        "\nMaximum Hate is a wonderful compilation of nine rare and new songs by German thrash metal icons Kreator that was released with an issue of the German Metal Hammer magazine one month before the band's new studio album Hate \u00fcber alles saw the light of day.\n\nThe first two songs are taken from the new studio album and represent the band's diversified soundscapes particularly well. ''Hate \u00fcber alles'' includes simple, heavy and fast riffs that take no prisoners and opens with a desperate scream that sets the tone for a pitiless anthem where the veterans sound hungrier than many promising newcomers and confirm to still be one of the greatest thrash metal bands around the globe. ''Strongest of the Strong'' however is a mid-tempo song with much more melodic guitar play that reminds slightly of the band's gothic sounds throughout the nineties without however sounding toothless, repetitive or bland. Both songs actually turn out to be among the new studio album's highlights.\n\nUp next come several rare songs such as obscure single material and bonus tracks. The shining highlight here remains ''Iron Destiny'', a Japanese bonus track from the Phantom Antichrist record, that is essentially a melodic heavy metal song with aggressive vocals and an anthemic chorus that will stay on your mind upon first listening to it. The lyrics about resistance, origins and identity represent the band spirit particularly well. Even though this is only a bonus track, this is one of my very favourite Kreator songs of all time, so give it a try if you haven't listened to it yet.\n\nThis compilation concludes with more rare material such as a demo song and two live tracks. The two live tracks confirm that the international quartet doesn't take any prisoners on stage and is able to sound even more energetic, ferocious and passionate in concert than it does on a studio album. The sound of these live recordings is unfiltered, raw and organic as it should certainly please genre purists in particular. Kreator might not be the most technically stunning genre band but they certainly are the most authentic, passionate and also political regarding its left-wing lyrics.\n\nAt the end of the day, Kreator's Maximum Hate offers nine songs with a running time of exactly thirty-seven minutes and includes excellent new studio versions, surprisingly convincing hidden gems in form of several recent bonus tracks and two live versions of recent tunes that have not yet been overplayed and still sound fresh. Any fan of the band should purchase this compilation either as a preparation or even as a complement for Hate \u00fcber alles. This release truly offers value for money in times when everything is getting more expensive.\n",
        "\nContinuing the recent trend of dropping an album every half-decade or so, Germany\u2019s thrash masterminds Kreator prove what proper amounts of time can do for a new record. 2017\u2019s Gods Of Violence wound up taking album of the year for me. While I may not go that far now, Millie and Co. have conjured up a solid follow-up to it with Hate \u00dcber Alles. It follows a similar path to what they\u2019ve been doing since 2001\u2019s Violent Revolution, yet twenty-one years later they\u2019ve still managed to keep it interesting.\n\nAdmittedly, this one didn\u2019t snatch me in as quickly as the prior two records did. But after a few listens, I was able to capture plenty of interesting ideas being offered. The previous record saw a bit more melody, and while Hate \u00dcber Alles doesn\u2019t dial that in as hard, it still remains a prominent factor. \u201cStrongest Of The Strong'' is absolutely loaded with traditional metal hooks with their Teutonic thrashy touch, and the same can be said about \u201cPride Comes Before The Fall'.\" The latter cakes on some beautiful singing amongst keys and melodies. \u201cMidnight Sun\u201d certainly focuses on that as well, featuring German new-wave vocalist Sofia Portanet on vocals, adding all sorts of atmosphere.\n\nBut there\u2019s a lot of ferocious energy to go around. The very next track \u201cDemonic Future\u201d kicks in with blitzing riffing and nasty drum kicks to contrast perfectly. Amongst this are slower songs that tune into a deeper feeling of dread, meant to match the common theme of destruction, hopelessness, and dystopia. \u201cDying Planet\u201d really lets us off on a different note, going out with the heaviest dose of atmosphere. This trick seems to be the biggest lateral move Kreator made to help themselves stand out within this disc. You\u2019ll also dig up plenty of doomy fossils within \u201cCrush The Tyrants\u201d.\n\nFor a band that has stayed relatively true to one style for two decades, I really appreciate how much they\u2019ve managed to make everything stand out. This is a discography that has been consistently good aside from a small hiccup in 1992 and into 1995, and this may see the most change since Endorama in 1999 (a criminally underrated record). Those looking for an entirely new invention of the wheel, you won\u2019t find that here. But I truly can\u2019t think of anything worth complaining about.\n\nOriginally written for Sleeping Village\n",
        "\nKreator really had an uphill battle to out due their classic sophomore release, \u201cPleasure To Kill\u201d, at the beginning of fall in nineteen eighty-seven with the release of \u201cTerrible Certainty\u201d. While I don\u2019t think this album hits the highs that \u201cPleasure To Kill\u201d set, it was the start of a new transitional phase for the band as it moved away from that unhinged thrash metal that was present on the first two records and moved into more \u201ctraditionally\u201d structured thrash with a focus of technical riffing and well thought out musical composition besides relying solely on major speed and chaotic energy. \u201cTerrible Certainty\u201d is less like a mad man driving haphazardly down a street and more like a pissed off fighter entering the ring with a calculated thought process. Along with \u201cEndless Pain\u201d and \u201cPleasure To Kill\u201d, \u201cTerrible Certainty\u201d was one of the three Kreator records I owned and frequented as a teen so this release does hold a special place in my memory, though that bias isn\u2019t going to taint my critical thoughts of the album. \n\n\u201cBlind Faith\u201d opens the album with a perfect sense of what the rest of this album is going to be like, punishing unrelenting riffs with a mixture of more complex song structures. The album features Kreator taking plenty of moments for the listener to have a breather, as there are plenty of sections within songs that have a slower section that goes for a more marching type rhythm. I personally think this is a great idea, though some may see this as formulaic, as it allows more variation to the songs and can help build up those savage main and secondary riffs and frantic solos. The sloppiness of their early days are also gone as the tight writing is complemented with tight playing from Mille, Tritze, Rob, and Ventor. \u201cToxic Trace\u201d is a great example of this as the song speeds through the main set of riffs and takes a quick sharp turn into that slower marching rhythmic pattern I\u2019ve mentioned before, matter of fact they start the song off with that guitar riff and bring it back in between the shredding assault that\u2019s present. The title track, \u201cTerrible Certainty\u201d, does this as well, utilizing that simple grooving march rhythm to set the mood before going into a rather technical flurry of riffs. I can see why both \u201cTerrible Certainty\u201d and \u201cToxic Trace\u201d have been mainstays in live set lists, both are absolute monsters and definitely some of my favorites from the band. \n\n\u201cTerrible Certainty\u201d is also surprisingly catchy, thanks to the diverse riffs and the focus of choruses that makes frantic metalheads scream along with them. A good portion of rhythms are much more melodic adding to the overall catchiness the album exhibits such as the main riff that starts at the fifteen second mark of \u201cNo Escape\u201d or the already mentioned title track for some examples. Of course most songs still have that frantic, riff-fest going on, such as \u201cStorming With Menace\u201d and \u201cOne Of Us\u201d that I haven\u2019t mentioned yet. But the cream of the crop so to speak is the final track of the album, \u201cBehind The Mirror\u201d. What makes \u201cBehind The Mirror\u201d so great is that soft eerie intro that layers the rhythms of the guitars, building up to the thrash assault on the senses. Personally I find this song to be the closest to anything off of \u201cPleasure To Kill\u201d than anything else in this record. \u201cBehind The Mirror '' should have really been a mainstay for the band, as I think it is such an underrated song from their discography. But if there\u2019s one song that may be the weakest link, it would probably be \u201cAs The World Burns\u201d. This is not a bad song by any means as I think it\u2019s really good but I find the song being more on the basic side of things. This is the only song Ventor is on vocals, compared to the half and half duties with Mille on the last two records. I\u2019ve always liked Ventor on vocals, he had this old school Venom-esque delivery but I would have preferred Mille singing here. The best way to describe listening to this song and then listening to the rest of the album is this; after you\u2019ve had plenty of five and four star meals, it\u2019s much more noticeable when you get a meal closer to a rating of a three star. \n\nAnother change from the past records is the lyrical matter showing a level of maturity as the band covers environmental themes, blind faith (wow, just like the name of the first song off the album!), and some personal human issues such as being addicted to one's inner urges and the failing of the mental health system to combat those urges (\u201cNo Escape\u201d). A few of these ideas and themes will be expanded upon with forthcoming releases, namely \u201cExtreme Aggression\u201d and \u201cComa Of Souls\u201d and while there\u2019s new elements and changes going on in this transitional period, one thing that hasn\u2019t changed is how strong the musicians are in the band. Ventor is still going ham on those drums while keeping the rhythm section moving nicely, he adds some nice technical rolls to add another level of intrigue to the music. Rob's bass playing is solid but if there\u2019s one downside to the writing, it\u2019s that the bass isn\u2019t much of a prominent player to the whole of the record. I\u2019ve read some negative comments about Tritze\u2019s lead skills behind the guitar and I don\u2019t see what\u2019s the problem at all as he is pretty energetic and wizzes by with sharp, technical riffing. Mille\u2019s rhythmic skills are still unmatched and while I don\u2019t think the combo of him and Tritze is the top of the top for the band, both complement each over really well. But vocally Mille has toned down some of that dark and screechy aggressiveness from before and while still pissed off and full vinegar, he begins to sing more like a \u201ctraditional '' thrash vocalist with a better focus on better pronunciations and melodies. \n\nWhile there\u2019s plenty of cool new things to be found here, the production is a little more of a mixed card. On one hand, the production is much clearer. On the other hand, the sound is lacking some dynamics, power if you will. It just sounds a little soft despite the clarity. Even with the muffleness, I think I prefer \u201cPleasure To Kill\u2019s\u201d production over this. It was just so raw and heavy and had this sinister evil sound and feel evoked throughout. But besides the production and maybe one weaker track, \u201cTerrible Certainty\u201d is an excellent release. It\u2019s interesting looking back at these thrash records and so many times the third record is either the game changing release or a transitional release where people usually rate them towards the top or end of the spectrum of bands\u2019 classic era and \u201cTerrible Certainty\u201d is no exception. While a better album than \u201cEndless Pain\u201d, \u201cTerrible Certainty\u201d ranks just behind the likes of \u201cExtreme Aggression\u201d, \u201cPleasure To Kill\u201d, and \u201cComa Of Souls\u201d not because it\u2019s a weak record, it\u2019s just that those albums are that good. Kreator\u2019s third release sits comfortably in the pantheon of the greats and if there\u2019s one thing I\u2019m\u2026. terribly certain about (baah- dum-tsshhhh)\u2026it\u2019s that this record deserves to be in any metalheads collection.\n",
        "\nIf you asked me about my thoughts regarding this album just a few months ago, you would have me use terms like \"humble beginnings\", \"rough start\", \"not quite there yet\" etc and I'd constantly mention the general fact that Kreator's next four albums are vastly superior to this one. Over time, however, this album had grown on me, and I came to appreciate it for what it is and what it (as it seems to me) attempts to accomplish.\n\nThose of you who had your minds blown by Pleasure to Kill and Coma of Souls will most likely be underwhelmed by this album. Endless Pain is much more amateurish and lightweight than those albums, both in terms of technicality and songwriting, and it sounds like Venom on steroids, as opposed to the proto death metal of Pleasure to Kill or the technical melothrash of Coma of Souls. The performances are not nearly as tight as on subsequent albums, with the band members often falling out of rhythm and having troubles keeping a steady tempo when playing below 180 BPM. And the lyrics are hilariously bad (though of the \"so bad it's good\" sort).\n\nHowever, my complaints about this album suddenly became praises when I changed my perspective. Lack of originality, repetitiveness, sloppy performances, cheesy lyrics, it all serves a stupidly simple, yet brilliant concept: this album sounds like it was made by absolute savages. Wild, illiterate and dirty cavemen wielding clubs and stones who just busted in a studio one day (and probably assaulted, murdered and raped a few people on their way there (of both genders)), beat the shit out of whatever band was playing in the studio at the time, recorded the whole thing in one take, drank all the booze they could find, took a piss on the wall, smashed all the bottles, instruments, recording equipment and furniture, all while the studio staff were just hiding in the bathroom and silently observing, all while being too frightened to do anything about the band's sudden interference. Many other bands have attempted to achieve this kind of atmosphere, but Kreator was the first to succeed. I simply don't get this vibe with Slayer's, Dark Angel's or Destruction's debuts. Hell Awaits is also brutal and vicious, but more in an esoteric, occult manner, as opposed to the straightforward bludgeoning of Endless Pain. Same goes for Seven Churches. Bonded by Blood, many would say, is also a landmark of pure savagery, but I always thought that it was too upbeat and restrained for the most part. Therefore, the verdict is clear: Endless Pain may not be the best, but it is the most brutal, relentless and devastating thrash metal album of 1985.\n\nThere are, however, some things in which Endless Pain outshines subsequent Kreator albums. The brutality for it's time is one such thing. Another one are Mille Petrozza's vocals. He never again sounded this vicious, frightening, demonic and outright pissed off. If it weren't for Quorthon, his would be THE first black metal vocals ever. But first or not, Mille's vocals are easily the best of that sort. Dead? Nocturno Culto? Please. Mille eats their wifes' hearts, rips their cunts and tastes the blood from their lips as they die. Not that any of those two are bad; it's just that Mille set the standard they could never surpass before they even started their careers. Ventor's primitive, punkish shout is also formidable and threatening, but Mille sounds like a demon who was trapped in the deepest pits of Hell for an eternity and was finally let loose to feast on the souls of whomever ends up in his sights. Unquestionably the best thrash metal vocalist ever.\n\nThe songs are very similar, with most of them being centered around the Black Metal (Venom) riff, Hit the Lights riff or the Trapped Under Ice/Impaler riff, although there are a few crushing midpaced segments, most notably on Storm of the Beast, Take Zeir- I mean Their Lives and Cry War. Nevertheless, some moments should be specifically mentioned. Okay, we all know Total Death has the same chorus as Strike of the Beast. What many don't notice is that the verse riff is the same as Dark Angel's Perish in Flames. Son of Fire has a menacing midpaced riff in the middle that would be reused on Under the Guillotine. Bonebreaker has very upbeat, punky verses and an evil as fuck chorus. Living in Fear's intro riff also appears on Slayer's Raining Blood, Pestilence's Commandments and Morbid Saint's Lock Up Your Children. Dying Victims sounds like broken Manilla Road for the first few seconds, but it soon grows into the most brutal song on this album. And finally, Awakening of the Gods manages to be epic without losing the primitive edge of the rest of the album.\n\nEndless Pain, note however, is not as idiotic as I may have made it seem. The songwriting is solid and there are numerous tempo changes, all of which are logical and coherent. It's just that this album is executed in a manner that makes it primitive and degraded. Although I still consider this the weakest of the first 5 Kreator albums, this album is an undeniable milestone in brutality and savagery. And that alone, despite its relative inferiority, makes Endless Pain an essential listening.\n",
        "\nFor such a flashy album title, there's suprisingly little actual hate inside.\n\nThis being the 15th album and this year being the 40th anniversary, Mille & Co. probably thought they'd go all out. Unfortunately, in 2022 their idea of going all out means female vocals (which are fine per se, just not all too fitting in that specific song) and sing-along choruses, which, to be frank, sound ridiculous. The rest of it is Kreator as we know them ever since \"Enemy of God\". And somehow this album loses not only to \"Enemy of God\", but to every single album since then, even to the direct predecessor \"Gods of Violence\". This album is so well-polished and so by-the-book Kreator that there's no room for growth, just room for sing-alongs. As it turns out, the 2020 single \"666 - World Divided\" was a sign of things to come, not just a slightly weird track (surprisingly enough, it somehow isn't featured on the album).\n\nFortunately, not all hope is lost. Mille's half-barks, half-shouts are still gruff and sorta believable, and some songs really do pack a punch, even though they're not outright aggressive anymore, the title track and \"Killer of Jesus\" in particular. \"Strongest of the Strong\" might be cheesy as hell, but the guitars on it are quite well done. Overall, none of the band members has lost their touch on the instruments: Ventor's drumming is at times outright cool, Sami's power metal escapades are well executed and still a nice addition to the trademark Kreator sound. In fact, they MAKE the trademark Kreator sound nowadays. And while Leclercq is no genius performer, his bass parts are solid, and they are audible, which always adds a nice touch to a metal album.\n\nUnfortunately, it sounds like the band somehow lost their energy in the last few years. Much as I'm fond of the tracks I mentioned, most of the others are just plain ineffectual. You do recognize them as Kreator songs, but they just go over your head. Yes, they're heavy, yes, they're pleasant to the ear, but you don't find yourself headbanging along. In fact, as catchy as \"Strongest of the Strong\" is, the only thing that makes it a Kreator song is Sami's quirks. Without them it might as well be a full-fledged power metal song, which also goes for the entire second half of the album (and Mille has the gall to shout \"Remember where you came from!\" at one point).\n\nThough truth be told, it's not all that bad. Uninspired as most of the songs may be, you can still listen to them and even enjoy them - the band has polished their skill during their 40 years of existence. The album is thankfully also short enough to not overstay its welcome and manages to grab your attention one last time with \"Dying Planet\", which evokes appropriate feelings of tension. And maybe, just maybe, I will discover some hidden sides to it after a few years and come to like it as a result (this happened with \"Hordes of Chaos\", which I initially dismissed, but ended up loving after all).\n",
        "\nIt's hard not to dive into superlative clich\u00e9s when talking about Teutonic powerhouse Kreator. Their impact on the European thrash scene of the 1980s and legacy left to subsequent generations is unparalleled in the old continent, placing them on a prominent spot in Heavy Metal\u2019s Olympus. Albums such as Pleasure to Kill, Extreme Aggression or Coma of Souls not only remain iconic references of the genre but also mirror the spirit of an era when Euro bands like Sodom, Destruction, Tankard or Coroner rivaled the mighty American armada that was taking the world by storm at the time. And although Petrozza & the boys have lost some steam since their experimental 1992 foray - Renewal, they kept moving forward, wandering into more adventurous (yet uninspired) territory over the nineties to later return to their roots, albeit with somewhat more melodic nuances. Be that as it may, the lads' perseverance has been paying off as most of their following are still on board, making Kreator one of today's most successful veteran thrash bands outside the Big Four.\n\nAs with all albums of the genre, particularly those by old-school acts, I waited for Kreator's fifteenth full-length with moderate expectations, as, with a few rare exceptions, these old dogs can no longer surprise me. It's all been done, redone, and tried out, so it all boils down to the entertainment value that each band or release can offer me; and when it comes to Kreator, the heavier the better. Mille Petrozza's musical and vocal peculiarities advise a focus on aggression, or at least that it be a paramount layer, even when surrounded by melody. Petrozza was never a gifted singer, so one must be careful not to take a step longer than the leg. A common mistake, when you fail to (or choose not to) acknowledge your own artistic limitations. In this sense, the title track and 'Killer of Jesus' are where the band shows its truest, most genuine colors, alongside the speed metal(ish) 'Demonic Future' that somehow reminds me of vintage European underground acts such as Mandator or Apocalypse. While it might seem a bit reductive, Hate \u00dcber Alles spreads its wings when it stays simple, closer to its straightforward thrash roots. The title track's imposing yet catchy chorus or 'Killer of Jesus'' ferocious verse are among the finest examples of a successful formula that should have been replicated more often. I certainly understand the aim to diversify and enrich the sound palette, it\u2019s a desirable aspiration, yet I don't think, for example, that 'Become Immortal's' Running Wild-esque approach or the gothic-ish 'Midnight Sun', despite their virtues, add quality to the whole. They do indeed diversify but provide no real value to Hate \u00dcber Alles, as do the uninspired choruses of 'Crush the Tyrants', 'Conquer and Destroy' or 'Dying Planet', which even exude some creative mediocrity. Polychromy isn't necessarily synonymous with artistic richness or multidimensionality. Nevertheless, despite its ups and downs, Hate \u00dcber Alles does not fail to entertain, if only for being what it is - an echo of times past that keeps us connected to one of the most iconic entities the genre has ever offered. The introductory homage to Sergio Corbucci is also worth mentioning since it lends an unexpected but pleasant cinematic tone to the album's overture while adding an extra European flavor to the mix. And some geographical context, when genuine, enhances any artistic expression.\n\nAt this point, we have to ask ourselves what to expect from Mille, Ventor & Co. Some kind of Extreme Aggression or Coma of Souls 2.0? And if that were to happen, would it be truly authentic? Expectations surrounding historic bands are almost always a double-edged sword; while on the one hand we yearn to capture a bygone era, on the other, we seek a degree of freshness that might lend relevance and entertainment value to the music. Hate \u00dcber Alles lies somewhere in the middle, swinging between good, average, and even mediocre territory, failing to fully embody either its title or vicious artwork. Because sometimes, violence is the (only) answer or at least stands as the most fitting output for some legendary Teutonic squads.\n\nOriginally written for www.sputnikmusic.com\n",
        "\nAlternative titles: Kreator Is Dead; Weakest of the Weak\n\nThis is just sad. Kreator used to be one of my all-time favorite bands. They could outthrash any of the legendary thrash bands in their prime. Their first five albums are absolutely essential, with Pleasure to Kill and Coma of Souls being among the highest peaks in all of thrash, if not all of metal. This album, on the other hand, is a complete opposite of what I just mentioned. I get it: times change, bands get old, yadda yadda yadda, but that's no excuse to write vapid and artificial trash such as Hate \u00fcber alles.\n\nSo, what's wrong with this album, you ask? Exactly what has been wrong with Kreator's output for the last two decades: generic and uninspired riffage; recycling and plagiarism that even Kai Hansen would be ashamed of; Mille's past-the-prime grating bark; absurdly lifeless and sterile overproduction; big dumb choruses with worthless singalongs and other power metal elements that the band just can't get right (get Persuader's Evolution Purgatory if you want an awesome blend of EUPM and raging thrash), it's all there. Kreator did not change at all since Enemy of God.\n\nThis album is a lot like Arch Enemy, Dark Tranquility, At the Gates and such bands. Sure, they're playing fast, there's a lot of screaming, the riffs are vaguely technical etc etc etc, but there's no intensity or conviction whatsoever. It's all polished to the crisp and robbed of the grit and roughness that thrash inherently needs. Some thrash albums like Tempo of the Damned at its best moments can outshine the overproduction with their amazing riffage and powerful songwriting, but rest assured, Hate \u00fcber alles is not one of those. Now, this IS better than any of the aforementioned Gothenburg bands, but saying that as if it's some sort of a compliment is an utter insult to this once legendary band. I haven't listened to any Kreator album between Violent Revolution and Gods of Violence in at least a year and a half and I can already name several examples of blatant recycling. Compare the title track to All of the Same Blood, Killer of Jesus to Phantom Antichrist, Midnight Sun to Impossible Brutality or Demonic Future and Pride Comes Before the Fall to System Decay. And that's without mentioning plagiarism from other bands. I'm pretty sure there are other examples that I failed to notice, but that's up to you to figure out.\n\nAnother thing that pisses me off are the random, nonsensical ideas, like the chantings at 3:05 of Conquer and Destroy, 3:02 of Pride Comes Before the Fall or 5:06 of Dying Planet. Or that fucking lullaby intro to Pride Comes Before the Fall. What the fuck? They fall completely flat, and simply sound like In Flames or Dark Tranquility when they get all \"creative\".\n\nCrush the Tyrants is a total Manowar/Sabaton styled plodfest that makes Servant in Heaven - King in Hell sound like Hall of the Mountain King, and Strongest of the Strong belongs on Whoracle more than on any Kreator album (seriously, that main lick sounds suspiciously similar to Jotun). Become Immortal is just a rewritten Phantom of the Opera, which is not necessarily a bad thing (Omen had done that multiple times on their first three albums and they still rule), but this is completely sappy and utter tripe. Midnight Sun falls for the \"gratuitous female vocals\" pitfall, and even those suck. They're overeffected and completely indecipherable. Dying Planet is the only song that shows potential in any notable amount, as it sounds quite eerie and apocalyptic. Unfortunately, even that song does little more than plod along and just makes me want to listen to Cirith Ungol's Doomed Planet. The rest is not even worthy of mentioning. Completely uninspired and forgettable.\n\nNow, there are some promising moments like 1:39 of the title track, and the soloing in general is pretty good on this album. And although I complained about the lameness of the singalongs, Midnight Sun has an amazing chorus that could easily fit on a Persuader album. Unfortunately, Kreator simply does not excel at this kind of thing, and singalongs in general not fit at all with Kreator's brand of destructive thrash. Try to find a single singalong on the first five albums and you'll see what I mean (Total Death and Material World Paranoia come close, but are not nearly as \"raise your fists, la la la\" as anything on this album). And unlike some people that dislike 21st century Kreator, I don't mind the fact that these albums are melodic (Coma of Souls is also pretty melodic, and we all agree its awesome), nor do I think they are necessarily \"Gothenburg faggotry\" (songs like Replicas of Life or Civilization Collapse sound to me more like Symbolic-era Death songs than anything from the Gothenburg scene), although there are times where that description fits. The real, main problem is that these melodies are pretty bland and sappy, and most importantly, they fail to create the vicious (and crippling) atmosphere that defines Kreator. Just listen to intros to People of the Lie or Terror Zone and compare them to the intro of Conquer and Destroy, and you'll see what I mean.\n\nAlas, a few great moments here and there a great album do not make. At least back in the early 2000's, they could pull off a solid thrasher like Reconquering the Throne or Enemy of God, or a solid epic number like Replicas of Life or Voices of the Dead. This has nothing like that. These songs are nothing more than a fodder so the band can keep touring. This album might as well have been written by an AI. For all I know, it quite possibly is.\n\nAs much as it pains me to say it, Kreator should just call it quits. They don't have nearly enough of fresh ideas to keep writing album after an album. I really wish it were otherwise because there are some small amounts of potential here, but it's all being wasted and buried in the sea of vapidity and mediocrity. This is almost Sabaton-tier in its creative bankruptcy. Nice soloing and the chorus of Midnight Sun aside, I cannot find anything praiseworthy on this album. Even the decent riffs are done to death both by Kreator and numerous other bands. Kreator is dead. They have been dead for 20 years, if not even more, and what we see here is just their lifeless husk. They keep going only because nobody invited them to their funeral.\n\nEdit: THIS THING IS PRODUCED BY ARTHUR RIZK?! ARE YOU KIDDING ME? Rizk has a knack for creating a sound that flawlessly blends the retro and the modern, so I have no idea what the fuck happened here. This album, despite his involvement, has exactly the same modern sterile production values of the previous four Kreator albums. Wow. I'm speechless. If he couldn't save the band, then Kreator truly is a living (but not ripping) corpse.\n",
        "\nKreator \u2013 maybe one or two of you may be already familiar with this name? Well, if not, that\u2019s no problem. Their name is unfortunately much bigger than the music they offer today. Of course, \u201cHate \u00fcber alles\u201d will receive a lot of fanboy and Mother Theresa reviews and naturally some of you really like the album whole-heartedly. That\u2019s okay, why not? But for me, the ridiculously titled \u201cHate \u00fcber alles\u201d is a pretty ambivalent album.\n\nYes, I said ridiculous. \u201cHate \u00fcber alles\u201d does not focus on aggression and hate. It\u2019s an album that wants to walk the fine line between a certain dose of thrash and commercial considerations. Already this calculating approach does not fit the explosiveness of thrash. Apart from this, the material holds some truly embarrassing elements. \u201cBecome Immortal\u201d is a lame and powerless song with squeaky guitars, but it would be at least acceptable without its terrible \u201cohoho\u201d sing-along section. And why does Mille sing \u201cremember where you came from\u201d on an album that has absolutely nothing in common with the early works of the band? Cynical parody? \n\nBut of course, nobody, not even me, expected a full-length that focuses on courage instead of commerce. At the end of the day, I accept the general approach of Kreator. They want to be in thrash what Maiden is in heavy metal and Scorpions are in hard rock \u2013 the absolute consensus band. Kreator want to be loved, no matter the cost. But does this excuse terribly soft vocal lines like those in \u201cConquer and Destroy\u201d? Not to mention the inadequate female vocals in \u201cMidnight Sun\u201d. These kitschy duets make me puke since Theatre of Tragedy\u2019s \u201cSchattentanz\u201d, although here the lady sings in a more robotic than romantic way. The calm intro as well as a soft intermezzo of \u201cPride Before the Fall\u201d also want to ride the song in the shit, but at the end it reaches a solid level.\n\nAll these soft building blocks must of course be compensated. \u201cKiller of Jesus\u201d, wow, what a provocative title! This is t.h.r.a.s.h. 2022, isn\u2019t it? Well, maybe it is, but there shimmers a little lie through every tone of the album. Either you have integrity or not and it seems to me that Kreator once indulged their passion and now they do their job. I admit they do it with expertise and their technical skills are beyond doubt, but \u201cHate \u00fcber alles\u201d is a pretty lame result, if you use thrash standards. The level of energy is low and the same applies for the degree of dynamic. Nevertheless, a small number of good songs has crept in. To begin at the end: \u201cDying Planet\u201d is a sinister, heavy closer, far away from being a typical filler whose only function is to close the output. The mid-harsh \u201cStrongest of the strong\u201d holds the strongest guitar work on a not very strong album. No wonder this track was put on the net as an advance track. \u201cKiller of Jesus\u201d is partly pretty intensive and okay, \u201cHate \u00fcber alles\u201d marks a stormy and violent opener, but (and this is a big but) it does not represent the album. It screams: listen, people, we are so goddamn brutal! The infantile artwork wants to tell the same story. But this work is anything else but brutal.\n\nIt goes without saying that the production is more or less perfect. Hooray! It avoids sterility and that\u2019s no matter of course when it comes to big players like Kreator with a great budget. I also do not deny that \u201cHate \u00fcber alles\u201d leaves a better impression than its formulaic predecessor. Some good sections shape an acceptable full-length, no more, no less. Is this the standard that Kreator set for themselves? Either way, all of you who like the album: have a good time with it, it\u2019s metal and therefore it is okay. I will listen to something else.\n",
        "\nWhat a solid follow-up from 'Gods of Violence'. That one just grew on me. But this one is solid in every way! Mille sounds great on vocals. And the riffs are sick. Fresh and well thought out! The overall quality is not only the music but the sound quality as well! Kreator's career stretches over 40 years and long-time members (Mille & Ventor) are still hacking it. As long as Mille stays on rhythm, cannot go wrong! Sami does a good job in the lead department but not as good as Frank Blackfire (the old lead shredder). This one has a mountain of aggression and technical thrash riffs. They just simply tore it apart here.\n\nI don't necessarily like the lyrics though I never did like their concepts. But the music and overall sound kicked ass. Wish I could see them once again but I'm not sure if that's going to happen. A friend said they're Saxon sounding on this one, though I've never really explored that band. I've just been into Kreator since the late 80's. I'm one that's always hell stuck on 'Coma of Souls'. But they have a lot of good albums to explore such as 'Phantom Antichrist', 'Enemy of God' and 'Violent Revolution' (not in order by release date). Their previous had some good songs as well though overall this one is the key solid release!\n\nI think the compositions themselves are what makes this one so admirable. They really do have it here! They're in their 50's and like fellow thrashers Destruction are still putting out good quality music. There was a brief time when Kreator took a dive with 'Renewal'. I thought that that was the last of them after I heard that one. I was wrong and since they've been thrash which is their roots! I think they've hit a wide array of fans once again showing that they will not compromise! The riffs on here were the highlights the melodies and rhythms simply kicked major ass from all aspects!\n\nWell, I cheated and downloaded the album in skepticism after hearing a few music videos then I heard the whole album! So I made sure to get this on CD! I'm glad I got their physical copy and am no longer skeptical of this one. The music is really strong here. Maybe because they took around 5 years of getting it put together after 'Gods of Violence'. This one is way tighter and more melodic in my humble opinion. Kreator is as strong as ever and this album just shows us that. I know there will never be another 'Coma of Souls', but this one is pretty close! Long live Kreator!\n",
        "\nThe USA may have been the birthplace of thrash metal, but when it comes to its most extreme adherents, said nation has some utterly forbidding competition on the German front. Whereas the original Big 4 presents something of a balanced equation of extreme, progressive, comedic and mainline expressions of the style, their Teutonic equivalent presents a lopsided scale of unapologetic carnage that could be likened to 3 Slayers and a Metallica/Anthrax hybrid in the group\u2019s lone outlier Tankard. Though the jury has been out for nearly 40 years as to whether Sodom or Kreator presents the most intense expression of pure sonic rage, there is a pretty strong case to be made that the latter has been the more willing of the two to incorporate some modern influences to further augment their craft. Indeed, with Kreator\u2019s latest studio effort aptly dubbed Hate Uber Alles, this quartet of part-time horror show purveyors, part-time political commentators have molded arguably their most balanced package of vintage mayhem and modern ferocity yet.\n\nFor those who have rode the train of human horror and social commentary that has been this outfit\u2019s stock and trade for the past couple decades, not much has changed in the personnel front since the early 2000s. The notable exception being the inclusion of former Dragonforce bassist Frederic Leclercq to the fold in the time since Kreator\u2019s last manifesto of rage Gods Of Violence. His contributions when combined with the exemplary post-production work this time around definitely result in a darker and heavier presentation, though most of the standout performances have been put forth by those who have served under the flag of hate for a longer tour. The kit work of long time drummer Jurgen \u201cVentor\u201d Reil proves about as thunderous as it does versatile, as much of the material found on here explores a more nuanced, mid-paced crevice in the thrash paradigm to go along with the unrelenting flurry of chaotic fills and machine gun double kick work. Likewise, the twin guitar assault of Mille Petrozza and Sami Yli-Sirnio recalls both the dissonant harmonies and blurring speed of classic Slayer, but also taps into some of the more consonant themes occasionally heard out of more progressive adherents to the old Bay Area sound and even parts of the 90s Gothenburg melodeath style.\n\nBut when all is said and done, the chief selling point of this album is the brilliant showcase of versatile songwriting that matches the extreme aggression with a more epic and elaborate take on the thrash game. The opening prelude \u201cSergio Corbucci Is Dead\u201d almost sounds akin to the sort of stereotypical Spaghetti Western soundtrack material associated with the film maker in question and superimposed on what sounds like a military funeral march. In like fashion, much of the pounding metallic anthems that follow reflect this sort of clashing of different worlds, with heavy-ended crushers like \u201cConquer And Destroy\u201d and \u201cCrush The Tyrants\u201d incorporating a blend of power and old school heavy metal elements to augment the obligatory brutality. Likewise, even when things go off into full speed as on \u201cKiller Of Jesus\u201d there is still a lingering sense of consonant, old school metal charm at play in the riffing approach. Even when things go into full on Slayer mode and the descending harmonies reminiscent of \u201cRaining Blood\u201d hit the speakers on the titan of a title anthem \u201cHate Uber Alles\u201d and \u201cDemonic Future\u201d, there is an enduring sense of modern precision and technical flair that lends almost as much to a sort of Arch Enemy meets modern Exodus take on things.\n\nIn this time where the younger generation seems hell bent on dismissing the wisdom of the elder guard, regardless of what subject the conversation may fall, there is something to be said for a band that is still killing it in a manner that most bands in their 20s can\u2019t match while well into their 50s. Indeed, one of the hallmarks of this album\u2019s charm is how Mille Petrozza\u2019s vocal work has gone from a monolithic extreme growl during their mid-80s beginnings to a highly versatile blend of cleaner and even rawer vocalizations that could embody multiple subsets of metal within a single song. The haunting gang chorus that close out the mid-paced melodic beast \u201cBecome Immortal\u201d and the atmospheric low chants that kick off the blistering berserker anthem \u201cPride Comes Before The Fall\u201d seemingly come out of nowhere in the context of Kreator\u2019s ongoing stylistic evolution, yet fit in seamlessly with the plethora of fresh new takes that this entire album has to offer. It might not outclass the zenith points that exists in this band\u2019s extensive history, be it undisputed triumphs like Pleasure To Kill, Coma Of Souls and their riveting millennial return to form Violent Revolution, but it gets as close as they\u2019ve ever gotten in the past two decades.\n\nOriginally written for Sonic Perspectives (www.sonicperspectives.com)\n",
        "\nThe 15th studio album by Kreator has the most matching title one can unfortunately imagine for the year 2022. Hate \u00dcber Alles is quite provocative but gets all the shit happening these days to the point. On the other hand a homage to Dead Kennedys (and everybody who is wondering about such a \"patriotic\" title got something wrong with Kreator). So it is no surprise that the whole album deals with hate, war, brutalization and environmental destruction. Megadeth once sang \"The Threat Is Real\" - yes, it is but the threat is not drowning refugees in the Mediterranean Sea but us: everybody on this planet who takes part in the destruction of society and the environment through his / her behavior.\n\nThe guys around Mille make a clear statement about this issue in 'Dying Planet', the last track on Hate \u00dcber Alles and one of the tracks you have to get used to. It's a slow and creeping track about which Sami Yli-Sirni\u00f6 told me that it could be their Celtic Frost track. So it is pretty obvious that you can find a lot of Swiss tunes in it. On the album are some more tracks that are not the old-school Kreator stuff so that Hate \u00dcber Alles became a more challenging album than the ones after Endorama. But before you stop reading now because of reading Endorama - I can assure you that you won't be disappointed. Kreator built in some more classical heavy metal riffing like in 'Conquer And Destroy' (Iron Maiden and Blind Guardian anyone??? ) or 'Become Immortal' with a lot of NWoBHM-flair, a slight kitschy \"ohoho\"-chorus and a really fantastic bridge part (and some autobiographical lyrics by Mille) and some quite dystopian tunes on 'Midnight Sun' combined with some female vocals from the German (pop music) newcomer Sofia Portanet whose album \"Freier Geist\" was Milles favorite album in 2020.\n\nBut of course there are a lot of quite typical Kreator tracks on Hate \u00dcber Alles like 'Demonic Future' with a lot of tempo changes and the typical drumming by Ventor. The title track which could have also been on Enemy Of God or Hordes Of Chaos, the more brutal albums from the younger past or 'Killer Of Jesus'. Another provocative title and the track starts with a short black metal-like intro. This one is a brutal and melodic song that really kicks ass.\n\nThe production is absolutely flawless. This time the guys didn't engage Jens Bogren but a quite unknown American producer called Arthur Rizk (who was recommended to them by Michael Amott) and I guess they made no mistake with that.\n\nSo, what's the conclusion? It takes some listening sessions to fully open up Hate \u00dcber Alles because they changed some things in their composing approach and don't repeat themselves (what they never did). The songs have a lot of melodic guitar work but nevertheless the album sounds pretty uncompromising. Of course it is no \"Pleasure To Kill Part 2\" but everybody who knows Kreator will not expect such a thing in the last 30 years.\n\nRating: 9 out of 10 Hate songs\n\nOriginally written for metalbite.com\n",
        "\nAfter succumbing to 20 or so years of mediocre experiments with gothic elements and some more thrashy but still far too contrived material, Kreator's last effort \"Gods of Violence\" showed a step in the right direction. While lacking in the band's legendary efficiency in their early days, that album was strong enough to symbolise somewhat of a comeback for Kreator. Hate Uber Alles takes this and develops it further, echoing back to the glory days of Extreme Aggression and Coma of Souls but still with an emphasis of a more modern touch. Straight away, the brilliant acoustic progression in the intro explodes into some quality, ripping thrash metal that dips its toes slightly into the melody that caused Kreator's stagnancy in the first place, but instead this time it's executed with overwhelming aggression and shows off a passionate and energetic performance from every member, right as the opening riff to the title track kicks off. \n\nThis song is representative of the entire record; frantic verses with raging speed and a brilliant chorus that reminds me of Satan Is Real, and captures the band's newfound commercial sound but it matches the intensity down to a science. Ventor in particular boasts one of his most vigorous performances in the better side of 3 decades, with relentless patterns and a great adaptation to the more harmonic guitars. You could make the argument that this album suffers from Kreator's melothrash tendencies which is a huge misstep, but the songwriting here is just too proficient to dismiss as mediocre or even good. A hugely consistent tracklist showcases an exhilarating use of melody as an overtone to the more thrashy sound of the riffs.\n\nSome sections that take the band out of their comfort zone improve the album, adding some interesting ideas like the tribal intro to Crush The Tyrants. The songs do become a bit predictable with the foundations of the songs being based on the choruses, but these choruses all feature some incredible utilisation of a processed, satisfying and crystal clear guitar tone. Extending from this are the solos, which are purely mesmerising, and show virtuosity that never was really present in Kreator's music prior to Hate Uber Alles. One of my personal favourite tracks is Strongest of The Strong, with its driving atmosphere and amazing melodic articulation in the verses. \n\nFalling only a hair behind Kreator's run of the 5 classic albums, this record is a supreme return to form with an ultra-layered production that sounds organic and massive, if only lacking in pure aggression in some certain areas. The runtime is filled with mind-blowing melodic passages and even some influences of groove metal, with the Lamb of God-esque Demonic Future. The result is an inspired, eloquent album with many memorable moments.\n",
        "\nI\u2019ll be honest, I overrated the last Kreator album. Gods of Violence was patchy and frequently tried to do the right thing instead of the most natural thing for the band. I have no qualms about the German thrash legends adding a touch of melody to their formula over the last decade or so, nor that a bit of that seems to come from melodeath, but all the same the quartet know what they are good at, and so do their fans. Hate \u00fcber alles strikes me as a smart step for old stages Mille Petrozza and Ventor, comparative newcomer Sami Yli-Sirni\u00f6, plus Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Leclercq, who really is a newcomer, joining on bass in 2019. Aggression rises above variety on a relatively trim 46 minute set of 10 songs, as well as the title track\u2019s intro\u2026\n\n\u2026which builds into a raging number that does Kreator proud. Really, it should be easy for these guys to write their popular songs, because they rely on a couple of tricks, namely stabbing changes of pace into thunderous fast verses, stabbing changes of pace into Petrozza\u2019s savage shouts, and stabbing changes of pace into flashing solos. Yeah, the faster songs only need the one feature to be effective as long as the band plays tight enough. \u2018Hate \u00fcber alles\u2019 is instant gold. The following \u2018Killer of Jesus\u2019 proves the formula can work back to back, although it highlights a disappointing tendency to slow down for the chorus and just repeat the title, which holds back quite a few tracks at such moments. Variety from Kreator these days is a must, so the slower and less dense likes of \u2018Strongest of the Strong\u2019, \u2018Dying Planet\u2019, and \u2018Crush the Tyrants\u2019 make use of floated melodies and stomping rhythms to redirect power in a more emotional direction, rather than through those primitive neck muscles.\n\nAs with the last few albums from Kreator, an experiment or two is allowed in too, plus a longer number that features some epic bits and bobs. The former this time around sounds like Cradle Of Filth (no, really) on their recent 3 albums, coupling furious semi-extreme riffing with female vocals, and what\u2019s more it might even be about vampires! Scandalous. Personally I love \u2018Midnight Sun\u2019, all the more so because it sees Ventor stepping outside thrash patterns on the drums and the skewed pace squeezing the song shorter, which these guys need to do more often. \u2018Dying Planet\u2019 is the lengthy one, and in fact the only song above 5 minutes, though the elongated vocal lines and darker melodies have a corollary in \u2018Become Immortal\u2019, which employs choral vocals later on to increase the scope of the experience, \u2018Conquer and Destroy\u2019 doing something similar too as a bridge during a more straightforward thrasher. None of these ideas elevate to genius levels, but the common sense approach to album structure and production pay dividends, firstly by sequencing faster songs first, breathing for some anthemic cuts, and then bringing back the fury in the lower half of the track list. I hardly need to say that everything sounds fucking massive.\n\nThese days, I find it hard to put my finger on a modern-sounding thrash release and say that it\u2019s truly awesome, yet much of Hate \u00fcber alles encourages me to do just that, funnily enough with the exception of the rather jolly \u2018Strongest of the Strong\u2019 and those lazy choruses. Like Gods of Violence before it, the newest Kreator album feels extremely clinical and benefits in that regard by being a big Nuclear Blast release, though the realization that it\u2019s clinical and still really enjoyable comes back every time I press play. Not to mention, I\u2019m tempted to press play more often than almost any other Kreator album at the moment.\n",
        "\nThere are some albums that you form such an intimate immediate connection with, you savour them for the rest of your life. Or for a very long time at least. Then there are some that grow on you with every passing listen; you may dislike or hate them initially, but give them time and everything starts falling in place. Kreator's Pleasure to Kill is neither of those albums. Despite its celebrated status, I think it's painfully brutal, stupidly aggressive and has ideas that are scattered all over the place. At 38 minutes, it's not very long, but 10 minutes in and you wish it'd just stop; I reckon it'd have made a decent album if it was shorter by about 30 minutes. The more it flows, the more its weaknesses become apparent. \n\nNot a popular opinion here but I've never really bought early teutonic thrash - most of it sounds overblown and pretentious and the bands often in their pursuit of chasing mindless aggression miss out on nuances in their music. Kreator may be a dominant force in the thrash metal scene and their sound has definitely refined and evolved over the years but I think the early few years were rough; their finest hour wouldn\u2019t come until Coma of Souls and then on it's pretty consistent accessible thrash. I definitely prefer the later more accessible (more mainstream?) Kreator to the early more directionless one.\n\nAbout the album, it starts off with a mildly interesting instrumental piece which is about the only melodic bit in the entire album and also the only time you are allowed to relax. It's too short to really leave an impression and certainly does not set the tone for things to come. The following song Ripping Corpse though, does. I wouldn\u2019t lie, it has a pretty exciting start, but things become really jarring really soon. There's plenty of ideas here but everything starts falling apart courtesy of crazy-fast thrash metal riffs, awkward time signatures, terrible vocals and, again, crazy-fast but totally out of sync drumming. This becomes a pattern on almost every song that follows - they all start sounding samey, repetitive and unmemorable very soon.\n\nWhile it does get jarring, there are interesting sections too. For example, the middle-section of the title track becomes really catchy when they dial down the pace a notch or two, and I think you will enjoy this album in bits when it resorts to a more medium pace, again evident in the album closer Under the Guillotine. And it's not completely without its moments: Riot of Violence is an absolute riot of a song and also one of Kreator's best. It has by far the best song structure here and also the best guitar solos, but that's not saying much considering how poor, chaotic and unmemorable they are on other songs.\n\nSo where the guitar work is passable and you enjoy sections of it, the drumming is absolutely horrendous. I think Ventor is a pretty good drummer who has proven his chops on subsequent Kreator albums, but here sadly, half the time I don't like a song, it is because of him. Why? Because instead of playing interesting drum patterns that should complement other instruments, guitars notably, he makes it his life goal to only relentlessly pound on the drums for as fast and as random as he can. This does such a fantastic job of making the drums feel so disconnected from whatever else is happening, you wonder if the band even recorded this album together. Take for example The Pestilence on which this problem is the most apparent - it's a good song with an interesting structure but gets absolutely marred by shitty drums.\n\nWhat's also bad is Mille Petrozza's singing. While I've never liked his style personally, he did get better with time, hitting his stride on Coma of Souls. On this album though, he sounds very amateur. And one-dimensional. And because the vocals sound half clean and half growls, they are not very pleasant to listen to. To compound our misery, Ventor, who should never be holding a microphone for the love of mankind, also performs vocal duties on a few songs and makes them even worse. Grrrr...\n\nThese are, I think, the major problems with this album. You can always nitpick and point out other aspects like why are the lyrics so naff or why is the production not good enough - you cannot hear a lot of bass and the drums can sometimes drown out other instruments. But these are smaller problems and not outright deal-breakers, even if they do add to worsen a package that's already bad. All these years, I have tried very hard to get into this album but turns out, it's not my kind of thrash metal. I understand the vision behind it and that it's supposed to be fast and aggressive, but I also cannot enjoy something that sounds so disorganised and pretentious; nothing seems cohesive or in sync and the switch from one song to another is never seamless. \n\nTo give it its due, because let's not completely shit on it, it does have its moments though they don't save the album overall. I completely get the appeal and why so many would swear by it, but I also get why a certain few of us, however less we may be, will always struggle to like it. Its constant comparisons with Slayer's Reign in Blood are understandable, too. But where the latter makes you swear expletives every other moment because it's awesome and makes you want to jump off your chair and headbang until your neck breaks, Pleasure to Kill does so because it's pretty bad and you are constantly annoyed and those frowns on your forehead never leave you.\n\nSo Pleasure to Kill, not so much a pleasure to listen to.\n",
        "\nThe album that's previous to my favorite which undeniably is 'Coma Of Souls', this one packs a punch as well. The lyrical concepts are just starting to advance with the band and the aggression in the music has illuminated. The real talent comes out in this one. The guitars were quite technical and voracious. Mille's vocals is just getting their own sound that he hasn't really abdicated his whole musical career in thrash metal. Just if the lyrics were as good as the music this would get a higher rating. But that's not the case here. Subsequently they get a low \"A.\" Fans this is no disappointment.\n\nIt's hard to believe this is about 33 years old. And the band is still going strong. It's say Mille's songwriting is what keeps me keyed into the band and their down-to-earth mentality in interviews. I've been a long-time Kreator fan. Some albums rotted though but not on here. My first listen to this album I was under the impression that it's tops with me. It was a good segue into 'Come Of Souls'. So yeah, the music leaves a scar in the memory never gets a healing since their aggression holds them true. I'm glad that they've stayed a band this whole almost 40 year career. They will always be a tops with me ABSOLUTELY.\n\nThe production quality was much better than their previous releases. The guitar riffs are what hit home with me and the vocals. And the fact that the sound quality is top notch. Mille could've done a better job on the lyrics, but they're still forming as a band or as Mick Harris would say \"we're all chuffed in repulsion.\" Being from Germany and a lot of the philosophical influences they've not explored so much yet but I think with later releases they're more spiritual than anything else. As on 'Gods of Violence' the song \"Satan is Real\" is a good idea of Mille in that mindset that he's identified this and it's true the hell on Earth that there is!\n\nThis album is about 40 minutes too short, I wished it would've clocked in longer, but I'm glad to have enjoyed it nevertheless. The music, sound quality, guitars, vocals, drums and aura is all-encompassing. I think that this is one of their best releases in their entire discography. Of course over the years they've evolved but even early on they still showed groundbreaking talent. These guys know how to play quality thrash metal! I do wish Frank Blackfire would've stayed with the band throughout their career to date it's just Mille and Ventor being longtime members. Get a hold of this album!\n",
        "\nNot to be confused with the Under the Guillotine vinyl box-set, which allowed rabid thrashers everywhere to get these oldies on their hallowed plastic format of choice, this is instead a new 2CD compilation put out through the Germans' alma mater Noise Records, and is largely comprised of remixes, rarities, and some reprinted tunes from stuff you might not be able to find like the Out of the Dark EP...initially I viewed this as kind of a grift, preying on the usual nostalgia, but it seems that at least some effort was placed into getting a bunch of odds and ends in one place for fans who might not have even been around to get them in the first place. That's not to say there is much value for me personally in this collection, it's mostly useless, but I've certainly come across far worse efforts.\n\nHaving said that, there comes with this a bit of inconsistency in terms of pure content, because you'll be getting rare versions of particular tunes, or remixes of others, but not for the entire albums, so it still comes across like a grab bag. For pure listening, it's not unlike pressing 'shuffle' on the Kreator discography you might have uploaded to your iPhone. Although tracks like \"Terror Zone\" and \"Terrible Certainty\" are remixed, the production alone doesn't help them meld in quite so fluidly with \"Flag of Hate\" or \"Extreme Aggression\", and the end result is that it wouldn't be so different than just a pure compilation of stuff jerked off various recordings, since that's what is basically is, only a mix of the original records and then the remasters this company did once they became active again. On the second disc you get more live cuts, and some of these like \"When the Sun Burns Red\" or \"Riot of Violence\" sound pretty awesome. There's an early demo version of \"Bonebreaker\" which sounds a bit shit, but at the same it totally captures the violence of the band's style that they'd later impress upon the superior sounding Endless Hate.\n\nIf you're new to Kreator and can find this around in a bargain bin for a couple bucks, it's probably worth the effort because let's face it, all the songs here are pretty awesome, yes even the stuff from the sadly underrated Renewal. But for full price, avoid it and just start picking up the first 5-6 full length albums, or even most of their newer records, because this is a band that has been tremendous for much of its career (Cause for Conflict and Endorama aside). If you're a hardcore follower, then you likely have all of this material and probably even the re-releases with the remasters, so this then downgrades to utter dogshit, make your own compilation and enjoy. But if nothing else, Under the Guillotine tries to provide a cross-section of quality material showing the band's strength through all its time on the label.\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nKreator was one of the bands who started the \u2018thrash attack\u2019 in Germany in 1980s, together with Sodom, Destruction, Living Death, Holy Moses and other less known outfits. Throughout the years, these bands have either undergone certain changes, both in line-ups and in musical style or...split up. Needless to say, those who have managed to survive, had to explore territories unthinkable for thrash maniacs 30-20 years ago. For Kreator, this search for new inspirations began in 1992 with the release of Renewal and before returning to playing 100% thrash they even flirted with gothic and industrial metal. 2001 marked the release of their first true thrash album (Violent Revolution) since the highly acclaimed 1990\u2019s Coma Of Souls, but the fans had to wait another 4 years to be fully blown away by the record which shall mark the truly powerful comeback for Kreator as masters of thrash. \n\nEnemy of God starts with its arguably best song, the title track. Aggressive throughout, both musically and lyrically, with excellent riffs which are first and foremost violent, but at the same time melodic, thus forming a song which doesn\u2019t get out of your head easily once you play it a few times. It also incorporates a typical Kreator trick, which effectively raises blood pressure of the listener: before the chorus Ventor\u2019s drums go silent and the guitars alone speed up the tempo, giving introduction to Mille who screams out the chorus on top of his lungs. Simple, but it works. That\u2019s what thrash is all about, ladies and gents! \u201eImpossible Brutality\u201d offers more...haunting melodies, still keeping the album on its brutal course. There\u2019s no time for rest, but one has to admire the excellent axemanship. Guitars are pushing this album forward, offering much more listening pleasure between the choruses than the 1980s standards did. Another track worth special attention is \u201eDystopia\u201d, probably the most melodic song on the album. It\u2019s also significantly slower than Enemy of God\u2018s average, which automatically makes it a song some will love for the epic atmosphere it creates, while some other will hate for being too soft. I\u2019m in the first group and I honestly don\u2019t care about those who would like each song on the album to sound exactly the same. Go to a record store and dig up some Finnish power metal \u2018jewels\u2019, goddammit! After a brief (and only partial) rest we are introduced to two possibly catchiest songs on the record \u2013 \u201eVoices of the Dead\u201d and \u201eMurder Fantasies\u201d. With different vocals, they could easily be found on an album by some melodic death metal band from Sweden. Take Michael Amott\u2019s solo on the latter song as further evidence ;) \n\nThe album is tight throughout and even the songs not mentioned by me in this review can defend themselves alone, although I believe I have covered all of the album\u2019s highlights. What about the weaknesses, you might ask? Shit, I wish I could elaborate on them, but there aren\u2019t any. Of course, some old school Kreator fans simply reject this album, claiming it isn\u2019t as violent and extreme as the 80s records (Pleasure To Kill, Terrible Certainty, Extreme Aggression) and I may agree that it isn\u2019t, but Mille, Ventor & Co. still sound fucking pissed at all the world and the sound...yeah, it is less heavy, but then again, it is also more selective and \u2013 in my opinion \u2013 simply better. \n\nPerhaps I\u2019ve been enjoying Enemy of God so much due to the fact that I\u2019ve never been a big Kreator fan before...Extreme Aggression was pretty close to being a perfect album, so was Coma of Souls, but other stuff sounded to raw, to harsh and underdeveloped to me. Looking back at Kreator\u2019s 1980s catalogue I can\u2019t help but think they were a trashy thrash band \u2013 the riffs (and whole song structures) were often too \u2018square\u2019, meaning rough, unpolished and predictable. Many of their old songs (including their biggest hits!) only have a great chorus, while verses constitute of mediocre, almost unidentifiable riffs, uninspiring drumming and non-existent bass (this hasn\u2019t changed a lot). They were lacking great, haunting melodies \u2013 both in terms of guitars and vocal lines. Enemy of God is a complete, consistent, heavy, catchy product. And perhaps as predictable as fireworks on New Years\u2019 Eve, but hey! They can\u2019t help it \u2013 they\u2019re German!\n",
        "\nHas there ever been a more clich\u00e9d album title in thrash ? Isn't that the archetypal romantic ideal of all thrash metallers: revolution ? And what's more, a revolution that is violent. The uprising of the just over the morally corrupt. The first words from the title track ring: \"Society failed to tolerate me. And I have failed to tolerate society\". If that ain't thrash for you. \n\nAs one would imagine having never listened to this, the music is very much in the same vein as that album title: it doesn't escape all the thrash stereotypes. Riffs with a sharp edge, Lombardo beats, aggravated vocals spewing out outrage language over society's unacceptable ills and the inability to exist in a world not worth a crap, all that good stuff you'd expect on an album that is irrevocably thrash. \n\nPerhaps the one aspect that sets this apart from most albums in the genre is it has a particular penchant for melody: melodious harmonized leads, or melodic riffing... Kreator seem to make it a point to make this melodic. It seems to be there at every break, like the band are seizing whatever opportunity to squeeze in guitar work reminiscent of, say, an Inflames. Thrash traditionally has always been accepting of melodic fret work, but this here would certainly qualify as being strongly in favor of that aspect if not somewhat infatuated with it. Perhaps is it the Germanic side of the band, or were they particularly influenced by the Scandinavian sound, quite in vogue there during the early 2000's. The ending on 'Of the same blood' shows off a peculiar side of the band, in fact something that isn't heard often in the genre as a whole: a lead melody bouncing off left and right panning with a \"ping pong\" delay effect, which could bring to mind music from the electronic scene.\n\nIt's unfortunate the riffs will tend towards such a caricature of thrash metal as a lot of the material on here feels genuinely inspired. This is by no means a thrash album where every song is essentially a variation of the previous. Each track brings something new to the experience. But as mentioned, whatever effort to break away from the routine is made is caught up shortly after by the more ordinary sequences. As the listener we'll feel transported every now and then to an utterly original place, but then that alarm rings and we're back where we were.\n\nOddly enough, it feels like the better tracks are found later on the album, almost like they get a little better each time. It's just the later tracks have less star quality about them and would've felt too stale to get the role of the protagonist in that top 3 to begin the record. \n\nIt should be said the production is quite stellar for an album from 2001. The guitars are meaty but so finely articulated, both saturated or clean, and like the feel of the record itself, sound beautifully organic. Those power chords are chunky. They're locked in just right with the double kicks and drums, and the vocals sound vengeful and are given just the right balance between articulation and backing reverb, without shrouding the mix.\n\nThis is surely way too long for its, and the listeners' own good. Twelve tracks of this, and just under an hour overall. You'd think the audience gets the point after about the seventh or eighth track, but it keeps coming. There were some genuinely interesting elements there, but that quality was undeniably spread out too much. Perhaps the bigger fans of this enjoy it so much because of how great it sounds, but overall there's a feeling the truly good about it gets diluted into too much material.\n",
        "\nAfter the destructive Pleasure to Kill, Kreator decided to take a step back in terms of intensity and while they wouldn\u2019t be the only band that had this in mind (think of how Slayer\u2019s Reign in Blood followed up with South of Heaven, for example), it\u2019s a welcoming change. In fact, if it weren't for Sepultura's Schizophrenia, this would have marked the best example of a band transitioning into the ''pure'' thrash metal territory with superior results.\n\nWhereas Pleasure to Kill recalls an overly gory horror movie, Terrible Certainty brings to mind a drama of realistic events that doesn\u2019t resemble fiction anymore. Now operating like a hit man with extreme eye for details, the band decided to approach thrash metal in a much more calculated manner, which means that we\u2019re no longer talking about overpowering vocals and piercing tremolo riffs that could rip your body apart. Mille and Tritze prove that they\u2019re capable of much more and unlike Coma of Souls, Terrible Certainty doesn\u2019t waste much time with safe-sounding riffs either. Sharp, yet extremely busy riffs fill these compositions to a point that they end up sounding extremely memorable and satisfying for any thrash metal fanatic.\n\n\u2018\u2019Blind Faith\u2019\u2019 may not be as crushing as anything you had heard on Kreator\u2019s earlier albums, as it introduces a collection of puzzling and punishing riffs and who could forget Mille\u2019s rapid-fire spitting during one of the album\u2019s most intense choruses? That breakdown allows one to catch their breath a bit, but it doesn\u2019t take long before the track makes a brief return to some hyper-speed pacing, making it one hell of an opener that's driven by several exciting tempo changes. \u2018\u2019Behind the Mirror\u2019\u2019 opens up with a surprisingly lamented acoustic introduction, but anyone familiar with Kreator should know that this won't last long. Indeed, riffs quickly start to bludgeon through the verses and chorus here, but do so with absolute purpose. It's hard to deny band's determination and I\u2019m almost convinced that they were compensating for the lack of brutality of Pleasure to Kill and the more restrained approach that they would take with Extreme Aggression. Even most of the record\u2019s mid-paced moments sound rather refined when compared to those of Pleasure to Kill and what the band lacks in brutality, they make up with clever riffs that would have been out of place on their earlier material. Take \u2018\u2019No Escape\u2019\u2019 for example, which features that fantastic thrash break before that atmospheric riff makes it between the conventional thrashing rhythms and Mille\u2019s tormented screams, making it quite a dramatic thrasher of a tune.\n\nThe leads also function as more than just noisy instruments like they did previously, adding a sense of eeriness to the album\u2019s atmosphere. That said, the sense of melody feels different than that of Coma of Souls, but it makes a welcoming change nonetheless. \u2018\u2019Storming with Menace\u2019\u2019 does exactly what it promises with that superb main riff storming through the verses and by the time those dramatic leads foreshadow those maniacal shredding and intense tremolo sections, it\u2019s clear that we\u2019re dealing with another highlight. \u2018\u2019One of Us\u2019\u2019 opens up with some frightening lead work before turning into a clinical thrasher that hardly shows any signs of restraint and thanks to its rousing riff that keeps resurrecting with fury, I can\u2019t help but be reminded of Metallica\u2019s \u2018\u2019Blackened\u2019\u2019 to a certain degree - that's certainly not a bad thing in this case.\n\nIf anything, I\u2019m terribly certain that \u2018\u2019As the World Burns\u2019\u2019 could have easily been left out of the album, only because it ends up as an easy-going thrasher with some restrained riffs that lack the \u2018\u2019it\u2019\u2019 factor. Vektor\u2019s angry yells remain effective and that breakdown after the two minute mark reveals promise, yet the track never dares to speeds up and overall the result isn\u2019t much of an exciting song.\n\nOf course, one weaker song isn't much of a deal, especially when you consider that the rest sounds absolutely superb. For a while I wasn\u2019t sure which Kreator album I considered to be my favorite, but nowadays it would be Terrible Certainty and although it doesn\u2019t match its predecessor in terms of brute force, it\u2019s nonetheless the best less-intense follow-up that you could hope for. \n\nThis review was originally written for antichristmagazine.com\n",
        "\nMany thrash metal bands flirted with other genres such as groove metal, hardcore punk and southern rock throughout the nineties. Kreator experimented with several genres such as industrial metal and shifted towards gothic rock on Endorama before going back to its thrash metal roots in the new millennium.\n\nEndorama is probably Kreator's calmest album as it focuses on a dreamy, numbing and mysterious atmosphere based upon additional programming, guitar synthesizers, slow and melodic guitar riffs, mid-paced rhythm section and vocals that are whispred, sung and spoken.\n\nThe more adventurous songs on the album work very well such as the catchy single ''Chosen Few'' or the dystopian ''Soul Eraser'' with its cold sound collages.\n\nThe main issue with this record is however that it isn't adventurous enough and suffers from at times repetitive songwriting. Several songs don't have much too offer beside their hypnotizing atmosphere such as tame opener ''Golden Age'' that sounds like a dull copy of Megadeth's ''Symphony of Destruction'' or the disappointing title track ''Endorama'' where guest vocalist Timo Wolff of Lacrimosa fails to add any memorable elements.\n\nAnother problem are Mille Petrozza's vocals. He is certainly trying his best on this album and exploring different vocal styles but he sounds limited and unconvincing. He is certainly great at shouting out liberating thrash metal anthems but he fails to fill atmospheric gothic rock songs with life.\n\nThe instrumental work is quite a mixed bag. The programming and synthesizers aren't overused and add atmospheric passages at the right moments. The guitar work is perhaps a little bit too restrained but adds to the gloomy atmopshere on the album. The rhythm section however is simply boring. The bass guitar plods along unspectacularly throughout the record. The drum play is at times so simplistic that a drum computer could have been used. The band could have added some more energy and urgency to its performances.\n\nAt the end of the day, Kreator's Endorama is a mixed bag. The album has an atmopsheric guiding line, strong programming and synthesizers as well as fitting guitar play but the lifeless vocals, repetitive songwriting and boring rhythm section fail to impress. Endorama can only be recommended to fans of gothic rock music of the nineties in the key of Voodoocult where Mille Petrozza was briefly involved. Fans of Kreator's early days and current soundscapes should approach this album without any expectations as it can't be compared to anything else the band has released in its vast discography.\n",
        "\nAh \u201cPleasure To Kill\u201d, a record I never tire of listening to and it still leaves an impact on my psyche even to this day. 1986 seems to have left a rather impressionable and highly influential legacy, with records such as \u201cMaster Of Puppets\u201d, \u201cReign In Blood\u201d, \u201cPeace Sells\u2026But Who\u2019s Buying?\u201d, \u201cFatal Portrait\u201d, \u201cSomewhere In Time\u201d, and an abundance of high quality releases. Yet, there is one record that I\u2019d happily pronounce as my favorite from 1986, as you can imagine based on this review, has to be Kreator\u2019s sophomore effort, \u201cPleasure To Kill\u201d. I went into detail in regards to how I discovered this record and the band in my review for \u201cI Black Hear\u201d, so I\u2019m not going to retread steps that I\u2019ve already taken. But what I will do is exclaim my love for this record. This, hands down, is my favorite album from the band. Everything from the speed, to the aggression, to even the production, I thoroughly enjoy. Of course even with my high level enjoyment doesn't block my viewpoint of flaws the record has but \u201cPleasure To Kill\u201d does so many things right that it\u2019s almost a just thing to give it an almost perfect rating. \n\nThe first remark I\u2019d like to make is about the overall sound the record has. Taking a step above from their previous record, \u201cEndless Pain\u201d, \u201cPleasure To Kill\u2019s\u201d production enhances the aggression and intensity and the sound itself does not leave much time for the listener to breathe. The guitars, drums, and vocals are fairly loud in the mix, coming off like a wall of sound. The bass is audible but sometimes I feel the mix is a little too heavy handed with the guitars and drums but it\u2019s not a fairly big issue as most of the time you can hear the bass follow along. Going from our intro \u201cChoir Of The Damned\u201d into \u201cRipping Corpse\u201d sets the tone for the whole record, as we start with an eerie choir overplayed with an electric guitar in the background, misty blowing wind, and carrion eating ravens or crows squawking into the next song which is an absolute ravenous attack on the senses with Mille\u2019s screeching vocals having that early eighties echo effect that helps give some sort of illusion that this record drips with musty evil tendencies. Everything that sets the feel for the whole record is found here. It\u2019s dark, it\u2019s heavy, and it\u2019s raw yet not too raw to where you can\u2019t hear all the players equally. \n\nThe record as a whole really does not let up much, always keeping a frisk pace and speed and not really dipping into mid-tempo like structures very often. Mille is constantly frantically riffing as if he had something to prove and the technical skill going at that speed and switching between riffs almost effortlessly is quite impressive, especially when you had records like \u201cReign In Blood\u201d and \u201cDarkness Descends\u201d being relatively agreeable comparables at this time. I\u2019ve read some reviews say the guitars can be repetitive, which I will say I believe there\u2019s enough variations to the main riff and branching into solos and new riffs to keep the songs flowing and interesting without feeling like a drag. The play style is quick, tight, and compact and the music being relatively short helps keep the pace from feeling like reputitious bore. I will say that Mille\u2019s solo work can be somewhat sloppy here and there, as Mille just speeds through like a speeding bullet train. Vocally Mille seems to have refined his voice a little, becoming just punch more clearer in his pronunciations. He still has that black metal influenced approach here but I do think this album is that one step towards his more general, thrash metal approach. \n\nSpeaking of vocals, Ventor is still singing on the record, though for only \u201cDeath Is Your Saviour\u201d, \u201cRiot Of Violence\u201d, and \u201cCommand Of The Blade\u201d. Just like Mille, Ventura vocals seemed to have refined a little, still remaining gruff and cave like but having a better sense of clarity and pronunciations. He still sounds great but compared to Milles performances on songs like the title track, \u201cPleasure To Kill\u201d or \u201cUnder The Guillotine\u201d, Ventor lacks that impact Mille can bring to the table. But if we talk about his drumming, that\u2019s an entirely different story. Ventor is intense behind the kit as he keeps a continuous rhythm for both Mille and Roberto to play off of. Ventor produces some blistering double kicks throughout and while he\u2019s able to give a great deal of interesting drum fills, there\u2019s an occasional flaw here and there as Ventor plays so fast (like Mille) that he misses some of the beats, coming off just a little sloppy. But besides some issues at points in the record, Ventor is well rounded and vicious. \nFinally we have Roberto on bass and really there\u2019s not much to say. Roberto's play style is moderately solid though he flows the main rhythm sections without much variation. It\u2019s not really his fault and more so the issue with how the bass was written. But even if the bass lines aren\u2019t fairly varied or interesting, I give credence to the fact that his bass helps the flow of the music, and gives everything else some dynamics. \n\nMusically, \u201cPleasure To Kill\u201d takes it up a notch, becoming even more technical and brutal compared to \u201cEndless Pain\u201d. As I mentioned previously, the riffing is much faster here, while maintaining a consistent flow between the main section of each song's riffs and their subsequent variations and solo work found within. Even with all that speed and aggressive playing, Kreator doesn\u2019t shy away from adding some melodic passages such as in the later half of their more ambitious \u201cThe Pestilence\u201d, towards the middle of \u201cPleasure To Kill\u201d, or in the first half of \u201cRiot Of Violence\u201d. For such a chaotic sounding record, it still retains a catchyness throughout the record and, in my mind, helps keep the music interesting throughout. Something else I find interesting is the lyrical matter. It\u2019s not like the lyrics are ground breaking or anything but I really liked that all of the songs deal with some sort of aspect of death, and the record almost comes off as a concept record. On the whole, \u201cPleasure To Kill\u201d is pretty much straightforward, yet that straightforward approach does not limit the overall technical nature that is exhibited here. \n\n\u201cPleasure To Kill\u201d is, in my mind, equal to the destructive power that Slayer\u2019s \u201cReign In Blood\u201d has and the chaotic nature Dark Angel\u2019s classic \u201cDarkness Descends\u201d drips. Not one minute is wasted throughout its run time; Kreator could have just made \u201cEndless Pain\u201d part 2 yet they didn\u2019t do that, they choose to push their sound to even more extremes, extremes that would go on and influence whole new genres such as death metal and the second wave of black metal. Even with all that scorching speed, the songs never feel like they blend in with the other tracks on the disc, nor taking components from said tracks and practically using them with minor tweaks. \u201cPleasure To Kill\u201d isn\u2019t a perfect record, nor is it near perfect, but damn is it close. Luckily the little flaws in production and playing don\u2019t take away from the well thought out writing. It\u2019s all in the next step in the evolution of the band but there\u2019s something so timeless about \u201cPleasure To Kill\u201d that it\u2019s remained my favorite (even if I don\u2019t believe it\u2019s the band's best record) for years. If you love raw, unhinged, down right evil sounding thrash metal, then \u201cPleasure To Kill\u201d will definitely be your bread and butter.\n",
        "\nIt's no denying that this is one of the most influential albums in terms of extreme metal, carrying huge inspiration for the death metal and black metal genres, not so much in terms of songwriting and riffs, but in terms of how intense, raw and relentless the songs are. Pleasure to Kill was a huge step forward in terms of the playing ability and cohesion of all 3 members; they all sound much tighter and sound like they care a lot more, whereas some of Endless Pain just sounds half-assed. Kreator go all-in on this record, and straight away there is a noticeable amount of musical improvement with the intro, Choir of the Damned. This melodic, somewhat charming, somewhat eerie, climaxes at the start of Ripping Corpse, which is my favourite song on the album, as it's a perfect embodiment of the next 40 minutes to come, it encapsulates the best aspects from all of the other songs and combines them. Although not being as dynamic and infectious as tracks later on in the album, Ripping Corpse is a bombardment of riffs that make you feel like you're taking a sledgehammer to the face. As well as the musical evocativeness, a lot of the songs are downright catchy, with the two more popular songs from the album, the title track and Riot of Violence, rely on hefty hooks that match the pounding riffs. Both of the songs are great, and resemble an equilibrium between the barbaric tone and caveman aggression found on this album with the weird amount of virtuosity. Death is Your Saviour is similar to Ripping Corpse, since it's quite short and relies on multiple riffs to get its point across, and with Ventor on vocals it sounds much more frantic.\n\nI would say that this album as a whole stands the test of time as a milestone in the early years of extreme metal. Nothing topped it back in 1986, it was the heaviest and fastest thing out. Of course barely a year later it was steamrolled by new acts such as Sadus, Napalm Death and Dark Angel, but when taken into account the time this album was released, it's clear as to why it bears so much influence. Ventor's drumming is incredible, sometimes it sounds like they just brought an assault rifle into the studio. The production of Pleasure to Kill is also very impressive, it isn't too thin like Endless Pain, but it also isn't too muddy like Terrible Certainty. Songs like The Pestilence show off the more ambitious and dynamic side of Kreator, which the world would see a lot more of in their next two releases, but The Pestilence is probably the one song in particular that I would pick from this album as the most musically ambitious, as not only is it the longest song, it's also the most progressive, with a huge middle section that isn't unlike something from Hell Awaits, and the song itself has 2 crazy primary riffs. The lyrics throughout the whole record are interesting, as they sound like oddly specific takes on death. According to Mille Petrozza, most of the lyrics on the album were inspired by the film Faces of Death, a semi-snuff documentary from the 70's, and apparently every song covers a different way to die. I don't see this exactly, but most of the songs definitely talk about more than mindless gore and edginess, some of these lyrics are quite disturbing in their graphicness, like on Riot of Violence \"A man lies in the corner, covered with blood, bloody wounds on his body, praying to his god, people pass him by, but they say why should we care about him? he will die today,\" and on Under the Guillotine \"Tears are running down your cheeks as you see the axe of death,\" the lyrics sound a little childish in nature, but they're still brutal and graphic, and it sounds like Kreator were trying to delve deeper into what bands like Slayer and Venom were toying around with, which also signifies their influence on the more demented part of metal music.\n\nThis tracklist is almost flawless, with the only tracks I'm not that keen on being Carrion and Command of the Blade, but the rest of the songs are all classics, and despite the brutality and primitiveness of a lot of the songwriting, Pleasure to Kill is surprisingly accessible, and I'd recommend it to people who are trying to get into extreme metal. Overall, this record is pretty much essential, the first side is exclusively must-listens, and The Pestilence is also a great song that's quite underrated in my opinion.\n",
        "\nThis site calls it a single, I would call it a mini-EP. Flag of Hate was released ahead of Pleasure to Kill, and I'm taking the bold guess that most people born after 1980 got to know it as a bonus addition to said album. \n\nGranted, Pleasure to Kill could not be improved any further. It was flawless (with all its flaws), but whereas bonus songs often are lame and unnecessary, \"Flag of Hate\", \"Take Their Lives\" and \"Awakening of the Gods\" would vastly improve almost every other album in existence.\n\nI have tried to do some \"virgin reviews\" on here, and indeed found some hitherto unreviewed albums, but ended up disliking many of them. So I wanted to go with a release that is far from unknown, but at the same time not too prevalent in lists of thrash classics etc. Nonetheless, all three songs on Flag of Hate are built on a backbone of truly classic riffs. Kreator at this time were masters of variety, delivering riff after riff after riff; fast and short, technical and raw. They were also fairly negligent of musical tightness, crashing in and out of sync with eachother. In my opinion it just makes the output more energetic, and over-the-top in a positive sense. Flag of Hate of course has two longer songs, which made it somewhat easier for Mille, Ventor and Rob to keep pace with eachother. There are some hiccups, for instance see 04:17 into \"Take Their Lives\". (Although according to Mille in Pleasure to Kill's liner notes, he had to lay down several basslines during this period. I don't know whether Rob has rebutted to that...) The songs remain interesting even after the 7-minute mark.\n\nThe only negative characteristic when comparing Flag of Hate to Pleasure to Kill is the lack of vocals from Ventor. The lyrics themselves are equally ridiculous as they are on the album, though. \"Come into my vault and [...] I'll eat your intestines\", for instance. Still, this thrashterpiece with cartoonish lyrics is a haven amid all the actual flags of hate being flown in the world today.\n",
        "\nThis was my first Kreator album, and honestly it took me a while to get into. The trio were definitely inexperienced with their instruments at the time, and the recording hasn't aged as well as their other 80s albums. Apparently it took them 10 days to record this, which I find hard to believe considering how sloppy some of the sections are. However, after having listened to this album about 20 times, I've come to enjoy virtually every song. Most of the tracks are primitive, but aggressive and vicious, like a watered down version of Pleasure to Kill. In fact, Pleasure to Kill sounds like an extension of Endless Pain on steroids, considering both records have pretty much the same lyrical themes and barbaric, razor-sharp guitar tones. The title track opens the album, and it's one of the most energetic and consistent songs on the album, the chorus is catchy and the riffs are all badass. Other songs such as Total Death and Cry War are similar in their riffing, which was clearly influenced by early Slayer and Metallica (who could've guessed), but they're much slower in comparison, and the chorus of Total Death almost identical to Strike of the Beast by Exodus, both vocally and instrumentally. Storm of the Beast is my favourite track on Endless Pain, it's the longest and also the most epic, it's almost as if Kreator were looking 3 or so albums into the future when writing this song, as it has riffs that are more akin to Extreme Aggression and Coma of Souls rather than the band's earlier material, Pleasure to Kill and Terrible Certainty.\n\nThe record in its entirety is quite simple and even repetitive, but a lot of the riffs have that infectious, catchy feeling found on old school metal songs by bands such as Celtic Frost and Venom. Despite a lot of them being sloppy and going on for too long, the songs aren't bad at all, and the tracks are surprisingly varied, Bonebreaker and Cry War feel a lot happier than the other songs, and have a bluesy feeling, similar to early Motorhead. Ventor's drumming is slightly sloppy and straightforward, which is especially noticeable during the multiple drum intros. Ventor also does the vocals on about half of the album, and his voice is slightly higher-pitched compared to Mille's growling. Ventor's voice is crazier and less controlled, whereas Mille's voice is one constant pitch, and I think that both of them sound good. Most of the record is just catchy, such as Tormentor and Son of Evil, the latter of which has a bouncy, fun middle-section, which is one of the highlights of the album in my opinion. The production clearly shows Endless Pain's age, as the whole record is plagued by wonky distortion and thin, scratchy guitar tones, and the bass is practically inaudible. On the contrary, I'd say that Kreator makes up for it in terms of how vibrant the songs are, they sound morbid and ruthless, but upbeat and fun at the same time, complete with galloping, impactful middle sections, and abrupt riff transitions which give the songs a dramatic dynamic edge. The songs in general aren't amazing though, and none stand out on their own with the exception of Storm of the Beast and Living in Fear, in my opinion. I wouldn't say that Endless Pain is flawless, but it's a great album, and you should definitely listen to it if you're into speed metal, thrash metal etc.\n",
        "\nIt's certainly true that Kreator abandoned their extreme (and boundary pushing) roots going into their third album, 1987's Terrible Certainty, at this point featuring a tighter and more straightforward thrash metal approach. However, the direction feels natural for a maturing thrash band and there really was no need to attempt to make another Pleasure to Kill- Mille had become a more socially conscious person, so the change in lyrical content on Terrible Certainty only reflects this. Meanwhile, the joining of a new guitarist and the more refined playing and execution from the existing band members feels suitable with the abandonment of crude lyrical themes anyway. To me, it's similar to what would happen with Sepultura from Brazil once Andreas joined on guitar, going from Morbid Visions to Schizophrenia this same year.\n\nEndless Pain was a damn cool thrash/black attack that showed ambition, and Pleasure to Kill is a record that every metalhead loves, due largely, I think, to the consistency of the tracklist - all killer, no filler. Classic extreme thrash in every sense! However, I'll still take the early work of Celtic Frost, Sepultura, Slayer, and Possessed for my 80's extreme metal, because I do feel that Kreator reached their fullest potential, and most honest creative vision, with albums like Terrible Certainty, Extreme Aggression, and Coma of Souls- you know, their non-extreme thrash albums they released before experimenting with their sound. Terrible Certainty, though, is the first and best album of this era, like a second debut in a way. The ideas are so coherently executed, the riffs cut though like a lawnmower blade through swiss cheese, and every moment exudes passion and intensity in exemplary thrash form. This album isn't as gloomy or detached as Destruction's albums circa this period, nor as cruel and outright punishing as Sodom's, but it is exhilarating in every sense and proves that thrash metal still had plenty of its finest hours to offer going into the later part of the 80's.\n\nI generally have a lot less to say about thrash metal than doom metal, but Terrible Certainty is easily in my top 5 thrash albums, so I do have a fair bit to say about it - the first point of which actually happens to be parallel to doom metal circa 1987. The structure of albums like Day of Reckoning by Pentagram are, as vastly different as Kreator may be than such a Sabbath-like group, not dissimilar to Kreator's structure on Terrible Certainty - you start with a banger or two, before building up to something more involved towards the middle (in this case, the title track and \"Toxic Trace\", broken up by the Ventor-sung \"As the World Burns\"), then having more sublime deep cuts (\"One of Us\") and finally closing on a more emotionally powerful note (\"Behind the Mirror\"). Don't worry, contrasting this album with dinosaur doom isn't the meat and potatoes of this review, but that pacing to the intensity here is just something I found interesting, and it is probably something that makes this a doom metal fan's favorite (or one of their favorite) thrash album(s).\n\nSongwise, Kreator's got emotional, dynamic riffing and delivery down to perfection. \"Storming With Menace\" is the banger most people remember well from this album, and coupled with the preceding opener \"Blind Faith\", it's not at all hard to see why. Both have unforgettable refrains, with Blind Faith relying more on Mille's vocal delivery and Storming relying more on an unnerving progression. Both of the first two songs here would make a very cool 7\" and that would still be a 10/10 thrash release in my book. The title track has more buildup to it (see the intense opening riff) but is also somehow more immediate with the main hook and familiar chorus. However, my favorite instrumental segment on this album has to be the beginning of \"Toxic Trace\", which makes \"Tornado of Souls\" by Megadeth sound less like a technical thrash marvel and more like wanking buffoonery with no balls, which it's not, but Toxic Trace still blows it out of the water compositionally. It's also the perfect balance of a relentless assault (especially the jaw-dropping chorus) and a more sophisticated approach. Certainly, the palm-muted riffs played primarily on the A and D strings break up the unforgiving thrashiness while still being interesting due to a curious feel. \"No Escape\" has elements of melodicism to it, but not in an overbearing way, because if you bring up this album to any veteran thrasher, they'll mention No Escape as a highlight and a prime example of what made thrash classics like Terrible Certainty so charismatic and unforgettable.\n\nThis is, bar none, the definition of ridiculously enjoyable and well-calculated thrash. When it comes to thrash with sublime musicianship and songwriting ideas, many albums are brought up before Terrible Certainty, and Coma of Souls is usually thought to be Kreator's technical peak, but the third album is somehow just the right balance of technicality and unadulterated fury. Everything here serves a purpose and goes in a coherent direction. Essential thrash!\n",
        "\nOverall impression: good. What\u2019s left to say?\n\nOkay, I apologize. I just wanted to be effective. Once in a lifetime! Anyway, let\u2019s take a closer look at \u201cEnemy of God\u201d. Lyrics are of course not the most important thing on an album, but since Mille likes to mime the intellectual, I have to get it over with quickly here. The lyrics suck. They are full of striking third-grade slogans. The multiple repetition of \"I want to kill you\" seems ridiculous and lines like \"I hate your lives\" or \"All I see is terror, all I see is pain\" are no better. But let's not rob Mille of his dreams of \"Murder Fantasies\", \"World Anarchy\" or \"Impossible Brutality\" and rather devote ourselves to the music.\n\nAs said before, \u201cEnemy of God\u201d is a good album. Honestly speaking, it does not have many thrash metal vibes. Kreator have penned some pretty smooth compositions that are heavy, profound and muscular, but the spirit of thrash only shows up every now and then. This is rather modern heavy metal in pure form and some hidden Maiden-esque melody lines are not forbidden (\u201cVoices of the Dead\u201d). Of course, sometimes Kreator step on the gas pedal with the effect that the songs have an authoritarian touch. Nevertheless, everything seems to be well planned and spontaneity comes off badly. This is tolerable, however, because many titles have other qualities. The cool chorus of \"Impossible Brutality\" catches the ear quickly, every note is right in the opening, pleasantly aggressive title track and one also likes to return to \"When Death Takes Its Dominion\" with its excellent solo, its effective opening riff and its dark mood.\n\nKreator succeed in playing their strongest card in the 21st century. They find a good mixture between hardness and melody. You could maliciously call it consensus metal, but you can also simply acknowledge a certain compositional class. Most of the pieces have a remarkable flow, are relatively varied in conception and suffer neither from over-length nor from insubstantiality. This alone is laudable, but the best is yet to come. Many songs are simply fun, for example \"Dystopia\", which unfolds its full splendour in the chorus. The experienced production, which reveals no weaknesses, also contributes to the positive impact of the songs. \"Enemy of God\" suggests that Mille, Ventor and friends were able to realise their idea of the \"right\" sound exactly.\n\nMaybe it is right that Kreator did not leave their comfort zone on \u201cEnemy of God\u201d. One can blame them for this, but everyone who sits in a glass house should not throw stones. Apart from this, the lack of progress does not matter. The overall impression is: good.\n",
        "\n20 years ago, Kreator welcomed the new millennium with \u201cViolent Revolution\u201d. The album marked a turning point in the history of the once furious pioneers of German thrash. In 2001, the more or less experimental period that had begun with \u201cRenewal\u201d was a thing of the past. Mille and his business partners swung the thrash axes again. Unfortunately, Ventor did not reappear as lead vocalist, but we can\u2019t have it all. Naturally one can discuss whether this was a credible return to the old style. Either way, whenever I was confronted with the crude \u201cRenewal\u201d or the velvet \u201cEndorama\u201d, I wished I could listen to a real thrash album \u2013 even if it lacks authenticity to a certain extent.\n\nI know it\u2019s not a new finding, but thrash lives from its energy, its velocity and its razor-sharp riffs. On the other hand, maturity is no essential ingredient. However, we cannot blame the band for having been active for nearly 20 years in 2001. What I want to say is that \u201cViolent Revolution\u201d sounds good, but the routine of the quartet shines through every riff, verse, chorus and solo. This does not mean that the songs are as lame as the predictable artwork. They are competently designed, the riffing conveys a very solid degree of heaviness and some well-placed tempo shifts lend the material a pretty dynamic appearance. What I miss is a higher level of spontaneity (underdeveloped), impulsiveness (almost absent) and ferocity (non-existent). To my surprise, the production shows the same deficits. It\u2019s a good, pretty clear mix with a cool guitar sound, but somehow it has an inoffensive character. I cannot say that this kind of technical implementation catches the unbridled spirit of thrash, even though it can be considered as good in objective terms.\n\nAnyway, the programmatically titled opener \u201cReconquering the Throne\u201d shows the band in good form. The song does not lack a basic aggression and Ventor pushes the pace while using his double bass accurately. The title track scores, among other things, with its catchy yet heavy chorus. The mainly swift \u201cAll of the Same Blood\u201d is Mille\u2019s peace, love and understanding song. It does not fall victim to a soft musical approach, but is lyrical message is amazing for a band that once felt the pleasure to kill. But of course, the guys do not words like peace or love, they prefer to transport their statement while singing about \u201carmies of totalitarian psychopaths\u201d. Be that as it may, the first half of the album holds almost only good tracks (and ends with another programmatic statement, the pretty rapid \u201cSecond Awakening\u201d). Especially \u201cServant in Heaven \u2013 King in Hell\u201d has a lot of thrashing charm, although its mid-paced approach does not make the pulse run faster. But its rasping guitars of the verses and the effective melody of the memorable chorus form a strong piece that does not need high velocity to leave a good impression.\n\nEvery single musician performs well here. Mille makes a good, pretty charismatic vocal delivery, the solos work and Ventor has no need to prove anything to anyone. He manages the drum parts excellently. Having that said, it\u2019s slightly regrettable that the second half of the album lags a bit. \u201cGhetto War\u201d possesses a casual chorus with a fine melody, but it derails during the sluggish instrumental part. The soft beginning of \u201cReplicas of Life\u201d should have been shortened. Adding calm vocals to emotional sequences has never been the strength of mom Petrozza\u2019s son. Honestly speaking, one finds more details that could have been done in a better way. On the other hand, \u201cSlave Machinery\u201d adds value to the work, \"Mind on Fire\" scores with a flashy chorus and there is no obvious downer to find. That\u2019s no matter of course on an album that clocks in after 56 minutes. In summary, \u201cViolent Revolution\u201d delivers a homogeneous load of adult thrash and it was, no doubt about it, a good start for Kreator into their new Mille-nium.\n",
        "\nI didn't think too highly of this release, hence the \"C\" rating. I thought that the guitars were generic and not well thought out. Nothing like the older days like 'Coma of Souls' or 'Violent Revolution'. I just think Mille is end of his road and legacy with his band. There's a lot of talk about the new album, but if it's going to be like this or even worse, I'm not getting it! The only good about this album are the vocals and some of the riffs (but not many). I was quite disappointed with this album. There's not a lot of good to say about it. When Kreator was a band whose riffs used to be fantastic. Just please, take out the sloppy leads!\n\nMost tracks were filled with disdainful hatred, but they also didn't show much enthusiasm. Not like say 'Enemy of God'. They just lagged through this. It's something that I'd have to talk to Mille about. If this is a Kreator album he'd take to a deserted album. I doubt it. The only tracks I like on here are \"Satan is Real\" and \"Fallen Brother\", the rest are just mediocre. The latter track signifies those in the metal world that passed away, especially Cliff Burton of Metallica. The music videos for the two songs I mentioned were good. But they should've made all the songs catchy and noteworthy. This is truly a TRAGEDY.\n\nIf Kreator is to still make music especially in this pandemic, they have to step it up. Take out the sloppy leads unless they had their old guitar player on 'Coma of Souls' Frank Blackfire. He's I think playing again with Sodom. His leads were magnificent. Mille's always been sloppy, he should just stick to rhythm guitar/vocals. He never seemed to master the art of playing lead guitar. I think he's another self-taught guitarist. But really, he should've stayed rhythm (as I say).\n\n'Gods of Violence' doesn't really have anything to offer the metal community. With those two tracks and that's it, but all the rest are pretty generic. I feel that this album was a step back from their good releases and I chuck this on in the trash. What a disappointment. Mille's vocals should stay strong, he needs to focus on his songwriting and what the critics are saying about his musicianship on here. The clean vocals, too are something that he needs to work on. Check out those two tracks but please steer clear of the rest of the album. If you thought those two were bad, don't even think about getting the album.\n",
        "\nWhen I think about some of my favorite albums, thrash debuts usually rank high in my lists; sometimes even being my absolute favorites. Kreator\u2019s \u201cEndless Pain\u201d is no exception to that sentiment. I mentioned in my \u201cHorrorscope\u201d review how that album got me to really connect with thrash as a genre and after the coat tails of collecting Overkill\u2019s material I came across across this, \u201cPleasure To Kill\u201d, and \u201cTerrible Certainty\u2019s\u201d artwork alone. I just thought those covers were kickass and I\u2019ve always been a stickler for centered and symmetrical art and Kreator\u2019s first three albums had what I liked. When you first listen to \u201cEndless Pain\u201d you\u2019ll notice how raw and unpolished this early black metal drenched thrash assault is. \n\nMusically \u201cEndless Pain\u201d is pretty much a full frontal attack on your senses with speed and aggression with not too much variation out of this formula. Like, you literally are thrust into quick, speedy riffing right of the bat with the title song, \u201cEndless Pain\u201d and most of the songs on the album begin the same way as the title song. There is some instances where Kreator take their time with some mid-paced openings such as \u201cCry War\u201d, \u201cStorm Of The Beast\u201d, and \u201cDying Victims\u201d but that mid-paced rhythm usually disappears within a minute or so. Though not filled with variety and may be simpler compared to what would come next; songs like \u201cFlag Of Hate\u201d, \u201cTormentor\u201d, \u201cTotal Death\u201d, and the rest of the album still offers some memorable writing while keeping that lighting fast riffing catchy and in your face. \n\nSpeaking of speed and aggression; what Mille Petrozza exhibits here is absolutely brutal and you can tell he was greatly influenced from bands such as Venom and Slayer. Mille just kicks fucking ass all over this record even if his playing may feel loose at times. There\u2019s a tremendous amount of skill to be found here, especially in the solo department. Something I really liked about this album is the catchiness of the solos as seen in a song like \u201cTormentor\u201d where the quick jump from the leads into the solo just flows so well and catches your attention and most of the songs do this as well. It\u2019s just some really fantastic guitar work here. \n\nOur other two key players, Ventor and Roberto Fioretti, offer some pretty great work though I still think the highlight is Mille behind the guitars. Ventor is clearly a talented drummer as he goes can go from those classic Maidenesque gallops into full on tearing the set apart in \u201cStorm Of The Beast\u201d and \u201cSon Of Evil\u201d. Just like the rest of the album there\u2019s not much of variety out of the fast paced nature but there are minor little moments he can slow it down a smidge. Roberto does a good jumping back up Milles guitar leads but sadly the mix kinda pushes the bass into the background which is a shame as I really like what I hear from Roberto. \n\nSomething to note is that both Ventor and Mille take over vocal duties on this album (and Pleasure To Kill as well) and adds a little dimension to the album that other thrash albums may not have had. Ventor vocally has more thrash overtones while Mille leans more into the black metal realm. Both seem to have a screechy singing style but what makes them really different is how it sounds. Ventor has a lower guttural screech while Milles is a higher nasally screech, at least to my ears. They both ooze a primal evil sound that caught my fancy in both \u201cEndless Pain\u201d and \u201cPleasure To Kill\u201d but that would subsequently be toned down by \u201cTerrible Certainty\u201d. Lyrically the album doesn\u2019t stray away from your typical topics about satan and demons, death, and war. Nowadays some may cringe at these type of lyrics but I find a good amount of charm here and what makes lyrics great is how they are executed and \u201cEndless Pain\u201d does that. \n\nI mentioned at the beginning that \u201cEndless Pain\u201d sounded raw and unpolished and that is true. Thanks to Horst M\u00fcller the album feels aggressive as if the actual music is made at you for some reason that you have no idea as to why. There could be some improvements bringing out the clarity of the music, especially bringing the bass up more in the mix, but overall the production does its job well for the most part everything can be heard with clarity and power. The recent remaster that came out in 2018 greatly improves this album sonically and I\u2019d recommend getting that and a original copy if you ever get the chance. \n\n\u201cEndless Pain\u201d is a tent pole as to what made early Kreator special and they would only go on to evolve and improve their sound. While it has some production issues, may not have the tightest handle instrumentally, and may not be varied in sound; it is though bulked up with memorable writing and catchiness that is head choppingly fast that it\u2019s hard not to love this album. \u201cEndless Pain\u201d is a really great release and beginning for the up and coming Kreator with only better things to come. It may not be their best and it may not be as good as albums such as \u201cBonded By Blood\u201d, Show No Mercy\u201d, or \u201cFeel The Fire\u201d but it damn sure still kicks your fucking ass. If you came for a slow ride then you better jump off this album but if you\u2019re looking for a catchy thrash attack that holds no prisoners then you are definitely in the right place here with \u201cEndless Pain\u201d.\n",
        "\nBut why; why would he do that? Rather than looking for ways to produce his own \u201cNo More Color\u201d, why doesn\u2019t he try to bring more colour to the listless, mechanical, aggro 90\u2019s environment that he\u2019s been trying to conquer ever since the start of the decade? Put a rainbow across the board and boom, you own it\u2026 well, you know the story from the first chapter only too well; it was \u201cNo More Color\u201d alright, only that it was titled \u201cOutcast\u201d, a dark gothic metallic dance that enchanted some, and seriously pulled back others. \n\nI can totally understand the latter fraction; \u201cCause for Conflict\u201d did sound like a partial at least return to times of thrash, not exactly very old school but still\u2026 and you know the old saying \u201cIn case of you don\u2019t succeed\u2026\u201d. The thing is that success during those transformational times wasn\u2019t measured by scholasticism and stubbornness; flexibility and adaptation were the new slogans, and what better way to prove to the audience that you still have it than riding the crest of a modern fad? The industrial chug didn\u2019t quite suit Mille; \u201cRenewal II\u201d was scrapped\u2026 what else to try? Wait a minute; why not ask the vetter\u2026 sorry, venerable Coroner for a piece of advice? And his office is not like miles away, but over there in Switzerland; just an arm\u2019s stretch from here\u2026\n\nTommy Vetterli had just wrapped on work on a very short-lived stint named Clockwork with one his former band\u2019s roadies (Lui Cubello), a fitting groovy tribute to the times not very far from \u201cGrin\u201d; and had plenty of time on his hands. But of course, he would use the opportunity to cook something with one of Germany\u2019s finest! What exactly should it be, though? He\u2019s still on a \u201cGrin\u201d wave more or less\u2026 oh, Mille has already tried something along those lines a few years back, on \u201cRenewal\u201d\u2026 a nice fitting title, by the way; will by all means give it a listen later. Not another such mechanical pull? Sure, no problem. Then\u2026 what? Any suggestions? Options are not exactly infinite right now, but they\u2019ll surely figure something out. \n\nAnd they did; and did a fairly good job with this dark gothic metal brand as this \u201cOutcast\u201d sounded so confident and smooth that if Paradise Lost\u2019s Chris Holmes had occupied the place behind the mike, this opus could have passed for a true gothic metal stalwart. Well, Mille\u2019s spiteful shouty baritone betrayed the Kreator connection, but this should have been the spirit\u2026 cause the Petrozza/Vetterli collaboration were bracing themselves for another ode to the dark side of the metal spectre. One can only speculate as to why the two veterans decided to give it one more go\u2026 did \u201cOutcast\u201d sell quite a few copies around the world, surpassing the sales of the last few albums? Possible. Did the two artists share common fondness for the gothic which needed more expressions than the solitary stint? Possible. Did they really like what they came up with the first time that a sequel to it immediately became an option? Also possible. The actual reasons were combinations of all those most likely, and they did propel the guys forward for the album reviewed here to become a fact. \n\nSo Kreator produced a faithful follow-up to a preceding album in the 90\u2019s; thumbs up. The gothic pirouettes continue on full-throttle, and some more; one just needs to have a look at the videoclip to the title-track to know that the gothic metal tournament might as well have its new champions from the obsolete 80\u2019s thrash brotherhood\u2026 yes, you can\u2019t miss Tilo Wolff there, the frontman of the leaders of the German goth rock/darkwave movement Lacrimosa. So Mille has added another, more relevant as well, celebrity to the line-up and although Wolff only dances (and also sings) on this number only, the message is clear: we\u2019re marching on, but not as the outcasts of the goth-metal wave anymore. Sure, but on the previous recording the outcast status was reflected in a more aggressive, rowdier attitude\u2026 here the latter has been reduced to a large extent; in fact, it\u2019s only reflected in two numbers: the brisk galloping energizer \u201cSoul Eraser\u201d; and the dramatic proto-thrashy \u201cPandemonium\u201d. The thing is that, regardless of how fresh and surprising these tunes are, one can\u2019t consider them the highlights simply because this isn\u2019t a thrash metal opus. \n\nBut this was the way to do it: bring in the mainman of the ultimate model in your chosen field, reduce the overt intensity to the minimum, modernize the setting with a few more trendy gimmicks, and here you go, you already are one of them. Not exactly a loss of identity, but with the element of surprise gone this effort can\u2019t possibly weigh as much. Well, Mille\u2019s spiteful raspy tirades are here for one thing, and with another more energetic nuance (\u201cShadowland\u201d) slipping through the cracks here and there, the canvas isn\u2019t exactly a still life. It doesn\u2019t get too perturbed by calm semi-balladic sprawls like \u201cChosen Few\u201d, or by elegiac melancholic etudes like \u201cEverlasting Flame\u201d, but bouncy roller-coasters like \u201cFuture Ring\u201d and \u201cTyranny\u201d retain some kind of tension, keeping the album on the more dynamic side of the gothic metal/rock spectre where also other German outfits belong like Secret Discovery, Dreadful Shadows, Lacrimosa again, the later works of Crematory and Lacrimas Profundere\u2026\n\ncloser to the goth scene doesn\u2019t mean better, not in the Kreator case anyway. Exclamation from fans like \u201cKreator?! Really!?\u201d became way more common than earlier; the skin shedding had reached a point where Mille had to take a firmer stance. \u201cEndorama II\u201d was going to throw him too deep down the gothic rabbit hole\u2026 was this what the man was planning as a next step? Were we going to watch Mille the Goth from then on, the new personage on the new millennium\u2019s music arena? I\u2019m sure some fans out there were secretly hoping that the Kreator spell would come to an end before the band could turn into the ultimate example of a radical metamorphosis from the thrash metal scene. It also remained to be seen how well this album performed in the box-office; cause it\u2019s all about money in the long dark run, right?\n\nDelving into that last detail became redundant with the arrival of the new era. Suddenly, it became perfectly normal again to play classic metal of all branches; and who to do this better than Mille Petrozza? For this, however, he didn\u2019t need consultants anymore; he bade farewell to Vetterli and to the entire experimental period from his career. \u201cViolent Revolution\u201d saw the man bringing back the thrash, not to such a violent extent but prominently enough to erase the audience\u2019s more painful memories from the past decade\u2019s stylistic meanderings. The band has been doing well ever since, not looking astray, staying the thrash course, sometimes embellishing it with more modern tricks, sometimes elaborating it with the casual more intricate nuance. All good and righteous in the Kreator camp\u2026 until the next appointment with the Coroner.\n",
        "\nHm\u2026 wrapping on my latest reviewing spree with Kreator reviews\u2026 strange; have never been a big fan of the band\u2026 I did attend their concert in Varna in the autumn of 1993, though, and I jumped particularly wildly on \u201cFlag of Hate\u201d and \u201cExtreme Aggression\u201d as these were the only tracks that I recognized from the set. \n\nBut the album reviewed here holds a special place in my heart\u2026 cause this is the only cassette that I stole from a shop\u2026 well, I didn\u2019t exactly steal it, I just forgot to pay for it. I was taking part in a tennis tournament in this city in the summer of 1997, and I spotted the tape in a music shop there. The guy was a big metalhead, and we talked far\u2019n wide about our favourite music, I gave him a few precious pieces of information that he wasn\u2019t aware of, and when I left, I took the tape but didn\u2019t give him any money; I forgot. This only occurred to me a few minutes later when I was already far from the shop, but I didn\u2019t have time to go back\u2026 you see, I\u2019m not like Clint Eastwood, to go the extra mile for a few dollars more, or for a fistful of dollars\u2026 I\u2019m a charity person. Besides, considering the invaluable information I delivered to the guy regarding our favourite pastime, I took this as a gift from him. Long live.\n\nYeah, the Kreator discography passed me by, completely before this Outcast here. Their early recordings sounded too messy and brutal for me back then, and based on what I heard on those I only gave half a listen to their more proficient late-80\u2019s/early-90\u2019s period. But then this \u201cRenewal\u201d appeared that became the most favourite album of a friend of mine; he had several cassettes, one for his home, one for his grandparents\u2019 house, one for the car, one for the bicycle\u2026 he even had a spare copy to give me. I nodded semi-approvingly on these weird industrial soundscapes, rather in solidarity with my friend than due to some strong appreciation I developed for them, and wasn\u2019t particularly moved when \u201cCause for Conflict\u201d came knocking on my door, another present from a friend, with Mille bumping his head against the already solid groove/industrial wall from the mid-90\u2019s, trying to prick it somehow with his obsolete thrashy tactics. \n\nNope, no success there, and under the ungrateful circumstances there was only one thing left to do: our hero had to sign up for an appointment with the sage known as the Coroner who had just retired from a busy illustrious career in the tech-thrash subgenre. Said Coroner, the actual name Tommy Vetterli, had tried his hands on a couple of jumpy groovy, semi-technical tunes under the name Clockwork (one demo, 1995) a few months back, but otherwise he wasn\u2019t doing much at the time. Perfect timing, and before you know it the Petrozza/Vetterli collaboration became a fact\u2026 yep, it seemed as though Mille might eventually realize his visions of tech-thrash grandeur\u2026 \n\nwhen I was buying\u2026 oops, taking the cassette, I knew that Vetterli had accepted the offer to join the Kreator camp; that was already a well-publicized secret. So the world, who earlier needed just one hero, now had two, as a joint force at that. The only question left was whether this was going to be a classic tech-thrash behemoth (\u201cVortex of Souls\u201d) or a venerable, not very servile, nod to the current at the time vogues (\u201cGrinning Renewal\u201d)\u2026 who would have thought that these two naughty troubadours, these people of the lie, would choose an entirely different path to explore, defying everyone\u2019s expectations\u2026 the moment the opening \u201cLeave This World Behind\u201d reached my ears I knew that we all were tricked; this Outcast didn\u2019t need to dance in complicated vortexes, and had no intentions on grinning artificially like a forced-to-be-there circus clown.\n\nThis is a modern dark/gothic metal recording, only executed the Kreator way; think an edgier and a more dynamic rendition of the genre than the one savoured on the works of Paradise Lost, Cemetary, and Sentenced at around the same time. And even more surprisingly, it doesn\u2019t sound awkward; not at all. After the thrash invasion Mille attempted on the previous effort ultimately failed, he knew it was futile to waste time for another such crusade against the aggro/groovy bastion\u2026 so why not give freedom to his dark/gothic side? Easier done than said as the album flows so naturally that one can only wonder why he hadn\u2019t tried his hands on this kind of music earlier. One may dispute the vocal style as the man makes few compromises with his venomous shouty antics of old, but his performance only adds to the aggrandized musical setting. Some modern sterile minimalism ala \u201cRenewal\u201d (the effective creepy \u201cRuin of Life\u201d) can be still detected, but it works fine with the more energetic delivery which is just about to burst into something genuinely thrashy on \u201cPhobia\u201d. As said number is served fairly early, one may think that the suppressed thrashiness would invariably resurface in a more fulsome form later, it\u2019s Kreator, after all\u2026 no, that doesn\u2019t happen but that wouldn\u2019t be anyone\u2019s most urgent agenda as the guys take care of business by instilling the dominant semi-abrasive mid-paced stride that hypnotizes the listener who may get a bit depressed on the excellent doomy dirge \u201cBlack Sunrise\u201d where even Mille\u2019s sudden synthesized screeches work. The rest is one solid, consistent sombre shredorama that surely welcomes both more balladic digressions (the title-track) and short rowdier hymns (\u201cAgainst the Rest\u201d) the only other more overtly thrashy moment being my personal favourite \u201cWhatever It May Take\u201d, a dramatic mid-pacer with sharp cutting guitars which could have reached the final round on a \u201cCome of Souls\u201d audition even. \n\nNo, this album doesn\u2019t need hypothetical past efforts\u2019 qualifiers; it has all it needs to convince the audience that Kreator by all means have a place under the dark/gothic metal sun, and may even reach to the very upper echelons of it with time... cause back in 1997 no one knew when exactly the numetal fads would end; they could have extended all the way into the new millennium and beyond\u2026 who could foresee the evolution/devolution of the flippant, volatile music industry with terrible certainty? Why wait for the good old times to return when they may as well never return? Why not try and fit into the current environment by also preserving some of the belligerence of old? Why not look for and find this hidden more lyrical string in your soul that can also inspire you to create something worthy albeit different from anything you\u2019ve delved into earlier? \n\nYes, the 90\u2019s were times for experiments those either caused by desire for profit or by the willingness to expand one\u2019s horizons, or by the need for challenge and departure from the loathsome comfort zone. It\u2019s not very clear which cause was behind Mille\u2019s wanderings throughout the decade; what is clear is that the man did venture into several branches of the modern metal spectre, and surprisingly he never flopped along the way. He didn\u2019t quite emerge victorious from his tussles with the ruling trends, but he did stand dignified along the ones who founded those trends, marching confidently onward by never completely forgetting his roots. \n\nI\u2019m not quite sure why Mille needed this appointment with the Coroner, though; a hugely gifted axeman like Vetterli is hardly the most necessary partner for a dark gothic dance\u2026 the Swiss maestro does participate vigilantly, but needless to add his intricate pyrotechnics are nowhere to be heard\u2026 cause they simply have no place here. I prefer to view Vetterli as more of a councillor and a consultant rather than a tantamount to Mille creative force. And they even stayed together for another shredo\u2026 sorry, endorama, released two years later, would you believe\u2026 the style quite similar albeit not as potently and as confidently executed.\n\nAnd that was it, this partnership was over largely cause the time for a violent retro metal revolution had come; Mille waited patiently for this moment, keeping an eye on the winds of change, trusting that if the world didn\u2019t come to an end at the end of the old millennium, there would be only one development to ensue from mankind\u2019s second spell with life: another Renaissance, or Renewal like he likes to call it, but this time not only restricted to Italy and a few other neighbouring to it countries. A strong classic metal tsunami rose, and Kreator simply had to be one of the flagmen\u2026 the time for rowdy gothic dances was gone, Mille had to go back to his tucked-away notebooks and recall how once upon a time he was so good at making everyone crazy with his arcane extreme therapies. Pleasure to kill? Nah, more like addiction to thrash.\n",
        "\nKreator, a name any metalhead should be familiar with. Arguably the most famous of the Teutonic Big Four aside from Sodom, Kreator are a competent deathrashing force of metal. Whenever people discuss Kreator's early albums, 1986's Pleasure to Kill and 1989's Extreme Aggression seem to be at the forefront. For whatever godforsaken reason, this album usually goes unmentioned or is dismissed entirely as just \"them trying to find their sound\". While the aforementioned '86 and '89 albums are great in their own regard, this may musically be Kreator's apex. And for whatever reason my fellow deathrashers seem to ignore this album's existence aside from a few tracks. Well, I'm here to set the record straight. Endless Pain exemplifies the phrase \"Speed Kills\".\n\nAs most of you are probably familiar with Kreator already, you'll know that drummer Jurgen Ventor provided vocals on their first three releases. What is interesting about Endless Pain is that Ventor and guitar wielder/main vocalist Mille Petrozza split the songs off half and half with each other on vocals. The odd numbered tracks have Ventor on vocals and the even numbered tracks have Mille at the helm. Ventor's vocal style is more the gruff, deranged shouting associated with European thrash metal, whereas Mille's is more an inhuman raspy snarl. Many consider this record to be part of the \"First Wave of Black Metal\", and I agree. Much like Quorthon of Bathory, Mille's vocal performance on this record wouldn't sound out of place on a 90s Norwegian album. For me, he never topped this vocal performance again, not even on Pleasure to Kill (though Extreme Aggression has its moments). I would argue that this album is the perfect example of a subgenre called \"Black Thrash\". Vicious black metal vocals and Satanic imagery with fistfucking thrash riffs and drumming. This record is unmistakably produced by Horst M\u00fcller, who also produced early albums by Sodom, Hellhammer/Celtic Frost, Destruction, Running Wild, and the ever underrated Iron Angel. His production is best indicated by the absolutely titanic drum sound, a decapitating guitar tone, and a sadly near nonexistent bass sound except for the occasional thud when the solos go on (except for on Morbid Tales). To me, this is the Teutonic sound exemplified. \"Total Death\" indeed.\n\nSpeaking of which, the songs on this album are fantastic. Hot off the heels of bands like Venom as most German bands were, the lyrics on Endless Pain deal a lot with Satan and his infernal legions. For whatever reason, a lot of modern metalheads reject lyrics about the devil as being \"stupid\" or \"immature\", usually done in an attempt to not be perceived as satanists by the pseudo-Christian standards of society as if its a bad thing. I say fuck that conformist noise, these lyrics are fucking great! The songs that aren't about demons or hellfire are about violent warfare (\"Cry War\", \"Total Death) or \"the forces of metal\" (\"Flag of Hate\"). As I mentioned in the previous paragraph, the razor sharp guitar sound of this album truly helps sell the aggression of the songs. Mille's soloing on this album sounds a lot more destructive and chaotic than on later Kreator releases, and that helps the tone of this album immensely. Ventor's drumming is a relentless attack and the fact that he can belt out these lyrics so quickly while drumming that fast is insane to me. Sadly, I cannot hear Rob Fiorreti at all, but I'm sure his bass playing is alright. For my money, the absolute best track is the breakneck scorcher known as \"Bonebreaker\", though facerippers like the title track, \"Total Death\", and \"Living in Fear\" are throughout the album. Even the weaker tracks like \"Cry War\" and \"Dying Victims\" still have their moments. What really helps these songs is their lengths. They don't go overboard into the 6-7 minute category or wane into what I call \"Meandering Thrash Metal Syndrome\"(That doesn't start becoming super prevalent with bands until the late 80s). They deal out their riffs in a timely and concise manner that leaves the listener craving more and with a sore neck from headbanging too hard. And with 10 fucking tracks on the album, you've got a lot of cool riffs to listen to all in nice little song packages. Pleasure to Kill has this approach in its shorter songs, but the effect simply isn't the same (for me, at least). It may have something to do with the fact that this album is also in standard tuning, which helps with the fast, aggressive state in my opinion. Who knows.\n\nWhat can be said is that this is my personal favorite Kreator album. Top notch thrashing riffs, nuclear warfare drumming, killer vocals courtesy of both Mille and Ventor (but especially from Mille), and near perfect production make this record an absolute must for any diehard deathbanger. Along with Sodom's sepulchral Obsessed by Cruelty, Destruction's invincible Sentence of Death, and Iron Angel's steelbearing Hellish Crossfire, Endless Pain is an esssential piece of German thrash history. If you for some reason haven't listened to this album before, please do so. You'd be depriving yourself of some of the best German steel otherwise.\n\nSelling Cuts: \"Bonebreaker\", \"Total Death\", \"Living in Fear\"\n",
        "\nHow many songs do we hear during our metal fan existence? 1.000 per year on average? And how many of them keep sticking in the mind? One percent? Two, three? The older I become, the less it gets. Thus, each and every song that enters our long-term memory can be considered as something special. Based on this premise, the opening title track of \u201cHordes of Chaos\u201d is something special. I don\u2019t know whether it gets the award for the best Kreator song of the 21st century, but it makes one thing pretty clear. \u201cHordes of Chais\u201d (the tune) proves evidence that vehemence and catchiness are not mutually exclusive. Kreator, and unfortunately that\u2019s no matter of course, avoid any form of polished cheesiness, but especially the chorus with its deeply digging \u201ceveryone against everyone\u201d line develops an amazing long-term effect. The liaison of repetition and insanity, performed by Mille in top form, is mind-boggling. Kreator sound like a young entity in rage and this is the best a thrash formation can do, at least since the invention of the Araya\u2019s scream in \u201cEvil Has No Boundaries\u201d.\n\nThe killer at the beginning of Kreator\u2019s work from 2009 makes me forget the weak moments of the album. Don\u2019t worry, there are only a few number of these moments, for example the slack first tones of \u201cAmok Run\u201d (Mille\u2019s vocals fail to do the calm sequence justice) or the useless intermezzo \u201cCorpses of Liberty\u201d (is this a hidden homage to Janis Joplin, the thrash metal translation of her \u201cfreedom is just another word for nothing left to lose\u201d creed?). Furthermore, non-musical components suck. The artwork is embarrassing and stereotyped, while the lyrics hammer in my head that I will never share Mille\u2019s weltanschauung. However, the music makes up for this. In general, the dudes let steam off and they do it experienced yet energetic, technically precise yet (more or less) wild and traditionally thrashing yet fresh. The tailor-made and coherent compositions profit from a transparent, powerful sound that delivers metal, not plastic. Kreator fire some well-formed riffs into the crowd without falling victim to self-quotation. Only the beginning of the strong \u201cEscalation\u201d reminds me of \u201cNonconformist\u201d, but this is surely just a coincidence in view of the rather inconspicuous existence of this song from \u201cOutcast\u201d.\n\nIt feels good to experience that the machine-like precision of the band\u2019s performance does not lead to a sterile overall picture. Especially the racy and aggressive \u201cWar Curse\u201d, the dark \u201cAbsolute Misanthropy\u201d with its mix of furious and menacing sequences or Ventor\u2019s flattening bass drums in the chorus of the constantly growing \u201cTo the Afterborn\u201d show that Kreator haven\u2019t lost much of their former relevance. Naturally, the quartet has the typical handicap of a long-standing formation. In view of all these years they are already in business, the dudes are not able to recreate the wow effect of \u201cPleasure to Kill\u201d or \u201cFlag of Hate\u201d. But it does not matter that both the song formula and the general direction of the band are more or less well known as long as a new album holds a couple of outstanding tracks and this is exactly the case here. Okay, with regard to the technical accuracy the title \u201cHordes of Chaos\u201d might be misleading. But who cares about such details? Those of you who like to listen to non-chaotic, mature thrashers will join the \"hordes\" that already had a good time with this full-length.\n",
        "\nKreator have made a lot of dubious decisions during their career. Or was it just Mille? It doesn\u2019t matter\u2026 I know, the objective situation speaks another language, but this is my review and here I am the dictator who has the final say. I mean just think of \u201cEndorama\u201d, think of the day they took Ventor the mic away or of the crude justification why they did not give \u201cWolf Child\u201d a place on \u201cPhantom Antichrist\u201d (\u201cit did not fit the context of the album\u201d \u2013 thank God, an honourable reason. How could I be so na\u00efve to think they just wanted to make some extra bucks with the \u201cCivilization Collaps\u201d EP?). Nevertheless, I admit the band has reached a very professional level of musicality, for better or for worse. From this it follows that the dudes are able to pen and perform smooth and partly catchy songs without killing their vehemence completely. \u201cPhantom Antichrist\u201d documents this. It is no bad album, but it rather scores with non-typical elements for a thrash album. However, it is still thrash and not that overly polished, pretty meaningless kind of material they presented on their stinker from the year 2017.\n\nUnfortunately, the band has totally lost its once uncontrolled aggression. I know, no new finding, but again and again, it\u2019s sad to experience it. No, I am not still waiting for \u201cEndless Pain Part II\u201d, but a few elements of insane brutality would have been fine. The formation stays within a frame of calculated violence. It\u2019s not an overly narrow one, but it seems as if they have taken fright at their own courage. Sometimes calm sequences stop the rise of intensity and that\u2019s a pity. Solid riffs and a basic heaviness do not deserve this kind of variety and it feels good to listen to a more or less real neckbreaker like \u201cCivilization Collapse\u201d. Thank God, this song fits the context of the album and my worst fears did not come true!\n\nMoreover, the tribal drumming that opens this song also sounds the bell for the best part of the album. \u201cUnited in Hate\u201d has, despite its nonsensical title, enough fire to burn all barricades that stand in its way. The truly swift drumming drives the verses forward and the voluminous chorus delivers catchiness minus cheesy elements. A good tune; it shows that the band is still ambitious without always falling victim to pretty commercial patterns. \u201cFrom Flood to Fire\u201d represents the other side of the band\u2019s ambitions \u2013 a comparatively commercial track that wants to be moving, yet it sounds rather lachrymose. Yet I wanted to describe the best segment of the album. \u201cThe Few, the Proud, the Broken\u201d finishes this part, it offers inter alia a very strong instrumental part where the guitars mix straightness and power. Once again catchy parts show up, the main riff leads the listener to the core of the song and even Mille\u2019s wannabe-evil voice does not hurt the coherent overall picture. No doubt, this piece boasts with a very good balance between aggression and melody.\n\nNeedless to say that the sound is flawless for \u201coverground thrash\u201d. It\u2019s not too dry and not too juicy. In its best moments, \u201cPhantom Antichrist\u201d delivers a fine slap in the face of the listener due to its clearly defined, vigorous sound. On the other hand, tracks like \u201cYour Heaven, My Hell\u201d do not detonate. The pretty unmotivated chorus is going nowhere and both the silent beginning and the more powerful verses do not provide anything new. Generally speaking, the last three songs of the album do not impress with an overdose of tension, even though \u201cVictory Will Come\u201d has some mighty (yet very typical) sequences. Anyway, \u201cPhantom Antichrist\u201d can give you the impulse to bang your head and have a - partly - good time. The eighties are gone and even I-don\u2019t-listen-to-metal-when-I\u2019m-at-home dudes like Mille have the right to development. By the way, this private banishment of metal is another one of his dubious (or simply wrong) decisions.\n",
        "\nThe 1990's, a terrifying era for thrash metal because most of the bands converted to a rock/alternative sound or filler thrash. Sure, Renewal may fall victim to not being pure thrash, but it's definitely not a bad album, not at all.\n\nMy absolute favorite part of this album are the drums. They sound absolutely amazing, the snare is solid, tight, poppy, and it fills in every beat and measure greatly. You can't ever go wrong with a solid and amazing snare, absolutely beautiful. The guitars do have a thrashy sound, but rather than being used to create pure thrash riffs and songs, it's designed to have a more laid back and restricted feel, and focuses more on the pure sound rather than ability. I suppose you could call this \"industrial thrash metal\", this is Kreator's first experimental album, and thankfully it's not bad.\n\nWhen thrash bands try out new things in the 1990's it's usually a shitshow, but gladly Renewal isn't. It's far from a shitshow actually, this is truly a beautiful album and it's really overlooked and mislabelled as a \"flawed 90's 'thrash' album\". The songs display a huge array of emotion, and it really does speak to me. Whenever I'm in a sad mood, or a chilled out mood, or even when it's raining outside and it's fucking peaceful and relaxing, this album is perfect for any of those scenarios, especially the rain. Match made in heaven. The simplistic riffs do their own thing throughout the songs and the album, and the more you listen the more you'll appreciate it all. I'd say to fully appreciate and see the true beauty of this album, you have to be in the right setting or a certain state of mind. Like rain, a perfect example. It's just an album that absolutely FITS with an atmosphere like that. It's simply goregous, can't really form it into words.\n\nThe standout tracks are for sure Winter Martyrium, Renewal, Reflection, and Brainseed. Pretty much the first few songs are the best standout ones, even though every track is realistically. Winter Martyrium is a pretty flexible song, it has several different sections and it's pretty cool. It gives me happy and positive upbeat vibes and I love the drum patterns on it. Renewal is where it starts to get more emotional and where the beauty starts to stand out. The start of the song has a few hallowed strums of guitar with drums that follow, the beginning of that song makes me think of a setting where you're in a city, or a big deserted area, and it's raining and you're all alone. It just makes my head expand and think about the settings each song depicts. The main riff of the song is catchy and pleasing to the ear. Reflection sounds like you're walking in the middle of a small blizzard/snowstorm, you're going against the tough weather while the harsh snow is being blown everywhere all around you, a lengthy challenge, but it'll be all worth it at the end point. Brainseed is a pretty in-itself track, the main aspect of the song is a metallic-sounding smack/hit that's basically a beat that repeats itself over and over. It's simply catchy and it's the main hook of the song. These 4 tracks are the greatest parts and are the backbone of the album that start it off properly and in a good direction.\n\nThere may be best tracks that stand out the most compared to others, but pretty much every track has all the elements that I previously described. Every song matters, every song is cool. Nothing really fails here, the band manages to properly maintain an ongoing formula.\n\nThe tone of the guitar followed by the song structures and patterns in every song creates a little story, or experience I should say. I just think this is entertaining and catchy, I like listening to the whole album and going on a cool adventure and waiting for all my favorite parts, it's an intriguing experience that's super fun and makes me feel an array of emotions. Especially when you're in the right setting, it'll HIT THE SPOT.\n\nRenewal isn't all that bad, it's an album you have to get used to and spend time with to understand it. Is it absolutely perfect? No. Is it terrible? Not in the slightest. Every track has a personality, some may be a little lazy, but at some point in any of the songs it'll have something interesting, and that's fine. Kreator wanted to try something different, and it's not bad. Experimental doesn't ALWAYS mean bad, this is a prime example. Renewal is an acquired taste that's appreciated only by a certain amount. I love this album and I always will, definitely one of my top favorites by Kreator.\n",
        "\nRenewal is hot garbage. The few things it does right can\u2019t cover for all that it does wrong. Its reputation precedes it, like many stinker albums by bands in the \u201890s. While still thrash at heart, Kreator\u2019s circumstances during this hazy period can be summarized in a few ways: besmirched, illimitable, and experimental (words that don\u2019t necessarily imply quality). More accurately\u2026 they were high. What boundaries they pushed with their hyperactive brand of thrash up to this point were discarded in favor of influences that didn\u2019t play to the band\u2019s strengths. Instead, it played to their weaknesses.\n\nTo truly comprehend Renewal\u2019s failings, you have to look at where its ideas came from \u2013 what parents birthed this miscreant. By 1992, the conventions of thrash metal and hardcore had long been established while they bordered each other closely. They were genres that naturally mixed and grew together from distinct, separate histories. Kreator made great leaps in the \u201880s bringing an extreme edge to thrash metal. As they grew, they felt now (apparently) was the best time to heavily incorporate non-metal influences and create something different. Drawing influence from \u201880s hardcore punk and some industrial components, Kreator made the decision to go ahead despite not having a clear direction or being in the right state of mind (read: baked beyond belief). This goes beyond crossover thrash or the burgeoning metallic hardcore / metalcore movement that was growing in the early \u201890s. There were even precedents set with several industrial metal albums by this point on how to do this music correctly. Kreator, the geniuses that they were, chose to disregard all this. \n\nThe mid-paced opening to \u201cWinter Martyrium\u201d resembles Amebix, with Mille attempting to imitate the vocalist from Negative Approach. It\u2019s at this point when the album nosedives. His delivery is so atonal, clearly a stylistic choice and hindered by his heavy drug use at the time. His monotonous shouts lack the precision-like scream and spite that once made his vocals so potent and effective as part of Kreator\u2019s arsenal. They also lack reverb, sounding flat as fuck. You\u2019d think he\u2019d want to scale it back a bit, but he never shuts up. The mixing is already imbalanced by having the vocals upfront with the drums while the guitars and bass are behind them. Add the mechanical production to these problems and it makes for a lifeless listening experience. It\u2019s like the band deliberately nerfed themselves while already being gimped. \n\nThere\u2019s so much the band could have done to expand the scope of their sound, not to mention actually putting in work to make it seem like they weren\u2019t really half-assing it. Tempos are often mid-paced, pedestrian drollery with caveman style thrash / hardcore riffing demonstrating a failure to evolve their sound and instead stripping it to the most basic of writing tactics. I don\u2019t find including moody bridges (\u201cKarmic Wheel\u201d), sluggishly replicating Killing Joke (\u201cReflection\u201d), or Ministry-esque throwaways (\u201cRealit\u00e4tskontrolle\u201d) to be examples of improving freshness or (competently) doing something interesting. The album improves slightly later on with the final three songs upping the spiritedness, but by then it\u2019s too late to salvage whatever this album offers.\n\nRenewal is something I remember for its ugliness. It\u2019s not outright melodic or catchy, and suffice to say is the wrong kind of dark thematically. It failed to properly apply outside elements in meaningful ways to elevate the band. Kreator opted to lower their own standards to accommodate what they considered fresher ideas rather than incorporate them to enhance their strengths. It was still Kreator, but marked a departure that would see them go off to do what they wanted now that they were at a level where they could do so. It\u2019s too bad that whatever they tried during that time always paled in comparison to the real thing.\n",
        "\nPerhaps the only subject more interesting than headlining act making major waves while on tour is the history of the venues where this occurs, and few places inspire such inquiries to the same degree as London\u2019s The Roundhouse. Originally constructed in 1846 as a turntable engine shed for the London and Birmingham Railway, by the mid-20th century it had become an important performing arts and concert hall that would be a favorite venue for such iconic bands and artists as Pink Floyd, Jimi Hendrix, Jeff Beck, Led Zeppelin, The Ramones and Motorhead. Suffice it to say, such a location is a prime outlet for one of Germany\u2019s most ferocious purveyors of thrash metal to record their first live album following 2017\u2019s Live Antichrist release. Relative to said release, Kreator\u2019s latest foray into neck-ruining mayhem outside of the recording studio dubbed London Apocalypticon \u2013 Live At The Roundhouse ups the epic factor something fierce while sparing no expense in the aggression department.\n\nThough Kreator has had something of a competition going with Sodom over who is truly the most extreme member of the Teutonic Big Four, it\u2019s difficult to truly compare the degree of intensity on display when the former takes the stage. Bearing perhaps the greatest resemblance to Slayer\u2019s and Possessed\u2019s quasi-death metal character and arguably outshining both in terms of modernizing their sound with the advent of the new millennium, it goes without saying that the set list would prove fierce enough to blow the roof clear off the building hosting such an event. And in keeping with their largely consistent qualitative output over their near 4 decade career, this quartet makes a good show of representing every era contained in their past; from the early speed/thrashing mayhem of their seminal mid-80s studio work to their more melodic death metal-infused present day sound, taking some additional time to explore the tech thrashing days of the early 90s and the slower vibes that came in by the middle of said decade.\n\nStructurally speaking, this performance seems almost like an elaborate dinner theater event, complete with all the obligatory breaks between acts to give the audience time to recuperate and reflect upon what they\u2019ve experienced. Much of this is accomplished through the strategic use of multiple shorter instrumental intros such as \u201cThe Patriarch\u201d off of Violent Revolution and \u201cMars Mantra\u201d off Phantom Antichrist, both of which are followed by the riveting title tracks of said albums. Likewise, several moments are taken for improvised transitional material such as an extended intro to Gods Of Violence song \u201cFallen Brother\u201d where vocalist Mille Petrozza takes the opportunity to both rev up the crowd and give a shout out to the ghosts of Vinnie Paul and Dimebag Darrell, underscoring one of those spontaneous moments that is utterly impossible to fully comprehend without having been physically present, but makes a grand addition to a collection of fine performances.\n\nBut for all the interesting structural devices that have been placed into this concert to accommodate the human nature of the audience, the driving force behind this entire endeavor is a high octane array of inhuman thrash anthems to shake the pillars of the very earth itself. As with any old school thrash metal outfit, the highlights are largely relegated to the faster material of the early days in \u201cAwakening Of The Gods\u201d, \u201cFlag Of Hate\u201d and \u201cPleasure To Kill\u201d, time-warping all who hear them back to the thrash heyday of the mid-80s with the band itself sounding much clearer yet also not a day older. Nevertheless, the more musically nuanced and measured character of tech thrash throwback to Coma Of Souls in \u201cPeople Of The Lie\u201d and an array of brutal newer entries like \u201cSatan Is Real\u201d and \u201cHail To The Hordes\u201d cut with almost the same degree of fervor as the seminal anthems. Even the understated entry from the mid-90s groove/thrash era \u201cPhobia\u201d, a token live favorite of this band\u2019s from said era, makes a respectable racket and fails to drag down a highly animated performance.\n\nIt is nothing short of amazing that in spite of a long career of punishing themselves on the road and the lion\u2019s share of this fold either flirting with or surpassing the 50 year old mark, they\u2019ve sound like they haven\u2019t aged a day since Endless Pain first put the Bay Area thrash scene on notice that it had competition on the eastern side of the Atlantic. It\u2019s also a rather interesting coincidence that the very venue where this event took place was repurposed as a concert hall about the same number of years ago as the average age of this outfit\u2019s current lineup. There are no slouches to speak of here, including longtime and now former bassist Christian Giesler, who proves that a musician can spend the majority of his time in a purely support role while still being able to punch through the arrangement and make it even more massive sounding live than many bands accomplish with an array of modern studio tricks. The Roundhouse may no longer house trains, but a massive Teutonic engine just plowed its way through without the need of any laid tracks.\n\nOriginally written for Sonic Perspectives (www.sonicperspectives.com)\n",
        "\nKreator went quite some time without releasing any substantial live albums, fairly deep into their career, having already established themselves as one of the 'Big Three' of German thrash, while their two major neighbors had released Mortal Way of Live and Live Without Sense fairly early on. However, in the 21st century Mille and company have been quite active putting out such releases, from the more 'official' stuff like 2003's Live Kreation to a whole slew of limited edition, shorter live efforts that were often included with various metal magazines as exclusives. Where it counts, though, on their major live releases, like this one, they put quite a lot into the production and performance and it pays off once again with a high quality recording that spans a wide swath of their career.\n\nThis one is out in a bunch of formats, from the basic CD or download to double vinyls, multiple CD or vinyl and Blu Ray combos, the works, so Nuclear Blast is making a pretty big push for it. It's from a late 2018 performance in England, and it sounds really good, with 17 tracks ranging from classics like \"Pleasure to Kill\", \"Flag of Hate\" and \"People of the Lie\" to fare that was recent at the time for Gods of Violence touring, like \"Satan is Real\" or \"Hail to the Hordes\". Of course with such a massive range of albums to choose from as Kreator has, they're going to miss a few things here or there, with some phases neglected entirely and others over-represented, but I'd say the selection of songs here is very much killer assuming you're an older fan who has continued to follow and enjoy their material. It's also cool that you get to hear more of the intricate, melodic recent fare mixed in with the more primitive 80s thrashers from their first few releases, and it doesn't actually sound all that bad by contrast, they can build a cohesive live experience from all of this without it seeming lopsided or like they're pandering to any one component of their audience.\n\nThe drums sound loud and almost machine-like in precision, where the guitars have a satisfying crunch to them that thankfully doesn't drown out the more melodic lead-work. I'd say if there was a weaker point, maybe the bass lines don't quite thrum along potently enough to make a difference, and you'll notice, as he ages, the more flaws and imperfections in Petrozza's delivery. That's not always a bad thing, though, because he retains that barking torment he pioneered back on the older releases, but you can tell the guy doesn't always spit out everything in the exact pitch you might remember it, and sometimes seems as if he's got an amphibian caught in his throat or goes a little too atonal with particular lines, or that he's running out of breath. Still, for all that, he'll actually bark out a few more sustained snarls and shouts on some tunes that prove he's still got a lot of energy, and there is some stage banter included here which really helps stoke up the audience.\n\nIt's better to experience with the Blu Ray on than without, since they carry that one off pretty well and you'll get the kinetic elements of the performance, like background screens, pyrotechnics and audience banging heads that help smooth over some of the little quirks you'd notice in the audio only. All told, London Apocalypticon is no joke, possibly the best Kreator live stuff put to disc, and while I would personally prefer hearing more stuff (or any stuff) from albums like Coma of Souls, Terrible Certainty and Extreme Aggression, I can't really fault their choices, it pretty much all sounds good. Will this be the live album that is held up through history like Destruction or Sodom's classics that I mentioned above? Time will tell, but although Live Kreation has a fraction more vitality to the performance, I think this is a damn solid offering for fans who still support commercial live releases.\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nFor the Hordes is another CD EP included with an issue of Legacy Magazine, which seems to have cornered the market on German thrash bands putting out exclusive audio souvenirs in the last decade. There isn't a whole lot to this one, just three live tracks, and a rarer studio cut that you can only find as a bonus track elsewhere. Even the lives aren't all that exclusive, since they're part of a more substantial release coming out in 2020, so at the best this is the sort of thing you might find while perusing and think was neat if you're into the band, but the process in putting it all together didn't demand much effort and neither should anyone but the most ardent Kreator fan put any effort into tracking it down for his or her collection.\n\nNow the live songs do sound quite good here, plucked from dates in places as far abroad as Chile, the UK and the Masters of Rock festival in Czechia. Hellish, energetic and very clear sounding, they sound as aggressive as you want them to be, with \"Hordes of Chaos\" and the more melodic \"Fallen Brothers\" standouts, and then the legendary \"Flag of Hate\" finishing up the trifecta, and that one did not translate quite as well in some sections, partially because it's being broken up for crowd interface. The final track, \"Earth Under the Sword\", is actually really great, it was released as a bonus track on a bunch of versions of Gods of Violence, and even had a limited 7\" single put out with Decibel, but in my opinion it should have probably been a main track on that album, it's energetic and has a little bit of cinematic atmosphere created through some sparse orchestration which manages to help it feel urgent and powerful without intruding on the core instruments or vocals whatsoever.\n\nIf you like collecting metal magazines, this EP is a nice little nudge in the right direction, even though all of its content will inevitably be made redundant. In that regards its very similar to the Chosen by the Grace of God of EP which also featured in this magazine, just a little lighter on the actual content. I certainly don't need it or recommend it beyond its nature as a collectible, but if you hadn't heard \"Earth Under the Sword\" somehow and you want quality live recordings you could do a lot worse, and at the very least it has me psyched that London Apocalypticon - Live at the Roundhouse should prove to be a potent enough live album come Valentine's Day, when you know all you want is to thrash. Partner optional.\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nViolence Unleashed was an EP pressed in both CD and vinyl formats which was to serve as a teaser for Kreator's great Gods of Violence album, released about a month after this one. A common practice for a lot of these larger reach, multi-decade veteran acts, although I can't tell you whether or not it's a successful one these days, since everything is just accessible online and a lot of folks have abandoned collecting physical media altogether. The Jan Meininghaus illustration is pretty basic but pretty good, tying in with the full-length, and for what it's worth you're getting nearly a half hour of content...none of which is particularly exclusive to this release, which as always, when you're looking for a hot new EP of content, a total fucking bummer.\n\nYou've got \"Gods of Violence\" itself leading this off, which I've already discussed elsewhere, and then the cover of Maiden's \"Number of the Beast\", which is pretty well done, but already available on Phantom Antichrist and the original Big Teutonic 4 split. \"Wolfchild\" is the one song I was not already familiar with, and it's a decent one, sort of a brisk heavy metal joint with Mille's distinct presence and a good flow to it all, erupting into the layered harmonies the band was sweet on for their last couple albums. Apparently this tune was also on the single for \"Civilization Collapse\", but new to me and the one thing here that doesn't feel too trite. \"Iron Destiny\" is another decent song, another Phantom Antichrist bonus cut, but probably unheard by many. It's a slower to mid-paced track, also with a heavy metal foundation, not terribly memorable riffs but if you're into this more glorious era of mature Kreator I can't imagine you wouldn't like it, especially the Maiden-like bridge.\n\nLastly, some live cuts of \"Phobia\" and \"Violent Revolution\" which are pretty useless to me since I've got the version of Gods of Violence which has the bonus live CD/DVD that includes them and more. Honestly the version of \"Phobia\" is a little silly, Mille sounds like he's losing his voice for part of it. But really, these are unnecessary editions to a fairly lame release that doesn't have much reason to exist other than as a promotional tool. Had Kreator maybe included an alternate version of \"Gods of Violence\", 3-4 unreleased studio tracks and then maybe \"Wolfchild\" for good measure, this might be a thing of beauty, but as it stands I have no reason whatsoever to revisit it beyond just that one song, and it's a hollow product that nobody's ever going to revere like they used to when bands put out EPs back in the earlier metal decades, where they were pretty important releases that built up their own cult followings and were often full of great original material.\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nThe original Big Teutonic 4 split was a fairly fun idea, so why not tap that well another time? That was Nuclear Blast's thinking as they rounded up the usual suspects for another go at some rousing NWOBHM covers. This time, each of the four thrash bands is taking on a different English forerunner, with only one of those bands (Maiden) being redundant with the original split. Raven, Saxon and Tank are all getting a turn to have some of their material in the spotlight. And once again, much of the material here has also been published elsewhere, so the value you're going to get out of it is pretty limited if you're not a long-term follower/collector of the German bands. As cool as it was to hear the slightly lesser known bands like Raven and Tank done justice, I was sadly less into this split than its predecessor.\n\nKind of like Sodom's cover on the earlier split, Kreator's version of Raven's \"Lambs to the Slaughter\" is one I've already been familiar with forever, since it came out on the Out of the Dark...Into the Light EP back in the 80s, and many represses of that with the Terrible Certainty album since. Sodom's contribution of Tank's \"Don't Walk Away\" is also an oldie that has been around since the days of the Agent Orange. Both are solid versions but they don't really change up the formula all that much, maybe in Mille's case but even he is trying to emulate some of the Raven screams with mixed success. I feel that Destruction's rendition of \"Princess of the Night\" is more of the transformation you want to hear when a thrash act is covering some trad metal, but it also comes off a little goofy with all the vocals and backing vocals going over it, cluttered where the original is just so elegant, perfectly written and executed. Bringing up the rear yet again, Tankard is the one band doing something exclusive here, with yet another Maiden cover, this one a somewhat exciting romp on their eponymous \"Iron Maiden\".\n\nPart II sort of falters with the first two tracks being pretty obvious covers that aren't news to anyone, and Destruction's is once again a bonus track from various versions of Spiritual Genocide. Since these three were all pretty saturated in exposure and easy to acquire, I think this is less of a value than the first time around, which was already a debatable value. So once again, hardcore Tankard fans will benefit the most from having it. What's the most disappointing though is that the label and bands could have taken this idea and done something really special with it, like new original material...an 8 or 12 track 4-way Teutonic split with 2-3 new original cuts from each band would sell like hotcakes. But this just seems like a lazier followup to something that already generated a little cash flow and it shows in both the selection and the product.\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nNow here's an example of a split release between numerous thrash metal luminaries which, at least on the surface level, seems rather an interesting one. I agree completely with the designation of these four bands as 'The Big Teutonic 4', happy that Tankard was at last being counted among them (I'd been doing so since the 90s when it was clear they were persisting where others faltered). This was yet another CD being issued exclusively through the Legacy magazine out of Germany, but Nuclear Blast also released a version of it some months later, so...not so much. What's even more curious, is that this doesn't feature original songs, but rather covers of two titanic English bands in Iron Maiden and Mot\u00f6rhead, with two German bands taking on each of them. Unfortunately, most of these are NOT exclusive to this split, but taken from various other singles, past albums, or previously issued bonus tracks, by the respective artists.\n\nThe most obvious of these is going to be Sodom's handling of \"Iron Fist\", which we'd already heard as far back as Persecution Mania and even live on Mortal Way of Live. It's a classic, in the hands of either its originator or Tom Angelripper, and a natural cover from a band that draws so much of its own style DIRECTLY from those NWOBHM road-dogs, however at the same it was the inclusion I was least interested in, having heard it many times before. However, Destruction's cover of \"The Hammer\", which was only included with the Japanese version of Spiritual Genocide (that I had not heard), is quite nasty, Schmier plastering his version of the vocals all over the punk-fueled speed metal massacre. It's also a little messy in the right ways, not as tight as the original content those Germans were putting out, but that's fine in the context of this particular cover. Another of my favorites here is Kreator's \"Number of the Beast\", not the first time they've taken on Iron Maiden, but even though the music plays pretty close to the original, it sounds great with Mille's harsher vocals, and I loved the lead sequence. This one is also located on the later Violence Unleashed EP or the Phantom Antichrist single if you're trying to track it down elsewhere.\n\nThe thrashier version of \"The Prisoner\" that Tankard includes is also a good one, filthier guitar tone and filthier vocals via Gerre, but they still touch on some points of atmosphere that you wouldn't expect from the German drunkaholics. And as far as I know, this is the one cover that is only available on this particular split, at least for now, so if you're a Tankard collector, you've got the most motivation to snap this up. Now, if ALL of these songs were exclusives, then I'd say this was a CD or vinyl that almost anyone would want...the songs are all good, even if Sodom's contribution is a bit too redundant. And to be fair, many fans might not own most of the tunes elsewhere. It's a fun concept to round up these thrashers, legends themselves, and then watch as they don't toot their own horns, but cover even mightier legends of British heavy metal. If you can track one down, it's pretty sweet to have on your wall, even if the content isn't all that valuable. Not a necessary purchase, but neat if you've never run across these covers before. And to think, Nuke Blast and these same four bands would be doing it again in just a couple years...\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nKreator's For the Hordes is a short extended play that came along with the latest issue of German metal magazine Legacy to promote the quartet's upcoming live release London Apocalypticon - Live At The Roundhouse. \n\nThis release will feature three concerts and this extended play includes one song from each show. \"Hordes of Chaos\" convinces with its excellent mixture of aggressive riifs and melodic guitar play as well as its unchained vocal performance. \"Fallen Brother\" is a vibrant, experimental and creative homage to recently deceased rock and metal musicians and convinces with excellent crowd participation. \"Flag of Hate\" represents the band's relentless side and certainly tears heads off in concert. The three songs convince for different reasons and show the band's different facets in a way that gives the fans a good idea of the diveristy of the upcoming live release.\n\nThe final tune \"Earth Under the Sword\" is a Japanese bonus track from the last studio record Gods of Violence. Just as it was the case with \"Iron Destiny\", the Japanese bonus track from the brilliant Phantom Antichrist release, \"Earth Under the Sword\" would have deserved its righteous place on the regular studio album. The track is short, melodic and energetic and convinces with precise song writing despite slightly stereotypical lyrics. If you haven't heard the song yet, this closer alone justifies a purchase of this very good extended play.\n\nFans of old and new date can pick Kreator's For the Hordes up alike and if you are looking for more live material, the upcoming London Apocalypticon - Live At The Roundhouse should satisfy you in that regard.\n",
        "\nDon't get me wrong, this album is cool, it's awesome, it's heavy, it's one of the first albums to mix the aspiring new death metal and thrash. This album isn't BAD, but it's not flawless or \"amazing\" at all I'd say. I really do enjoy this album but at the same time I'm not that big on this at all.\n\nI absolutely adore tracks like Ripping Corpse (especially that song, it's my favorite on the album), The Pestilence, and Under the Guillotine. Mostly every song is very good and great. But my main issue is how sloppy everything is. The skank beats, pretty much alot of the drumming is half off tempo, the guitars fail to catch up with the drums at some times, and alot of the time the vocals are just shouted out randomly instead of being structured and placed accordingly throughout songs as they should be. Some people like this album mainly because it's messy. It appeals to them because it has a repentless pummeling evil sound, and I totally get that; but in my opinion I dont think it's all that great. Endless Pain actually used the \"messy\" type of shit in a good way, on that album the messy vibes feel good and it just feels right, like it should be there, where on Pleasure to Kill it feels forced and not fully processed.\n\nAside from all that which is the biggest issue for me, the songs are good. As I said before my favorite is Ripping Corpse. It has an awesome riff followed by skanks and fills on the drums, and Mille's vocals sound heavy and plain evil. So good. On the other hand, tracks towards the end of the album heavily decrease in quality. The guitars loose their heaviness and the riffs get stale, and the drums sound completely different as they did on the first half of the album. Especially the snare, oh god did the snare loose it's greatness. Makes me sad. Can't stand that soft gross snare. Those songs are just alright but not as enjoyable as the first few songs, not at all; and that's for sure.\n\nI do like this album, but I find myself not being fully pleased everytime I listen to it. I'm not a huge fan of how unorganized it is. I would enjoy it far more if it wasn't so much like the way it is. It's pretty hard to explain for me. I do love this album but I also just don't like it compared to other albums. Terrible Certainty is far more better than this. Overall this is just a good album. It's cool, but needs some fixing up.\n",
        "\nKreator's debut is pretty original and cool. This album has a rough, edged, and tough feel. Compared to other thrash albums released at the time, this one I'd say is one of the heaviest and brutalest.\n\nThe guitar work is (in a awesome way) unorganized and loose which provides a pretty cool feel overall for the listener. Thrashy and powerful yet jagged. The drums are solid, specifically the kick drum, it doesn't fail to make an appearance, you can hear every beat on every song; same thing goes for the snare. The vocals are different from the usual way Mille sounds. As I previously said, this album is pretty rough in all means, and Mille's vocals are just that. His vocals are like a mix of growling and tough screaming, that's pretty much the only way I could describe it and word it out.\n\nMy favorite track on this album is definitely Endless Pain. It has an awesome opening riff, furious drumming, and raspy vocals. The opening riff is the same riff throughout the whole song, but still I just love the riff on that and it'll always be my favorite track on the album definitely. All the other songs are good too and have the same elements as I've said above.\n\nThe guitars have one of the best tones I've ever heard when it comes to old school thrash. I don't know how exactly to explain it, but I guess I'll just say what I already said again. The guitars have a rough scratchy feel and it just sounds so damn good. If you listen you'll get exactly what I mean. Especially on tracks like Total Death the riffage just pops out at your face and never goes away.\n\nEndless Pain's main highlights are the title track, Total Death, and Flag of Hate. Those are obviously the standouts of the albums. Best riffs are on those tracks.\n",
        "\nAt first glance of the moody cover, you'd assume Extreme Aggression was a grungy or gothic affair; an album in the spirit of their 90s output, perhaps. Instead, the fourth album in Kreator's sizeable catalogue is a mature and razor-sharp thrash classic, developing the accomplished style that the band had shown glimpses of on Terrible Certainty, and for the most part closing the chapter on their proto-death metal pioneering. However, Terrible Certainty 2.0 this is not.\n\nWhat sets Extreme... apart is the quality of each passage of songwriting, and their arrangement. The songs twist, turn, stop and start, with rhythm and tempo at their mercy, whilst the jazz-like drums, chromatic guitars and rough vocals battle for your attention. They'll dive off into a pre-chorus or bridge with no warning, and will catch you out even on repeated listens. Take the title track, which is comprised of approximately 8 different sections, three of which variate as the song tears along. With wild complexity comes the opportunity for self-indulgence that might lead to a loss of effectiveness, but brevity prevents things from getting stale; the longest track on here is 5:35 (the brooding mini-epic \"Some Pain Will Last\"), and the rest of the tracks average at just under 4 minutes. Even the relatively tepid \"Bringer of Torture\" only sticks around for 2:15.\n\nProduction could easily make or break an album like this. As the 80s progressed, production jobs gradually improved anyway with access to bigger budgets and interest from high-profile producers, but there are plenty of albums that suffered between 88-90: State of Euphoria, So Far, So Good... So What?, ...And Justice For All, Practice What You Preach, to name a few. Impressively, Kreator hit the sweet spot. Each instrument is presented with an optimally dry clarity; there's no struggle distinguishing a snare hit, tremolo or yell, where earlier reverb would have bled each stem together. A pinch of reverb is reserved for the lead work, which gives the album an extra dimension where it may have lacked. Overall, this is a very refreshing listening experience, at a time when other bands seemed to be experiencing or approaching meltdowns.\n\nThe rhythm guitars, vocals and drums on Extreme... are amongst my favourite performances in the genre. Mille effortlessly lays down both precise, rapid riffs, with mosh-heavy power chords, and his gasping growls effectively flow against and with the rhythm to ensure each verse and chorus is an earworm. His leads are short but sweet, adding a melodic edge to the often dissonant riffing and further showcasing Mille's top-quality technical ability. With rhythmic and tempo shifting on a dime, Ventor flicks the drums from modest to extreme and back again, to the point where it can feel as though he is dictating things. It's not overly complicated stuff, but perfectly complements the other instruments, ensuring the drums are not simply part of the background, but actively powering the music.\n\nThe few flaws of Extreme... almost feel irrelevant when I'm assigning it such a high rating. Sure, the bass guitar isn't always audible, quietly accompanying the band much like Araya does for Slayer, but its presence is certainly felt. As mentioned above, the mediocre \"Bringer of Torture\" isn't as satisfying as the surrounding tracks, but such is the quality of those other tracks. Honestly, it's an album that will always divide opinion - it isn't as violent or cutthroat as Kreator's earlier output, and isn't as refined as the next album, and yet the formula here is one that resonates with me the most, to my surprise.\n\nMany say that, with good reason, it all came together for Kreator on Coma of Souls. It is more bombastic, straight-forward and appealing to a wider audience. To me, the polished Coma... lacks a certain edge though; Extreme Aggressions is an experience of engineered chaos unlike any thrash album I've come across.\n\nSpin To Win:\n\"No Reason To Exist\"\n\"Betrayer\"\n\"Don't Trust\"\n",
        "\nKreator once released pure brutality. Later on, they were not afraid of some more or less courageous experiments. Today they are neither overly brutal nor experimental. Their compositions ooze out maturity and experience from every pore. This is regrettable. Furthermore, they have lost their autonomy. Somebody has told them that every song must have a catchy chorus; \"Satan Is Real\" follows this order. Another guy pointed out that even the most furious song needs a melodic part; \"World War Now\", actually a strong and vehement piece, suffers exactly from its lame part. Give your German fans a candy, a third know-it-all said; lo and behold, \"Fallen Brothers\" holds some German lines (the next Wacken Open Air comes for sure). Forgive me that I am not willing to list further examples.\n\nWell, all these details are annoying, but the most irritating fact is that pretty harmless harmonies destroy the power of songs such as \"Totalitarian Terror\". Its melodic bridge is terrible. Thrash was meant to be an explosion of energy, not a kind of stop-and-go system. Yet Kreator offer a pretty polished form of mainstream metal with acoustic intros, emotional intermezzos and well-dosed parts that give the guys with a less radical music taste a reason to lend an ear to the album. Clever strategy, but not very authentic. It seems as if the business has taken control over a once independent band. I am definitely not the one who is seeing through the hype, but Kreator's tactical move is more or less obvious. Okay, Mille's slightly grim voice has never been outstanding and it also does not dominate the new songs. Instead, the mid-harsh thrashers try to combine relatively straight and fast parts with rather hymnal or less dangerous sections while the guitar work defines the compositions. The guys are good songwriters and they have a knack for effective designs, nevertheless, the majority of the songs sounds somewhat cheap. Nobody expected a new \"Flag of Hate\", but did they have to do it in such a predictable way?\n\nTalking of predictability, it goes without saying that the production is perfect or what Nuclear Blast considers as perfect. \"Gods of Violence\", the top candidate for the most vapid album title of the 21st century, sounds voluminous, clean and soulless. Every technician with dirt under the finger nails did not have access to the recording sessions. This is not \"Thrash, Altenessen\", but \"Thrash, D\u00fcsseldorf\" and you must know that D\u00fcsseldorf is a pretty chic city in Germany, not far away from Kreator's home base. A certain amount of good ideas cannot be ignored, but they are not able to shape fantastic songs, probably because Kreator, a flagship of its company, are confronted with social constraints that do not allow a really sharp and spicy thrash album. Good riffs are not missing, but they have to fight with all these lacklustre details that the band has integrated as well. So if your heart beats for slightly synthetic thrash of guys who are intelligent enough to avoid compositional hits below the belt, \"Gods of Violence\" is your album. If you do not like Maiden-esque \"Thrash\" whose commercial intention cannot be ignored, you better keep your fingers away.\n\nOriginally written for Metalegion Magazine (www.metalegion.com)\n",
        "\nThere was a time when Kreator was one of the heaviest metal band in the world, in its glorious days of Pleasure to Kill until the Extreme Aggression album. However, the early days of Kreator are quite dark and evil compared to their later stuff. They were named Tormentor for two years before changing their name to Kreator, releasing two demos, which are both low-fi quality recordings, and barely listenable. They got their record deal a little bit later than their country mates of Destruction and Sodom, but it was still ahead of its time and the debut album of Kreator also deserve the same praise. When I hear about this band, it's always about their most known songs, but we have to remember that the original version of their iconic song \"Flag of Hate\" is actually from their first album, Endless Pain. The band went into various style during their career, but let's see what this record is all about...\n\nBeing the first full-length of Kreator, released in late 1985, it was basically the perfect time to release such aggressive music. To me, \"Endless Pain\" is one pure of a thrash metal record. By pure, I mean that the other releases of Kreator such has \"Pleasure to Kill\" has some early death metal elements present on some tracks, or \"Terrible Certainty\" is more technical at some points. But \"Endless Pain\" was made with just one goal in mind; Be fast, heavy, violent and evil. This album is probably one of the best example of the sound of German thrash scene. Even if it was recorded in just ten days, the musicanship was already quite good, and the guys of Kreator were pretty much minded to make a blast with the sound of this album. There are ten songs for a running time of 38 minutes, and let me say that there are no stopping point in these songs, they are basically all the same style, except maybe some exeptions but overall, every tracks on the album are brutal as hell.\n\nWell, the album doesn't have any break actually, it starts off with the title track \"Endless Pain\", which has no introduction whatsoever, starting with a riff and Ventor's drums with the vocals kicking in. An arranged song in the classical way, but does the job very efficiently, in fact, the album doesn't feature some particular song structure as Sodom's \"Obsessed By Cruelty\" for example, as I mentioned in my last review of that record. It's kept simple, but what matters the most is the energy displayed, the young rebel spirit is definitely present, and it gives this album a certain charm. The fast-pacing guitar riffs is maintained in the following track, \"Total Death\", a highlight of this record. It's very similar to Exodus's \"Strike of the Beast\", but the catchiness and intensity of that one is impressive, its chorus hits pretty hard with the harsh vocals of Mille Petrozza. To be quite honest, one of the main reason I prefer \"Endless Pain\" over all the releases of Kreator is the sharing vocals duties between Mille and Ventor. They have a very different tone while both fitting perfectly in each song they perform. Ventor is more furious while Mille's vocals sounds more like bestial. The track listing of the album is well-arranged for that particular case too. They do the vocals each their turns through each song of the album.\n\nEven if simplicity is present, some tracks are pretty interesting though. Songs like \"Cry War\" and \"Storm of the Beast\" are a little different with their more mid-paced tempo verse. To me, it adds some variety to the album, both these songs start a little more slowly, but reach the top speed we all like pretty quickly. Otherwise, we have of course some speed metal structured tracks such as the iconic \"Flag of Hate\", \"Bonebreaker\" and \"Son of Evil\". They are similar on a certain level, but each also brings something different too. The beat is really easy to follow and to thrash as well. The brutality of Kreator's debut doesn't end here though because some forgotten tracks like \"Dying Victims\" and \"Living in Fear\" are among the most violent songs of their whole catalog. Being signed to Noise Records, the band had the chance to release an already good quality release, as the production of Endless Pain is pretty good for a debut album. The instruments are well mixed, except maybe the bass, which is pretty much buried to a certain degree, a fact that does not really surprise me as a 80s thrash metal listener.\n\nAs many other 80s extreme metal bands of that time, Kreator, or as Tormentor before, flirted for a short period of time with the occult and evil stuff. That makes this album the only one to have such lyrical concept, as some material on Endless Pain was composed during the Tormentor days. However, they quickly dropped off for a more violent attitude soon after. Overall, this album is to me very underrated and hidden because of the success of their later releases mentioned earlier in this review. It is also one of my most recommendable album from the German thrash scene, people who like bands like Sodom, Destruction, Deathrow or Darkness will praise this album.\n\nFavorite tracks: (Hard choices)\n\nBonebreaker\nDying Victims\nFlag of Hate\nLiving in Fear\nSon of Evil\n",
        "\nFor a band calling themselves Kreator, it seems rather puzzling that the German thrashers would release an album named Enemy of God, since surely most kinds of creator we think about are linked to the concept of deities. That said, this is also a band who entitled an album Phantom Antichrist, so perhaps it\u2019s just a matter of what name they thought was cool at the time, rather than any strict philosophical reason. In any case, when I was in my late teens, I really loved the songs I heard from this record, favouring them to the deranged speed and screeching heaviness of that other Kreator album, partly because I thought there was nothing cooler than shouting (or pretending to shout) \u201cUnder a total blackened sky\u201d while it was raining on my way to school. That\u2019s not exactly the best way to analyze the music on offer here, though I think it captures some of the appeal of post-millennial Kreator.\n\nAll of the band\u2019s work since Violent Revolution has featured the same shout-happy sloganeering (Mille Petroza picks a title because he wants to repeat it, not as a summary of the other lyrics) and scrambling, thrash-meets-modernity riffing that lit a fire under my skinny 18 year old arse and can still do so for my less skinny backside in my office era. What I guess Enemy of God does right (in the eyes of Kreator fans) is play fairly quickly and with little obvious melody, chucking down riffs in every song and sticking to \u201csafe\u201d subjects, which \u2013 just for the record \u2013 means war, terrorism, religious dissent\u2026you get the idea. All of this means that for skinny me, who was too poor to buy the whole album, I had the impression that this was a great release, since you can pick just about any track and be treated to similar smoothed out thrashy riffage with hints of melodeath and metalcore offering assistance in the playing styles and production, plus solos that either scream out or moan melodically across the sound. However, when I listen to the whole thing, I find that this is a questionably long album with 12 songs that fall into a slightly samey pocket of high-impact yet medium-intensity metal.\n\nIt\u2019s been discussed before, but the guitar tone is not exactly biting on Enemy of God, bouncing around on a lot of palm-muting and only slashing into the listener\u2019s ears at moments on the title track and \u2018Suicide Terrorist\u2019. The drums are crisp and well-executed but don\u2019t quite bring the aggression and acceleration required to transmit everything from pace and groove into excitement and hookiness; meanwhile, the bass of Christian Giesler wanders around in the mix, popping up occasionally to introduce \u2018Voices of the Dead\u2019 and fatten up some of the mid-paced riffs. This means that Petrozza\u2019s savage vocals are left in rather an awkward position, since he sounds suitably incensed, yet the groove of the melodic guitars in \u2018Murder Fantasies\u2019 doesn\u2019t exactly bring credence to words like \u201cI want to kill you / Your death I want to feel\u201d. On the other hand, when the subject changes for \u2018The Ancient Plague\u2019, the reverb and melodies form a more intricate picture, though it would have been nice to see more balanced subjects chosen or music made that fitted the lyrical ideas a little better.\n\nI don\u2019t have particular problems with the style of the songs either, but Kreator certainly did a better job of editing the compositions down on the following Hordes of Chaos, since there are too many songs here, some of which tread familiar ground or merely earn their place by being decent rather than necessary. There are some fairly boring ideas used in \u2018Impossible Brutality\u2019 (which is not nearly as brutal as one might hope) and \u2018Dystopia\u2019, though little experimentation with song structure neuters some of the faster bridges in songs such as \u2018When Death Takes Its Dominion\u2019, seeing as we are waiting for the moment when it kicks on, having learned from the other songs that it would. The middle section of the album introduces a lot of melody compared to most Teutonic thrash, with \u2018Voices of the Dead\u2019 probably taking the gentlest route, while the softness of \u2018Dystopia\u2019 is problematic when coupled with the slowness of its chorus. \u2018Dying Race Apocalypse\u2019 proves a late album nadir of washed out melody and lacking ideas before the last two songs pick up again.\n\nThe critique of some of its songs doesn\u2019t preclude Enemy of God from being an enjoyable album at least in part, especially as \u2018Suicide Terrorist\u2019 and \u2018Under a Total Blackened Sky\u2019 are fully worthy of being shouted outside in the rain, the former taking an approach of direct attack while the latter adds some melody and churning atmosphere into the equation. The strong title track and different closer \u2018The Ancient Plague\u2019 also prove highlights in a decent showing, though it would be a much stronger album after some serious trimming. This is not the best of recent Kreator, though it is certainly a good example of their output this century.\n",
        "\nKreator lived in 1990 one of their most splendid, wild and authentic moments. The extreme scene had seen the teutonic band grow, and now, entering on last decade of 20th century, the thrash world was giving its last throes, before becoming extinct as we knew it, and then mutating. Discs like \"Seasons in the Abyss\" by Slayer, \"Rust in Peace\" by Megadeth or \"Persistence of Time\" by Anthrax, all they closed the genre as if it were a kind of testament of an era, and Mille's warriors were not stay behind. Kreator were going to deliver a record at the height of biggest ever.\n\nFor me, one of the keys to this final result is Frank Blackfire. The ex-Sodom is one of the best thrash guitarists and he does an enormous job. He came from recording with Sodom, Agent Orange, a true thrash classic, and Kreator did snatch it from Sodom. Blackfire marks the road with his riffs and solos, both powerful and technical as hell. It may be Kreator's best album along with their firsts two and of course, their last great work which is an improvement in comparison with previous two. The best thing about Kreator is their beginnings, then when we got involved in the 90's we notice that they lost the north. I also like the lyrics, they're pretty committed; the first song, for example, talks about global warming. Great riffs, full of claws, with those accelerations in drums according to Blackfire's varying riffs, virtuoso and technical as always. Another curious thing is the opener which has an acoustic intro, perhaps inspired by the intro of Battery or Moonchild, both great openers from others legend albums.\n\nThe album contains a very melodic riffing; at least for their style it begins to cook, but hey, false alarm, in a few seconds you'll discover that the thing was a cool intro and then, it moves on to a devastating killer lead. Furious riffing, an ardent Petrozza as always; a Frank \"Blackfire\" which debuts on a disc with a high note; and a magic \"Ventor\", fast and with a so overwhelming technique. Songs with lots of aura like their two previous works, but with a novel touch. Kreator did mature, yes, but they're still murderers, children of a bad mother. A huge magnum opus, which unfortunately closed the most glorious cycle of the band. Mille Petrozza has always known how to produce masterpieces of an indisputable quality (even the most discussed and vilified ones), but his band never sounded as devastating as in 1990-1991 despite continuing today to a level that few ones have. Few, just not to mention almost any.\n\nI don't get it... what would I do, if I don't have this cute disc under my pillow.\n",
        "\nAnd it was, I guess, to some extent, some 30 years back when it made us, the youthful, swallowing anything that came and went, metalheads mosh around like crazy cause this was, and still is, one hell of a headbanging, albeit pretty rough-around-the-edges and one-dimensional, barrage. I have to admit I wasn't into thrash at all when the album came out, but I was carried away by those around me who were playing it incessantly, bemused by this primal ball of aggression. And, if you think of it, what more did we want, a bunch of angry, belligerent teenagers; this was the perfect fodder for us to jump, and shout, and scream at whoever cared, and at the world in general\u2026\n\nCause this is what this album provides exclusively, an entertainment for the less pretentious part of the fanbase, and this is where we largely were in the mid-80\u2019s, ready to devour anything that had \u201ckill\u201d, or \u201cblood\u201d, or \u201cviolence\u201d in the album-title. Kreator were up there to satisfy that need, but it was good that they managed to outgrow their early hysterical, over-the-top feats otherwise we wouldn\u2019t have had masterpieces like \u201cExtreme Aggression\u201d and \u201cComa of Souls\u201d later.\n\n\u201cEndless Pain\u201d was a fairly decent debut, the guys not having realized yet that they could bash with the utmost intensity and get away with it, and it seemed as though they would eventually learn to play their instruments with the requisite proficiency at a later stage. Well, this process was slowed down by the album reviewed here as the band suddenly wanted to show to the audience worldwide that Germany got extreme talent. And it did, truth be told, in spades at that; just listen to the unbridled ball of fury that the opening \u201cRipping Corpse\u201d is, and cringe with fear and also involuntary waves of pleasure. Cause it does sound like a forbidden fruit, this overt extremity although in terms of novelty it couldn\u2019t have possibly scored very high provided that Sacrifice and Possessed already started traversing more brutal, not yet fully mapped, territories a year earlier, not to mention the dozens of demos setting the underground on fire at around the same time. Brutality-wise it was all right for sure, no second opinion about that, although it couldn\u2019t quite rank with the blasting outrage that was Sarcofago\u2019s \u201cINRI\u201d , or with the intimidating piece of \"death and darkness\" that was Messiah's \"Hymns to Abramelin\" (both 1986); and the musical professionalism again on display was certainly debatable compared to the more expertly executed same year\u2019s efforts of Slayer and Dark Angel. \n\nRegardless, its raw, albeit considerably faded, charm is still here, and I couldn\u2019t help but nod approvingly the other day, listening to the visceral, venomous vocals of Mille soaring with all the spite the man could muster over this impenetrable wall of sound, this relentless bashing melee from which I totally dig the stomping break on the title-track; the clever melodic hooks on \u201cRiot of Violence\u201d; the more serious riff knots tied in the middle of \u201cThe Pestilence\u201d, the first signs that the band should be able to reach loftier musical dimensions; and the unrestrained proto-deathy vigour of \u201cCommand of the Blade\u201d and \u201cUnder the Guillotine\u201d, the latter the only song from here that I listen to on regular basis, a massive piece of evil bashing extremity which has sent me multiple times in front of the door of the noisy neighbour upstairs with a hammer, eventually a knife, in hand\u2026 (un)fortunately, no casualties yet, also thanks to my wife\u2019s timely interferences. The next time he bothers me I\u2019ll punish him by making him listen to the entire album here (he\u2019s not a metalhead) \u2026\n\nBash, bash, bash\u2026 good vigorous stuff all around although it\u2019s by no means as amateurish as the early Sodom efforts which some \u201ccritics\u201d have tried to bind, the debut included, with. The guys were definitely getting somewhere, and once having dealt with all this anger and frustration within them, the only way was up with every subsequent album moving up the proficiency scale, the culmination achieved on the glorious \u201cComa of Souls\u201d. So as a ventilation effort \u201cPleasure to Kill\u201d fulfilled its role on all counts, and is still regarded as the band\u2019s most popular release. I seldom recommend it to the novices as a first acquaintance to the Kreator outcast... sorry, output, though, as this wouldn\u2019t be fair to the guys\u2019 superior recordings; and I by no means want to feed the young budding fans with visions of blood spattered guillotines, raised flags of hate, and riots of violence\u2026 or do I?\n",
        "\nI remember getting this album quite a while ago, not long after it came out, and looking through the reviews for it on Amazon. It was just before I started reviewing on this website, but even then I remember thinking that it was bizarre to have around 15 five star reviews for a good though not sensational release, alongside absolutely zero negative or mixed ratings. Granted, I guess it would be mostly excited fans who were tempted to post their feelings on Amazon, though I felt that it was necessary for me to add a note of moderation and gave it a more cautious four star rating.\n\nThe funny thing is that now I can totally understand why so many people freaked out and praised the ass off Phantom Antichrist, because there are some songs here that genuinely make me go nuts as well and want to scream \u201cKreat-ooooooooooooorrrrr!!!\u201d like Mille Petrozza from the bus stop or out the window of my apartment. However, there are also moments when I am underwhelmed by the experience and would probably sit down on the bus stop bench or close my window due to a sudden loss of energy. There are a lot of arguments in a song like 'Civilization Collapse' or 'Death to the World' about why metal is such a potent force and complete trap for its disciples: Kreator have always done a fine vein in raging fury and rollicking speed, not to mention some wicked riffing that wouldn't be out of place soundtracking heavy duty farm equipment, such is the power and brute force with which it arrives. This isn't a claim about thrash metal in general, since I'm not always too fond of our Slayers and Exoduses, but the momentum that these guys get into when they play their way through the fast numbers is irresistible, never allowing the listener to stay still as 'Phantom Antichrist' blasts into action and smashes through its first chorus without halting - the superb title track is exactly what I'm talking about.\n\nWhat marked a lot of those Amazon reviews that I saw back in 2012 (barring blind excitement) was the use of the phrase \"more melodic\", which reflects the tendency of Kreator to play guitars with a lighter touch at times in the last 10 years, as well as some slower and more considered sections that would have been unthinkable in the '80s. I don't have any issue with the band offering melodic juice to the parched wasteland of riffs and beats, though I think no one would deny that Petrozza and his gang have always been at their best when laying down the law in vicious style. Aside from the \"more melodic, more considered\" comment, it is also noticeable that this album has riffs on songs such as 'From Flood into Fire' and 'The Few, the Proud, the Broken' that are quite bouncy and groovy compared to the normal expectations of German thrash, leading a few to point the commercial finger at this album. I think that the style at these moments is certainly catchier and more accessible than one may have expected, though it doesn't differ too far from the formula that Sodom or Testament adopted in the new millennium, sacrificing a few knots of pace for greater memorability. What disappoints ever so slightly about the ploy is that the accessible elements are not completely integrated into the general listen, standing out quite clearly by the pace of those two mentioned tracks and the deliberate return to the main riffs, although there are melodic tricks used to make 'Victory Will Come' and 'United in Hate' (not as hateful as one might hope) stick in the mind for longer.\n\nThere are several moments as well when the Germans seem to come to a forking of the paths, when they could decide to put their feet to the floor and power onwards into a more intense verse yet actually hold back and take things down a notch. Many of these instances occur after the second chorus (the structures are slightly predictable), as often as not allowing the solo or bridge to provide a rest in the action, such as the end of hostilities in the delicate lead of 'Death to the World', which feels like a copout compared to the great main riff that surges forwards on the back of the other two choruses. The only time when the band really go nuts in the bridge is on the title track, the \"Terror from the left, terror from the right\" segment of which has entered my mind at inopportune moments during the last five years, usually when I'm very excited indeed.\n\nAs such, I'm slightly disappointed that an album with such a promising title and cover didn't yield more savage results, though the moments that really hit are not to be sniffed at. I have a personal problem, however, as far as 'Your Heaven, My Hell' is concerned, since the clean opening doesn't suit the band very well, nor do the riffs offer anything attractive. The issue with softer verses returns with the closing 'Until Our Paths Cross Again', though I must say they are better done and have better backing, as well as a splash of genuine atmosphere. Having just nine complete songs was a good idea, certainly when compared to the recent Gods of Violence, which overdosed rather on length, whereas this is satisfying rather than bloated, totalling a moderate 45 minutes. Overall, Phantom Antichrist is nothing to be sniffed at unless you detest the idea of ruthless speed and well-worked melodic lead playing sitting side by side with a few gentler (though still metal) bits and pieces. This phantom is still very much alive and kicking.\n",
        "\n''Live Antichrist'' is a free live album by German thrash metal quartet Kreator. It consists of ten unreleased live tracks recorded during different shows in the past few years. The album was released with an issue of the German Metal Hammer magazine. \n\nThe different tracks have a solid production that sounds raw and unpolished but also manages to showcase the band's great musicianship. Especially Sami Yli-Sirni\u00f6's guitar leads and solos really stand out in concert. Rhythm guitars and drums also sound powerful enough to convince. On the other side, the vocals are sometimes out of breath and rhythm and sound a little bit too dominant in the mix. The bass guitar could have been a little bit more present on the other hand but I have heard worse.\n\nThe track list is quite interesting as it features new tracks from the more melodic Phantom Antichrist as well as the brutal Enemy of God records, forgotten pearls from the band's experimental years with albums such as Renewal and Outcast and one classic track from the early release Pleasure to Kill. To my surprise, the harsher tracks are less convincing as they all sound quite similar and are mostly fast-paced and one-dimensional. The vocals often can't follow the fast instrumentation which makes these songs sound even more chaotic than usually. The more melodic tunes from the experimental years have some more punch in concert and offer very interesting listening experiences that will please both to the band's more traditional fans that might rediscover these tracks and those who liked the band's shift in style during the nineties. The tracks from the last studio record blend in very well and offer a welcome mixture between melodic heavy metal influences and rhythmic thrash metal parts. \n\nDespite having a great track list that gives potential new fans a very good idea of Kreator's discography, the order of the different tunes isn't very well chosen in my opinion. The record kicks off without any introduction in form of the chaotic ''Enemy of God'' which might be the worst track on here. In the middle of the album, we suddenly get to hear the instrumental ''Mars Mantra'' followed by the vivid ''Phantom Antichrist''. These two songs should have kicked this release off instead of ''Enemy of God''. Closing the record with ''Civilisation Collapse'' is also quite weird as a vivid and fast-paced thrash metal track like ''Pleasure to Kill'' or ''Suicide Terrorist'' would have been more suitable to end this release with a violent bang.\n\nDue to the fact that these tracks are taken from different live shows, the ten tracks don't really build up a coherent and fluid atmosphere. In fact, communications with the live crowds in some songs are done in German while others are suddenly in English which makes the listening experience oddly confusing. Some tracks also have fade-outs instead of offering organic transitions to the next songs.\n\nWhile Kreator has released much better live albums, ''Live Antichrist'' is good for what it is as free gift of a metal magazine. It's not essential to own this record for occasional listeners or faithful fans who already own live albums such as ''Dying Alive'', ''Terror Prevails'' or the limited edition of ''Gods of Violence'' that includes the band's entire 2014 Wacken performance. This record is only interesting for new fans who want to discover Kreator's different soundscapes in live form for free as well as for avid collectors who would buy anything this band releases.\n",
        "\n\"Violence Unleashed\" is a nice EP and collector's item that promotes Kreator's upcoming \"Gods of Violence\" release. This release is available with the highly recommendable 01-2017 edition of the German Legacy magazine. The first song is the title track from the upcoming album. The next three songs are rare tracks recorded during or shortly after the sessions for the great melodic thrash metal milestone \"Phantom Antichrist\". The last two songs on this output were recorded at Wacken Open Air in 2014 and will be included on the bonus CD/DVD/BluRay of the upcoming record.\n\nThe new track starts surprisingly smoothly with harmonious acoustic guitar melodies and dreamy Asian folk elements that develop an appeasing yet mysterious candlelight atmosphere. After about one minute, the track becomes an epic heavy metal anthem for about thirty seconds before the band speeds things up and delivers a great melodic thrash metal anthem in the key of the last studio album. The song perfectly captures Kreator's more melodic thrash metal of the past few years and is one of the very best tracks of this kind. It combines typical elements of the genre veterans with a few fresh ideas and a powerful production.\n\nThe most interesting parts about this release are obviously the rare tracks. My personal highlight is the ferocious yet melodic anthem \"Iron Destiny\" that perfectly captures the anticonformist spirit of the band and of the metal scene as a whole. This unknown and underrated song is one of the very best in Kretaor's extensive career in my opinion.\n\nThe slightly edited live tracks have been recorded authentically and sound so straight that you feel as if you were standing in front of a stage during one of the band's energetic live shows. The two cuts chosen for this release seem to indicate what could be Kreator's very best live release in my opinion. Especially the unchained mixture of anger, melody and speed in the frantic band anthem \"Violent Revolution\" sounds better than ever and represents what Kreator stands for.\n\nTo keep it short, this EP is worth its reasonable price; especially since it comes along with another compilation and an entire great magazine. Faithful fans will get an excellent new track. Occasional fans will get an excellent idea of what the band sounds like nowadays. New fans will discover everything that represents one of the most rebellious thrash metal bands around the world. Go grab this beautiful gem, crank up the volume and be prepared for total destruction.\n",
        "\nThe beginning of 2017 is starting to look a lot like the last few years in heavy metal, lots of bands releasing new albums, but not just run of the mill, let\u2019s do another record, these bands are releasing albums of their careers. A lot of these bands are beyond their zenith, but are now enjoying life beyond the huge arse fucking that the major labels dealt them, they have their own creative control and this is one of the reasons why we have seen such an influx in well above par records in recent years.\n\nThis time it is Teutonic thrash metal legends, Kreator, to take centre stage with their latest release, 'Gods of Violence'. Debatably, the German thrash metal movement is considerably more brutal than its Transatlantic counterparts with Kreator always being in the forefront, standing alongside the equally brutal Destruction and Sodom. Just like many bands, Kreator may have strayed from their thrash metal roots in the 90\u2019s and experimented with a more Industrial sound, but since the turn of the millennium, Kreator re-embraced their original sound with a more mature and experienced vision.\n\nIn true heavy metal fashion, 'Gods of Violence' begins with an introductory instrumental, the marching 'Apocalypticon' before bull-rushing into the formidable 'World War Now'. In fact, formidable is a great way to describe the entire of 'Gods of Violence', the song-writing, craftsmanship and musicianship is top notch and Mille Petrozza sounds as fresh as he has ever been with his voice substantially better than in his younger days. How do you push beyond 'World War Now'? It is obvious to Kreator, with the superb 'Satan is Real' with its simple droning, almost chant like chorus that will get stuck in your head.\n\nEach song on 'Gods of Violence' bats back and forth, easily memorable and enjoyable barring the rather unnecessary 'Lion with Eagle Wings'. The title track itself begins with an acoustic fingerpicking that is reminiscent of Metallica\u2019s 'Fade to Black' at times before ploughing at break neck speed into the fist in air simple chant of \u201cWe shall kill!\u201d. In fact, that could sum up 'Gods of Violence', each song relies on that one little hook, that one little niggle that once it gets in, it has you and before you know it, you\u2019ll have 'Gods of Violence' on repeat.\n\nKreator have never been a band to shy away from tough lyrical subjects and even taboo in some parts of the world. 'Side by Side' challenges homophobia, not just in heavy metal, but in the world and for those nay-sayers in the world who say that heavy metal doesn\u2019t write beautiful songs, then this is an example of how the heavy metal world supports people no matter their race, colour, creed or sexuality. A simple reminder if you ever needed one that heavy metal has no boundaries. 'Gods of Violence' also gives a beautiful eulogy to the late Cliff Burton, as well as the sheer amount of musicians and fans of the genre who are no longer with us through 'Fallen Brother'.\n\nWith 'Gods of Violence', Kreator have delivered an album of high quality and is definitely a must add addition to any thrash metal fans catalogue. It is still early in the year, but it is doubtful that any thrash metal album will top this in 2017, 'Gods of Violence' is fun, it is memorable and above all, it makes you want to play it over and over again.\n",
        "\nKreator's post-experimental run of albums, while marginally divisive among their older fanbase, should be respected from more than a few points of view. Primarily, Mille and crew have done a great job at maintaining their indignant, rotten core while updating their sound to appeal to a more contemporary crowd. This manifests itself in the form of what many like to label as melodic thrash metal, but to be frank the band sounds closer to exceptionally riff-centric melodeath most of the time. Sami Yli-Sirni\u00f6's Finnish roots are clearly a source of much of this, and with Gods of Violence, the band fully embraces their more melodic side, reaping the most returns since Coma of Souls, even if some old school thrashers will call betrayal on much of this material. Although the band has been accused of sleepwalking through the last few years (Phantom Antichrist felt extremely redundant and lacking in flair) - I personally feel that Kreator has stoked the flames of discontent with this album in a manner worthy of nearly-grand praise.\n\nIrregardless of melodic aptitude, Gods of Violence is not without its own combustible armament of solid thrash riffing to link the chains in an endearingly punishing manner while Sami inveigles and obfuscates with his concurrently focused and madcap lead work. One of the more distinctive riffs has to be the verse number on the title track, which sounds like a fusion between Kalmah and perhaps Amon Amarth. The concussive din of the rhythm riffs helps keep the album sounding just as \"Kreator\" as anything released in the last decade and a half. To be honest, there is very little to complain about regarding track selection, a profound plus because the band has been guilty of stuffing recent releases with interchangeable filler - especially on albums like Enemy of God. \"World War Now\" opens with a petulant barrage offset by open chugging on the verses - all pretty standard for the band. The epic lead break around the two minute mark is where the album truly begins to show its colors, being one of many triumphant fist-raising sections that should really bring the house down in the live arena. Killer.\n\nFurther down in the tracklist, \"Hail to the Hordes\" downshifts a bit to cultivate a concrete-cracking mid-paced gait, providing a menacing contrast to the higher speed that dominates much of the remainder. \"Lion with Eagle Wings\" is another standout, featuring the now-familiar atmospheric buildup, and great tremolo work firing off during the verses. But my favourite cut here has to be \"Totalitarian Terror,\" which is a grinding speeder inundated with strikingly memorable leads and the best solo on the album. It simply sounds so focused and wastes virtually no time wallowing in pretense or feigning aggression - and it definitely shows. \n\nWhile most of us have experienced familiar sequences before, Gods of Violence really nails that easy-to-embrace epic feel without feeling corny or forced. It's like a big blockbuster action movie that while you can openly admit is kind of transparent and daft at times, gives you the douche-chills during the climax. Even the production values feel well-suited, with a voluminous, yet raw guitar tone and airtight pop to the percussion. In conclusion, Kreator have delivered a racing, ripping modern monument that slaughters most upstart bands at their own game. I expect many to throw this one to the wolves and write it off as Wacken-ready mainstream fodder, but Gods of Violence will still enjoy praise many years down the road, I think.\n",
        "\nYou've got to love how the metal press, particularly the metal press in Europe, finds a way to keep its subscriptions afloat in the digital age, and I think a key element of that is the inclusion of special live or unreleased material from popular bands that attract collectors. Germans Kreator have taken advantage of this exposure numerous times, especially in their homeland, recently with their Violence Unleashed EP in Legacy, Live Antichrist album in Metal Hammer, and now another bonus vignette in Rock Hard, who they've teamed up with before for the Terror Prevails live album in 2010. This time, however, they've got New York's Overkill on board, and both are offering something we might not have heard before. Is that enough to pick up (or import) a copy of the Rock Hard #358?\n\nOverkill are no stranger to paying homage to their influences, what with their decent 1999 release Coverkill and various tunes added to other releases, like their rendition of Edgar Winter's \"Frankenstein\" on Horrorscope, or more recently Thin Lizzy's \"Emerald\" on The Grinding Wheel. That said, I can't recall hearing them perform a country cover, and what's more, playing the song IN that style, rather than metalizing it. And so they have done here with Johnny Cash's \"Man in Black\", spun out with Bobby Ellsworth's unhinged screams in a duet with more a straightforward voice. The lyrics aside, this has never been one of my favorite Cash tracks, and so I can't say I was thoroughly impressed by the band playing it close to the original, when a heavier injection might have at least proven interesting, but overall it's a passable version and it's nice to hear Blitz at least try to apply his own distinctness to a pretty mundane musical exercise.\n\nI was far more interested to hear \"Warrior Heart\", a new Kreator track with a driving melodic death metal feel to it that would not have been out of place on the recent Gods of Violence, or perhaps on some comparable excursions like 2001' Violent Revolution. Granted, there's nothing exceptional here either, and you feel like you've encountered the melodies before across a number of Swedish bands, but it's wholly competent and never a detriment to hear Mille's voice grating over the grace of those airier harmonies, or the straight heavy metal thrust of the bridge and its substantial leads. So this is the side of the split which ended up appealing to me a lot more, it's at least on par with some of the other recent tracks and one could get some value out of ripping an .mp3 of it and tossing it on his or her Gods of Violence playlist.\n\nOverall, it's a decent gimmick that rewards the integral symbiosis of musicians and press, even if the content is rather scant and not all that great. Nothing on the level of Sabbat's brilliant \"Blood for the Blood God\" flexi in that old issue of White Dwarf, but Rock Hard isn't leaving you with nothing.\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nMy dear friends, get your silk underpants, your frilled shirt or your velvet pyjama, here comes \"Endorama\", the fluffy Mille work from the year 1999, Kreator's gift for the girls' boarding school, the pink sheep of the Petrozza family. No doubt, this is the totally credible album of a thrash legend that intends to bring its real soul to life while being absolutely not interested in making money. Don't be confused by the kitschy artwork or the crude group picture in the booklet! However, it's the music which counts. With that said, let's try to judge \"Endorama\" unbiasedly.\n\nI am not going to mince matters: the frequent use of the synthesizers is irritating, the relatively emotional singing of Mister Petrozza poses a riddle as well. Inter alia due to the pretty edgeless mix, the opener, usually a more or less representative track for an album, cannot hide its pop appeal. The following title track reminds faintly of the gothic sluts called Sisters of Mercy, but I am no expert for this kind of pretty polished music. Yet the involvement of the jester of Lacrimosa is really annoying and even inexperienced listeners understand pretty quickly that the four-piece has put an eye on catchy choruses while keeping the level of harshness under close control. Relatively speedy and straight parts like the verses of \"Shadowland\" also show up occasionally, but they do not characterize the album.\n\nYet despite my contempt for comparatively harmless sounds and the collaboration with dark wave nutcases, I must admit that some of the here gathered songs cannot be blamed for being shitty, insubstantial or half-baked. Okay, \"Chosen Few\" is a mild fart where Mille sounds like a narcissistic storyteller. In Germany we would call him a \"M\u00e4rchenonkel\", but I fear the word \"fairytale-uncle\" does not exist in the English language. These inconsistencies aside, let's have a look at \"Everlasting Flame\". The musical content of this piece - please note the dreamful string instruments - is as kitschy as its title. If they had shortened it to three and a half minute, the song would have been perfect for the European Song Contest. To be more precise: it would have been perfect for the 21st position of the final ranking. Yet \"Last Passage to Babylon\" with its sharp contrast between the tranquil verses (Mille whispers moronic promises) and the explosive bridge (Mille spits fire) leads to a dynamic overall impression. This is really a good song, even if it also houses some superfluous synth gimmicks.\n\nThe emotional piano intermezzo \"Entry\" and the comparatively harsh \"Soul Erazor\" try to provide a similar contrast, but this combination does not work. Aggravating this situation, the entire second half of the album suffers from a serious problem. The melodies are less expressive. Regardless of whether one listens to \"Future King\" or \"Willing Spirit\", the songs are flat, without aggression, kind and banal. Not to mention the gruesome lyrics with lines like \"So I wait as I watch the stars, I feel you're near but you're yet too far\". Shit happens, my little star child. However, the more the full-length progresses, the more it becomes clear that this is a painfully trivial work, released by a quartet of business partners that tramples down its integrity. Make love with a pink sheep, if you like, but such a creature is not my preferred sex partner.\n",
        "\nPlease ignore the ugly nudist on the cover, \"Outcast\" does not deserve to be overlooked only because of its shitty artwork. Kreator's album from 1997 cannot be compared with the formation's famous works such as the first two full-lengths, yet it exudes its own, more or less seductive aroma. The band relies on a simple recipe, but it has enabled them to pen an interesting album. All songs are reduced to the essentials, all are based on almost primitive, conventional patterns and the band cannot be blamed for neglecting catchy elements. This compositional approach means that everything depends on the quality of the riffs. No need for concern, they are mostly brilliant.\n\nWith nearly primitive yet intelligently used means, Kreator deliver hit after hit. Yes, there are two downers that lack of heaviness, belligerence and wickedness. The slack \"Black Sunrise\" with its painfully gothic verses and the aimlessly meandering, a little bit lacklustre title track form the cancer in the body of \"Outcast\". Fortunately, it is a good-natured ulcer that does not seriously endanger the healthy appearance of the album. Too many great tracks hit the nail on the head. Their riffs are highly efficient, the omnipresent mid-tempo rhythms are no challenge for Ventor, but they give the guitars room to develop their full force and a certain negativity builds the fundament of the songs. This is another kind of demarcation from the lukewarm mainstream, not comparable with that nearly absurd stubbornness which formed the main pillar of \"Endless Pain\" or \"Pleasure to Kill\". Yet it is a demarcation. Commercially motivated albums sound different.\n\n\"Leave this World Behind\" constitutes an almost programmatic opener, because the album is truly able to offer the audience another universe. Its cold atmosphere, the consistent renunciation of any kind of bombastic, light and needless elements as well as the nearly unvarying level of harshness create a closed unit. \"Leave this World Behind\" introduces the listener to this new surrounding in a very convincing manner. Nonetheless, be aware of the fact that the best tunes of \"Outcast\" bear other names. Edgy riffs shape highlights such as \"Forever\" and \"Nonconformist\". The latter excels itself additionally by its fantastic drive. Still better, \"Stronger than Before\" is cut from the same cloth, \"Enemy Unseen\" combines stomping verses with an eerie chorus and \"Ruin of Life\" underlines the pretty fatalistic aura of the entire album. The final smasher is \"Whatever it May Take\", inter alia due to its dynamic transition between verse and chorus. Only its robot sounds after the second part are a little bit strange.\n\n\"Phobia\", the most aggressive song, and the last three numbers do not fall by the wayside. Kreator stay loyal to their uncomplicated method and it comes therefore as no surprise that the whole work is based on an homogeneous overall impression. Ignorant fools call the here performed approach uninspired, but this group of blockheads just sucks. Instead of taking care of the guys, it makes more sense to have a look at the technical framework. Production-wise, \"Outcast\" delivers a transparent and distanced, but not soulless sound which was created with a good ear for what's essential. Mille's voice fits well with the bone-dry guitars. To express it differently, the dominating elements harmonize with each other. So now it is probably time to use the term which is used so often in these cases: \"Outcast\" is an underrated album. But forgive me to say it less sententiously, I just like this album.\n",
        "\n\"Cause for Conflict\" - the title reminds one of Anvil's album names, but it goes without saying that Kreator's output from 1995 has nothing in common with the Canadian pranksters. Kreator are a serious band and Mille has got a lot to say. Mister Petrozza, driven by hatred - but fair hatred, of course - is raging against the \"Catholic Despot\" in very harsh words. Too bad that he never wrote a similar text against Islamic terror. Yet I agree that the Catholics are much more dangerous than the ridiculously harmless fighters for Allah. Otherwise Mille would have opened his mouth against the jihadists. He is definitely no coward! Another story: capitalists, your days are numbered. The \"Progressive Proletarians\" will destroy your golden throne. Eh, what? The Wall Street is still existing and feels fine? However, Mille is definitely no idiot!\n\nOkay, enough said about the lyrics of this album. Mille does not have the monopoly in terms of writing moronic lyrics and so I want to close this chapter. In terms of music, \"Cause for Conflict\" is solid and without major flaws, but slightly torn. The violent outbursts \"Bomb Threat\" and \"Dogmatic\", the most radical tune, stand on the one side while uncovering the band's affinity for punk sounds. Thus, \"State Oppression\" can be understood as a logical choice for paying tribute to another band. Italy's hardcore formation Raw Power can be proud of finding one of their (strong) tracks on a Kreator album. On the other side, one finds a somewhat psychedelic number like \"Isolation\". From my point of view, this does not lead to a really coherent work. Anyway, one must consider the difficult situation for thrash bands in the nineties. With that said, Kreator attacked with a high degree of anger and did not betray the scene. To be more precise: they did not betray it yet, not with the here reviewed album.\n\nBetter still, \"Cause for Conflict\" offers some thrash metal jewels. One cannot speak of classic thrash, but the songs unite the characteristic features of the sub genre. \"Men without God\" has everything a thrash grenade needs; the first section of the song is swift as an arrow and sharp riffs meet a furious singer. Mille's voice conveys an appropriate dose of fatalism, hatred and anger; perhaps his best performance on the entire album. Generally speaking, the fast thrash parts are definitely influenced by Slayer. Listen to the part of the opener which begins at 2:35. This section is definitely ripped from \"Reborn\". Nevertheless, the thrashers do not show many signs of weakness. Even the \"Catholic Despot\" knows how to thrash very well. The Vatican is full of surprises.\n\nAll in all, the recording session was successful, both musically and technically. The snare drums does not appear in a very natural manner, yet this is not a big deal. The guitars do not lack of pressure and the bass claims its right while the vocals sound harsh, pretty raw and expressive. Long story short, \"Cause for Conflict\" has not changed my life, but it is a strong album. Each and every of the regular tracks has its strengths. Only the hidden noise, which appears at the end of \"Isolation\" after some minutes of silence, makes absolutely no sense.\n",
        "\nA different style, but another shitty artwork: welcome to \"Renewal\". I admit, whenever I think of Kreator, the words \"violent thrash metal\" come to my mind immediately. How stupid, because we all know that this is a fallacy. Mille, Ventor and their sidekicks have made many experiments and only their early albums offer really raw, brutal we-spit-in-your-face thrash. \"Renewal\", the name says it all, shows another facet of the band. The surprised listener finds slightly psychedelic sequences (the whispering at the beginning of \"Reflection\"), atypical melody lines and breaks (\"Karmic Wheel\"), non-conform solos (\"Brainseed\") and less aggressive lead vocals (during the entire album). Last but not least, the band expands its lyrical spectrum - a poetic title like \"Europe After the Rain\" would not have been possible before - and the musical cosmos as well. Pretty fast songs like the coherent \"Brainseed\" remain the exception and that's usually a pity. Nevertheless, the full-length is too good to be thrown into the trash. Some of its sections are convincing.\n\n\"Renewal\" distinguishes itself by a solid amount of catchy parts. One can like or dislike them, but they leave their aroma. By contrast, the useless intermezzo with the crude German title \"Realit\u00e4tskontrolle\" is only for fans of industrial noise who hate any form of music. (Guess there exist two or three mentally deranged guys worldwide who enjoy this bullshit.) Apart from this downer, \"Renewal\" marks a courageous album. Safety first was definitely not the maxim during the recording session, even though songs like the strong and compelling opener would also have been a stylistically adequate number on \"Coma of Souls\". The pioneers of devastating German thrash are trying to leave their old image behind and walk into the unknown without completely cutting their roots. The guitar sound, for example, is not attractive for people who do not have an affinity for metal and despite his less vile style, Mille's voice is still not suitable to enthuse aesthetes.\n\nThe first half of the album delivers a nice mix of melody, aggression and mostly mid-paced rhythms. Its songs have a good drive, do not lack of diversity and avoid lacklustre sequences which hurt the general impression. Yet the uncompromising brutality is completely lost and it was exactly this feature that catapulted Kreator into the centre of the thrash scene within just a few years. \"Renewal\" has nothing that makes the difference, it's a pretty decent album whose last tracks fall short of expectations. \"Zero to None\", for example, lacks of everything: no melody, no catchiness, no surprising breaks and so on. \"Europe After the Rain\" is slightly better, but all breaks down as its crude middle section begins. Yet despite its fillers, \"Renewal\" is not a bad or confusing work. It is just light years away from their early full-lengths.\n",
        "\nOf course, you think that this is a review about \"Coma of Souls\". My dear friends, I must disappoint you. Instead of Kreator's fifth full-length, I have to put myself in the focus of this review. I beg your pardon for being so egocentric. Yet I have seen the incredible average of 96% after remarkable 19 contributions and I ask myself what the hell is wrong with me? Either my brain does no longer work correctly (did it ever?) or my ear canals have an allergy against this album. I don't hate it, no way, but I do not see even the slightest indications of a milestone. Perhaps my copy is flawed and I am listening to the recordings of unknown musicians who intend to sound like a bad imitation of Kreator? Anyway, it's a mystery.\n\nAs always, Mille barks and nags uniformly, but the riffs do not achieve an outstanding level and dynamic is written in small letters. This does not mean that angry outbursts like \"World Beyond\" lack of speed, but velocity is not a synonym for dynamic (wise finding, I know). Moreover, Kreator do not offer something new, it's just a prolongation of the approach that formed \"Extreme Aggressions\", for better or for worse. Let's stay at \"World Beyond\" which represents the category \"short and simple\". I like a lot of tracks that are based on this idea, but the quality of this kind of songs stands and falls with the accuracy of the riffing. And the pretty decent \"World Beyond\" cannot hold a candle to comparably designed eruptions such as \"Piece by Piece\" or \"Sinner 666\" (Iron Angel). \n\nThere are naturally also more complex pieces. \"Agents of Brutality\", for instance. To be honest, this number is a little bit boring. Despite its tempo changes, it leaves me completely cold. It has no hooks, no catchy lines and it also fails to deliver flattening, impressive brutality. And the more I think about it, I come to the conclusion that this is the general problem of the album. Too many songs come and go without implanting the wish to press the repeat button. Even worse, the album lacks atmosphere. Of course, thrash metal does not primarily focus on atmosphere, but this is no carte blanche to record a more or less emotionless work. A small number of rather soft guitar sections tries to evoke some feelings, for example the intro of \"When the Sun Burns Red\" which marks a strong opener, although the part after the second chorus cannot fully convince. Yet these rare emotional sections do not get through. From my (obviously unprofessional) point of view, the vast majority of songs appears as an incoherent juxtaposition of parts that were forced to liaise with each other in order to create another song.\n\nNo doubt, now you are surely convinced that I do not understand this output. I hate to say it, but I guess you are right. I cannot find access to the compositions of \"Coma of Souls\" and the proper yet expressionless production is therefore of minor relevance. Kreator's thrash offering lacks of fury and determination with the effect that everything sounds a little bit stale. Of course, legions of albums have lost their energizing freshness after 27 years, but believe my: this is my point of view since the release of the full-length. To mention a final example, the title track is kicked off by a strong riff cascade, but this riff does not shape the song sustainably. It just marks the introduction and reappears at the end. Nevertheless, the title track belongs to the better representatives of the album. Yet, alas, another opportunity has been lost to pen a really strong number. - Enough written. I want to apologize once again, it's all my fault. I know it for sure, because my wife has analyzed the situation in the meanwhile. She says that my disc does not suffer from any production errors, my ears are slightly dirty but basically functional. Only my brain (or what is left of it after more than 48 years) is giving cause for alarm.\n",
        "\n\"Extreme Aggression\" was a good album in difficult times. The glorious days of thrash metal were more or less gone and everybody wanted to demonstrate the new maturity of his once unleashed band at the end of the decade. This was not a bad thing per se. Kreator, for example, did no longer torment us with artworks of Phil Lawvere. The childish shit of this dude was replaced by a simple band picture. Not the most original selection for a cover, but acceptable instead of totally embarrassing. And, even better, the music was very easy to accept as well. \"Extreme Aggression\" showed an upward trend.\n\nThe album's sound does not possess the raw brutality of the group's former full-lengths. It rather impresses with a cold, slightly mechanized mix. The technical execution is more transparent than before while creating another thrash feeling than its predecessors. Nevertheless, the listener has no reason to cry. There exist different recipes for solid thrash. I must say that the album does not belong to my most favourite works of Kreator. Nonetheless, I rediscover it pleasurably from time to time.\n\nThe new sharpness of the sound emphasizes the strict riffing of songs such as \"Love Us or Hate Us\" or \"Don't Trust\". One cannot deny that the guitars are the dominating element on this album, while the previous outputs were focused on creating a violent overall impression. No doubt, Kreator did not only break with visual traditions. The modified artwork style was aligned with the new kind of thrashing ugliness. The here presented songs are clearly shaped pieces which do not set the world on fire. They are further less massive than any piece of \"Pleasure to Kill\". Yet Kreator, and this must be emphasized, still pray to the Gods of thrash and the poisonous screaming of Mille lends the songs an additional touch of nastiness. \n\nIn its best moments, \"Extreme Aggression\" shows the harshest side of the band's slightly redefined approach. The title track has some relentlessly storming leads, \"Bringer of Torture\" raises hell in a very direct manner. Honestly spoken, complexity does not play an important role, neither in terms of the aforementioned track nor in general. Kreator have found the balance between the necessary degree of variety and the appropriate amount of desirable brutality. Even the slightly epic \"Some Pain Will Last\" adds value to the album while marching forward in a stoic manner. Only the hectic and somewhat ineffective \"Stream of Consciousness\" suffers from its unimaginative chorus. \n\nThree questions remain. Does \"Extreme Aggression\" possess any kind of special features? I don't think so. Is it a classic, a cult album or something like that? Once again, I don't think so. Does it live up to its name? For the third time, I don't think so. Yet its profound heaviness, its antipathy towards commercial elements and its no frills strategy have an impact, while the lyrics deal with more intelligent issues than before. Thrash fans that do not need barbaric, overly fierce or mega-hostile outbursts will like this robust and tight album.\n",
        "\nFive years between albums is a long time when out of all the old guard of eighties thrash metal bands, you\u2019ve been by far the most consistent of the twenty first century. Once one of the most fearsome and brutal thrash metal bands out there as evidenced by genre landmarks Pleasure to Kill and Extreme Aggression, the experimental nineties led to some decent but ultimately questionable releases, another thrash band that seemed to have been claimed by the decade that all but buried the genre.In 2001 Kreator \u201cmark three\u201d came back with a vengeance with Violent Revolution, returning to a more straight forward thrash style, returning to the heaviness of the past but polishing up the production, amping up the crowd-pleasing epic song writing and imbuing an Iron Maiden-esque sense of guitar melody \u2013 winning over new fans, and winning back all but the staunchest of the eighties fans who stopped listening. A four album run since then culminated in their best album of the 21st century era in Phantom Antichrist, taking all these elements to perfection, followed by multiple headline tours and headline slots at Wacken, Summer Breeze and Metal Days, among others of the most prestigious festivals in Europe. So to reiterate, five years has a felt like an almost endless wait but their fourteenth album Gods of Violence is finally here.\n\nIf you\u2019re still expecting a return to the somewhat sloppy but awe-inspiring brutality of the eighties \u2013 stop waiting because it isn\u2019t coming back. Gods of Violence is exactly the kind of continuance to expected from the melodic but heavy Phantom Antichrist. Mille Petroza\u2019s trademark aggressive but comprehensible snarl drives the songs forward with rousing verses and choruses atop riffs that are equal parts melodic and heavy. The title track is a perfect example of this \u2013 fast and melodic riffs that stick in your brain, blazing lead solos coming straight from the Iron Maiden guidebook and pounding thrashy drums all make for a heavy as fuck but easily accessible piece that\u2019s simply classic \u201cmark three\u201d Kreator. The chorus is easy to sing along to the rhythm section gets the head banging away in one of the heaviest tracks on the album, with World War Now and Totalitarian Terror delivering the same brilliant modern thrash.\n\nWhat Phantom Antichrist did well though was it\u2019s ability to always sound completely epic on every track, even those such as From Flood into Fire or Civilisation Collapse that were slower and more melodic, intended not to be listened to in the bedroom but sung along to en masse at shows. Even if the lyrics got a little cliche it never felt at all cheesy, always sounding epic through the instrumental heaviness and melody. Unfortunately at points on Gods of Violence it seems to go too far when trying to be epic and rousing, by turning the dial down on a little on the heaviness that made it work so well before and by making the lyrics more predictable in their search for this epic sound, they sometimes drift off into cheese territory. The choruses on , Satan is Real, Fallen Brother, Side by Side and Lion With Eagle Wings seem to be lazier than most of the albums of this era, the latter three all being of the \u201cmetal brotherhood\u201d sort of predictability, and just coming off as bit forced and cheesy. But the choruses aren\u2019t too much of a problem if the riffs and the rest of the song writing carry it off \u2013 plenty of Iron Maiden albums have repetitive choruses while being genre classics. It\u2019s the way at some points the riffs feel somewhat watered down that follow this trend and cement the movement from epic to cheese. If the melodic noodling that serves for a riff in places such as in the beginning of Hail to the Hordes were slightly heavier rather than a somewhat neutered guitar sound it would be much improved \u2013 whereas Lion With Eagle Wings is one of the heaviest songs on the album musically, just with a weak chorus.\n\nBut none of the songs here are bad, apart from some lazy choruses the song writing is really solid, and it\u2019s only a fraction of the riffs mentioned above that are lacking power, and there\u2019s usually a good degree of melody to make up for it \u2013 even if a little saccharine it still holds interest. There\u2019s not a single bad guitar solo on the album, each one blazing furious and melodic. Unfortunately it\u2019s just the fact they can get it spot on 80-90% of the time but lose their way a little the rest of the time that makes it slightly disappointing, as they\u2019re clearly capable of making pretty much perfect albums as evidenced by the previous effort. I wouldn\u2019t for a second entertain the notion that any loss of heaviness is an attempt to make themselves more accessible and reach a larger audience \u2013 it\u2019s still a really heavy album on the whole, and their popularity has sky rocketed since the nineties to the biggest point they\u2019ve got to on the back of their touring and albums of the last sixteen years. They just had such a fantastic album to match up to that expectations were set a little too high. It\u2019s a really good effort and is much better than Hordes of Chaos or Violent Revolution, just not quite reaching the heights of Phantom Antichrist or Enemy of God. But while the hints of cheese might creep into the song writing and they sometimes let off the gas pedal on the heaviness, they\u2019re still brilliant, melodic, relevant and above all fun.\n\nOriginally written for swirlsofnoise.com\n",
        "\nKreator has it\u2019s roots going back to 1982 so the fact that this band is still active and prolific is a testament to the ability of this band to remain relevant while adapting to an always changing metal scene. They are also quite polarizing since their turn of the century \u201creturn\u201d to their extreme metal roots from the experimenting they were doing with their nineties output. Ever since Violent Revolution in 2001 they have combined the best parts of their experimentation and melded it with their thrash roots and it has caused some to not be as accepting as I think they should be. Kreator is still a force to be reckoned with and, despite the accusations of trying to go \u201cGothenburg\u201d with their sound (an accusation I find absurd), they have managed to keep churning out top notch heavy metal\u2026and isn\u2019t that what matters?\n\nSo 2017 brings us Kreator\u2019s fourteenth full length album, Gods of Violence. This album has it all and shows that these Teutonic thrashers can still kreate (sorry, just had to) brilliant metal. No, not every moment is thrash. No this is not Gothenburg worship. No this is not the reincarnation of Coma of Souls or Extreme Aggression as it seems so many are always looking for. Yes there is a lot of melody on this album. In fact, it\u2019s the melodies on this album that make it catchy and unique. And if you listen objectively and closely enough, you\u2019ll hear some really cool nods to the aforementioned classic Kreator albums.\n\nSongs like the opener, \u201cWorld War Now\u201d and the monster thrasher \u201cTotalitarian Terror\u201d shows this band can still write killer thrash riffs. The latter comes in with a catchy and melodic chorus that gives this song an extra dimension. Both songs have moments that can be compared to their \u201cclassic\u201d thrash era with the brilliant riffing going on here. Having that melody is what changes the game for me. These songs are thrash monsters that are also epic metal anthems. How is that wrong? Then you have the solos on this album, which are brilliant and show that Mille and Sami are still on top of their game.\n\nThe title track is actually a five minute epic beginning with some cool acoustic guitars and some eastern sounds before crushing with the opening and Mille shouting \u201cWe shall kill!\u201d This song is metal as fuck with some serious thrash riffing and a melodic chorus that is super catchy and gives this song that anthemic vibe.\u201dArmy of Storms\u201d is another just brilliant song that has some really cool riffing that reminds me of \u201cCome of Souls\u201d a bit before morphing into a totally new killer riff. Once again, the addition of the melodic bridge and the anthemic chorus adds to the brilliance of this song.\n\nThe lyrical approach to this album is classic Kreator. Down with the corrupt, fascist, oligarchy that rules us all. Mille\u2019s lyrics has always been geared towards opening our eyes to the injustices of the world and this album is no different. \u201cSide by Side\u201d shows Mille creating a personal dialog between himself and anyone that can personally relate to this song. Mille uses his clean vocals on this song as well as on the closer, the seven and a half minute \u201cDeath Has Become My Light.\u201d This song could be Kreator going power metal. The galloping tempo and the melody going into a truly power metal chorus shows this band going into some uncharted territory.\n\nThis is modern Kreator and I think it\u2019s fucking brilliant! I\u2019ve been a fan of this band since I first heard Extreme Aggression back in the day. I don\u2019t expect a band of this magnitude to stay stagnant and not grow. This album shows that they can still release quality metal after all these years\u2026a feat that some bands from the 80s just can not pull off. Gods of Violence is a great album and there\u2019s no sign of them slowing down. Nope, this isn\u2019t the second coming of (insert classic Kreator album here). It\u2019s a new chapter.\n\n\nThe Elitist Metalhead\n",
        "\nAfter they furnished killer albums like, Endless Pain, Pleasure To Kill, Terrible Certainty, Extreme Aggression, and Coma of Souls; the fellas from Kreator had become one of my favorite acts in the thrash metal genre. All those years, even until this very day, I always enjoy blasting those mentioned records in my speakers as it gives me such feeling of great enthusiasm that I have always desired to have.\n\nHaving mentioned and described the extreme pleasures that the albums above had given me, their recent God of Violence release gives me the opposite. Long gone are the savagery, aggressive nature, and hostility of the materials which are what gives the listeners that intense ecstatic feeling that they had love about the crafts of the mighty Kreator.\n\nHonestly speaking, after Coma of Souls I haven't really dug the records that they had put out following that album. Though Violent Revolution, Enemy of God, and Phantom Antichrist rejuvenated my interest to the band, the succeeding offerings -- which obviously includes Gods of Violence -- had once again let me down.\n\nFor a band with a status like Kreator, I know that they can do better than this. They can revive that murderous nature of their tunes if they want to. See, the problem with Gods of Violence is that it inherited the softness and the too much melodic nature of the band's albums after Coma of Souls. I have no problem with bands incorporating melody (Amon Amarth is a band that I enjoy listening and they used numerous melodies in their crafts, but those guys know how to manipulate the melodies and they sure can make it effective and entertaining even in a simplistic manner.) in their crafts, but if it's too much applied it makes the output soft and boring. And being soft and boring is not what fans of extreme music wants with their metal tunes.\n\nThere are a few tracks in this album that are actually good if the band had stayed straight up in the thrashing manner approach. Tunes like Gods of Violence and Totalitarian Terror have in point of fact obtained the nature of the early kickass attitude of the band when we talk about the number of appreciable old school thrash guitar riffages that those tracks owns. On the other hand, the melodic parts of both tracks had totally wrecked these two potential masterpieces.\n\nTo end this review, Gods of Violence is one of those records that shows that Kreator is departing away from their old school roots which accorded them their legendary status in the extreme music genre. The band clearly sent a message to the fans that they want to be on the safe side by advertising cheesy new materials that are saleable for the kids of this generation. Man, I just expected more from Kreator about this release. This is a nonviolent and unobjectionable album for a legendary band who once put out classics like Endless Pain, Extreme Aggression and Coma of Souls.\n",
        "\nKreator's EP from 1988 is nothing else but a bad joke. Who needed this release? Okay, I bought it almost 30 years ago. As a victim of my own juvenile enthusiasm, I thought that the purchase could make sense, despite the facts that I never was very interested in live recordings. Moreover, I never appreciated cover songs very much (as always, the exception proves the rule; Cruel Force's version of Bathory's \"The Return...\" is excellent). Finally it goes without saying that the artwork sucks once again. Thus, I was focused on the only exclusive piece of this release. Frankly speaking, \"Impossible to Cure\" is an impertinence.\n\nAlready its playtime of less than three minutes implies that this is a half-baked, quickly recorded piece without any special features. It is therefore only logical that it cannot convince. A typical thrasher with a short noisy solo and a comparatively ordinary chorus. The riffing is a little bit lame, but still okay. Anyway, the only function of this number was to give the company and the band an alibi to publish this EP. Target missed, because \"Impossible to Cure\" does not justify the purchase.\n\n\"Lambs to the Slaughter\" is the pretty lame cover of a pretty lame song which was originally written by a pretty lame band. It seems as if Kreator just needed another studio track and they were not very picky. The result is a conventionally designed, more or less decent, but simultaneously completely superfluous, somehow vacuous piece which has nothing in common with thrash metal. No doubt, Kreator seemingly forgot to ornament this traditional tune with their individual style. Or they just wanted to leave the studio as soon as possible.\n\nNeither the sound of the studio tracks nor that of the live pieces falls flat and maybe those of you who do not possess any other release of the band will say that this work offers value of money. No doubt, \"Riot of Violence\" with its unbridled chorus and the massive \"Awakening of the Gods\" raise the roof and \"Terrible Certainty\" has a catchy instrumental part. However, the dissemination policy of Noise Records was a slap in the face of all loyal fans who had bought the previous vinyl products as well. All in all, an interview with Mille in the Horror Infernal fanzine from 1988 says it all. \"What can you tell us about your new 12\"?\" - \"Well, nothing spectacular\". Thanks, Mille, for this refreshing and honest answer.\n",
        "\nAll these experts who say that the third album is the make-it-or-break-it work of a band may be puzzled by \"Terrible Certainty\" in view of the further, outstanding career of Kreator. To put it more directly, I tend to the break-it option. This is not to say that the third output of Kreator completely sucks, yet it is far away from the mind-blowing experience which was offered by \"Pleasure to Kill\". In alignment with its artwork, it lacks of inspiration. Just listen to the opener. Hectic guitars and high speed drumming seem to be an end in itself. The expressionless vocals of Mille lead nowhere and the rapid solo sounds like a million other solos. Thank God, this acceptable yet pretty average song does not mark the best track of the album, but it indicates the overall quality.\n\nOkay, there are more problematic solos on this album that do not add any value to the respective song. Yet some strong riffs and leads cannot be overlooked. \"Storming with Menace\" provides a concise chorus, \"One of Us\" possesses a good degree of compactness and the piercing high speed guitar work ensures a certain recognition value. The same applies for the tribal drumming and the leads at the beginning of the title track. The guitars have an almost hymnal character, but the song fails to develop excellently. At the end of the day, it is just another rapid outburst that fails to impress sustainably. I don't intend to beat around the bush; its individual components are just too weak; a strong, continuous melody line is missing, the riffing remains unspectacular and Mille's vocals are monotonous. His angry, scratchy and slightly gnomish barking is very predictable. Too bad that \"As the World Burns\", the only track where Ventor is singing, fails to deliver enthralling sounds. Standard riffing and rather slow-paced drumming form a piece without any upward or downward swings.\n\nBy the way, the lyrics of this track continue the extremely poetic tradition of the former releases of the band. Ventor informs that \"megatons of death await to explode\" and paints pleasurably an apocalyptic picture. Yet \"Toxic Trace\" shows a new lyrical approach while dealing with more realistic scenarios such as the pollution of the environment, doesn't it? Come on, it's a very simple approach. The unscrupulous industry is to blame for everything, among other things because of \"ignoring the warnings of ancient prophets\". Crude understanding of modern business leadership, at least in my humble opinion. However, songs like \"Toxic Trace\" or \"No Escape\" are neither crappy nor outstanding, they just make some more or less solid noise and that's it. I am talking about furious thrash metal without surprising or even overwhelming details, no more, no less. All trace elements of black and death metal that enriched \"Pleasure to Kill\" are gone.\n\nThe comparatively soulless sound of the album also does not collect plus points. It remains a mystery why the band changed from Harris Johns to Roy Rowland. The bass guitar is sidelined, the drums lack of penetrating power. This situation matches the equally undistinguished musical content. My judgement is clear. As soon as I retire - I just need to endure the next 222 months - I will have enough time to record a Kreator mix tape (in the then modern form) with all my personal highlights of the band. Unfortunately, I don't think that there will be many songs of \"Terrible Certainty\". But perhaps I should ask the experts, before I start the recordings for my tape.\n",
        "\nKreator's picture disc from 1987 is a fairly nonsensical release of the band. The A side features the title track without the acoustic beginning which introduces the song on \"Terrible Certainty\". From my point of view, \"Behind the Mirror\" did not justify this publication, because it lacks of compelling riffs. The scratchy guitars do not form outstanding verses or a great chorus. Everything sounds more or less banal, not totally worthless, but without memorable sequences. Mille's vocals also remain mediocre. His nagging cannot be compared with that of an ordinary Norwegian black metal vocalist. He rather sounds like a nervous, old witch.\n\n\"Gangland\", a composition of Tygers of Pan Tang, is the (more or less) exclusive track of this output. Just like \"Lambs to the Slaughter\", the cover version that prolonged \"Out of the Dark... Into the Light\", \"Gangland\" does not deliver another portion of thrash metal. It's a pretty traditional metal track, heavy and with a certain degree of vehemence, but it is nothing that makes my day. The band seemingly worked on the basis of the motto \"minimal effort - maximum effect\". Surprise, surprise, the dudes had no problem to avoid major efforts. They perform the song in a rather reserved and distanced manner. But unfortunately, the effect was rather poor. The manual dexterity of the musicians cannot be denied, yet manual skills alone are not able to make gold out of shit, to express it drastically.\n\nProduction-wise, one can realize that Noise Records were not skimpy. The mix does not suffer from major flaws. Well, Noise was well advised to equip the vinyl with an adequate production, because Kreator was one of the most important formations for the company's success. This is definitely also the reason why this picture disc was produced at all. Only fools like me, who felt the need to know every studio track of Kreator, bought it. No doubt, the calculation of Noise paid off.\n",
        "\n Originally Written For The Grungy Land Blog\n\nKreator releases another album. \n\nI know the phrase \u201cKreator releases another album\u201d may be the most dismissive thing I have said in years, but lots of modern thrash albums just haven\u2019t been doing anything for me lately. And, with the possible exception of Tankard, I\u2019ve never been as infatuated with the Teutonic Thrash scene as other fans. Couple that with the lukewarm singles \u201cGods of Violence\u201d premiered with, and I was not quite thrilled with Kreator\u2019s new work. But something happened when I was listening to \u201cGods of Violence\u201d... I actually started to like Kreator.\n\nThe album starts with the intro \u201cApocalypticon\u201d which has this imposing, symphonic edge to it with a decent solo. Nothing too grand or haunting, but I thought it was a nice warm up. But once the intro explodes into \u201cWorld War Now\u201d, the album doesn\u2019t let up. \u201cWorld War Now\u201d shows a level of speed and energy I haven\u2019t heard from the thrash scene for a while. It\u2019s refreshing to finally hear a thrash song with so much life. The drums and guitars working together in sonic unison to create a truly great song.\n\nThis album does have a more melodious edge than Kreator\u2019s previous works and it definitely works in their benefit. \u201cArmy of Storms\u201d has so much in the way of catchy riffs and a hook filled chorus, that it might as well be a long forgotten Iron Maiden track. \u201cHail to the Hordes\u201d has a similar feel, drawing heavy influence from the Black Sabbath/Dio/Manowar era of classic metal. It doesn\u2019t stick the landing as hard as \u201cArmy of Storms\u201d but it also doesn\u2019t drag on too long as a result.\n\nIn fact, this whole album is at its best when it isn\u2019t being the blast-beat filled trash metal that made me despise Kreator in the first place. \u201cPleasure To Kill\u201d does not hold up, get over it. All that aside, I ended up enjoying my time with this record, even though it feels like Kreator die-hards may not enjoy it as much for not being as evil and heavy as their old material.\n\nWhile this album was certainly a surprise, there are some nitpicks I have with the album as a whole. I think Millie\u2019s vocals are unique, creating an engaging yell and heavy snarl when necessary, but sometimes the overall production leaves his vocals swallowed by the noise of the music. Some of the tracks definitely do pull from the same bag of tricks, like \u201cFallen Brother\u201d, \u201cSide by Side\u201d, and \u201cDeath Becomes My Light\u201d but even when they do end up repeating themselves, the complexity and the absolute talent of Millie and Sami as they play is what makes them work. When Kreator\u2019s classic metal sense rears around through the thrash, they transition so well and make every note feel very important and well executed.\n\nLyrically, the album could be a bit more diverse. There\u2019s pretty much nothing new here in terms of perspective or style from previous thrash or even previous Kreator records. The horrors of war, satanism, it\u2019s all pretty standard fare. And finally, the \u201cDeath Becomes My Light\u201d closer would have had more impact had the last few songs not follow very similar patterns and styles, making the last quarter of the record sound kind of bland. I will say that the song has one of the better interludes on the entire record, however.\n\nOverall, I was presently surprised by Kreator\u2019s \u201cGods of Violence\u201d. It certainly wasn\u2019t enough to make me fall in love with Kreator, but in this drought of creativity and fun that is the modern thrash scene, \u201cGods of Violence\u201d certainly delivers something entertaining.\n",
        "\nKreator were, for a long time, among the most aggressive thrash metal back out there. Pleasure to Kill, even though sloppy and pretty one-dimensonal, still stands firm. Over the years the back became more experienced and slick, culminating in the balanced Coma Of Souls. The ending point of their heyday. The albums between Pleasure and Coma have always been my personal favorites. They perfectly bridged the aggression of Pleasure with the song writing depth, superior riffs and catchiness of Coma.\n\nDuring the nineties Kreator were soul searching. Renewal saw more industrial and atmosphere, Cause for Conflict was a safe album apart from lower gruff vocals, Outcast just a meandering piece of slowthrash and the Salonf\u00e4hig melodic Endorama being the point where they lost most of their old fans.\n\nHaving reached the deepest point, Kreator came back with a vengeance. The threesome Violent Revolution, Enemy of God and Hordes of Chaos all featured a majority of fast old school thrash metal songs and the band sounded rejuvinated. \nAt least, that\u2019s what we thought at the time. Because listening to them in retrospect after having heard \u2018Gods Of Violence\u2019, it\u2019s clear the band were already showing some cracks on Enemy Of God, being the overly slick production to appease the new generation and godawful melodic fillers \u2018Dystopia\u2019 and \u2018Dying Race Apocalypse\u2019. \n\nPhantom Antichrist was a huge disapointment. Even more slick production and more of those semi-melodies. The first albums since Endorama I did not buy. Which is a tough decision since I always claimed to have loved this band since I first heard them in 1988 (apart from Endorama, obviously). \n\nBut knowing Kreator, the next album after Phantom would probably be better or different, right? But, it isn\u2019t. Phantom Antichrist apparently was well received by a a lot of people so Kreator felt safe to keep following this path and incorporate more and more melodies. It\u2019s okay, it\u2019s their choice, but me as a fan they have lost, again.\n\nI think it\u2019s a shame. \"Totalitarian Terror\", just like the title track, is such a superior track were it not for that shitty melodic chorus. It ruins the entire song. I hate that! There are so many great riffs throughout the songs and each and every time a half-assed attempt at a melody comes in and fucks the song in the ass!\n\nAlso, the song title 'Satan is real', despite what the lyrics say, is just uninspired. It's the title a 12 year old kid would choose for a poem about bad people on earth. it is CHILDISH! The song itself meandering. Have they not learned from the Outcast debacle? This is boring folks!\n\nAnd the worst part of the album: \"Hail to the Hordes\"\nWe all know Alestorm, right? Love\u2019m or hate them. (I actually enjoyed them because from time to time I can enjoy pirate comedy and love the first Pirates of the Caribbean movie). But Kreator have managed to write a folk metal tune which would even had been a mediocre one on any Alestorm album. Yes, \"Hail to the Hordes\" is that bad. I don\u2019t know it Kreator were attempting to write an anthem of union and solidarity like Overkill\u2019s \u2018In Union we Stand\u2019 but the result is sheer comedy. This is way to cheesy and bad.\n\nNo, clearly they have decided to cash in on the melodic and semi-epic approach bands like Sabaton and Amon Amarth are having succes with but for me isn\u2019t working. Kreator have turned into politically correct semi-melodic 'safe for kids' metal and that is exactly why I will sell this album a.s.a.p.\n",
        "\nSince the turn of the millennium, the triumvirate of Teutonic thrash metal have all been on pretty good form, with terrible albums happily absent. However, among the three, Kreator have drawn probably the greatest share of attention, not only for the praise that met Enemy of God and Phantom Antichrist, but also for the divided opinions that heralded Hordes of Chaos. Five years on from Phantom Antichrist, it\u2019s possible to see Gods of Violence going either way, since the mixture of gritty thrash and more melodic material should sate hungry fans, though there are a few risks that might not be so palatable to all.\n\nA certain trend that has developed in the post-millennial climate continues on Kreator\u2019s new effort - namely, a further mixing of the band\u2019s original savage tendencies with modern and melodic elements, something that is also to be witnessed on Sodom\u2019s latest, Decision Day. The outsourcing of brutality has not gone so far as to make songs such as 'Hail to the Hordes' and 'World War Now' sound unlike Kreator exactly, although the catchy Swedish melodies and bouncy momentum of the former and the muscular hum of palm-muting and scrambling fills that propels the verses of the latter invite unexpected guests to the party. Aside from these flirtations with melodeath and the modern metal movement, there are hints of other left turns that reflect the time Kreator have spent honing these songs. The acoustic guitar and brief moments of sitar that open the title track, the respectful keys used in the intro to 'Lion with Eagle Wings', and some of the riff choices from 'Fallen Brother' and 'Gods of Violence' break new ground for the band, both in terms of instruments included and styles referenced.\n\nOn the other hand, this is still a vigorous thrash album for all the detours, while it is important to note that the surprising features are always details and never the focus. For any old school fan left looking askance at the souped-up modernity of 'World War Now', 'Totalitarian Terror' should provide a fast remedy, with special emphasis on the word fast. Other full-blooded thrashers include 'Lion with Eagle Wings' and the no-nonsense 'Side by Side', which offers a more hopeful message late in the album. Ultimately, it comes down to the pace of the riffing to ensure that Gods of Violence remains undoubtedly a Kreator album, something that is present to varying extents in almost every song. Added to which, there are solid riffs all over the place and a few special ones too, including those mentioned as different, while Mille Petrozza predictably covers topics of death, violence, and struggle with his impressively visceral roar. Nonetheless, the lyrical topics do present a minor negative aspect of the album, since the themes are now well-worn after 30 years of active service, plus the fact that Petrozza seems particularly fond of screaming out any given song\u2019s title as often as possible, 'Satan Is Real' and 'Fallen Brother' proving the worst culprits.\n\nAs a statement of Kreator\u2019s supremacy in the 21st century metal scene, Gods of Violence straddles the divide between being simply another signature set of songs and an intentional development towards new ground. The steadfastly thrashy underbelly solidifies the Germans\u2019 place as one of the most consistent and respected of the \u201880s crew, while the modern touches provide some excitement and variation, pushed to the fore as they are by Jens Bogren\u2019s meaty production. There is hardly a question of filler material, although the first two thirds of the album carries the most distinctive compositions, of which 'Hail to the Hordes' and 'Totalitarian Terror' sit proud as not only among the best of Kreator\u2019s output but certainly some of their catchiest and most memorable.\n\nOriginally written for The Metal Observer - http://www.metal-observer.com/3.o/review/kreator-gods-of-violence/\n",
        "\nNormally I don't like to jump on the \"immediately review new releases\" bandwagon, but sometime's there are exceptions. After being greatly disappointed with Testament's Brotherhood Of The Snake, having this record absolutely blow my mind was truly a relief. To say it's way stronger than their previous release would be a stretch, but Kreator have always been one of those bands that have matured with every album, ever since abandoning the noisy, stripped down, '80s raw thrash sound. This could not be anymore evident in Gods Of Violence.\n\nFor starters, this is probably the most melodic that the band has ever gotten, even in the heavier tracks. This record displays some great, yet subtle use of some power metal riffs, but you have to pay close enough attention to catch it. It's most evident in my favorite track, \"Totalitarian Terror\". Their ability to fuse this into their sound, yet remain true to the aggressive, harsh style proves this release worthy of respect, whether you dig it or not. There's still long, lung killing shrieks, surrounded by hailing blast beat drumming and riffs that are nice and sharp. The production on this record could not be any cleaner, with little to no extra noise. That being said though, the bass could have played a better role on here, which would have definitely brought this up even higher.\n\nMost of the song structure is mature and clearly took some thought. A lot of the content focuses on actual world problems, and for the most part doesn't attack religion on every other track. Tracks like \"World War Now\", \"Gods Of Violence\" and \"Army Of Storms\" contain some of the heaviest moments, with outstanding solos and above average, heavy riffing, as well as Millie's greatest vocal work, and it all fits together perfectly. At the same time, they also offer us some slower tracks near the end, such as \"Side By Side\" and \"Death Becomes My Light\", where we get to witness his singing voice, a rare occurrence, but always neat. It's deep and devious, yet depicts his emotions very well. My only issue with the writing is how corny the track \"Satan Is Real\" is, as the chorus is repetitive, and it would appear they tried too hard with this one. Not a horrible track, but definitely sticks out slightly. As a whole release, this is a solid album to kick off 2017, and definitely brings out some ability in Kreator that wasn't revealed in the past (or at least not as prominently). Hard kicks and complex licks are not abandoned, and with a very small amount of flaws, I was not disappointed.\n",
        "\nIf there ever was a physical manifestation of 'worth the wait' - Gods of Violence must surely be it! It has been almost five years since the kings of teutonic thrash, the almighty Kreator, dropped their previous masterpiece Phantom Antichrist. Now it appears they have succeeded in overthrowing that album's podium place. Our favourite Germans have crafted a triumphant work that expands upon the melodic death metal influences of their post-2000 output, but remains 100% Kreator through and through. Buckle up - this is one hell of a ride...\n\nThe noble march of \"Apocalypticon\" sets the tone with its menacing pomp, before blasting into what is possibly the best opening song in Kreator's calatogue. \"World War Now\" is an explosive thrash-fest, which furiously rockets out of the speakers. Equally full of drama and malice, it's sure to become a live staple. It's also a great example of one of Kreator's characteristic traits: complex riffs that extend twice as long as one expects before repeating. This method of riff-writing keeps their material fresh ten, twenty, thirty years on.\n\nThe production is top notch. Perhaps the bass doesn't get the breathing space it deserves, but the drums are thunderous, the guitar tone is just the right amount of meaty before becoming sludgy, and the vocals are packed with volume. Mille Petrozza only seems to get better with age and, despite a weak delivery on 2009's Hordes Of Chaos, now spits every syllable with both rage and nobility. Just listen to the opening scream of \"Totalitarian Terror\" - he means fucking business! \n\nLyrically, this is a surprisingly positive album for a band whose most famous songs include \"Ripping Corpse\" and \"Endless Pain\". It's refreshing to hear lyrics such as 'I'll be by your side' and 'cherish all remaining days' - they add an air of elegance to an already well-crafted album. This is no clearer than in the triumphant \"Hail To The Hordes\" (ooh those bagpipes. Glorious!). There's even a beautifully-placed slice of German in the melancholic \"Fallen Brother\".\n\nThere are few albums where I can say every song is a highlight - but Gods Of Violence is absolutely jammed with substantial songs that each add a little something of variety, whilst remaining stylistically loyal. High-speed thrashers like \"World War Now\" and \"Lion With Eagle Wings\" contrast beautifully with the mid-tempo stompers such as \"Satan Is Real\" and \"Side By Side\". There's even a seven-minute epic, \"Death Becomes My Light\", which sounds almost like what Iron Maiden would if they were a German thrash metal band. Admittedly, \"Army Of Storms\" became an instant favourite of mine due to its Coma Of Souls-esque riffs and hammering chorus. \n\nThere's absolutely no reason not to own this CD. The digipak contains an amazing DVD of their set at Wacked 2014, and some stunning artwork from Jan Meininghaus. It's still January, so I shouldn't really be thinking of what will go into my 'top 10 albums of the year', however - Gods Of Violence has set a bar, not just for thrash metal, but for all heavy music in 2017. Fueled by animosity, packed with expansive thrash classics, and victorious on a grand scale - Kreator show the young and old crowd how thrash metal should sound in the modern era.\n",
        "\nAfter the outstanding Phantom Antichtist that mixed furious thrash metal and melodic heavy metal in a balanced way, Gods of Violence offers a very similar style without having the consistent high-quality songwriting of the predecessor. The first half of the record mostly offers formulaic thrash metal that one has heard over and over again from this band while the second part is much more epic and melodic but is often lacking memorable passages.\n\nThe band seems to offer a few experiments here and there in form of short piano and orchestral passages and bagpipe sounds or with extended instrumental introductions and unusual bridges with poem recitations or even with some unexpected German lyrics. However, these ideas often feel like unnecessary gimmicks since they rarely add anything to the different songs and are much too short to elaborate towards something more consistent or interesting. This even concerns the better tunes on the album. Let's take ''Hail to the Hordes'' as an appropriate example. This is an enjoyable homage to the fans and has an anthemic atmosphere that will surely work much better in concert than on this studio release. The bagpipe sounds played by In Extremo's Yellow Pfeifer are performed as perfectly as we are used of him in the bridge. However, they don't add anything to the song and feel completely out of place.\n\nThe repetitive ''us against the world'' topics also get quite redundant and show that this band is running out of ideas lyrically. The vocals sound as they have sounded over the past three decades and offer an angry mixture of poignant screams and nervous up-tempo parts where they often sound out of rhythm. The pronunciation of the lyrics also got worse over the past few years. The thrash riffs feel rehashed an uninspired. They recall records such as Enemy of God and Hail to the Hordes without adding anything new to this style. The rhythm section remains formulaic throughout the entire release and is neither brutal enough to go back to the band's roots nor diversified enough to add anything new to the band sound.\n\nThe only truly positive point of this album is Sami Yli-Sirni\u00f6's guitar play. He pulls off some emotional melodic leads as in the mellower parts of ''Gods of Violence'' which starts promisingly to fall flat or in the mysterious overture of ''Lion with Eagle Wings''. He also pulls off a few excellent solos as in the otherwise average ''Satan Is Real'' or in the Japanese bonus track ''Earth Under the Sword'' which clearly isn't as great as the epic ''Iron Destiny'' five years earlier.\n\nTo keep it short, you might be impressed by this record if you have never heard of the band before. If you are familiar with Kreator's more recent material, you will realize that Gods of Violence is basically a mixture of the last three albums and offers more of the same without adding anything new to the mixture. Thanks to a few solid individual tracks like the fan anthem ''Hail to the Hordes'', the melodic heavy metal track ''Lion with Eagle Wings'' and the melancholic ''Fallen Brother'' which is probably the most creative tune on here, this album is still overall enjoyable. The additional live concert that comes along with the limited edition of this release also rates this release up. However, Gods of Violence is a minor disappointment after the strong Phantom Antichrist. Personally, I won't purchase this record because I know Kreator can do much better than that.\n",
        "\nGods of Violence reminds me a whole lot of Sodom's latest record in how it tries pretty effectively to be everything for nearly every generation or tier of the band's audience, and it does so with a close approximation of success. Granted, if you're pining for a tip of the hat to Endorama, Outcast, Renewal or Cause for Conflict then you might be largely left out in the cold, but that would at best comprise only a literal handful of listeners on this entire planet, and Kreator would be wise to do so if they want to pump up their base. They also don't delve back into the primacy of their demos or debut. However, if you're interested in hearing an amalgam of their later 80s, involved riffing patterns with the melodic overtures of records like Phantom Antichrist and Violent Revolution, all wrapped up in the accessible thrashing echo chamber of an Enemy of God, then this should fit rather snugly to your interests. Hell, even the TITLE here is drawn from some of those...\n\nYes, there are a handful of riff progressions here which certainly reflect back upon records like Terrible Certainty, Extreme Aggression and Coma of Souls, but they're all trussed up in an elegant penchant for melody which alleviates some of the sinister evocations of Mille's raving, barking vocals, giving a more uplifting, anthemic feel to even the harshes thrashing. This is actually most prominent in the architecture of the leads, which are generally pretty feel-good to the point that even some of the rhythm guitars backing them shift to a more accessible direction than the verse riffing. There's no question a level of nerdy progressive metal has infiltrated the band's sense for extremity, much like it did on Phantom Antichrist, but one could make a strong case that the band has reached 'peak proficiency' here, since the sheer number of notes and leads flitting around the 11 tracks and 52 minutes seems to exceed anything that has come before it. Bound up in the elegant, slick production values which make it effortless to experience every individual breath or note, Gods of Violence might not live up to its title in terms of the expected brutality, but it's one frenetic record with plenty to take in across a good number of listens.\n\nPersonal favorites here included \"Army of Storms\" and \"Lion With Eagle Wings\", just for striking that perfect balance of aggression and melody, and in the latter case even providing me with something that felt fresh and new in the Kreator lexicon. And Gods does that quite a lot...for every callback riff there's another here which simply has never existed before in their catalog, and while it's not going to prove very welcome for folks who feel like the band died off or sold out after Pleasure to Kill, I'm not ready to give up on the notion that these veterans have something left to give us as they continue to forge on through another decade. For a band over 30 years into its existence, this material doesn't entirely rest entirely on its laurels, lazily subsisting on nostalgia alone. Rather, it's inspired. Mille still sounds great, and the clarity with which his vocals can adhere to the more melodic guitars behind them is a real stunner. Drumming is efficient, and the bass is fine, but really this is ALL about those intricate, harried guitar lines, and how you feel about that will make or break your experience. So far, the songs don't rank among the most memorable in their canon, and no amount of busyness or proficiency can really make up for that, but Gods of Violence is enjoyable from fore to aft while I wait for whatever they summon up next.\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nCertain albums transcend their genres (\"thrash\" in this case); some through universally appealing songwriting, others by finding a musical attribute and perfecting it. In the case of Pleasure To Kill, that attribute is violence. In my Darkness Descends review, I mentioned that Slayer was a crossroads; one path led to raw ugliness, the other led to slick production that would well define its riffs as bricks to be smashed over your head. This album asks \u201ccan\u2019t you have both?\u201d Now that is not to say that this album destroys Dark Angel nor Slayer in their respective categories. It doesn\u2019t have the magic reverb free touch of Rick Rubin, yet there is just enough definition to each riff that you will lose a piece of your spinal cord upon contact. On top of that there is just enough rawness to provide that atmosphere that made Ride The Lightning so enduring and charming. It quite fits the phrase \u201cthe best of both worlds.\u201d \n\nI didn\u2019t know how to handle this album at first because it had the most unorthodox fast drum beat I\u2019d ever heard up to that point. It wasn\u2019t a blast beat, and it wasn\u2019t a super fast rhythm like on Darkness Descends. It was just as if Ventor decided to play as fast as sloppily as he could (even though the playing is anything but sloppy) and hope that Mille could build riffs around. Despite such unorthodox execution, it provides a perfect foundation. Or rather a foundation destroying earthquake, as the rhythm section gives this album that the ground is about to give way to the Earth's molten layers below. Ventor is like a drunken master in this regard.\n\nBut of course, the real reason why we\u2019re here, the RIFFS! Believe me, Slayer is jealous of every riff on this album; jealous they didn\u2019t come up with them that is. Special mention has to go to the riff in the middle of Riot of Violence. This is perhaps the only thrash break in history that can challenge Angel of Death's spot on the throne. It was like a thousand workshop saw-blades ripping me to pieces. Whenever that part comes in I must snap my neck. At any time. Even when I\u2019m running. Another reason this album transcends thrash is that the riffs are so ugly and brutal they elevate this album into a death metal feel. I\u2019ve always held a theory. In 1985 death metal was given it\u2019s first album in Seven Churches. Then in 1987, Scream Bloody Gore, another evolutionary step appeared. I postulate that this album serves as a bridge between those two albums. Kreator would get much more credit for death metal if they had stuck to a death metal sound, but much like Sodom and Destruction, they moved from whatever extreme they were sonically occupying on to a pure thrash metal sound. Alex Webster has actually referred to Kreator in general as death metal when discussing vocal styles on the Centuries of Torment documentary. While Kreator over time have been proven to be thrash, I would absolutely call Pleasure to Kill not just a death metal album, but a death metal cornerstone.\n\nThis another all-time genre defining masterpiece that separates the men from the boys. If you don\u2019t own this, get it, or taste the blood from your lips as you die.\n\n\nRecommended Songs:\nRiot of Violence\nCarrion\nPleasure To Kill\nUnder The Guillotine\n",
        "\nWe all know what happened to thrash metal in the 90s and for some bands - like Kreator - it wasn't really a disadvantage (unless you ask the majority of Kreator fans). I'm very happy that Kreator got to experiment with their sound and expand it from being \"just\" a thrash metal act. 'Cause for Conflict', just like their other albums from the nineties, is different, but not too different. \n\nThis album definitely achieved something. I listened to it in heaps after i first discovered it. It's groove metal, industrial and weird, while still being pure aggressive thrash. You would think that's a really strange anomaly, which it is but it just works perfectly. I can't even really tell why, I guess the composers just did a very good job on this. Mille Petrozza and Frank Blackfire seem to be a great combination (the albums with both of these are my favourites). This album sounds so strange at times but never lacks any energy, creativity or originality. It works perfectly as what it is, a combination of groove and thrash metal combined with industrial and other weird elements. I have to add though, that \"Cause for Conflict\" really is one of the most aggressive sounding Kreator albums. The vocals are very anger led, the riffing is ridiculously tight and energetic and so are the drums. Just by hearing the album for the first time I could tell there was a different drummer on it. Joe Cangelosi is a true enrichment for this, I'm really not sure if this album would have been as good with Ventor on it, who is also a great drummer but has a different style. Cangelosi has a completely different approach which fits very well to the overall sound of this album. It gets ridiculously fast at times, but never lacks authenticity.\n\nYou could say this is some sort of modern thrash metal (I would rather use that term for albums like Phantom Antichrist though). So what is this album, post thrash metal? Not really, it's really just a thrash metal explosion with other interesting elements to it that make the whole record appear kind of weird but at the same time very interesting. It keeps your attention from beginning to end, for me at least. Maybe you can call it groove thrash metal or industrial thrash, but it really doesn't matter. To me, this album is a perfect nineties thrash metal anomaly. Some people complain about the \"shaky\" production sound and some even say it sounds boring (which I really can't understand). I'm really glad they did it the way they did it, songwriting and production sound are very well done. Every instrument (as well as the vocals) oozes Aggression and Energy, without ever feeling bland, \"Cause for Conflict\" is a very creative and interesting thrash metal album without lacking the vigor that thrash metal needs. As I said before, this album is a pretty aggressive one, much in contrary to the newer, more modern Kreator albums. However it never feels like its missing something, it got alot going on. If I had anything negative to say about this record it would be the very few slight cumbersome appearing moments, but those really barely even happen. \n\nAfter the many listenings I've had for this album, all I can say is go listen to this as soon as you can. \"Cause for Conflict\" is addictive as hell and if you have an open mind for thrash metal you will definitely like this, especially after listening to maybe one of the best final tracks ever, which wraps up this whole thing perfectly. The 90s brought us some abominations, album, band and genre wise, but this is certainly not one of them.\n",
        "\nDuring the last years, Mr. Petrozza has begun to stylize himself as a politically interested, reasonable guy, socially competent and thoughtful. A brainy man who knows more than the somewhat narrow-minded heavy metal universe, a man who has something to say. Something very important, of course. \n\nWell, that's definitely fine and everybody has the right (or even the duty) to keep a close eye on his personal development. Nevertheless, whenever Mille opens his mouth in order to vitalize our poor brains with a very thoughtful message, I have to think of lines like this one: \"My only aim is to take many lives, the more the better I feel\" or that one: \"He eats the heart of your wife and rips her cunt inside\". I know that we have to separate the artist from the person, yet this contrast always irritates me. Frankly, the entire lyrics of \"Pleasure to Kill\" are nothing else but a pile of shit (and the artwork is not much better). But here comes the good news: lyrics are absolutely irrelevant as long as we are talking about unleashed thrash metal. \"Pleasure to Kill\" contains exactly this music and furthermore, it holds a couple of excellent compositions.\n\nAs soon as the deceptive intro fades away, three berserks start immediately to demonstrate their \"Pleasure to Kill\" their instruments. Mille is ahead of the pack and spits out the nonsensical lines with a maximum of hate and anger. Ventor, who delivers the lead vocals on three tracks, makes sure that there is a certain variety. His voice sounds less hateful, but more masculine and more controlled. Anyway, both singers convince with a highly aggressive performance. Anything else would have been inappropriate in view of the musical content. Kreator use the heavy artillery. \"Pleasure to Kill\" is more vehement than \"Agent Orange\", it sounds much more brutal than \"Zombie Attack\" and it delivers a rougher form of violence than \"Infernal Overkill\". The songs are characterized by high velocity, stormy riffs and flattening leads. Furthermore, the smell of decay fills the air. Although I am not a fan of the artwork, I must admit that it reflects the atmosphere of this milestone of German thrash metal very well.\n\nKreator manage the challenge to integrate tiny melodies without hurting the brutality of their songs. \"The Pestilence\" holds a short, almost melodic part from 4:45 to 5:33, but even the here presented melody line does not lack of a specific gruesomeness. However, violent sections dominate the album. A small number of sequences borders on chaos. \"Carrion\", for example, is kicked off by a noisy solo. Shortly afterwards, hectic guitars are accompanied by equally nervous drums and both create a violent staccato. Nevertheless, the band does not lose control. Instead, the three-piece delivers some jewels of extreme thrash. Both the title track and \"Riot of Violence\" score with surprisingly catchy choruses, \"Ripping Corpse\" impresses due to its sheer fury and the closer \"Under the Guillotine\" leaves a final trace of devastation with regard to its piercing guitar work and the simple yet sustainable chorus. \"The Pestilence\" wins the award for the most epic battle. But it goes without saying that I also want to provide you with the titles of the downers of this work. Here they are: ---- . That's not much? Sorry, but there is nothing more to say in this context. Only a real human competence centre, Mille for example, would be able to add an intelligent comment.\n",
        "\nTogether with \"Sentence of Death\" and \"Expurse of Sodomy\", \"Flag of Hate\" constitutes the triumvirate of classic Teutonic thrash EPs. And just like the outputs of Destruction and Sodom, it delivered fantastic non-album tracks. Even the revised version of the title track appeared as a completely new track. What had happened to Kreator? It seemed as if they had been imprisoned in their rehearsal room between the release of the debut and the here reviewed vinyl, because the new \"Flag of Hate\" sounded so incredibly tight, compact and precise. Vice versa, all kind of awkwardness had vanished. One could not believe that this was still the same band that had recorded the great yet slightly amateurish \"Endless Pain\". Already the original version of the track had been energizing, but now the guys offered a pure stimulant. Not to mention the unleashed violence which was expressed by this straight, hyper-fast and fanatic piece. In addition, the sound engineer also left his mark while giving the solo guitar a very exposed position. If one ever wanted to know the origin of the term \"screaming guitars\", the solo of \"Flag of Hate\" gives the answer. But the following pieces also featured piercing, extremely loud solo guitars. This brings me to the next piece, the heavyweight \"Take Their Lives\".\n\nThe sawing guitars at the beginning form an extremely effective fundament for the song. Although or exactly because of the fact that Kreator do not put the focus on high-speed, \"Take Their Lives\" develops a spooky viciousness and the slightly tricky drum rhythm of this tune reflects the newly gained musicianship of the guys. As already indicated, the guitar solos sound one more time like the cries of a bunch of tortured slaves and a small number of tempo changes ensures a dynamic overall impression. From my point of view, this number belongs to the best tracks that the band has ever written, no more, no less. By contrast, \"Awakening of the Gods\" is slightly weaker, because its (good) guitar work does not reach the outstanding level of the other tunes and its chorus does not possess a compelling line. Yet it is a more than solid number that also illustrates the compositional progress of the band. In terms of complexity, \"Awakening of the Gods\" pushes all songs of the debut into the minor positions.\n\nThe sound of the EP can be described as skullcrushing, to put it mildly. Kreator fabricate a powerful inferno. They leave no stone unturned to destroy any kind of harmony and they are successful in doing so. \"Flag of Hate\" does not have the sharpness of Sodom's most famous EP, but its vehemence is absolutely exciting. Thus, this comparatively opulent output with a duration of almost 18 minutes belongs to the most impressive releases of the three-piece, because it shows a more or less mature (but still ferocious) formation that had not yet begun to think about business mechanisms. In short, it marked a worthy harbinger of their next album, the great \"Pleasure to Kill\".\n",
        "\nSome years ago, Mille spoke in an interview about \"Endless Pain\". He said that Noise Records had booked the studio for two weeks. Yet the band members were very proud of the fact that they were able to finish the recordings within ten days. In hindsight, Mille could no longer understand this amateurish, anti-perfectionist behaviour. But it gets even \"better\". Quite frankly, the album sounds like it has been recorded not within ten days, but within ten hours. Anyway, exactly the non-professional approach and the fairly awkward production lend Kreator's debut its special charm. Although it is defaced with one of these shitty Lawvere paintings, \"Endless Pain\" has become an important time document, not only because of the amazing career of the band, but also because of its musical content.\n\nOkay, one cannot say that the album was highly original. Kreator wanted to sound as demonic, evil and abnormal as possible, but their closest competitors, Destruction and Sodom, pursued the same target. Furthermore, \"Endless Pain\" holds some riffs that had previously been used by others. \"Total Death\", for example, reproduces the riffs of the chorus of \"Strike of the Beast\". Don't get me wrong, I don't think that the trio copied these sounds deliberately. It is just a fact that a few parts of the album lie in close proximity to sections of other tunes. Yet Kreator also wrote outstanding guitar lines that triggered a fresh and energizing breeze. \"Bonebreaker\", a close relative of \"Total Death\", started with a riff that had the power to wake the dead in a matter of seconds. Both \"Bonebreaker\" and \"Total Death\" demonstrated that the young J\u00fcrgen \"Ventor\" Reil was able to manage very fast rhythms. \"Tormentor\" is another straight, unfussy and fast-paced rocket, but Kreator had slower fragments in their repertoire as well. Thus, let's put an eye on \"Storm of the Beast\".\n\nIts beginning celebrates the triumph of simplicity. Ventor plays a primitive four-four time and a forceful guitar sets in and increases the tension. The song turns out to be another speed-driven, ugly monster, but its chorus slows down the tempo and the ending picks up the intro sequence again in order to close the cycle. \"Storm of the Beast\" does not show the highest compositional brilliance, but it is coherent and catchy in its own way. \"Cry War\", another fine mix of mid-paced and rapid parts, follows a similar line. By contrast, exactly the opener and title track creates nothing else but an awkward sounding noise and I also never understood the structure of \"Son of Evil\", despite its actually strong beginning. Well, as the oh so wise guys like to say, every beginning is hard. Even the special thanks section was strange. It listed their parents (good boys!) as well as \"the girls that we f**k\" (not so good boys!). But how many girls wanted to be f**ked by one of these three unwashed outsiders? One? Or even none at all? \n\nDespite these irritating details, Kreator's debut was an important statement. It made clear once and for all that energy, ambition and conviction beat technical musicianship. Unlike the aforementioned guys of Destruction and Sodom, they did not start with an EP, but with a complete album and therefore we got the full dose of juvenile anger. Even in 2017, Mille's, Ventor's and Rob's thirst for action is still tangible. Inspiration was the magic word for the band as well as for its noise making surrounding. The movie \"Thrash, Altenessen\", which is available on YouTube, shows the fairly harmonic yet restrictive working-class milieu where the band members grew up. Furious thrash was the tool to break these chains. Nobody could foresee that Kreator would become a force to be reckoned with, but one thing was certain: this debut came straight from the heart. Among other things, this feature makes \"Endless Pain\" so valuable.\n",
        "\nAdmitting unfamiliarity with latter day Kreator might mark me unfit to review this new Kreator single, \"Earth Under The Sword,\" as my Kreator fandom kinda petered out after Coma Of Souls. That said, for over a decade now, I've heard and read so much good stuff about Kreator's return to thrash that I felt it was finally time to see what's up. What's up is that Kreator have definitely got their swagger back, that they've taken their brand of Teutonic thrash in a more melodic direction, and that their production aesthetic is far too slick and plastic for my liking. \n\nI won't deny that I enjoyed this song. But with some major reservations. The guitar riffs and drum lines are bitingly sharp, with a kind of choppy mid-tempo groove that easily set my head a-bangin'. The noodling melodic guitar lines beneath the anthemic chorus was less appealing and kinda cheesy, undercutting Mille's fist pumping message. Ditto the actual solo, totally standard glossy melo-cheese. So while I dug the riffs and grooves, and found Mille's voice in fine fettle, I was less enthused with the more melodic elements, as well as a production job far too bright and shiny. Not really a thrash tune, this is the kinda mid-tempo track thrash bands use to pad their track lists and rest their chops. Fine for what it is but there's a reason this track was left off their forthcoming album.\n\nSo, is this indicative of all latter-day Kreator? Probably not. But does it make me really want to dig into their more recent output? Not really. Put me in the camp that prefers the band's barbarous older work over their more recent imperiality.\n",
        "\n\u2018Endorama\u2019 is Kreator\u2019s most controversial album for a reason. It\u2019s just not a very good reason. Sure, it\u2019s not the thrash metal that the Germans are known for, but flirting with new wave, postpunk and early gothrock influences has made the record unique, both in Kreator\u2019s disography and in the European metal scene. People might think you may have to look for riffs between the atmospherics, but \u2018Endorama\u2019 is still very much a guitar driven album. A rather memorable one at that. Only the fact that their masterpiece \u2018Coma Of Souls\u2019 was released in 1990 keeps this from being Kreator\u2019s best nineties record.\n\nMaybe the presence of former Coroner guitarist Tommy Vetterli has left people with the wrong expectations. Instead of bringing the complexity of the Swiss geniuses with him, his Kreator debut \u2018Outcast\u2019 is the band\u2019s simplest record to date. Here, his influence is most felt in the production. The shoddy industrial leanings of the previous three records are exorcised in favor of a more atmospheric, layered approach that feels a little like what Coroner did on \u2018Grin\u2019. The main difference is that \u2018Endorama\u2019 borrows from the goth scene, bringing to mind The Sisters Of Mercy, Bauhaus and late eighties Killing Joke.\n\nAdmittedly, the low budget video of suited-up frontman Mille Petrozza in a nightclub was a little awkward, but \u2018Chosen Few\u2019 is actually a really good song. The rhythm may be borrowed from Killing Joke\u2019s \u2018Love Like Blood\u2019, but it\u2019s effective. In fact, never before or since has J\u00fcrgen \u2018Ventor\u2019 Reil\u2019s drum work had so much swing. Petrozza\u2019s surprisingly intimate vocal performance also works wonders. Another highlight is \u2018Shadowland\u2019, probably the most \u201cmetal\u201d song on the album. The main theme is excellent and memorable, while the riff work gives the song a vibe somewhat reminiscent of Nevermore.\n\nEasily the most gothic moment on the record is \u2018Passage To Babylon\u2019, with its strong focus on Christian Giesler\u2019s bass line and the piano part. Petrozza\u2019s voice has a somewhat tormented quality, which really adds to the dark atmosphere of the track. The subtle orchestral samples in \u2018Everlasting Flame\u2019 are also something that could only appear on this Kreator record. Closing track \u2018Tyranny\u2019 improves upon the \u2018Outcast\u2019 formula by better dynamics and a really strong melodic theme, while the remarkably upbeat, catchy opener \u2018Golden Age\u2019 could at the time have been a minor hit for any band without Kreator\u2019s prominent thrash metal history.\n\nWhile the album does wane a little bit towards the end \u2013 \u2018Soul Eraser\u2019 and the relatively riffy \u2018Pandemonium\u2019 aren\u2019t quite as strong as the rest of the record \u2013 and more variation in the tempos may have made it even better, \u2018Endorama\u2019 is a record full of well-written songs, strong performances and an excellent production. Petrozza is rightfully still proud of the record. And that\u2019s a good thing, because I hate it when musicians try to cover up their willful experiments. If you\u2019re not a thrash conservative, give the album a chance. Just forget that the band ever recorded \u2018Pleasure To Kill\u2019 and let these amazing songs work their magic. It\u2019s well worthy of your attention.\n\nRecommended tracks: \u2018Shadowland\u2019, \u2018Chosen Few\u2019, \u2018Passage To Babylon\u2019\n\nOriginally written for my Kevy Metal weblog\n",
        "\nThe early German thrash has a special kind of appeal, largely due to its rawness and unrelenting approach, and of the Teutonic thrashers, Kreator were ahead of the rest in rawness and extremity by some way. This album in particular has gained a reputation for being one of the most ferocious assaults in thrash metal, while also drawing criticism because of its single-minded nature. I am not especially partial to all-out musical destruction, but I must say that Pleasure to Kill is one of the best examples of its kind, almost certainly better than that other 1986 all-out thrash album.\n\nFirst off, the levels of intensity are quite awesome to behold on some of the songs here, especially the sledgehammer blows of 'Ripping Corpse' and 'Death Is Your Saviour'. On these numbers, there are no moments when the band step down from furious fast pace, nor any hints of mercy or loss of concentration. Some bands have managed the same level of crazed intensity, but have rarely been able to keep the musical quality as consistently high as Kreator do here, pouring riffs and changes from a seemingly never-ending supply and matching parts together without the stitches showing. The first time the Germans relent is halfway through the title track, after a solid 10 minutes of punishment, only for Mille Petroza to growl his way through a set of lyrics in his grim guttural voice that sees him buried for ever in a grave. The more melodic 'Riot of Violence' and mid-paced sections of 'The Pestilence' show that the band can also be deliberately memorable when they want to.\n\nWhat impresses the most about Pleasure to Kill is not that Kreator managed to make a terrifyingly intense thrash album, but more that they managed to do it while sounding extremely sharp and tight as well as pissed and bloodthirsty. Compared to Destruction and Sodom in 1986, as well as some of the other early thrash bands from the USA, the three-piece are astonishingly well-controlled in their changes of pace, links between sections, and general interplay, allowing songs to spin on a pinhead and keep excitement high at all times. The drums are handled with admirable skill and creativity, never becoming generic or overbearing, the bass also occupying a great position and keeping everything super-heavy, while the rhythm guitar sound is incredible, having power, speed, and dirt in equal measures. (These comments relate to the Noise Records reissue, released with the Flag of Hate EP.) The only part of the recipe that is less than great is the lead guitar, which has a rather screamy tone and generally is responsible for chaotic yet ill-defined solos, mostly in the same scale. While those solos do fit the intensity, they can't give the finishing touch to the music, actually robbing it of its clinical edge. Understandably, Petroza recorded all guitar parts on his own, so perhaps there wasn't a lot of jamming and rehearsal done on the solos, although there are nice melodic interchanges that surface in 'Carrion' and 'Riot of Violence' that rise to the level expected.\n\nPleasure to Kill is probably an album best experienced in its entirety because of the cumulative effect of its savagery and the minor amounts of contrast that mid-paced thrash breaks and melodic sections introduce. The pick of the bunch might just go to 'Carrion' and 'Ripping Corpse', which satisfy as the most skillfully assembled and the most eye-poppingly vicious respectively. 'Carrion' has a great set of riffs (actually, so do all the songs...) that do light and shadow in addition to momentum, while the breakdown around the 2:30 mark is a great touch and has an awesome chugging riff to go with it. 'Ripping Corpse' is full-on lethal thrash, but shows how Kreator dealt with upping the intensity of their music, by tearing into glowering tremolo riffs when the down-picking of thrash wasn't enough, breaking the boundary into death metal and shifting the atmosphere a notch further into the fires of madness. The other songs don't lag far behind, though the closing two and some parts of 'The Pestilence' are marginally less memorable than the rest.\n\nReally one of the pillars of thrash metal and almost certainly the best example of thrash at its most intense (Kreator's other albums included), Pleasure to Kill is a phenomenal listen from start to finish. Even the intro is fitting and well-executed, which goes to show the quality of the whole product. You owe yourself a listen to this - like, now.\n",
        "\nAlright peoples, Extreme Aggression, my favorite Kreator album. Yes, I said it, this is my favorite Kreator album. The so-called weak point in Kreator's early career that is sandwiched between the technical yet vicious monster Terrible Certainty and the completely fuckin' godly Coma of Souls that outshines almost every thrash album ever. I just, you know, like this one more. Extreme Aggression was where Kreator started polishing their blade a little bit; they started out hacking people to death with a jagged, blood-stained battle axe but around Terrible Certainty and this one, they began introducing more streamlined songwriting elements, better crafted and catchier riffs, and an overall smarter approach to the thrash. \n\nIf you're like me, that smarter approach to thrash absolutely kicks ass. The nonstop mayhem offered on Pleasure to Kill was bliss to some listeners, but people like me quickly grow bored of the one dimensional assault that albums like that provide. I've always liked a sort of middle ground between rape-all-who-oppose thrash and catchy thrash; thrash albums that seamlessly combine aggression and tons of energy with a lethal ear for melody, memorability, and crafty riffs and thrash sections are my favorites, and let me tell you, this album is all of that and a bag of chips. It may not be as ass-rapingly vicious as early Kreator but this album flawlessly shows off Mille and the gang's vitriol and mixes it with a badass helping of old school thrash riffing and some catchy as hell thrash breaks. \n\nThe result of that somewhat contradictory mix is absolutely brilliant. This album is like that neapolitan ice cream but without the strawberry because fuck strawberry. You get some of the best riffs ever to be played in thrash metal - displayed by \"Betrayer\", \"Extreme Aggressions\", \"Fatal Energy\" and \"Dont Trust\" (the most underrated Kreator songs EVER), and \"No Reason to Exist\" - as well a brutal dose of properly injected anger and just all out viciousness. The songs shift from brutal and aggressive to catchy and swinging on a dime, and every song packs some absolutely lethal riffs for every situation. Kreator show off their ability to weave through the musical maelstrom they create by making clever use of both speedy, borderline death-thrash riffs and more straightforward, old school thrash riffs in tandem with each other. The riffs are catchy yet heavy and the songs all feature a nice mix of clean-cut craziness and straightforward thrash. The results are amazing, this album manages to be energetic and exciting but simultaneously memorable and catchy. All of this is golden. This album does not get boring. \n\nSo there ya have it, it's not a popular opinion, but it's my opinion nonetheless and I'll love it, cherish it, feed it, all that good stuff that one does with opinions. Extreme Aggression really does represent everything to love about a mixture of aggressive and catchy thrash styles. Many people see albums like this as unfortunate weakenings in musicianship or even as selling out, but this is really a band making stellar use of their inherent brutality and tempering it with a very well-done, more streamlined thrash assault that never fails to be tons of fun. This is my favorite Kreator album without a doubt, passing Coma by just a hair. This is also among my top 5 thrash albums of all time. I can't get enough of this album, and if a thrash album with a focus on riffs and toned down brutality sounds appealing, I can't recommend it enough. I consider this album to be top notch thrash, and while most disagree, Extreme Aggression is that perfect middle ground between straight brutality and riff-happy catchiness. This kicks ass. I strongly recommend it.\n",
        "\nAs you have guessed correctly, dear metal brother or sister, the sound found in Kreator's seventh LP is quite similar to Slayer's release from one year before this one. And that is, modern thrash with hints of groove metal and, in this case, also some of the industrial components from the Germans previous material, Renewal. 1995's Cause for Conflict is an anomaly in the band's discography: It is their only Ventor-less release, replaced here by American drummer Joe Cangelosi, which sounds closer to Paul Bostaph in sound than to its German predecessor, one of the many comparisons I can think of between this and Slayer's also ill-reputed album from the mid-nineties. There are two small, under two-minute ragers in \u201cBomb Threat\u201d and \u201cDogmatic\u201d, akin to \u201cSex. Murder. Art.\u201d and even the color palette of their covers are similar, both bands abandoning the often quite predominant red tones and opting for a cooler, darker feel. \n\nBut it is the production's work what makes this one sound like the younger and inferior brother of Divine Intervention, as both bands opted for a heavier, lower-end sound, perhaps to compete with the groove metal scene and the more underground death metal appearing at both sides of the Atlantic. This is most noticeably in the drums mixing, which are louder than on previous albums, with emphasis on the dry pummeling of the double bass drum, along with muscular throbbing sound of the bass guitar, though forgetting a bit about the cymbals and plates. The guitars also deliver quite the punch, but Mille's vocals, though aggressive as usual, end up a bit low in the mix and sound quite compressed, a loss of balance that ultimately renders the sound of this album unconvincing and imperfect. And that is of course, aside from the totally unspectacular compositions. The riffs range from fast palm mutes to slow groovy chugs, but none of that variety helps to conjure something worthy of bearing Kreator's name on it. Speesy's bass sometimes follows the guitar lines, but other times ventures a bit outside of the box, and with an interesting sound it\u2019s somewhat of a highlight. Cangelosi employs some virulent tom fills and pulverizing double bass work, and his performance is also one of the brightest here, but given the poor choice in riffs, his power is lost amidst the grey. And the solos are particularly weak for a Kreator release.\n\nThough I wouldn't include any of the twelve tunes here in a hypothetical Kreator Best Of, some of my preferred are \u201cCatholic Despot\u201d, which features punishing drum work by Cangelosi, and Kerry King-esque soloing, and its following companion \u201cProgressive Proletarians\u201d, in which Kreator's old demonic form somewhat materializes again, though not entirely. I even feel Mille's voice almost sounding like 80s' Mille. Track number four, the slower \u201cCrisis of Disorder\u201d also has its merits with an eerie melody somewhere between Slayer and Killing Joke, some stops and go and a more worked solo (by this album standards). Though the song's potential is not fully reached, its middle section becoming again a generic mess of this albums uninspiring elements, I can almost picture it appearing as an Enemy of God bonus track, imagining it with that album's superior production values. The two shorter tracks are the sweetest, but suffer the Reign in Blood disease and are too goddamn short for their own good. I was curious and hopeful about the almost 12-minute closer, \u201cIsolation\u201d, expecting Kreator to go nuts and experiment a lot, but the truth is that the slow paced song's actual length is just 4 minutes. Again, this reminds me of 90s Slayer, in particular their tune \u201cGemini\u201d from Undisputed Attitude, but boring. I'll save you 4 minutes and 40 seconds of your time, which is the silence inserted into the track, after which you'll get a reminding 3:15 of animal slaughterhouse noises that will end this record playing time. On second thought, just skip this track altogether. \n\nEven when they chose to revisit their thrashier roots of old to a degree, something is missing here. The tunes are not particularly memorable; they feel like a decently violent thrash battering with groovy grit but with no real spirit at its core. The production doesn't help, but apart from that the riffs, solos and lyrics come and go without long-lasting impact on the listener, and thus the album feels like a grey, long multi-part song with few discernible highlights, though on the other hand there are no horrible lows in quality either. Despite Cangelosi's brutal and sometimes interesting performance, different from Ventor's usual feel, Cause for Conflict ends up more like a failure than a triumphant return to form. Sill, for 90s standards, this is probably as thrashy as Kreator could get, thus making it listenable and enjoyable to a degree\u2026 for Kreator enthusiasts like myself, that is. The 90s were thrash metal's wormhole travel to the 21st Century, and the few stops at mid trip are not that enticing in 99.9% percent of the cases. This isn't that 00.1%, I can assure you that.\n",
        "\nAh ze Germans are here. These guys have to be my favourite thrash band from Germany along with Destruction and Sodom. While Destruction was widely known for the infamous buzz-saw guitar tone and Sodom has an infectious punk vibe mixed in with their brand of Teutonic thrash, Kreator were the crowning jewel of Teutonic thrash, starting off as pure aggression while slowly incorporating other elements into their brand of thrash. This album arguably represents them at their peak of innovation, with every track bursting to the seam with badass melodies, scintillating riffs along with every member of the band locked into the groove with the precision of a sniper, from the moment the acoustic intro of \u201cWhen The Sun Burns Red\u201d fades out. This song is arguably one of their best containing a freaking truckload of riffs enough to fill two songs and an amazing solo to boot. The thrash-fest is just beginning folks, so prepare your back and neck already. You\u2019re about to get the beating of your lives with this. \n\nThe first thing that stands out is the superbly varied guitarwork. Now Kreator in the beginning was the main band waving the flash of brutal thrash with the Endless Pain EP and their sophomore debut. Post \u201cTerrible Certainty\u201d they started introducing more elements of melody and technicality into their music as opposed to the straightforward brutality of \u201cPleasure To Kill\u201d. This album is the perfect mix of all those elements into one sparkling diamond of thrash. The fist-pumping guitar tone is massive and will carve you up into little slices of flesh only to shit and piss on your remains. Most of the songs are faced paced with a few mid-paced moments which are there, but are few and far between. One of the very few thrash albums where there are equal parts melody and brutality and neither of the two elements are compromised for the sake of one another. There are so many thrash/death metal albums that just seem to follow \u201cExtremity for extremity\u2019s sake\u201d syndrome making them plain unmemorable and boring after a few spins. Not this one. Even the solos are not at all the usual chromatic flurries of thrash and death, resembling more of the classic feel of NWOBHM, making for yet another delightful contrast. \n\nMille Petrozza\u2019s vocals have certainly improved by leaps and bounds compared to the raspier vocals of the previous albums only to unleash his inner beast within on this album with the vicious snarling of black metal coupled with the traditional death metal growl. Needless to say, the vocals sound punishing and venomous as hell. Every single effing song is a standout people from the vicious technical riffs and choppy rhythms of \u201cComa Of Souls\u201d, \u201cHidden Dictator\u201d, \u201cMaterial World Paranoia\u201d (one SICK outro!) and \u201cAgents Of Brutality\u201d to melodic thrashers like \u201cTerror Zone\u201d and \u201cMental Slavery\u201d. When you\u2019re struggling to pick standout tracks, you instantly know that that\u2019s the sign of a classic album. Even to this day with kickass albums like Enemy Of God and Phantom Antichrist, Kreator have yet to surpass the brilliance of this album IMO, which is a testament by itself as to how damn good this album (still) is. \n\nAll in all, one of the classics of thrash. And seriously, what more could you want? If you are a thrash fan and are yet to hear it, you honestly should be ashamed. Kindly get your ass moving and do the needful. Oh and before you do anything else, listen to one of the best, most brutal thrash songs ever, namely \u201cPeople Of The Lie\u201d with one of the most amazing guitar solos I have ever heard. God-bustlingly epic and overflowing with melodic ecstasy in every sense of the word. Can\u2019t even begin to tell you how many times I\u2019ve put this track on repeat. The headbanging that ensues is guaranteed to cause permanent spine and neck trauma. Take my word for it.\n",
        "\nTeutonic thrash metal band Kreator is known as being one of the more aggressive and violent groups of the 80's. It's easy to see why, as they exploded onto the scene with the aggressive debut, Endless Pain, and the unrelenting insanity of Pleasure to Kill. Their sound would continue to develop through the latter half of the 80's with Terrible Certainty and one of my personal favorites, Extreme Aggression. As the band progressed further, they learned to hone their incredible energy. They would begin to add more melodic sections and more mid paced thrash parts to their compositions, which is very evident on Extreme Aggression; but while that one was a little more developed than the previous three, their more focused sound would reach near perfection on their 1990 masterpiece: Coma of Souls. \n\nThe song structures of Coma of Souls tend to vary from track to track, but they tend to each contain a blend of both aggressive, speedy, and sometimes frenetic sections and more focused, mid paced bridge sections. One would think to use the word \"Restrained\", but that isn't a very good adjective at all for this. Truth is, the album never actually runs out of steam. While the tracks go through their various parts, they never let up on the creativity or ingenuity, making use of a myriad of different timings, riffs, and drum fills. One of the album's greatest assets is its outstanding diversity that doesn't sacrifice consistency. It is easy for an album to give up consistency to attempt to throw in some unique songs here and there. A lot of times, this can really hurt an album. A great example of what I mean is Testament's New Order. That album tries to add dimension and atmosphere by placing a handful of spacey clean interludes throughout the album. In the end, it really damages the album's structural integrity, and it leads to the skipping of a few tracks here and there. Coma of Souls never gives up its brilliant heaviness and aggression for creativity; it brings character and creativity to the table naturally through lots of unique melodic sections and creative riffing resulting in a very enjoyable thrash experience that never seems forced. \n\nThe general sound of the album can be seen as akin to the previous releases; there is no shortage of super heavy and sometimes complex riffs. Also, the general brutality and anger, while a little tamer, is still alive and well here. Even the simplest song on the album, \"People of the Lie\", is kept on the level of the other songs with Mille's angry vocals and excellent drum work with the addition of a great solo. Songs like \"World Beyond\" or \"Twisted Urges\" would fit right in on with some of the old Kreator albums, but these two are kept a cut above due to the extremely focused musicianship and the absolutely fantastic production. Songs like the energetic and riveting \"Agents of Brutality\", and the uniquely constructed mid paced \"Terror Zone\" show off Kreator's new, enhanced sound at the time; both of which, of course, feature more of Mille's signature harsh vocals. \"When the Sun Burns Red\" even starts off with an acoustic intro, something of a clich\u00e9 when it comes to metal album intros, but it quickly changes colors as the song blasts into a fast and frenetic alt-picked riff with blazing drums and then a fitting (and rather menacing) scream from Mille. The song ends with some melodic soloing and mid paced riffing, and it overall sets an example of greatness that the album will follow until it finishes. \n\nIt's remarkable how well the songs transition from aggressive sections to more mid paced sections, and sometimes the very melodic solos act as a perfect means for the songs to flow from section to section. Never will you hear any abrupt stops or awkward transitions, the album is built fantastically and as a result, it's pretty freaking great from start to finish. On some other thrash albums, you can tell that the musicians were caught up in trying to force a certain sound or try to get a specific effect that ends up undermining the final product in the long run. For instance, an album might be violent for the sake of being violent; or the other way around if a band tries to sound more commercial and it ends up sounding weak, or worse, like an effort at selling out. I definitely could've have seen Kreator musically derailing after their first few albums, either trying one or the other of what I previously described, but what we have here is pure, aggressive yet focused talent and musicianship. When I listen to Coma of Souls, it's astonishing to hear how developed it is without sacrificing even the smallest fragment of aggression; truly a feat to behold. \n\nThe production, as I said earlier, is spectacular. There is a sublime clarity to the mix that is not present enough on the vast majority of metal (especially thrash) albums. Often times clarity and overproduction can lead to a record that sounds weak, thin, and I like to use the word \"papery\". There is no such papery here as the album retains a badass punch to the guitars and drums, with the solos soaring above with near perfect sound quality. Even the bass, which is not usually a staple of this band's music, is prominent and gritty sounding. Whenever Rob does get to snag a little spotlight (\"Hidden Dictator\" intro), his bass sounds fantastic. Overall, the production value on Coma of Souls is one of the best I've ever heard, and I'm usually pretty effing picky about production.\n\nThe musicianship on Coma of Souls is nothing short of fantastic. Ever since the beginning of this band, they have showed incredible musical prowess and stamina, but on here that sheer energy is tempered with an impressive focus that really knocks this out of the park. Nobody is weak here, the addition of Frank \"Blackfire\" Gosdzik of the Sodom fame is the icing on the cake too. The addition of Frank adds an element of more technical string work and brilliant soloing. In my opinion, someone like this is exactly what the band needed. In addition to him we have the other three members: Mille and his wicked riffing and pissed off vocals, Ventor's insane drumming, and Rob Fioretti's adept and tasteful bass playing. The result is a far above average thrash metal outfit. \n\nThe biggest barrier that might keep someone from enjoying Kreator's music is definitely Mille Petrozza's voice. He has a very thick, higher pitched, aggressive, and sometimes scary sounding vocal approach. Ventor doesn't sing on this one like he did on some of the old stuff, so it's Mille handling the vocals completely. I can't lie at all, I hated the vocals at first, but now I love them. His angry raspy voice fits the music and makes you wanna punch a tree. Totally awesome thrash vocalist. I find that his approach is masterfully pulled off here, even if he doesn't actually sing by definition, he is a beast of a vocalist and I have to give him huge props. Also, if you are new to Kreator and don't mind his voice, definitely check out their previous records, they're amazing. \n\nMille also contributes to the guitar work of the album, a role in which he previously performed single-handed. His riffing is creative and heavy, and his solos aren't bad at all. Usually it will be him going nuts or handling the slower, more melodic bits while it is Frank taking on the masterfully played high speed melodic solos. I don't quite know who is the primary riff writer, but regardless, each are fantastic. Some of my favorite solos are the ones from \"When the Sun Burns Red\" and \"People of the Lie\". While there are so many that I can't really pick favorites, but I will say that the last few minutes of \"When the Sun Burns Red\" and most of \"Terror Zone\" are some of my favorites. \n\nThe rhythm section is fan-flipping-tastic, if not a little bit lopsided. Ventor is an absolute drumming monster. His skills are undeniably profound, and his incredible stamina, speed, and dexterity of fills really sets the bar high. His ridiculous energy from the first couple albums, like the other members, has been focused and tempered, resulting in a masterful performance that never overdoes anything. He never abuses blast-beats or double bass or anything like that, and when the songs really pick up, his percussive brilliance keeps up magnificently. Ventor's got one of my favorite thrash performances right here. Rob is quite out-shined by his fellow rhythm man, but that doesn't mean he is bad. His playing can be likened to maybe Ian Hill, but a lot better. Rob Fioretti tends to play more basic bass lines and stick to the game plan, and while this isn't my favorite type of bass playing, he gets the job done well. His tone is thick and crisp, with an ability to punch through the music without overpowering anything. A very solid performance from him. Overall, fantastic rhythm section. \n\nSo there we have it, Coma of Souls is more than worthy of its legendary status as one of the very best thrash metal albums ever. Even though it is not as popular as some other thrash albums, it stands up to the best of them. The sheer consistency of this alone makes earns it high points, but consistency isn't everything. This record combines that fist-clenching, angry aggression with which Kreator made a name for themselves with a focused and powerful melodic sense that makes this album just golden. Add the top-notch production, and you really cannot get too much better than this; it really comes down to personal preference. I strongly recommend this to thrash metal fans who have not heard this, it is utterly brilliant. Fans of lighter thrash metal, if they can learn to like Mille's voice, would enjoy a lot of this as well, as it is a great mixing of aggression and melody that I think most thrash metal fans will enjoy. If you have not yet gotten into Kreator, this should probably be your first listen. Coma of Souls never gets old the more and more I listen to it, the talent and musicianship behind this is insane. Definitely snag this if you can, it's one of the best. \n\n\"Spirits on ice \nthey'll never be free!\nOne dimensional lives \nwill the coma of souls outlive eternity?!\"\n",
        "\nMost of the time words like \"savage,\" \"visceral,\" \"aggressive' and \"primal\" are overused in heavy metal reviews. Every third-rate thrash or death band gets painted with such phrases, even though often you end up feeling as if M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce's \"Smoking In The Boys Room\" would be more aggressive and in-your-face. But one album that can only be described by such violent description is Kreator's phenomenal 1985 debut, Endless Pain. \n\nIf later Kreator can be imagined as battalions of riot police methodically striking down all opposition, then Endless Pain is a group of soccer hooligans obsessed with nothing but inflicting wanton violence upon anyone. Indeed the music seldom lets up. It's fast, furious and angry. Very often such a premise can be monotonous with albums thrashing through at similar pace without much variation. Kreator avoids this by writing actual distinct songs, each with their own central musical themes and hooks. The band is not afraid of throwing in some more traditional heavy metal and punk elements a la \"Cry War\" or \"Storm of the Beast.\" \n\nDual vocalists also help maintain a sense of variation. Mille presents a more high-pitched shrill rasp, whereas drummer Ventor rumbles along in a more guttural style that would be at home on many an early death or black metal album. The riffs are phenomenal, being both memorable and primal. It's in fact hard to believe this a three-piece.\n\nThere is very much a form of youthful exuberance that other, more established bands like Metallica, Slayer and Anthrax had already started replacing with a more serious and more metallic approach. Indeed this sounds more like it belongs in 1983 with the likes of Show No Mercy or Kill 'Em All than in 1985. \n\nTracks such as \"Endless Pain,\" \"Total Death,\" \"Bonebreaker\" and \"Flag of Hate\" are quintessential slabs of thrash. Even when the composition is flawed on songs such as \"Cry War,\" there's still an infectious, violent groove that makes them enjoyable. And such flawed moments are few and far between.\n\nThe production is primitive but that's part of the charm. A more polished approach would have reduced the impact of primal, barbaric thrash metal. The remastered version was done well enough to make the music quite accessible whilst maintaining the sense of primal violence.\n\nIn the end Endless Pain attains a form of perfection based not on technical playing and production, but rather as the definition of extremely violent yet memorable thrash metal.\n",
        "\nAlmost three years after the first release under \"The Big Teutonic Four\" banner, Germany's leading thrash metal bands Destruction, Kreator, Sodom and Tankard are back with another short offering of four cover songs of bands that inspired their early careers. This time, we get to hear four quite different covers of four completely different bands. None of the songs is an exclusive release and some versions are almost already thirty years old. That's why you should make sure to purchase this release with the German Rock Hard magazine and not separately on vinyl at a more expensive price because it simply wouldn't be worth it.\n\nOverall, the four songs are all quite solid but far from extraordinary while the first compilation had passionate ups but also disappointing downs. Kreator's unusual take on Raven's \"Lambs to the Slaughter\" sounds more melodic, rocking and tame than I would have expected which is a positive surprise to me since I like Kreator's more melodic material. Sodom's version of Tank's \"Walk Away\" also sounds surprisingly clean, grooving and rocking which makes this track the catchiest on the compilation. Destruction's Tribute to Saxon's \"Princess of the Night\" is a little bit more enthusiastic, faster and poignant which makes their reinterpretation sound the most authentic and interesting on this output. Tankard's homage to Iron Maiden's band anthem \"Iron Maiden\" lacks creativity and sounds extremely close to the original and suffers from average vocal efforts, a more limited drum play and a production that is almost as flawed as the original version despite the better productional possibilities for the German thrashers.\n\nWhile I liked Kreator's and Tankard's version the most on the first part of this compilation series, I clearly prefer Sodom's and Destruction's efforts on here even if they are not outstanding either. All in all, this release is a nice gimmick for an extensive metal collection as a free giveaway for a magazine but nothing memorable or worth spending much money or time on. There's a reason why these four tracks were originally released as b-sides and one should stick to the original versions from the eighties and the band's own material.\n",
        "\nWhile heavy metal was having its peak in the U.S. and the U.K., other scenes, such as the Teutonic, developed extreme metal music that was faster, rawer and more violent than ever thought. An important part of the extreme metal history was marked by the release of three albums in 1986 that formed the so-called \"Unholy Trinity\". Kreator's \"Pleasure to Kill\" was one of the albums that formed the \"Unholy Trinity\" and it became a classic and an influential album for further death metal bands, such as Morbid Angel. Its aggressive and raw sound had been remaining as a trademark of the band for almost one decade, and this album is one of the best Teutonic metal releases. The structure of the album is very cohesive, thus it does not allow filling stuff, nor shitty tracks.\n\nIn general terms and as mentioned above, the sound of the album is raw and somehow primitive, and it is mainly influenced by Venom (e.g., if you pay attention to the title-song, you will notice that it is an upbeated version of \"Bloodlust\"). The songs are constantly fast with just many bridges in which they are slowed-down. The violent drumming is also complemented by bass lines that are surprisingly audible. They are not outstanding like Di' Giorgio's bass playing, nor the most brilliant thing on the Earth, but at least they fit well with album's sound.\n\nOn the other hand, the guitars are harsh and really great even though they are repetitive throughout the songs. It is surprising to find out many melodic passages in certain songs which is something uncommon in extreme metal, mainly when considering that extreme metal tends to avoid any kind of melody. The solos are fast and they are very chaotic, since they do not follow a clear pattern. In other words, those are pure Slayer's worshipping.\n\nPerhaps the album is not musically ambitious, nor outstanding, it meets the standards of a legendary album, though. The songs are not the most ambitious ones, the sound is not so polished, and the production far from brilliant; however, the songwriting is excellent, and they were able to make a very unique album which is a must-have for the extreme metal fanatics. It is also revolutionary, since it gave an idea on how to make extreme metal.\n",
        "\nAnd by A.B.C. I mean: atrocious, bestial and chaotic, this album is the purest definition that can be found for the term \"extreme metal\", because it is fast, it's very aggressive, it's \"hardcore\" in that it has no 'soft moments or instrumentals' that go away from the chaos that the whole album creates, except maybe for the first 25 seconds of Dying Victims and fortunately is the last song on this album, so the album is pure aggression itself. This album was released in 1985, but it is way ahead of its time. In that year there wasn't yet any Darkness Descends, nor Reign in Blood, nor Shark Attack, nor anything like this; for 1985, this is the most merciless album that can exist (this one along with Seven Churches and maybe Sepultura's Bestial Devastation ep); however, that doesn\u2019t mean that before 1985 there didn't exist other releases that were extreme, in 1984 Hellhammer released Triumph of Death, an homage to the most horrendous face of metal in their ep Apocalyptic Raids, and in that same year Bathory released their self titled album; although Endless Pain is more extreme than Bathory's, Bathory's album is darker and more sinister than Endless Pain. Maybe there will be people that will want to include To Mega Therion as an extreme and bestial album (same for Bulldozer's Day of Wrath), but I don't consider To Mega Therion as extreme as Seven Churches or this album (but that doesn't mean Mega Therion is bad, all the opposite, it is magnificent).\n\nHalf the album's songs have Petrozza as the main vocalist, and the other half have Ventor (the drummer) as the main vocalist, and they are arranged in a way that one song has Petrozza as vocalist and the next song has Ventor as the vocalist, which is good. Although they could have put the first 5 songs with Petrozza alone as the vocalist, and the other five with Ventor as the vocalist and that would have been good as well. Both vocalists are aggressive, and with both vocalists the album is extreme and great; however, with Petrozza leading the band, Kreator sounds like a demon that has been unleashed and is completely pissed off and determined to harm humanity, whereas Ventor sounds like a pissed off guy that has the urge to kill. The difference is in that: Ventor sounds human and pissed off (extreme thrash metal), and Petrozza sounds inhumane, fierce and pissed off (extreme black thrash metal). Both vocalists are great, I like their style, around extremeness and violence the album's music centers on. The songs that have Ventor as the vocalist are the ones that in moments slow down a little bit the speed, but then again they speed up (a thing that isn't bad at all), for example: Storm of the Beast or Cry War are songs that go relatively slow (when compared with the rest of the songs), however, after the middle of the songs they speed up again and get violent; whereas Petrozza's songs never slow down at all.\n\nDrums sound good overall, they aren't noisy in the respect that you can listen to the rest of the instruments, they also aren't brutal or something like that but still they go well with the music, they have good production and sound good. Bass can be heard sometimes here and there (mainly in Bone Breaker), but overall what sounds the most is drums and guitars, and of course, vocals which I consider are the most remarkable thing of this album.\n\nAnother interesting point that I want to highlight is that when this was recorded, band members were 18 and 19 years old, and that is quite impressive for me. They were very young, but that didn't mean they had no clue on what they were doing, they knew what they were doing and what they wanted to prove with this album: that they would be the most extreme thrash metal band in the whole Germany; Kreator are the Germany Slayers of the teutonic trio (Destruction, Kreator and Sodom; although there is people that expand the trio to a four way including Tankard or Exumer [I am possessed by fire!]).\n\nThis album breathes and emanates bestiality, ferocity, but at the same time, love for metal. This album raises high the Flag of Hate and the flag of metal itself in general.\n",
        "\nIf you don't know much about early Kreator, this EP wil tell you all the important things in the first 10 seconds. The opening title track blazes out furiously from the speakers, without regard for melody or the safety of our ears. These guys are determined to make us either dizzy or deaf and if you ask me they get their way with both. There was no doubting Kreator's thrash credentials for even a moment in the 80s: no melodic invention like Overkill, no subtle vocal lines like Testament, no virtuosity like Megadeth - it's just thrash. And that's kind of the point of 'Flag of Hate', which even the name backs up with its defiant brandishing of its intent and defects from the off.\n\nThere are three songs here and in fact it's enough. This is the kind of music that benefits from its hit and run nature, taking no prisoners and leaving no traces. As I mention, the first track goes up the middle with smoke and, though the other two are much longer and slow things down a bit - especially the grooving mid-paced riff on 'Take Their Lives' - they don't really have a let-up in the assault or in tone. Mille Petroza, whatever his actual skill as a vocalist, has always had an awesome and sick thrash metal voice that really sounds disgusted and ugly, like the things he sings about. His utter disgust and disdain gives the songs a believability that was missing from many of the thrash bands, even compatriots Sodom and Destruction (I'm thinking particularly of Schmier's squeals) and makes them sound deathly and extreme without actually becoming too focused in that area. On 'Awakening of the Gods', the band do pull off a couple of proto-death metal riffs, although I would argue that they aren't really focused on being nasty as Sodom maybe were, but actually just trying to go faster and more atmospheric, which comes across as both without losing its sense of enthusiasm and fun.\n\nMaybe that's the reason why this EP triumphs despite its flaws. I think that it's universally acknowledged that some of Kreator's early work bore solos that were more than just Kerry King's random noise bursts, but fully-fledged amelodic shredding into which had been put next to no forethought; add to this that the drums here are a little unbalanced, with some flat snares and cymbals that are occasionally just noisy. However, the band keep it together and sound like they are enjoying themselves more than they should be considering the subjects. It's weird, because the riffs, especially on the more intense 'Flag of Hate', are as tight as a gnat's arse and are joyful to hear, but the songs keep that joy when they spiral off on those crazy, unpracticed solos or escalate into the deathly sections: although the lead guitar that would emerge by the time of 'Coma of Souls' was clearly more skillful, this stands as a suitable addition to the sound on this release. I think it works even better here than on the 'Pleasure to Kill' full-length, because that album just holds its head a little higher and aims for a more ambitious result, which means that the skill needs to equal it and the lack of which is more obvious. Here, the riffs are exquisitely raw and grubby, and the solos match them.\n\nThis EP is currently available as part of the 'Pleasure to Kill' reissue, which is the easiest way to pick it up. It works as a compliment piece to that album, but is also a great release in its own right, with a slightly casual attitude that doesn't prevent it from snapping your neck right down the middle.\n",
        "\nKreator is a monument of the German and European thrash scene. Coming to prominence and releasing a cluster of very aggressive and extreme albums. Albums that maybe were not as high in quality, technical skill and flashy songwriting but were heavier and harder then a lot of American thrash being generated during the 80s. Sadly this is the weakest of that string. As far as extremity and aggression most every thrash band on both sides of the ocean have released highlight tracks (if not entire albums) that are more aggressive and extreme and that is a telling sign, because of there is one thing the German bands of the day had over the American bands it was extremity and aggression.\n\nThe biggest issue seems to be that the tempos are slowed down a bit. A lot of the riffing while meaty and muscled sounds mid paced even when it clearly isn't midpaced (Stream of Conciousness). Generally speed equals extremity (Slayer's Reign in Blood, for example), so this is quite an unexpected move for the band's sound. In the standards of the average 80s pop fan this probably sounded brutal and heavy but for experienced metalheads of the day this probably seemed like a more morbid and straight forward version of Ride the Lightning.\n\nAs stated the guitar lacks no muscle but tends to lack driving force. Its fairly dumbed down placing all the emphasis on the riffing, no flowery melodies, no little hooks, minimal usage of leads. So in that respect the album has a lot of muscle and power even if it is at the stake of other cool elements. All the solos are very flowery sounding in comparison though. You have these relentless straight forward no frills riffing and then suddenly you get an ultra melodic solo. It just doesn't seem like a logical combination, I mean they mostly made it work but how did they even get that idea.\n\nThe bass follows the guitar pretty well, but he can be heard which is nice. The drums generally are fast but suffer the same fate as the guitars where it doesn't seem like enough to really give that extreme feel to it. The band are very tight and professional, they all know their part and none of them try to steal the show, but they also grow stagnant in their roles and its always predictable when their going to try to grab your attention because the whole band seems to let off a bit to emphasize how great their buddy is. Makes it very predictable when everyone in the band is obviously building up to that sweet drum fill. Not enough risks as a group.\n\nThe vocals are a raspyish yell. Sounding similar to the vocals of Venom but without quite as much energy. He gives a passable performance regardless. The lyrics cover pretty standard themes; anger, aggression, war and evil. The lyrics aren't as aggressive as on their past releases though, especially 'Love Us or Hate Us' the lyrical theme seems like it was taken from a glam group and rewritten to sound more credible with metalheads.\n\nStandout Tracks: Extreme Aggression, Bringer of Torture, No Reason to Exist and Betrayer\n",
        "\nCommercialization of the music industry has left the market full of music with shallow lyrical themes, ridiculously slick production, to much electronic arts, and an overall vibe that says \"Buy me please! It's part of the trend! I'll disappear from the mainstream in a few months!\" \n\nHowever, Kreator's \"Phantom Antichrist\" is exactly what a modern metal album should sound like. Production good enough to make the band sound larger than life, but still in the realm of human capability. The lyrics have a misanthropic and rebellious attitude and the songs themselves are all unique, not one song sounds like filler. It's worth every penny. I heard many other bands on this record as well. I heard some Exodus on the verses of \"Your Heaven, My Hell\" and some Slayer throughout \"Death to the World.\" Yet the riffs and beats still seemed refreshingly original.\n\nOne of the main reason's why I've listened to Kreator over the years is the guitar work. As soon as I heard Sami Yli-Sirnio's solo on the title track, I new I had spent $9.99 correctly. And the dropping of my jaw didn't stop there. The balance of wails, trills, sweeping tremolo picking, and precise harmonization was more than I asked for in the most pleasant of ways. The best solos are on tracks \"From Flood to Fire\" and \"Civilization Collapse.\" Mille Petrozza just keeps getting better and better as his fellow heavy metal front men get mellower and add some hired guns to add some beef to their sound. Petrozza is a timeless staple of the world-wide metal community. He seems to be ageless. This album showcases his prowess and authority over how to play what you want and make a career of it.\n\nOne thing that was a bit of a drag on this record was the subject matter. Songs like \"Phantom Antichrist\", \"Death to the World\", and \"Until Our Paths Cross Again\" all had very different lyrical subjects/messages that made them perfect for singles. Other songs' themes didn't do to well in that category. \n\n\"We are Legion\nWe are Legion united in Hate\"\n\nAre you, the listener, feeling the message of \"Revolution?\" I sure am. And it has kind of gotten old. Maybe it was the \"Violent Revolution\" album that had already given me that message. These kind of lyrics can be found in \"Victory Will Come\", \"From Flood Into Fire\", \"Civilization Collapse\" and various other songs on this album. Kreator lyrics have always been evolving, but this time I think that Petrozza and his fellows hit a bit of a dead end with the lyrical content on this release. \n\nCheck out \"Phantom Antichrist\", \"Civilization Collapse\", \"From Flood Into Fire\" and \"Death to the World\" before you listen to the album. If you like those tracks, then you just struck gold. I sure did. Kreator wird sich durchsetzen!\n",
        "\nThe 90's were a busy time for extreme metal. Coming from the late 80's, this era of metal music saw death metal rising up, thrash metal falling down, groove metal taking the baton over, and nu metal unfortunately gaining loads of popularity. Thrash metal was one of the first genres that lost its reputation and quickly fell victim to the simplified formula of groove metal, and big thrash metal acts saw fit to change their sound to something more populair and \"hip\" to keep a fresh image amongst their ever growing fanbase. Imagine if you will, Metallica shifting to heavy metal and hard rock, Sodom going warpunk on us, Slayer and Sepultura hopping on the nu metal bandwagon and Destruction shifting to dumb pedestrian groove metal. One of the bands that took a less crappy direction was Kreator, they too shifted their sound to something a little simpler than the brutal thrash formula of prior efforts, but out of all the bands I just named, it's definitely Kreator that suffered the least from changing their approach, from a quality perspective, that is. Renewal is \"phase 1\" from Kreator's experimental period, and it showed us that the 90's were a goldmine for Kreator, because, using their newly found elements, they created one of the best albums the metal scene has ever witnessed.\n\nRenewal is a work of pure artistic creativity, it changed the true meaning of catchiness, it's incredibly succesful at creating a fitting atmosphere, and serves as one of the most recognizable albums mankind has ever experienced. Overall, it's pretty ironic to see that Kreator, by experimenting, have kreated (ha-ha) an album that outgrows the worth of basically everything else they've made...combined. This simply has so much more of a meaning to it than their somewhat (read painfully) repetitive thrashy output and it's proof that this band are the best when they're not trying to please their fans. I truly wish Kreator would have continued experimenting after Endorama, because them stepping out of their experimental phase resulted in one of the most redundant \"comebacks\" the thrash metal scene ever had the misfortune to lay its eyes upon. This is way ahead of anything the band has made before or after it, it has much more of a personality and individual identity, instead of sounding like basically everything else ever the band made.\n\nSure, there might not be an abundance of ripping leads and riffs, but Renewal more than makes up for it by creating some of the catchiest licks the metal scene will ever see. This is truly on a whole new level of catchiness, even eclipsing albums like Heartwork as a result. It's also really impressive to see how everything on this album sets itself apart from basically everything ever and even its own material. Not a song here sounds even remotely similar to another, and you can easily tell them apart from each other. I can perfectly hum every song purely from memory, even months after last hearing it. (Don't ask me how I forgot about this.)\n\nBeing the first of 4 experimental albums from Kreator's 90's era, Renewal introduced the industrial elements to Kreator's formula. Along with hardcore, groove and perhaps even a little doom for the atmosphere, they created something truly unique. Mind you, most of these elements are merely aesthetical, the industrial elements are largely limited to the mechanical feeling of the production, the hardcore is found in some uptempo parts and the vocals, and the groove is the bulk of the slower material. Of course, Kreator didn't completely get rid of the thrash sound, but it's simply put in the background, with the band favouring more of a sinister and depressing approach to songwriting. This is incredibly dark and atmospheric, and the negativity in the aesthetics and lyrics make for a somewhat difficult album to sit through. One of the main reasons long-time fans/idiots didn't like this is the new vocal approach from Petrozza. Being the enemy of metal I am, I'm proudly going to say that this is by far the best performance of his entire career. There's genuine anger and frustration in the guy's tortured grunts, and while he's a bit grating on the ears, I feel that it's perfectly fitting to the album's idea. And even the lyrics (which are far more negative than usual) fit like a glove to what the band tried to achieve with this masterpiece.\n\nI'm absolutely in love with the sound of this album, the thick and doomy sound of the guitars makes for absolutely crushing moments when the album hits its highest peaks, and even when the band are going flat-out thrashy on us it sounds fucking perfect, best heard on \"Reflection\", one of the most typical songs from this album. The rest of the band certainly don't leave anything to be desired though, the bass might not be that loud and you need to listen carefully to hear it, but I feel the thick sound of the guitars do more than enough to create a nice layer of bass for themselves. The drumming here is incredibly prominent, I feel this album is actually more drum-driven than it is guitar, the drums are very loud, and you can hear every single beat or hit Ventor produces here, which is also due to the incredibly high quality of the production job and mix. Everything feels perfectly balanced, some instruments might be louder than others, but I feel it's all very fitting to the album's sound.\n\nRenewal is a depressing and tortured work of utter awesomeness. Of everything the band made, Pleasure To Kill is what comes the closest to the level of this magnum opus, but even that album doesn't have the right to lick the shoes of this masterpiece. I'm sure everyone will disagree with me that this is by far the best Kreator album because you need constant Coma Of Souls-dickriding to feel safe on a Kreator record (which is EXACTLY what they're doing nowadays), but this masterful. It shows a band leaving their past behind for something that gave them the possibilites to create one of the best albums ever, and that's exactly what they've done.\n",
        "\nAfter the massive success of the concert series of Anthrax, Megadeth, Metallica and Slayer under \u201cThe Big Four\u201d banner, German metal magazines started some hype around Germany\u2019s oldest and probably most famous thrash metal bands by calling them \u201cThe Big Teutonic Four\u201d. These bands have never really toured together under this banner but German extreme metal magazine Legacy decided to put out a short EP anyway with one tune from each Destruction, Kreator, Sodom and Tankard. To be honest, there is nothing spectacular about this release as the four tracks are only cover songs. Sodom and Destruction honour Mot\u00f6rhead while Kreator and Tankard worship Iron Maiden. Some of the cover tracks are not even exclusive to this release. Sodom\u2019s version of Mot\u00f6rhead\u2019s \u201cIron Fist\u201d was already released back in 1987 on the \u201cPersecution Mania\u201d record. Kreator\u2019s take on Iron Maiden\u2019s \u201cThe Number of the Beast\u201d is taken from the \u201cPhantom Antichrist\u201d single released earlier in 2012. Destruction\u2019s version of Mot\u00f6rhead\u2019s \u201cThe Hammer\u201d is taken from the Japanese version of their \u201cSpiritual Genocide\u201d album that has just been released one month before this split release. As far as I know, only Tankard\u2019s cover of Iron Maiden\u2019s \u201cThe Prisoner\u201d is exclusive to this release. As this split came along with a free magazine for a fair price, it doesn\u2019t really matter if the material is exclusive or not but one could have chosen more than just four tracks and maybe original songs by the four bands instead of these cover rehashes.\n\nLet\u2019s talk about the songs themselves. On the positive side, all four bands made the tracks sound like their own. Nobody is trying to copy Bruce Dickinson or Lemmy Kilmister on here which is a good thing because these bands wouldn\u2019t have been able to reproduce these unique vocalists. Musically, the Mot\u00f6rhead covers still sound like fast and dirty rock \u2018n roll and are quite close to the originals while the Iron Maiden covers sound quicker and meaner than the originals.\n\nSodom\u2019s version of Mot\u00f6rhead\u2019s \u201cIron Fist\u201d is the most disappointing song on the release. The track remains too close to the original and Schmier\u2019s vocals sound even more limited than Lemmy\u2019s and are surprisingly lackluster. He sounds as if he had just smoked a couple of cigarettes and felt extremely sick or tired while recording this song. There is no true effort or passion behind this rendition and I\u2019m always skipping this song.\n\nDestruction\u2019s version of \u201cThe Hammer\u201d sounds a little bit more enthusiastic, both musically and vocally. Still, the song is a little bit too close to the original to really stand out and I think that the original is not the most gripping Mot\u00f6rhead song either. Sorry but both the original and this cover version don\u2019t leave any deeper impression on me.\n\nKreator\u2019s version of Iron Maiden\u2019s \u201cThe Number of the Beast\u201d is faster and meaner than the original but I don\u2019t appreciate this experiment for two reasons. First of all, the band cut off the iconic spoken word introduction to this heavy metal classics and its absence just feels wrong. Second, Mille Petrozza rumbling vocals sound pathetic when compared to the emotionally charged and stunningly versatile vocal performance of the original. Mille Petrozza\u2019s vocals just sound the same through the entire song and don\u2019t vary at all which makes the song sound quite monotonous. This lackluster vocal performance is a little bit sad as the cover version has a nice pace and a really solid instrumental work that should please to both fans of heavy and thrash metal.\n\nIt\u2019s a little bit surprising that Tankard has picked the challenging \u201cThe Prisoner\u201d instead of a more punk-driven tune from \u201cIron Maiden\u201d or \u201cKillers\u201d but this courageous idea works fairly well and was worth the risk. Their take on \u201cThe Prisoner\u201d is by far the best song on the split and the sole reason to purchase this release. Sadly, the spoken word introduction is also missing here but it\u2019s not a big deal as this part is not as essential as the opening of \u201cThe Number of the Beast\u201d. Tankard\u2019s opening riffs and the dynamical rhythm section build up an energizing pace that beats the original where I have always thought that the opening section sounded a little bit too slow. The song gets really unchained in the verses and the chorus and has a strong punk vibe and rebellious party feeling to it. The vocal performance is surprisingly great. Obviously, Gerry can\u2019t mess with Bruce Dickinson but his singing is more diversified than usually and he clearly put a lot of passionate emotion into this rendition. His desperate, oppressed and slightly breathless vocals fit to the new version and even to the lyrical topic. Gerre\u2019s performance is absolutely gripping. Tankard\u2019s cover song is a big positive surprise and despite being a faithful Iron Maiden fan, I slightly prefer this vivid version over the slower original tune. The original has a great introduction and a better bass guitar tone but the cover has a more fitting pace and even more emotional vocals while the instrumental performances from both bands are absolutely stellar. I wouldn\u2019t have thought to ever find an Iron Maiden cover better than the original but now it has happened.\n\nAll in all, Tankard\u2019s cover song is musically appealing and vocally gripping while the other three bands deliver average renditions in Kreator\u2019s and Destruction\u2019s cases to bad performances in Sodom\u2019s case. If you are able to get your hands on this gimmicky collector\u2019s item for a low prize, go for it, otherwise you should just download Tankard\u2019s track on here as the rest is forgettable and had already been published elsewhere before.\n",
        "\n2012 was obviously a strong year for thrash. Along with Kreator's Phantom Antichrist, Overkill released the ever impressive \"The Electric Age\" and Testament released their seminal return to the glory days with \"Dark Roots of Earth.\" However, only one album out of the three fully encompasses the band's past sound while still looking to the future by adding different elements to their albums. Kreator has always had hints of melody even for a few brief moments in their albums ever since \"Pleasure to Kill\" (\"Riot of Violence,\" and \"Command of the Blade\" will serve as examples for the review). So the melody on Phantom Antichrist shouldn't be a surprise to anyone as it was hinted during \"Violent Revolution,\" \"Enemy of God,\" and attempted yet again in \"Hordes of Chaos.\" The fact that Jens Borgen (producer and engineer) has worked with several Swedish death metal bands including Amon Amarth, it is no surprise that Kreator's thirteenth album holds such a strong resemblance to that of our Swedish metal brethren. This might be a major setback for possible fans that demand Kreator release Pleasure to Kill II. However, Phantom Antichrist still manages to hold as much thrash as the band did in the early 2000s. The sound may be different, production incredibly clear, and the riffs melodic, but it is still the pioneering Teutonic thrash titan most of us have come to love and respect. \n\nMille and Sami put on the greatest show since Sami's debut \"Violent Revolution.\" With interesting leads and exchanges these two really give the listener's senses a lot to cover and keep up with. Some tracks like \"Victory Will Come,\" \"The Few the Proud the Broken,\" and \"Death to the World\" all feature catchy intros that automatically grabbed my attention. Vocally Mille does a great job to erase the underwhelming performance on \"Hordes Of Chaos\" and he still retains enough venom in his vocal delivery to kill three men...twice. However, when compared to say \"Enemy of God\" or \"Violent Revolution\" it\u2019s obviously less bearable than the newer classic albums by the band. Ventor is a mad man on the kit as we all know. He is incredibly consistent and punishes his snare demanding ever present attention. Giesler is hardly ever heard on Phantom Antichrist. However, this is understandable as Mille and Sami's guitar work overpowers almost anything other than Ventor's ever physical drum work. The production is crystal clear especially for a metal band such as Kreator. Take that how you may, some love great production (especially fans of melodic metal) and some fans of thrash hate great production. Whatever your personal preference the production places the guitar work at front and center stage over anything else. \n\nFor all the positives, Phantom Antichrist has a few flaws that keep this from being the greatest return to form thrash album that has ever emerged. First, repetitiveness runs high in this thirteenth release. Some riffs feel recycled, especially from the band's past (Example: 2:25 on \"From Flood Into Fire\" the underlying riff sounds eerily similar to the underlying riff used in \"Terror Zone\" at the 3:55 mark.) Mille's voice does deteriorate on the album almost as if he was getting tired towards the end of the record. Yet another possible flaw is the lyrical themes and their delivery. In some instances the metal clich\u00e9s run high on tracks like gang shouts with senseless choruses, the softly spoken poetry in \"From Flood Into Fire,\" or the annoying young teen angst that can be felt on some of the tracks like \"From Flood Into Fire,\" and \"United in Hate.\" \n\nOverall, Phantom Antichrist is strong. It isn't a total waste of an album as others say. Each individual track has its own strength and weakness. Kreator is still going strong after 30 years. How many other metal bands can create an album that contains an epic sense of melody, strength of powerful riffs, the insanity of thrash, blend them together, and produce a different and varied album while still throwing back to the days of old? Not too many folks. Cheers to Kreator for 30 years strong and for many more to grow on.\n",
        "\nThis was a step in the right direction for Kreator. Terrible Certainty felt very hit or miss, and this manages to be much more consistent, with high points of its own. This is a more subdued release than previously, but I don't think that really subtracts from the quality in any real way. The quality of instrumentation isn't very high, but it's all still good.\n\nCompared to many of their competitors, Kreator weren't very technical. Even compared to Sodom and Slayer, I'd consider them at an overall disadvantage. Kreator were a very professional band, but the technique on this album is rather low. For one, Kreator's soloing was just tolerable around this time. It's better than the previous album, but not by a ton. The drumming isn't at a particularly high level either. After Pleasure, nothing Ventor did on the drums was really impressive. He was born to jackhammer, and he became far less shining when Kreator toned down. He's still well above-average, but he's not as impressive as he was. The bass isn't doing much either, nor is it particularly loud. As one can tell, this isn't very high technically by even their standards.\n\nVocally, this is one of Kreator's best. This is the album on which Petrozza perfected his shouted rasp, and it works well. Some may prefer his froth from Pleasure, his blackish voice from the debut, or even his toned down work from the later albums, but this is what I associate him for. The lyrics present are a little more, \"socially aware,\" than what most of their competitors wrote as well. I frankly don't care much for the thinking behind that term, but it's probably a slight improvement to the music. It's easier to hear what he's saying, and when it does fail, you cringe. The song about child molestation aside, most of these are better lyrics than what they've done before. I do think they took the socio-political lyrics overboard later, but they're far from that. Lastly, Kreator's riffs are still excellent. Even the people who don't particularly like this album will admit that this has some great, catchy riffs. \n\nThe cover is a good place to start with this idea. Compared to the covers before and after, the demon isn't present. This is a fairly plain photo of the band in front of a sunrise. This isn't bad, but it's not really amazing either. It strikes me as something I would expect from a much older band, like Aerosmith or Rolling Stones. That's something that has to be noted about this album. Part of the way Kreator brought down their extremity was by incorporating some hard-rock elements into their sound. The choruses have that catchy, yet aggressive feel jacked up several notches. They also are almost all short and straight-forward, as compared to relative epics that are found on many of their albums. It's not surprising considering Petrozza's fondness for Kiss, and in a way it works for them pretty well.\n\nTo explain some contradictory ideas in my explanation of the band's performance, they all work together pretty well. The music isn't technical, but the song-writing is all very catchy and succinct. The playing is also very tight and concise. Compared to most Sodom albums, who always exuded sloppiness even when tight, this is much more focused and concentrated. Compared to Slayer, this is much catchier. The songs are also somewhat more varied inside of themselves. I would argue that the playing on Pleasure To Kill seems more impressive, but that the music here has more tempo and rhythmic changes. The music here largely thrives off Petrozza's catchy songwriting and riffing, and Ventor's occasional moment.\n\nMy score is largely a reflection of how well these elements work. On a song like Bringer of Torture where the lyrics are horrid and there's nothing else to save it other than a solid riff, it fails. Thankfully, this is the only failing, and it's short. The other problem is that this starts sounding samey. I don't mind this too much, it's a great formula, but it does keep it from breaking through to the next level. The album is a little front-loaded, as the best song is the opener, and the middle is a small step-down, until the last song. All in all, this is Kreator's third best album. Thrash fans need this.\n",
        "\nPrior to, and simultaneous with, this release many bands released their signature album. Peace Sells, Pleasure to Kill, Reign in Blood, Master of Puppets, Darkness Descends, etc are all highly valued releases by various metal bands. These were the albums that these bands were striving for, and now they had achieved it. The only problem is that many of these bands weren't sure what to do: So Far....was a pretty inconsistent affair, South of Heaven and Leave Scars just don't do much for me, and And Justice remains a controversial album. Kreator managed to do better on the next release than the bulk of these guys.\n\nPetrozza hired another guitarist to help them make this transition. From what I can tell, he didn't write much. I rather wish they had left him wherever they found him, considering his leads. They are as bad as others have claimed, and he does make King sound like Malmsteen. It's just odd to think that they hired him at all, but it does seem to be the preferred route for metal bands to have a dual-guitar attack. The riffing has a different focus this time. It's not nearly as wild and extreme as their previous releases. This is much closer to Hell Awaits or some other, older thrash record, where the music is much less chaotic. I also feel this may be the starting point for where Kreator got their reputation for repetitiveness. Many of the riffs do seem more similar to one another than on Pleasure to Kill. I don't know if Pleasure actually was more varied, but I don't notice the box that this and future albums resided in.\n\nPetrozza's lyrics have also altered. In the past, we heard stories of slaughter, rape, pillaging, and the undead. We now see lyrics about the environment, Toxic Trace, and personal problems, Behind the Mirror. The music behind them is strong, so it's quite alright with me. In terms of lyrical shift, I suspect this is an influence from Master of Puppets. Around this time, many thrash bands began to tone down and switch to more \"mature\" topics, and I imagine Master of Puppets' success and reputation was a push. This influence seems to come at the expense of other aspects of Kreator's extremity. Both the dual-vocals and Bathory influence were lessened on this album, giving it more of a purer thrash sound. \nHis vocals themselves aren't as extreme, but it's still the same guy, and I've never thought this was a problem.\n\nAs far as the rhythm section goes, the drums and bass have a sweet intro on the title track, but the bass does little else of note the rest of the album. You can hear him, but it's just not worth it. The drumming is a different matter. None of Ventor's other performances match Pleasure, but he still does a pretty good job on here. It's not as pounding, but he still goes pretty aggressive and that satisfies me. The only really bad thing he does is the song, As the World Burns. That song is probably the weakest one on here, and his vocals sound poor. This is strange to me, as I really did enjoy his performances on the first two, but he just sounds out of place on this track, and there's nothing else to really salvage it.\n\nThis was the beginning of the slow softening of Kreator's sound, but this isn't quite as big of a deal as many make it out to be. The next two were even softer, yet they're better albums, while Endless Pain is more extreme, but weaker as a listen. Blind Faith, the title track, and Behind the Mirror are great thrashers. As the World Burns and One of Us are not. The deductions come in the fact that if takes a few listens for things to not sound very samey and that a quarter of the songs are pretty much toss-worthy. Compared to the surrounding albums, this just isn't as consistent. Compared to what the other bands of 1986 followed up with though, this is pretty good. I would recommend at least the highlights to any fan of thrash.\n",
        "\nFor a starter, I want to underline that I've never been a big Kreator fan like the many reviewing their albums. They are probably one of the very few \"big\" bands in thrash that have never been among the bands I'd regularly listen to, in any period of my life or their discography. However, I've always recognised their former albums and as much as I am not a fan of Mille's voice, I've recognised the quality of the early works and the significance they have for the scene.\n\nTo the point. Phantom Antichrist can make even the very melodic sellouts in Nuclear Blast's catalogue giggle. Its attitude is ultra childish and I cannot see any sympathy or interest that it could possibly evoke in an extreme fan whatsoever, unless you're a die hard Kreator fan who listens to it from nostalgia or whatever feeling. If you think I am exaggerating, go check the lyrics - no need for me to quote, you can see yourself that they are targeted towards fourteen year old children with yet not very strong perceptions about metal.\n\nMost songs sound like the band has tried very very intentionally to make them epic. It's even worse than Manowar's attempts to play cool and majestic these days. You're supposed to \"march towards the fire\" and sing along with a thousand other voices and this kind of jazz. Most songs are probably intended to be big stadium hits, sang by huge escalated crowds. As you can probably imagine, this effect is missing, at least on me.\n\nAnother problem is the guitar sound and the overall production, nothing raw left, all instruments sound like being laid in a crystal clear studio and fixed and it is just the modern production targeted for the massive audience rather than an extreme fan. Not that the latest Kreator albums show a big deviation, therefore you shouldn't be surprised in any way. At least some modern melodic death metal bands have conserved some of their anger and energy. While Phantom Antichrist is just so 'plastic, lame and weak', that I can't even be bothered to move some muscles on my face and frown. It's just \"meh\". Yes, generic - that's the perfect adjective to describe it. \n\nThe riffs itself are not especially thrashy and the style of this band is more like super overproduced melodic death/epic metal rather than thrash. Like very cheesy Arch Enemy (not that I have bothered to check their latest effort). And if that has not yet sealed the deal for you, there are several times on this record when you can hear Mille attempt clear singing. It's not bad from a musical point I guess, but I believe its place is not in a thrash album. The musicianship of course is very good and this is totally not my point. The band present here is Kreator, of course they would be good musicians. The problem is that the final product is just very generic and left me personally with a headache rather than an elevated spirit.\n",
        "\nOver the course of the dreaded 90's, Kreator endured an era of experimentation, line up changes, and a decline in both popularity and profit. However, the new millennium brought with it a new Kreator, and a new album which completely shifted things back into their favor. From the classic Kreator styled artwork, to the savage, barbaric beat down inside the music, this album destroys any naysayer in sight and puts Kreator back into the thicket of thrash metal glory. \n\nOne of the more obvious things about this album is that Kreator took a faster, more streamlined approach and employed the use of their old destructive antics once more. The production quality of this record is excellent and really brings out the true sound and character you'd expect from these metal veterans. All instruments are audible and the sonic assault here is almost unparalleled by even more modern records. The guitar tone is crushingly heavy and songs like \"Reconquering the Throne\" and the title track showcase their intensity along with Ventor's legendary drumming. The vocals were a bit deeper and raspier on this record than any of their past efforts and they really compliment the band's sound well, there is also a fair amount of vocal range present on this record utilized by Petrozza as well as many different styles. For example, the song \"Replicas of Life\" begins with clean vocals and then it morphs into a high pitched scream before finally descending to a low, guttural yelling. \n\nOne amazing thing about this record is the pacing, this record does not possess a single moment of filler music. Every tune on this LP deserves it's place and is worthy of a full listen. From track one to twelve, Kreator really made it a point to keep the listener hooked every second of this musical journey. Guitar harmonies are present all over the place in songs like \"All of The Same Blood\" and \"The Second Awakening\", Gothenburg styled riffs appear in all the songs, and tons of stylistic changes throughout this album make it more interesting and worth listening to again and again. \n\nThis album is thrash metal the way it was meant to progress through the 90's, it is mature, brutal, and loaded with mosh-pit infusing moments in every piece. The production is top-notch, the performance fantastic, and the style near perfection. It is worth every penny to purchase, is one of the best thrash metal records released, and should definitely be listened to by anyone who wants anything to do with heavy metal music.\n",
        "\n\u201c\u2026what will the wind bring these days?\u201d\n\nWhat Tom Fischer didn\u2019t know when he let that lyric sail is that in this instance the wind brings an ideal case-in-point for the old \u2018which one doesn\u2019t belong\u2019 game, for this 7\u201d falls easily into contention for that trophy. You\u2019re gonna run into a slap if I have to explain further. \n\nBeyond that obviousness, this is a curious little four-track sampler that's made more curious as it exhumes a few rarer-than-standard picks that newer archaeologist labels like Old Metal or Sentinel Steel wouldn't have to excavate to serve to us on silver trays, and that, my friends, is due to unassuming little outlets such as this. The problem is, however, that the disc\u2019s sleeve doesn\u2019t seem to have a clue what\u2019s bubbling inside it, nor who it\u2019s poised to impress. Yep, with its warm ocean-blue, decade-familiar, yet metal-unfamiliar pop \u201880s \u2018hey you, put down Rod Stewart and l00k at my big 1, dammit!\u2019 cover, it implies to...um...someone this 7\" has the #1 metal goods you\u2019re searching low and high for. Well, around 60% of the civilized world population was under the impression that Def Leppard\u2019s Hysteria was the latest heavy metal champion at the time, and since this disc is tattooed with underground and rather ignoble band names, it\u2019s only natural Sounds Waves was gonna be a hard sell to such an audience. Looking for a alternate horizon or perhaps a bigger picture, the disc squints at the .001% - the bedraggled few who are aware of and actually give a swig about underground metal \u2013 and naturally doesn\u2019t see a parking lot full of anywhere near semi-expensive rides being exited by adults with anywhere near semi-bulging wallets. So...who\u2019s gonna buy this thing? \n\nThen what makes this yet all the more a curious curio actually forms the solution to the last haunting question - as a promo release it\u2019ll be issued free with Sounds magazine, which even then was a long-running, well-respected rock rag that led early cheers for metal when NWOBHM was an acronym that meant very little to just about everybody. Gone are most complaints of wasted money, and the publicity\u2026ah, you can figure out the rest. \n\nSince \u201cVisual Aggression\u201d was already a warrior made fierce on Frost\u2019s 1985 The Emperor\u2019s Return ep, there was a minor chance it was already speed-racing recklessly somewhere in your collection, and if it wasn\u2019t\u2026well, then it should've been. Much obliged. Meanwhile, more hidden from view was Kreator\u2019s \u201cAfter the Attack\u201d, a song armed for slaughter along with the rest of Pleasure to Kill's dreadnoughts, yet was only to be found on that release\u2019s picture disc version, making this arguably the scarcest thing finding shelter here. \n\nI say arguably about \"After the Attack\" because, really, how often were/are The Stupids ever on the tips of anyone\u2019s tongues? I mean, even in the poorly dug ditch of underground metal, The Stupids were a hardcore band far underfoot and covered in indiscernible mud if they were in the ditch at all, and even today I never hear a syllable uttered about these guys. So basically if \u201cLive to Rock\u201d, actually an almost halfway decent h.c. specimen, wasn\u2019t the unicorn of the disc in 1988, it probably is now. \n\nThen there\u2019s\u2026yawn...ever-present Motorhead traipsing through \u201cKilled by Death\u201d, to me one of their stolidly standard and ultimately slow lane snoozers that could never spark even a moment\u2019s interest in me, and the so-called dazzle that comes from it being live from The Birthday Party at the Hammersmith Odeon video/album is only a big fizzle to someone who could care less about most live albums. Enter the last reason I throw a smile at this thing (yes, The Stupids beat out Motorhead. I\u2019ve lived with this truth for a few decades and still hold my head high. Now you can, too).\n\nShould be slightly more collectible than it is. \n\n\u201c\u2026everywhere starts the search for water and groceries\u2026\u201d\n",
        "\nI have nothing but ambivalence regarding this one. Enemy of God is oft-abhorred for supposedly ushering in a multitude of modern influences that have now become part of Kreator's primary approach. I actually really dug this album's direct predecessor Hordes of Chaos for it's keen sense of melody and archaic sonic appeal. I can't necessarily say the same regarding Enemy of God, which features an irritating, blubbery modern guitar tone that reminds me of later Exodus albums. \n\nNone of this necessarily matters if the album has the compositions to back it up; but yet again, Enemy of God fails to inspire for the entire duration. Maybe I'm just not feeling Petrozza's modern songwriting approach here, but so many of these tracks have the tendency to devolve into stock Teutonic thrash posturing. I fully realize I am calling out one of the forefathers of \"Teutonic\" thrash as sounding stock, but it really sounds like Kreator is scraping the bottom of the riff barrel here and likely unearthing dinosaur bones underneath it in the process. \"Impossible Brutality\" takes banality to a whole new level. In most cases, the second track on most thrash albums is the most important. You've had a searing accretion and release of built-up tension in the opener, and it is the second track's job to prove that there won't be any lull in the bloodletting. While the opener \"Enemy of God\" is decent gritty thrash, \"Impossible Brutality\" embodies everything grating regarding modern Kreator. Petrozza's lyrics may vary from song to song, but he reuses so many of the same vocal patterns that it just becomes monotonous. I can honesty look at the title of some of these songs and accurately predict how he is going to bark the song title ad nauseam alongside the tepid, churning riffs.\n\nThere are exceptions where the band pulls it together for long enough to make an impact. \"One Evil Comes (A Million Follow)\" features some decent galloping passages and more dissonant, recondite hooks. \"World Anarchy\" could easily have been the best track here, featuring a disorienting opening barrage that is classic Kreator and more atypical songwriting elements. It starts to lose it's grip around the listener's throat during a pointless atmospheric break about three-quarters through. The band tries to rebuff and dial up the intensity, but the damage is already done, sadly. I am also partial to \"The Ancient Plague\"'s esoteric approach. The brilliant dual-lead that it opens with, the acoustic passages, the awesome solo (and the riff behind it, for that matter). It all works brilliantly, rivaling \"Demon Prince\" from Hordes of Chaos as Kreator's best modern closer.\n\nIt's not that the rest of Enemy of God is offensive, it is just so damned unmemorable. The atonal harshness of the riffs becomes too expected without any real surprise elements lurking behind corners to snatch unwary listeners away to their doom. Reil's drumming is tight, even if it a bit restrained in the tempo department. Yli-Sirni\u00f6 is also a hell of a soloist, but it seems like he didn't fully come into his own until Hordes of Chaos. There are hints of that brilliance here, but it is always too fleeting as the rest of the monotonous approach swiftly swallows it up. I had similar issues with most of Violent Revolution, but I give that one a free pass for breaking the chains of the '90s that held Kreator down for most of said decade. Did the band just forget about that here?\n",
        "\nI just realized it\u2019s been a while since I wrote a review with a hundred per cent rating. It\u2019s not that I believe in that \u201c100% is only for God\u201d bullshit. I\u2019m definitely not a prickly self-righteous cunt who believes perfection can\u2019t be achieved in music. No, I actually love metal, so for me there are A LOT of metal albums that deserve a perfect score\u2026 so many! I had been focusing in new or relatively newer releases, most of which come short of the mark. So it was time to turn back to the classics for a change. My choice to review Kreator\u2019s masterpiece instead of something else is based on pure chance. Maybe the fact that I just listened to it yesterday and will listen to it today as I write this also helps. The fact that matters though, it\u2019s that this is one of thrash metal\u2019s greatest records ever, from one of thrash metal\u2019s greatest bands ever (and I won\u2019t fail to mention it, my favorite one). \n\nBefore the launching of their fifth long play Kreator were already a powerful entity of the Teutonic thrash scene, with a couple of outstanding releases under their bullet-belt; the seminal Pleasure to Kill, of course, and the more complex but equally punishing Terribly Certainty. The rest of their catalogue didn\u2019t fall short in quality either, from the obscure, primitive pummeling of their debut and the somewhat simplified, restrained thrash of Extreme Aggression to the pair of solid EPs released in those years. Yet all their work from the past decade was but the build-up for Coma of Souls, which is in fact an amalgamation of the best elements in their career, an exercise in perfection of the form they\u2019d never surpass. The crowning jewel of Kreator\u2019s discography, and probably of the whole Teutonic thrash scene, is composed of high-octane riffage tempered with magnificent shifts in tempo, masterfully placed breakdowns and NWOBHM-inspired soloing cranked up to 11 that guarantee flawless excellence in the ten compositions here. \n\nIt all starts with one of those classic thrash acoustic intros in the vein of Metallica\u2019s \u201cFight Fire with Fire\u201d that heralds \u201cWhen the Sun Burns Red\u201d, a condemnatory tune about Mankind-induced global warming. Mille sings on this opener with crude and honest rage, as his ideologies have always been an integral part of Kreator\u2019s lyrical themes, Coma of Souls more that other albums being constantly nurtured by his ecological, religious and political beliefs. It\u2019s soon followed by the amazing titular-track, and on this one the undisputed star for me is Ventor. He has never been the fastest, or the most complex of drummers, but he compensates by a great sense of timing, precision and classy use of the double bass. This is true for each track here, but I love his playing on \u201cComa of Souls\u201d, its just spot on. Things get simpler, though not less spectacular with the catchy as hell anti-Nazi three-minute rager that is \u201cPeople of the Lie\u201d. This tune usually makes me remember my first Kreator gig in 2005; there was an older guy behind me yelling the title of the song at the top of his lungs since the beginning of the concert. When Kreator finally fucking started playing it, he became a whirlwind of black leather and spikes thrashing everything in its path, myself included. I was only familiar with their post-Endorama material at the time, but that short \u2018n\u2019 sweet hymn stuck on my head forever. So after the concert I bought this treasure, and it blew my mind. It still does.\n\nFor those complaining that Coma of Souls doesn\u2019t have enough speed and aggression, Dr. K prescribes the couple of two-minute trail blazers \u201cWorld Beyond\u201d and \u201cTwisted Urges\u201d, whose clinic battering will leave your skull as pretty as Kreator\u2019s mascot on the iconic cover artwork gracing this record, provided by the great Andreas Marschall, the first of many similarly styled demon head portraits. For those preferring a more epic and complex approach, fan-favorite \u201cTerror Zone\u201d is a must listen with its ominous Maiden-esque mirror intro and outro, and marching pace with sudden bursts of speed. The rest of the tunes on the second half of the record are a more similarly styled attack than those on the first half, but that doesn\u2019t mean the voyage becomes dull or predictable, and the fatal energy levels never descend below 100%. \u201cAgents of Brutality\u201d has really brutal lyrics about totalitarian control, whilst boasting an eerie uplifting solo. \u201cMaterial World Paranoia\u201d and \u201cHidden Dictator\u201d are riff-fests on top of which Mille spits some excellent jagged-edged chorus whose message resounds as loudly today as they did in 1990:\n\n\u201cConcrete coffin breeds lunacy \nCold steel skeleton \nDesperation in the factory \nCrank out oblivion \n\nMaterial world paranoia \nCorporations dominate earth \nMaterial world paranoia \nEnslavery begins at birth\u201d\n\nFinally, mid-tempo closer \u201cMental Slavery\u201d has winding riffage with an almost Middle Eastern feel and it\u2019s a marginally more laid back song that those before it. Nonetheless, it won\u2019t stop you to feel the urge to bang your head. It stands as one of my favorites along with the title-track, \u201cPeople of the Lie\u201d and \u201cTerror Zone\u201d. I should add that I also love that bass plucking intro on \u201cHidden Dictator\u201d, one of the few spots on which Roberto Fiorentti\u2019s four strings are clearly heard, usually buried beneath Mille and Frank\u2019s onslaught of stellar, breakneck riffs. Its sad, but it really doesn\u2019t affect the output. Now that I think of it, the production reminds me a lot of Master of Puppets, a classic thrash sound that discards much of the low-end bass while highlighting the guitars, only here Ventor\u2019s bass drums are way punchier than Lars Ulrich\u2019s on that seminal Metallica release. But the melodies on both records have that distinct nostalgic eighties sound that also reminds me of \u201887-\u201891 Sepultura. A sound I really dig even though I was a kid when it was invented, a sound that no retro-thrash act nor the current incarnation of those classic thrash bands have managed to achieve again. There\u2019s a part of thrash metal that died with modern day production standards, but fortunately that sound will never die as long as we own and enjoy thrash-terpieces such as this one.\n\nThe price of achieving such a peak in creativity, delivery and virtually all artistic areas cost Kreator dearly. Perhaps they knew themselves unable to surpass this record, perhaps it was the change of tastes in the thrash world, but probably it was their own very desire to experiment and broaden their musical palette that made them embark in an experimental phase, lasting from 1992 to 1999, which resulted in a handful of good tunes but a streak of very poor albums. There\u2019re some who hold Renewal in high esteem, but I\u2019ve never been able to enjoy that album much. It doesn\u2019t help to know that it might have been a continuation of the greatness of Coma of Souls had the band opted to do what they did (and do) best. But the past can\u2019t be changed, unless you get yourself a Delorian or a similar artifact. The rebirth of this band wouldn\u2019t come until eleven years have passed with Violent Revolution, which happens to be my second favorite album from the band, their \u201cSecond Awakening\u201d. So there\u2019s no need to change the past, we have Coma of Souls for eternity. Only two other albums from 1990 I deem even better than this one, Painkiller and Rust in Peace, but the fifth Kreator album is just as MANDATORY listen to any serious metalhead as those two.\n",
        "\nI can go either way regarding Kreator's modern output, and Hordes of Chaos falls in line with most of the band's post-Endorama material. I fully comprehend that one of the main draws to this album upon the time of its release was the antiquated recording practices that were employed, but at the end of the day it does little to separate Hordes of Chaos from it's direct predecessor, Enemy of God.\n\nIf there is one sonic attribute Kreator picked up throughout the '90s, it was a keen sense of melody. This doesn't necessarily surface on every song, but both the title track and \"Demon Prince\" feature Iron Maiden-like harmonized leads that coexist potently with the band's usual teutonic aesthetics. The riffs manifest themselves as sepulchral, caustic bombardments as per Kreator, but the harmonized leads are what really lift individual moments to greatness here. The biting, dissonant inclination of \"Escalation\" and the more deliberate, stomping persona of \"To the Afterborn\" are other highlights. The guitar tone is both classic sounding and heavy. The one major stylistic deviation compared to Enemy of God is the disposal of the overloud, modern distortion that plagued said album, and as such Hordes of Chaos benefits greatly.\n\nHowever, Hordes of Chaos also suffers from many of the same pitfalls that plagued its direct predecessor. Many of these tracks end up blurring together, rushing by with riffs either too stock or too forgettable to catch. This primarily occurs between \"Amok Run\" and \"Absolute Misanthropy\", ultimately accounting for about half of the album. These tracks aren't necessarily bad or offensive, but they pale in comparison to the rest of the proceedings. Save for the decent opener, Hordes of Chaos really comes alive during the final three tracks. \"To the Afterborn\" features a stinging, memorable chorus and a decent groove. Regardless, the highlight is without a doubt \"Demon Prince\". The terse, acoustically textured \"Corpses of Liberty\" slowly leads into it, at which point a glorious twin-lead manifests and escalates into the heart of the song. It doesn't even end there, as the melodic, emotive solo yields even more harmonic goodness. Moments like this separate Kreator from other, more standard modern thrash acts. I understand that some fans are not fond of the Gothenburg-influenced melodic side the band has been playing up recently, but it comes off as novel here, resulting in what is probably their best modern song.\n\nPetrozza's vocals I find myself in the middle of the road on. He reminds me of Boltendahl from Grave Digger in that his vitriolic approach would be out of place in nearly every band but his own. He has virtually no range and barely tries, so if there is a weak individual performance this is undoubtedly it. I'm assuming a lot of the modern influences regarding the guitars is a result of Yli-Sirni\u00f6's involvement, but he is a decent lead-smith and has settled into a comfortable niche here with Kreator. Reil's drumming is the same as it has always been, featuring typical thrash patterns and occasional, controlled bursts of speed. He is neither a standout nor a liability here.\n\nIt isn't amazing, but if I had to choose between this and Enemy of God, Hordes of Chaos edges it out by virtue of slightly more speed and vivacity in the performances. Don't miss \"Demon Prince\", if anything.\n",
        "\nHaving seen Kreator live, i can honestly say they have one of the best live sounds i've ever heard. No DVD can fully capture the sound of actually being there, but this is pretty good. The setlist is excellent although a little predictable. Kreator play it safe in terms of the songs they play, making this a 'Best Of' style set. The new DVD is no exception to this. \n\n'Extreme Aggression', 'Riot of Violence', 'Pleasure to Kill', 'People of the Lie', 'Flag of Hate'....they're all here and all played with passion and ferocity as you'd expect from Kreator. Performance is excellent, but the way the DVD is put together frustrates me.\n\nWatching it as a whole, every now and again the show stops to show some backstage clips or whatever. I hate this! Put that in the extras. Speaking of which, in amongst the extras are the final 2 tracks listed here, 'Flag of Hate' and 'Tormentor'. Not on the main show, but in the extras! They were recorded elsewhere which is fair enough, but why list this as one long show only to find the tracks are missing until you explore the extras? Whoever came up with this badly organised DVD layout needs a good slap.\n\nThe other main extra is a documentary mixed in with video clips from the particular era discussed at that point of said documentary. Not a bad way of doing it but personally i probably would separate the videos from the documentary. Interesting and detailed though so it's a worthwhile addition to the DVD.\n\nSo basically you've got a great show and an interesting documentary with a poorly organised design on this DVD. Buy it anyway, but be prepared for some minor annoyances.\n",
        "\nThe influential nature of Teutonic legends Kreator cannot be stressed enough, and yet is an often ignored aspect of extreme metal history in the eyes of the mainstream, that has all too often directed unwarranted focus towards what is often deemed the heralding location of thrash metal, i.e the west coast of the United States. The rise of the most ground breaking, stylistically defying and unconventional genres in the cryptic extreme metal movement of the late 80\u2019s and early 90\u2019s was simply a reciprocal exaltation to the formative influences bestowed upon the innovators of extreme metal. The raspy screams, percussive insanity and the battering riffs of these disgruntled, ferocity-driven youngsters from the industrial town of Essen would prove to serve as an influence for a legion of the band\u2019s followers across the world, that would in turn further intensify and shatter the artificial stylistic boundaries that had been set in stone and give birth to furthermore intrepid and adventurous styles such as death and black metal. The innovators of these aforementioned genres were looking for and consequently developed even more radical music in various parts of the world, having grown tired of the conventional modes of action already available in heavy metal, and one can quite easily draw a line tracing it back to the early musings of these German trailblazers, alongside similar innovators of the era such as Hellhammer/Celtic Frost, Sodom, Destruction, Possessed, Sepultura, Bathory and Slayer.\n\nHaving formed in 1982 as Tyrant, quickly shifting to the moniker Tormentor, the band has seen a varied career graph, starting with their debut Endless Pain (1985), which was essentially a rehashed speed-metal indulgence with a blackened edge. The band truly made a torrential entrance with 1986\u2019s seminal Pleasure to Kill, deemed by many as the heaviest thrash album of all time and widely known as one of three releases that comprise of the infamous trio of 1986, along with Slayer's 'Reign in Blood' and Dark Angel\u2019s \u2018Darkness Descends\u2019, all these albums being characterized by a very relentless, speed-driven and frenzied approach, which brought a new touch of heaviness and brutality to the genre at the time. Soon after, the band\u2019s work up until the early 90\u2019s was characterized by a new found ambitiousness, with the band reaching for the stars as far as technical dexterity, unique song-writing and thematic intelligence was concerned. Thereafter, an experimental phase saw the band dabbling in groove and industrial elements alongside a slew of line-up changes. Not surprisingly, this didn't go down well with their long term fans, but the dawn of the new millennium saw them return to their classic thrash sound, albeit with an audibly pulsating melodic twist, and has characterized the band\u2019s sound to date, and the current line-up seen on the DVD.\n\n\u2018Dying Alive\u2019 is the band's latest live DVD, released via the band\u2019s long term record label, Nuclear Blast Records and could be viewed as the summation of the shows the band played in support for their latest masterpiece, Phantom Antichrist (2012), which won the band both critical and fan acclaim. The show that was used to record this live DVD was a gig in Oberhausen, in the Ruhr area of Germany and a mere 13 KM away from their hometown, Essen. The DVD\u2019s main menu has a rather user-friendly interface that is fairly simple to traverse through. The graphics of this menu are in line with the cover artwork of the DVD and is nothing short of vivid and detailed, and truly reflects on the rounded vision of the band. While the main DVD presents the concert as a whole, there is also an option to choose select songs to view, in addition to other DVD bonus material such as the official music videos for the album\u2019s singles \u2013 \u2018Phantom Antichrist\u2019 and \u2018Civilization Collapse\u2019, behind the scene footage of the DVD\u2019s making, as well as a generic settings function that serve to adjust conventional particulars as per the viewer\u2019s preference.\n\nOnto the actual live experience, I would first like to say that I have had the pleasure of seeing the band live, coincidentally in the very same Phantom Antichrist support tour at the Bangalore Open Air on June 16th, 2012; and mere words cannot express the sheer intensity that the band brings to a live setting. Lest I digress into my own concert experience, the DVD starts with \u2018Mars Mantra\u2019, an excellent choice for an intro, which starts of as a somber dirge that descends into epic rhythms and melodies that serve to build up excitement for the thrash-tastic assault that awaits the audience. During this intro, lyrics across songs from the album are projected on the stage curtain against a backdrop of various paintings, which also have a thematic consistency, with the paintings all depict a variety of situations concerning war and general disarray. The band invokes nothing short of an adrenaline rush as the curtain drops and the band kicks off with the anthemic \u2018Phantom Antichrist\u2019, which bleeds directly into \u2018From Flood into Fire\u2019. The set-list is fairly diverse and touches upon every era of the band, and is a rather accurate representation of an average Kreator seltist. All the songs blend with each other in a similarly seamless fashion. However, it is fairly evident that the band\u2019s set-list choice is skewed towards the promotion of Phantom Antichrist, with five songs in all. Save for the crowd favorite \u2018Phobia\u2019, the band is seldom known to play songs from their experimental era, and this is reflected in the set-list choice on \u2018Dying Alive\u2019 s well. Despite some songs having been conceived almost two decades apart, they fit flawlessly into the band\u2019s set-list and there is no discernible obstruction in the flow and congruency of the set-list whatsoever.\n\nThe band\u2019s performance is nothing short of fantastic, and the chemistry between the members of the band\u2019s current line-up is akin to the type of live harmoniousness seen during their career peak in the late 80\u2019s and early 90\u2019s. The axe duo comprising of Mille Petrozza and Sami Yli-Sirni\u00f6 produce riff after riff in an effortless fashion. The interplay between the two is nothing short of enthralling, and the trade-offs in lead parts is beyond drool worthy. Sami Yli-Sirni\u00f6\u2019s performance cements his status as a sorely underrated guitar virtuoso. His guitar work is both technical and melodic, and yet does not descend into mindless noodling and also evokes and reinforces the mood of each song. The precursory acoustic intro to \u2018United in Hate\u2019 is an excellent reflection of Sirni\u00f6\u2019s versatility and showcases an unseen, elegant side of the band. Founding member J\u00fcrgen \u2018Ventor\u2019 Reil was often criticized for his apparent sloppiness and overtly speed-driven style of drumming in the early years of the band, but this live DVD makes any such notions invalid and his technical dexterity is a sight to watch. As an aside, the calmness and composed expression that Reil maintains while belting out his tireless brand of mayhemic drumming is also rather amusing. Christian \u2018Speesy\u2019 Giesler\u2019s bass is barely audible, but likely contributes to the overall heaviness wholeness of the band\u2019s sound. It must be said, however, that Kreator has essentially been a band driven by the distinctively ingenious and enjoyably esoteric guitar work of Petrozza. However, a band devoid of a bassist generally sounds thinner and more sterile, and to that extent Giesler\u2019s presence in the band is imperative, but not specifically something that adds to the distinctiveness to the dynamics of the band. Mille\u2019s vocal delivery has undoubtedly been subject to the inevitability that is aging, but still manages to retain the razor-sharp, raspy quality that came to characterize his vindictive sonic pillage. Petrozza\u2019s crowd interaction is genuine and evocative in a powerful and invigorating manner. Mille alternates between German and English, commanding for mosh-pits, crowd approval and the completion of lyrics in an assertive manner. One of my favorite aspects of the band\u2019s approach towards a live performance is the manner in which they prolong the space between two songs, by letting the feedback flow. During these intervals, you can hear the crowd chanting the band\u2019s name, and the general tension that builds up during these intervals effectively increase the level of excitement in the arena. Thus, when the band finally starts off with a new song, the crowd reaction is extremely uproarious.\n\nThe quality of the footage in the DVD is very high-quality, courtesy of the 24 cameras that were placed in strategic positions to cover every aspect of the show. Thus, the viewer experiences every aspect of a Kreator live show, and is shown footage of not only the band on-stage, but also a panoramic view of the stadium, close-up footage of various parts of the crowd, the circle/mosh-pits (a specific mosh-pit camera was set-up for the making of the DVD). The conventional guitar cams are satisfactory, as well. \n\nIn essence, this is a must-have for any Kreator fan, thrash metal enthusiast or live DVD collector, and yet is also an excellent gateway to newer fans who are looking to get into the band\u2019s sound, as it chronicles and covers both various eras of the band\u2019s creative musings through its set-list, as well as the band\u2019s sheer combative tenacity as a live force. The band presents a monolithic, momentum-driven performance with healthy doses of ruthlessness and palpitating doses of sensible melody; and merely reinforces its status as one of the premier live acts of the genre, apart from its position as one of the most influential yet underplayed acts of heavy metal music. Apart from the fact that this live show might not be wholly universal in nature given the usage of German during crowd interaction every now and then, I truly cannot find any prominent flaws apropos this DVD offering, and is in summation and immensely gratifying experience. The band seems to be in a very healthy place now, in terms of its preferred stylistic mode, creativity and popularity; and \u2018Dying Alive\u2019 is most certainly testament to that.\n\nOriginally written for - MetalWani.com\n",
        "\nDamn it, I expected much more!\n\nReally, I read a countless number of reviews. The vast majority of them got enthusiastic final notes, so without any hesitation (man, this is another album of Kreator!), I decided to check \u201cPhantom Antichrist\u201d out. After first meetings with this, I was bashfully pleased with another Kreator product, but my positive impressions weakened quite fast. My doubts started to concern the music itself. As compared to the albums recorded after \u201cEndorama\u201d, the musicians made great play with\u2026 melody. Of course, the great eighties times are gone now, just like very hard, difficult next decade. Now, these persevering Germans perform\u2026 yes, what do they exactly perform? For sure, this is not a pure thrash, because they courageously bathe in the reservoir with two labels: heavy metal (strong Iron Maiden influences) and melodic Swedish death metal. Anyway, I got very professional product (as always) with memorable Wes Benscoter front cover. \n \nMusically the band gave me a real kaleidoscope of emotions. I got well known songs, for sure the musicians didn\u2019t forget about \u201cViolent Revolution\u201d album, yet I don\u2019t treat it as a blind imitation of \u201cEndorama\u201d successor. Good, fast and aggressive riffs, venomous Mille\u2019s vocals and characteristic melodies in chorus are the main elements of the title track and \u201cDeath to the World\u201d, they are simply the best songs on the album\u2026 Unfortunately it\u2019s very hard to write such words about the rest. Why? Because there are two songs that don\u2019t fit to Kreator completely: \u201cFrom Flood into Fire\u201d (in slow tempo, with average portion of riffs and awful (!) melodic lines in chorus supported by choral singing, which make it a third league Grave Digger song) and \u201cUntil Our Paths Cross Again\u201d (with many sugary pseudo melodies and unacceptable tempo changing, from nice and definitely and too sweety moments, to useless fast shots). And the remainder sits somewhere in the middle. The songs are varied for sure, there no place for stagnation, and the band doesn\u2019t bring any unpleasant surprises, as the clean Petrozza vocals (almost two minute singing in the beginning of \u201cYour Heaven My Hell\u201d) and fantastic solo leads by Sami (especially in \u201cVictory Will Come\u201d) are commonly known among the Kreator disciples. But! I am too far to be under the impression. In general, \u201cPhantom Antichrist\u201d is a very mediocre proposal with significant stylistic defects.\n\nWriting some words about the final mark, one thing have to be declared: I\u2019m a worshipper of the first Kreator era, still I have in mind all these great albums from the glorious past\u2026 And I arrive at the main conclusion that \u201cPhantom Antichrist\u201d suffers from the lack of thrashing brutality and (extreme) aggression. The worse thing, I guess, is that I will remember this record due to these songs that ruined the musical wholeness. That\u2019s right, there are tracks that make my blood runs faster, where music has its fine moments, still I can see enormous potential for the future, but the remainder is unacceptable (two songs I mentioned) or almost unacceptable (thrashing killers with too festive melodies). The entirety has a perfect sound realization, unfortunately tempo changes effectively destroys many songs, when the band serves fast tempos by turns with sweet melodies and clean vocals. Even if this album is a much worse version of \u201cViolent Revolution\u201d, but mercifully still better than \u201cEndorama\u201d, the Kreator live tracklist got some new killer songs. In my opinion the album seems to be a first step for metal beginners, or gothic fans. Not so brutal, yet with memorable and easy tunes. Is this a true face of Essen thrashers? I don\u2019t think so. Thus, should I be afraid of the next release? Time will show, naturally I don\u2019t want to hear another \u201cPleasure to Kill\u201d copy, however definitely more aggressive and mad stuff is needful.\n",
        "\nI'd like to dedicate the song \"Absolute Misanthropy\" to the haters of this album. I cannot, for the life of every DNA strand in my 5' 10\" fleshy husk, understand the utterly revolting and unwarranted dislike for Kreator's 12th studio effort, \"Hordes of Chaos\". This album was their first in any years to be recorded live in the studio, leading many very stupidly to hope for another \"Pleasure to Kill\" for some dumb reason. The result was a very, VERY strong followup of the melody-infused, riff-happy technical thrash they've been doing since \"Terrible Certainty\". The aggression, brutality, riffs, attitude, not to mention a raw, REAL production job, all there, and people bitch and whine about a good thing. Fuck the fuckers who don't know a good thing when they hear it, and no they're never gonna make another \"Pleasure To Kill\" so shut up! \n\nAnyway, the band is on fire here, still riding the high of aggression heard in spades on the oh so slightly inferior \"Enemy of God\". Mille Petrozza's rhythm guitar works are just vicious, and the tone is gnarly and fearsome. Then his vocals...wow, did someone tow his car before he recorded, 'cause he is still fucking angry! Mille still has that rough, scratchy angry in his voice and he's not afraid to use it! Sami Yli-Sirni\u00f6 still makes for a hell of a lead man, even if (I think personally) his solos run together a bit. Still at least the guitar tone tone is an improvement, a far cry from the wimpy sound it had back on something like \"Violent Revolution\". Bass has rarely been a major playing factor with Kreator, and that changes not for Christian Giesler, whose work still remains basically invisible. The sound of the album is given its full, rounded-out ferocity thanks to Ventor, whose dynamic, ripping double bass is still top of the line and still as strong as Mille's vox even after all these years. \n\nWrapped up in a natural-sounding, raw production, \"Hordes of Chaos\" cooks from beginning to end. There's a cantankerous, vicious vibe of energy from each song, even I want to pick just two that don't pop as well. \"Amok Run\" is cursed with something of an odd alternative/industrial intro before starting to get going. But even still it's not to engaging, especially the boring, repetitive chorus. \"To The Afterborn\" retains the energy, but offers little of interest in the way of riffs or even a good solo. Oh, and the interlude \"Corpse of Liberty\" is fucking useless; I hate interludes.\n\nBut every, and I mean EVERY other song grabs me by the nads and chucks me against a rusted metal wall over and over as I beg for more! The title track and the closer, \"Demon Prince\", infuse the group's new-found sense of melody with a series of memorable, crushing riffs and a series of wicked tempo shifts; the title track has a particularly cool chorus you just wanna scream from the top of your local church. You know, just for kicks. A series of shorter bloodthirsty cookers permeate the running time as well, like the charging, guitar-crazy \"Escalation\" and spitfire killer \"Absolute Misanthropy\". Elements of the more modern-sounding \"Warcurse\" and the stomping \"Destroy What Destroys You\" bring in more mid-paced aesthetics.\n\nOverall, there's little to nothing wrong with this album. Just because it's a little melodic (it helps the music to be more memorable fuckhead!) and it's not \"Pleasure To Kill\" again apparently means it's modern throwaway garbage from a band trying to stay relevant. Yeah right. I've even heard so-called metal fans trashing the production for fuck's sakes! Just don't listen to the haters; Kreator has done right once more. From the still youthful aggression to the sweet production to the ripping riffs and choruses, \"Hordes of Chaos\" is well done modern thrash. Listen well, and listen for yourself.\n",
        "\nOut of all the thrash albums from the 1980s that I have heard Pleasure to Kill was perhaps the least accessible with the tracks \u201cPleasure to Kill\u201d and \u201cRiot of Violence\u201d being the only standout tracks amongst the wall of noise. However, the album grew on me and now I like all of the songs off of the album. I now consider it to be the best and my favorite thrash album of all time alongside Slayer\u2019s Reign in Blood. In fact, in terms of intensity, Pleasure to Kill outdoes Reign in Blood.\n\nA particular high mark of Pleasure to Kill is Jurgen Reil\u2019s drumming which sounds kind of like a blastbeat you would hear in early Napalm Death or Mayhem due to how chaotic it is. Some people say that Reil\u2019s drumming is not very precise and sloppy, but I by no means see this as a downside since the looseness of the drumming sounds faster and denser than say a clean precise metronome perfect beat. The engineer/producer of this album did a good job (or bad job depending on your tastes) of making the drums sound muffled and murky which serves to make the drums sound faster and crazier. I am a huge fan of the murky sound quality of early death metal albums recorded at Morrisound Recording, especially Suffocation\u2019s Effigy of the Forgotten, which is one of the heaviest death metal albums ever. \n\nAnother high mark are the vocals, done by Mille Petrozza and Reil, which alongside Sodom\u2019s Tom Angelripper are on the verge of being death/black metal in nature. Some say that Reil\u2019s vocals are satisfactory compared to Mille\u2019s vocals, but I would disagree greatly. Reil\u2019s vocal performance is amazing on the three tracks he provides vocals for: \u201cRiot of Violence\u201d \u201cCommand of the Blade\u201d and \u201cDeath is Your Savior.\u201d The German accented vocals he delivers at blistering speeds with many of the words being slurred together really makes for an intense unique sound. Of course there is no argument to how guttural, raspy and heavy Mille\u2019s vocals are particularly on \u201cCarrion,\u201d perhaps the least loved song of the album. Be sure to listen carefully to the vocals that begin at the 3:50 mark of the song where I think he gives his heaviest and best vocal performance of the album. \n\nThe guitars on this album are surprisingly catchy once you get into them because initially as I said before it was just a blistering indiscernible wall of noise upon the first few listens. Standout tracks in terms of catchiness are \u201cDeath is Your Savior,\u201d \u201cRipping Corpse,\u201d \u201cPleasure to Kill,\u201d \u201cCommand of the Blade,\u201d especially the main verse riff which begins at the 00:31 mark, and \u201cUnder the Guillotine.\" \"The Pestilence\" is the epic of the album being the longest song filled with a endless series of riffs. As a result \"The Pestilence\" will probably be the last song that one will get into since it trades in immediacy for length and complexity. As for the solos, they are probably going to take the most getting used to because of their sheer shrillness. Despite the tendency of the solos to have the same effect on your mind and body as someone raking their nails on a chalk board, they fit in well with the music and I cannot imagine any other type of soloing style working.\n\nThough the bass guitar does not have any standout moments in terms of audible fills, breaks, or solos it accomplishes its job by thickening up Kreator\u2019s sound. The bass guitar is also surprisingly audible throughout most of the album, one just has to listen a little carefully for it or focus their hearing on that part of the mix. This was surprising to me because I only noticed the bass guitar until after I had gotten really into the album and before then I did not even notice it or I assumed it was buried in the mix.\n\nIf you like 1980\u2019s German thrash metal, this album is a must. However, first I would recommend checking out the other Teutonic thrash masterpieces, Sodom\u2019s Persecution Mania and Destruction\u2019s Infernal Overkill, to warm your ears up because Kreator\u2019s masterpiece is much less accessible due to its speed and intensity.\n",
        "\nThere are few modern thrash albums that can square off with their 80's and early 90's counterparts. Ironbound is one, Endgame, perhaps, a second. However, the best of the modern bunch, and certainly the only one that is actually better than many of the best 80's thrash albums, is Kreator's Hordes Of Chaos. Having already made their thrash revival two albums previously, with 2001's Violent Revolution, Kreator built upon this album with Enemy Of God, but from the very first notes of the intro of the title track it is clear that Hordes Of Chaos is going to blow both of these out of the water.\n\nFor the first time since Coma Of Souls, Kreator sounded hungry for blood again, mixed with the raw, primal, live in studio recording sound unheard from this band since 1986's Pleasure To Kill. This truly is something completely special, seamlessly blending the technical style of Coma Of Souls with the speed of Endless Pain, and the melody of their more recent releases, creating a 10 song, 39 minute whirlwind album that blazes past, leaving only wreckage in its wake. This is how Kreator should sound.\n\nThe opening two tracks remind the listener straight away that this is Kreator, and if anyone slept on the streak of mediocre albums that preceded this, then their eyes are ripped wide open as riffs created by the masters of the art pierce their ear drums. Mille Petrozza's angry vocals are present and correct, although still not as powerful as on such albums as Pleasure To Kill, Extreme Aggression and Terrible Certainty, they still manage to flow well with the music and deliver a point in such a way that only Mille could. His typically angry lyrics return, only this time they are exceedingly relevant to the world we live in at the moment in a way that not even the title track of Violent Revolution could aspire to be.\n\nThe greatest moments of this album, however, are where it moves a little away from the traditional Kreator sound, and into either the more melodic sound explored on more recent albums, or even the hints of their Outcast-era material. The intro to Amok Run could well have come directly off of that album, being somewhat a carbon copy of that song to begin with, with the soft intro with dark, clean singing. The tinges of melody found throughout this album are very pleasing to hear, from the beautifully composed intro to the title track to the instrumental song Corpses Of Liberty. These moments are spaced perfectly throughout this album to ensure that it remains fresh throughout. This is the albums chief success-it never fails to entertain all the way through, with something new to hear upon every listen.\n\nAs for the thrash metal songs on here, they are thrash metal as only Kreator could write. Their is a perfect blend of fast paced numbers (Warcurse, Escalation) and slower, more groove-oriented thrash in the vein of Pantera's Cowboys From Hell, in particular Destroy What Destroys You. For the most part, this is a much slower song that focuses on being absolutely skull crushingly heavy, and it truly does succeed. From the first riff through to the final notes, this is one of the most aggressive songs Kreator has ever written.\n\nMusically, this is Kreator at their absolute peak. The riffs are as tight as we have come to expect from a band as highly revered as Kreator. The best of the bunch would be found on the song Demon Prince and the title track, but they are first rate right across the board. The drumming is Ventor on top of his game, with much of this defeating his work on Enemy Of God, which many consider to be his best performance to date. The intro drums to Warcurse in a way remind me of a much more to the point version of Impossible Brutality. This is his most refined, aggressive show he has ever put on, and goes far beyond merely churning out a beat for the rest of the band to build off. The bass is inaudible, which is a large shame, but is nothing more than the preconceptions that the listener has going into the album. This is Mille and Ventor's show, as has always been the case with Kreator. Mille's vocals are as angry as they have always been, with great lyrics to back them up, which is always nice to hear. This is pretty much the flawless album on a purely musical note.\n\nThe one minor complaint that can be made of this album is that Absolute Misanthropy was not entirely necessary, and merely interrupts the album. This is an album where every song other than this one is a killer track, so this really is a shame to put a filler song directly in the middle of so many amazing ones that merit play after play. However, the song is not entirely boring, and has some killer riffs and a razor sharp vocal performance, it just feels a tiny bit unnecessary when placed among so many songs that far out do it in every single respect.\n\nThis is an album that is nearly flawless thrash, with just one minor blip to interrupt it and keep it away from utter perfection. This goes toe to toe with, and curb stomps, almost every classic thrash album ever released, and stands proud as the second finest album in Kreator's discography, behind only Coma Of Souls. This builds off of the two albums that preceded it, which were mainly albums all about treading water in the thrash metal scene for the first time in over a decade, and sets a new bar for modern thrash albums, even higher than that set by Endgame. Then again, this is Kreator... What did we all expect?\n",
        "\nWhen most people think Kreator, they think the brash ear assault of Pleasure To Kill, the refined aggression of Extreme Aggression or the technical workout of Coma Of Souls. Some may think of the return to the thrash style they helped make popular in their native Germany with such great albums as Enemy Of God and Phantom Antichrist. However, one often overlooked album is their dabble with the industrial genre, heavily influenced by bands such as Fear Factory, Nine Inch Nails and certain aspects of Marilyn Manson. The album utilized simplified chugging riffs and tuneless shouting from frontman Mille Petrozza across 12 adrenaline soaked songs. The album I am referring to is the criminally overlooked 1995 album Cause For Conflict, the album I personally think of when I think about Kreator.\n\nThis is an album that got a lot of hate upon its release, and still is, with many fans of the band being particularly angered by the blatant disregard for their thrash past. However, the band could not have gone on putting out thrash great after thrash great, as had already been shown following the release of Extreme Aggression, with Coma Of Souls spending too much time focusing on being as complex as possible to use the bands real strength-their sheer rage. However, this rage that made the band so great on albums such as Endless Pain, Terrible Certainty and Extreme Aggression is present and in correct order on Cause For Conflict, with every song sounding just as pissed off at the world as the previous one. Whilst Mille's voice is definitely not the same as found on past releases, it is perfectly fitting for a release such as this, clearly containing a large amount of Fear Factory influence in its styling. The vocal patterns are, at times, a little off in this album, however, particularly when the songs speed up and Mille has to frantically deliver his vocals in order to keep up with the music. His voice is considerable monotonous throughout this album, but that tone is one that packs an edge to it unlike so many passionless vocalists out there, and for that Mille deserves credit, for showing that even in a samey genre such as Industrial, he can still kick it with the best.\n\nMany consider the major criticism to be made about this album to be the lack of Jurgen \"Ventor\" Reil behind the drum kit, and whilst this is clear from the off, it is also obvious that the band found a more than worthy replacement in the form of Joe Cangelosi. Cangelosi can keep a solid beat going with his double bass work, keeping a sound of intensity and showing that the band was not finished after their original drummer left. Joe overuses the double bass somewhat, but is still an adequate drummer, and, during the faster moments of this album he really shines. Catholic Despot, when it speeds up, is the best example of how good Joe can be at times, with some of the fastest beats on the album contained within this song and handled brilliantly by the new man with the sticks. At the other end of the rhythm work, the bass is at its most audible on a Kreator album here, with Christian Giesler clunking away incessantly, playing some nice bass work throughout the album that shows off something rarely heard on a Kreator album, making this somewhat unique in the bands discography.\n\nThe one slight throwback to the glory days of Kreator on this album is found in the guitar work. Specifically, some of the riffs are very much the signature crunchy brand of riffs found on albums such as Terrible Certainty. Whilst the past album, Renewal, had showcased a heavy industrial sound, this was the album that sounded most akin to the forerunners of the genre, whilst retaining a moderate amount of thrash riff work at times. This is still a far cry from the guitar work found on their previous releases, but certainly has a bite to it that the previous release lacked somewhat. The one riff that stands out the most among this entire album is the very first one found on the opening song, Prevail. This is one of the strongest songs on the album, containing relentless drumming from Joe Cangelosi and a level of passion and anger that is obvious from the off. The riffs to this are about as tight as the album gets.\n\nThis album contains significantly more thrash influence than on the previous album, but is definitely still an experimental album for them, and one that tops much of their discography. Whilst on a purely musical level, this may not be as good as some of their previous work, the sheer rage behind this album is more than enough to carry it and prop it up among the best they have put out. This may well be my favorite Kreator album for the simple fact that it is unrivaled anger packed into relatively short songs. There are a few more than headbangable moments found throughout this album, with the slower section towards the end of the third song definitely being the most notable. This is a great album that gets slept on unfairly, and is certainly worth a look.\n\nOriginally written for Sputnik Music\n",
        "\nGerman thrash legends Kreator have come a long way since the barbaric infernal racket of Endless Pain and Pleasure to Kill. Ever since returning to a more straightforward metallic attack with 2001\u2032s Violent Revolution after a misguided experimental phase, the band have experienced a rather impressive late-career resurgence, marked by the ripping instant classic Enemy of God and the solid Hordes of Chaos. Now with their thirteenth album Phantom Antichrist, Kreator have completed their stylistic evolution from primal thrash overlords to quasi-gothic/industrial metal weirdos to purveyors of thunderous, thrash-tinged traditional metal.\n\nEssentially, Phantom Antichrist is what Iron Maiden would sound like had they been German rather than British, and Steve Harris hadn\u2019t tried to turn the band into a prog-rock circus. Kreator have retained every bit of the ferocious extremity that made them gods of the Teutonic thrash movement, but they have also fully integrated the trad/NWOBHM elements exhibited on their last three albums, creating something that can only be described as classic heavy metal. While some have accused Kreator of adopting a Gothenburg/melodic death metal sound, I\u2019m afraid I have to call bullshit on that. Guitarist/vocalist/band leader Mille Petrozza is forty-five years old and Kreator has been around since at least 1984; do you honestly think they\u2019ve been influenced in the slightest by fucking In Flames? Gimme a goddamn break. Kreator\u2019s incorporation of trad metal riffs and harmonies is clearly derived from the elder gods themselves; the aforementioned Maiden, as well as Judas Priest. I can only assume that the fools crying melo-death have either never heard Number of the Beast, or are still bitter over the fact that Kreator have chosen to continually evolve throughout their career instead of releasing infinite variations of Pleasure to Kill.\n\nBut style doesn\u2019t mean anything without substance; fortunately Phantom Antichrist possesses substance in spades. The songwriting here is among the most mature and varied of Kreator\u2019s entire career, possessing a level of finesse befitting a veteran band. Even though we\u2019re all well aware that this is far from being Kreator\u2019s first rodeo, there is still something utterly impressive about the level of compositional and instrumental precision on display here. Phantom Antichrist is German metal engineering at it\u2019s finest; not a single note out of place, not a single note wasted. The guitar work of Petrozza and Sami Yli-Sirni\u00f6 is, to be perfectly blunt, off the fuckin\u2019 hook, a mash-up of old school thrash metal terror tactics and NWOBHM-derived shock and awe, while drummer Ventor and bassist Christian Giesler keep the rhythms punchier than a Tyson fight circa 1988. All of this is wrapped in a crisp production job from Jens Bogren, which emphasizes both power and clarity without sounding overly processed or triggered.\n\nLyrically, Petrozza sticks with the tried \u2018n\u2019 true themes that have come to be synonymous with Kreator, such as the horrors of war, the destruction of the environment and the collapse of civilization. These lyrics would probably sound trite or cheesy coming from just about any other vocalist, but Petrozza\u2019s rasp drips with conviction, and it doesn\u2019t hurt that there are hooks aplenty built into them. Although Kreator don\u2019t play straight-up thrash these days, they\u2019ve managed to retain the genre\u2019s social conscience; perhaps they can teach these new-jack bands that there\u2019s more to thrash lyrics than zombies, mutants and pizza.\n\nKreator have proven time and again that they are a metallic force to be reckoned with, and Phantom Antichrist is the latest crown jewel in a series of late-career albums that are for the most part totally unfuckwithable. It is both a sharpening and a refinement of the sound they\u2019ve been hammering away at for the past decade, coming impressively close to complete perfection while still leaving room for further progression. Founding members Petrozza and Ventor may be getting on in years, but Phantom Antichrist will leave no doubt in fans\u2019 minds that the Kreator war machine is still more than capable of achieving supremacy through superior firepower.\n\nOriginally written for That's How Kids Die.com\n",
        "\nDefinitely a step up from their previous release entitled \"Hordes of Chaos\", this release is heavier and way more aggressive thrash metal played with utmost intensity. I'd say it's about as good as \"Enemy of God\", but nothing tops \"Coma of Souls\". However, these guys flourished during the 80's (1985) and then went to hell during the 90's, then came back with vengeance with \"Violent Revolution\". Here the lead guitar work is much more well played out plus of course rhythms that are definitely original with a combination of tremolo picked riffing plus some fretboard chaos. A solid production definitely with an even keel of mixed tempos, but overall plainly original.\n\n45+ minutes of brutality and mixture of thrash with some clean guitar playing. However, most songs are heavy and filled with monumental distortion and utmost speed. The riffs themselves are wholly well constructed. Mille's vocals have never changed and they fit well with the guitar and intensity. This album is just so much more enthusiastic with riff-writing frenzied guitar featuring amazingly fast frets played with vigor. A great one to pick up and a Kreator release that can't be outplayed. I really think that this is a monument because it's so aggressive and catchy.\n\nSome clean tone guitar exhibited here, however, mostly what is gripping are the distorted riffs. A lot of it reflects the past with all of the aggression and utmost originality. I dug most of the guitar on here because it's played with precision. These guys don't fool around when it comes to belting out fury in their music within the genre of thrash metal. This is definitely what they play their best. The leads are definitely much better than on \"Hordes of Chaos\". They don't overdo it with them either. The bulk is within the rhythm guitar work. Much better played than their predecessor.\n\nThe music is the highlight of this release. It contains all elements of metal and they mix up some songs with a bit of clean tone guitar. Not the whole album is wholly aggressive, just most of it. Mille sounds extremely pissed off here which fits well with the distorted guitar work. A lot of their lyrical topics have been exceptionally interesting to me, just the music and the vocals. The recording quality here is phenomenal. Everything is well mixed in there. The quality here is exceptional and everything flows diligently. The bass guitar could have been a bit louder and that's my only complaint.\n\nIf you want an album that is fast and furious, thrash metal galore, and just overall a plain original sounding and awesomely well played out, \"Phantom Antichrist\" hits home with vigor. You'll find everything here so balanced out. The lead guitar, rhythms, clean tone melodies, great chorus pieces, and mastermind production sound, this album is for you. I didn't think too highly of it until I listened to it maybe 4-5 times. Then everything to me seemed to fit into place. Again, nothing tops \"Coma of Souls\", but this band really makes a dent in their discography meaning that it's an album that hits home in all aspects.\n",
        "\nMy favourite thrash bands were always Celtic Frost and Kreator. Up to 1988 both bands had not only released amazing records but along with the blinding music the artwork on their records were always clever or raw and always exciting. In \u201988 Celtic Frost released Cold Lake. More of a rock record than thrash but at least the cover showed a new logo. When it became Kreator\u2019s turn to release new material I just didn't get their front cover at all. It showed a stock photo of the band with a photoshopped red/orange background slapped underneath. I understand the reasoning behind it. Interviews at the time were hinting towards the band writing more serious songs with less dungeons and dragons / heaven and hell themes. But bands such as Metallica, Death and Megadeth had done a great job with serious topics portrayed on the sleeve. Extreme Aggression\u2019s cover just felt a little weak and a hell of a lot cheap.\n\nThe band made a video for the lightning fast Betrayer and it got some heavy rotation on Headbangers Ball and in the UK on the BBC\u2019s Friday Rock Show. Due to this the band found themselves with an expanding fan base and I can see why, I love it when Mille Petrozza sings his \u201cYou can\u2019t deny, you can\u2019t deny\u201d part before the chorus and it really fired me up for the release of the album.\n\nI bought it in Our Price record store on the day of release on vinyl and played it to obliteration. I still have the same copy now, all of its its pops and crackles are proof positive of this. Listening back today the opening title track still has that same fire within it as it did back in the day. The opening scream may not have the same impact as Slayer\u2019s Angel Of Death but its damn close and the riff is just as good as that monster classic. The best moment on the record comes in the form of Some Pain Will Last Forever, it has a great spiralling riff that flowers into another monster guitar part and its mid-tempo pace clearly separates it from the rest of the record as a stand out cut.\n\nThe only times that thing\u2019s get a little sloppy is when the band sing about child abuse on Bringer Of Torture. Its subject matter should probably be handled by somebody with a better grip of the English language. And again on the song Love Us Or Hate Us which musically is nothing short of brilliant but lyrically I think it is an attempt to bond Kreator fans together with some sort of anthem. Unfortunately it comes across as if the band is angry at receiving a rotten review, not so inspiring really.\n\nThe band may well have released a better album before this (Terrible Certainty, 1987) and after it (Renewal, 1992) but Extreme Aggression kept the thrash flame burning hot at a time when speed fuelled metal was on its last legs.\n",
        "\nA return to form is what this album should have been. When the title track was released as a single, I bet many Kreator fans was high on excitement, and apparently it stayed that way for many people. But not me, I don't understand all the praise that has been given to this album. The first two times I listened to this album I had to turn it off when I was half way through it. I was really looking forward to Kreator \"returning to form\" that I pre ordered the album on vinyl, and that is something I really regret.\n\nAfter the first three tracks, one of them being the intro, the album has already peaked, and from here it goes downhill until the record is done. If you heard the main single of the album, it contains an Iron Maiden cover. Despite a laughable scream in the start of the track the band covers The Number of the Beast quite well. The only problem... That style continued on the full album. I guess Kreator wants people to sing along and wave back and forth because this album feels like a melodic thrash metal tribute to Iron Maiden. There is only two tracks that I would shine some light on from the album, and that is Phantom Antichrist and Death to the World. These two tracks is the only ones I would describe as being worthy of being on a Kreator album. Because the main problem for this album is the band is trying to be something they are not. And when that doesn't ruin the songs, then it is the incredible bad lyrics...\n\nThe thing I however want to praise is the album cover. There are two versions, one awesome and one shitty. The awesome cover, which was made by Wes Benscoter who also has been employed by bands like Slayer, Autopsy and Cattle Decapitation. Wes' version of the cover is the red one that could remind you of the artwork for Pleasure to Kill and definitely is their best cover in many, many years. The shitty cover however looks so photoshopped that it hurts, and just doesn't look good. It was made by Jan Meininghaus who also has been working with bands like Falconer and Bolt Thrower.\n\nIf you, like me, expected Kreator to return to the tunes of Violent Revolution and Enemy of God, then you are in for a surprise. The phantom that appears on this album is what I would call melodic thrash metal, and a tribute to Iron Maiden. I really want to like this album but it just don't have what it takes. Even though I like some other melodic genres, this one does not please my ears, specially not when it has been kreated by a band that brought me albums like Pleasure to Kill and Extreme Aggression.\n\n-Alexander Dinesen\nwww.legacyreviews.blogspot.com\n",
        "\nKreator may have been the last of the German \u2018Big 3\u2019 to storm the gates of the ever burgeoning world of thrash, but to these ears, they wiped the floor with all the material both Destruction and Sodom had up to that point released. Endless Pain is very close in aesthetic to Slayer\u2019s debut, a driving storm of diabolical riff craft that attempts little outside of standard verse-chorus-bridge compositional dynamics. Though to be fair, the same could be said of the vast majority of thrash metal, especially the formative albums. So, when based purely on the strength of the songwriting, which is infectious enough to make you blow chunks in purulent glee, Endless Pain is a resounding success. These boys weren\u2019t quite as technically proficient as Destruction or as filthy as Sodom, instead lurking somewhere in between, but they more than distinguished themselves with an array of riffs that sear themselves like hot iron mushroom stamps into the memory banks, and their compelling dual vocal assault served to further differentiate them. There are hints of the unique monster Kreator would become in short order, but for the most part, this is very much in the ballpark of Show No Mercy, albeit with a raw, animalistic hatred for humanity that veritably drips with bloody audible saliva.\n\nThe fast, sharp NWOBHM style riffs are nothing incredibly unique, but they\u2019re both exciting and memorable, chopping and slicing along like shrapnel in a razor wind. This is pure-blooded thrash, through and through, though a certain aspect lends a blackened aesthetic to a number of tracks. Namely, Mille\u2019s vocals, rasping like some reptilian monstrosity, breathing ice all over the even numbered tracks. These duties are split down the middle with drummer Ventor, who lends a slobbering, filthy Neanderthal drawl to the odds. I like Mille\u2019s much better, as he\u2019s been one of my favorite vocalists (and guitarists) in the medium for years, but this dynamic switch-off does wonders in keeping already fun, yet familiar songs continuously fresh. All told, it\u2019s much more of a strength than a detriment. Mille\u2019s riffs and solos are all primed for war, sometimes just couple simple bars, and other times fast, scathing flurries. He and bassist Robert Fioretti work in tandem to get that head banging with rippling metal might, and the production feels raw and audible enough to do the music justice, if not accentuating these calculated napalm strikes. In all regards, you never feel like you\u2019re getting anything other than a grade A classic thrashing. \n\nThe whole experience is incredibly barbaric, at length, but therein lays the charm, a vibe and technique that would climax on Pleasure to Kill. Songs like Tormentor (why does every classic thrash band need a song called Tormentor?), Cry War, and Son of Evil just charge up with wild, violent abandon and slash your throat right out\u2026 in fact, you get that from most tracks here. Flag of Hate is also a highlight, of not only the album, but their entire career. The techniques are simple and few, but Endless Pain just exudes creepy, violent excitement the whole way through, like a pack of cave-dwelling, spear-wielding nightmare beasts relentlessly stalking you through the night, jabbering obscenities with bloodlust shining in their eyes. It\u2019s this revelatory primacy that lends such an instinctually satisfying edge to this album, with no need to intellectualize a damn thing, just feel the power and hatred surge while Mille shreds your face into scraps.\n\nEndless Pain is going to appeal most to those looking for good old school thrash. In fact, most people that will love this album already know it very well, but it bears repeating once again. If you\u2019re into classic intensity like Slayer, and other Bay Area bands, but haven\u2019t delved into the German division, this is an excellent starting point. Conversely, the new wave of thrashers might find this interesting, as it\u2019s a building block for a lot of material today, and more specifically to see the roots of the phenomenal, yet completely different band that Kreator embody today. Endless Pain is not perfect. It\u2019s loose, wild, and simple, and there\u2019s nothing here that will blow your mind like dynamite in a watermelon, but it\u2019s aged incredibly well, and is an absolutely essential addition to any self-respecting thrashers collection. That\u2019s a claim you\u2019ll see me make often, I\u2019m sure, and I assure you, I mean it every goddamn time. Out of all the founders of the empire called thrash, Kreator are one of my favorites, and moreover, Endless Pain is one fantastic debut album. As to whether or not it gets a top spot in the lexicon as a whole, I\u2019m not so sure, but it contains enough quality to continue kicking ass after nearly 30 years, and it wouldn\u2019t surprise me if it makes us spit blood after 30 more. Timeless awesomeness: the definition of classic.\n\n-Left Hand of Dog\nhttp://reaperdivision.blogspot.com/\n",
        "\nKreator are at a point where they don\u2019t owe anyone squat. Being a juggernaut of influence not only to thrash metal, but also being part of the Unholy Trinity (along with Slayer and Dark Angel) of thrash bands that would help smooth the transition of death metal\u2019s birth into a burgeoning scene. The band already went through a questionable experimental faze in the 90s, and since 2001\u2019s Violent Revolution, they have kept up a consistent pace of vicious, but cleaner thrash metal, which has generally appeased the fans. But after flirting with death metal on Enemy of God, the band turned to more melodic orientated work on Hordes of Chaos. In a sense, Phantom Antichrist does start where Hordes of Chaos left off, but it executes that style in a much more precise way, while using a few influences from more modern bands to give it a far more unique touch.\n\nEven though I mentioned this album definitely has a melodic focus, that doesn\u2019t mean it won\u2019t rip and tear when it wants to. It\u2019s not as intimidating as Pleasure to Kill or even Enemy of God, but this is still Kreator, and thus ripping, violent thrash riffing is abound. There are points that do almost bleed into full blown death metal, with pummelling blast beat\u2019s and chaotic, tremolo-picked riffing riding them through the chaos. But since this album is based in thrash for the most degree, this time Kreator have spun a lot more Iron Maiden and even Amon Amarth influences into the mix. For example, while thrash riffing is the norm for this record, there\u2019s a few songs (From Flood into Fire, The Few, The Proud, The Broken) that start off with an epic, dual-lead guitar bit that then breaks into a mid paced gallop, generally used by bands trying to get a Viking-march sound to their riffs. There are also a few songs (Civilisations Collapse, United in Hate) that have their choruses based around catchy, NWOBHM styled dual-lead guitar bits, harmonizing with Mille Petrozza\u2019s gruff vocals and riffs to make bombastic, attention grabbing melodies.\n\nThis style actually manages to work fine with Kreator\u2019s usual \u201cripping corpse\u201d thrash style, and does end up leading to some pretty catchy songs. But then there are points like Victory will Come. The song itself is generally pretty good and catchy, but the down tuned melo-death chugging that the song is based around succumbs to that distasteful, grit tone that plagues a lot of metalcore bands based off the genre. The overall song is awfully upbeat for the band as well, and almost seems like it would fit more on a mid period(Colony, Clayman) In Flames record, and some of these distasteful features bleed onto a few bits in other songs.\n\nWhile the band is all pretty much on the top of their game technically, Mille Petrozza\u2019s vocals are also still pretty gnarly in their own right too. But where as the man has clearly tamed his voice from the feral sound it had in the 80s, he did show on Enemy of God that he could let that monster loose again. Alas, we are not that lucky, as he sticks to his general, modern style of throaty yelling (albeit he does sprinkle it with an old-school shriek every once and awhile) on this effort. The bass work is more or less unapparent, but the drumming is pretty impressive in its own right. Ventor has always been a beast, and here he proves he is still the machine that thundered out Pleasure to Kill. The man has no problems out-playing most modern purveyors at their own game (although I guess it helps when you helped invent said game), that said, pummelling blast beats, smashing snares and whirlwind drumming (as well as chilled, softer pieces) makes the drumming on Phantom Antichrist appear surprisingly fantastic.\n\nThis record is pretty damn consistent in its styles, and makes for an overall enjoyable, smooth listen all the way through. But the thing is, a lot of the songs tend to be decently predictable. For example, you can pretty much assemble the tracks as having: 1. an aggressive, old-school Kreator riff. 2. Some sort of melodic-based ear catcher 3. A crazy solo and 4: some riffs somewhere in the middle that gel the three types together. Sometimes they\u2019ll throw in a curve ball, like a haunting acoustic guitar bit or a poppy, atmospheric intro, but those are rare. Really though, the beauty of this record is that the band have so perfected the ratio of aggression and melody between songs that you always feel the balance is totally covered by the beginning of the next track. IT never once seems to drag or have no idea where it\u2019s going. When it comes down to the lyrics on this effort, it is somewhat business as usual for the German thrashers. But it seems that Mille was really going for a lot more anthem-like choruses on this record, and it\u2019s reflected in the lyrics. Almost every other song contains some sort of chorus that beckons to be sung along too, using subjects such as fighting against oppressors or uniting against the corrupt and what not at an attempt to inspire.\n\nWhile most of the thrash bands lost sight of the game in the 90s, it really seems Kreator bounced back out of their odd phase quite quickly and set into a comfortable niche soon after. I guess the question most bands have to ask themselves then is: \u201cDo we bother trying to do something different ever again or just cut and paste over and over?\u201d. And while it kind of seemed like the band was trying different variances of their 80s style since 2001, I think Phantom Antichrist really sees the band recovering from the fan lash back that experimental, yet clearly flawed records like Cause for Conflict and Outcast caused on their creative limits. It\u2019s a bit more upbeat than your usual Kreator effort, and the Amon Amarth influence leaves a weird taste in your mouth, but it still aggressive and heavy, and there\u2019s enough good, memorable tracks on this record to make it a fun ride. Phantom Antichrist definitely shows that Kreator are still competent song writers. \n\n[Originally written as Adam Korchok for AXIS OF METAL http://axisofmetal.com/2012/07/kreator-phantom-antichrist/]\n",
        "\nIt\u2019s rare for a band over 20 years into their career to release even a single album that can measure up to, let alone surpass, the classics of their heyday. This fact makes it all the more astounding to behold the latest audible feast by genre veterans Kreator, who have proven time and again to be one of the world\u2019s premier acts to follow in not only thrash metal, but heavy music itself as an art form, spurring the universe on in their own simple, powerful way. Phantom Antichrist is no different, going above and beyond the call to become one of the greatest records in both their expansive catalogue, and the entire metallic lexicon.\n\n2005\u2019s Enemy of God was one of my favorite albums of that decade, and one of my favorite thrash records period; with a robust collection of truly epic songs, it\u2019s still in regular rotation in my car stereo today. 2009\u2019s Hordes of Chaos was a gem as well, if a mild disappointment in comparison. It was great, to be sure, but didn\u2019t have quite the same level of staying power, with an emphasis on repeated, hooky choruses rather than seriously epic melodies. Enter Phantom Antichrist, an album that contains more tasty riffs per square inch than most bands can manage in their entire career, and a serious run for Enemy of God\u2019s money as my favorite Kreator album. Only time will dictate overall preference, but for the sake of this review, all you need to know is that this is as close to thrash perfection as you could pray for. And pray you should, as Phantom Antichrist paints its dystopian picture with a savage grace, galloping its way into crushing thrash breakdowns, magnificent melodic bridges and ripping solo money shots.\n\nStarting with a fa\u00e7ade of deceptive calm, Mars Mantra glides gracefully into a furious crescendo, morphing into Phantom Antichrist, which bounds across the sand with sword in hand, slicing down poseurs and unbelievers in droves, before Death to the World summons a tidal wave of magma to incinerate the rest. From Flood into Fire is a Kreator manifesto, a marching song more infectious than the Black Death itself. Civilization Collapse gathers these amassed legions and sends them into battle, with a furious, driving verse and a chorus that scrapes the skyline, a melody so tasty it verily renders the sun itself. Like Enemy of God before it, this is not only a thrash album, but a work of unbelievably epic songcraft, a virtue illustrated by United in Hate, another conjuring of vast, panoramic hordes, uniting under the warrior-god cries of Mille. The Few, The Proud, The Broken ups the epic another notch with its soaring melodics and gladiatorial spirit. Your Heaven, My Hell softens you up with a soothing intro, akin to Voices of the Dead before it, and then breaks open the floodgates to an ocean of streaming melody, stabbing your heart and stomping your face in simultaneous rhythm. Victory Will Come\u2026. Yes, yes it fucking will. The album end on a note of hope in Until Our Paths Cross Again, a summation of all the great elements within this record, and contains one of the best lead guitar lines in the band\u2019s history.\n\nYou likely noted the word melody featured prominently in my gushing, and that\u2019s an important point, as this truly is a distinct hybrid of thrash with latent tendencies creeping in from the world of melodeath, a practice the band began with Enemy of God. Those who want nothing but neckbreaking thrash might not be satisfied with the kingly, stoic grandeur of Phantom Antichrist, but that truly is their loss, as nobody should miss out on this soul-blazing record.\n\nHistorically speaking, one of Kreator\u2019s most continuously admirable qualities is their insistence on evolution, even when it doesn\u2019t turn out quite as good as expected. Still, this is particularly satisfying considering the tendency of most old dogs of the thrash scene to stick to their established guns, and the majority of newer acts simply aping the output of the legends. In all, the genre becomes a bit of an inbred mess, and extra props go to Kreator for blasting them all out of the water. If I have any complaints at all, it\u2019s perhaps that this does not feel entirely new, as it follows pretty faithfully in Kreator\u2019s new songwriting and stylistic mold used in the last couple albums. However, being that the resulting quality is so immense, I would hardly call it a fault. \n\nPhantom Antichrist is not a reinvention, unlike past excursions such as Renewal, Outcast, and Endorama. Rather, it takes the best elements of a storied history and stitches the best parts together seamlessly, tightening and brightening the formula until it conjures that savage magic that is the hallmark of their very best releases, and I could not have asked or hoped for more. Those hoping for a return to the roots of Coma of Souls will have to remain disappointed, but we already have that record, don\u2019t we? Too many bands try live in the past, an idea that Kreator consistently spit on in their tireless quest for the holy grail of blazing awesome.\n\nNot a second is out of place on Phantom Antichrist, and every riff is glorious. It\u2019s a rare pleasure to obtain an album with absolutely no filler, where every track is lovingly crafted into a dynamic progression that builds its energy perfectly. Kreator choose just the right moments to build or ease tension, which makes every single song exude strength and heroism without ever feeling showy through unneeded technicality. This is not to take away from the musicians, as everyone is in force here as absolute demons, particularly Mille, who has never sounded better, and belts out all the apocalyptic screams you would expect, again with an impeccable sense of timing. Nothing is wasted, no element outweighing the rest; this is a perfect alchemical formula for a new ruling race of atomic, melodic thrash supermen, and sets the bar astoundingly high for the mid-point of 2012. \n\nIf you couldn\u2019t tell, I find Phantom Antichrist to be apocalyptically crushing. It nobly presents its dystopian lyrical slant through its chosen progression of notes, and contains some of the most delicious riffs I\u2019ve had the pleasure of experiencing in my 10 plus years enveloped in the world of metal. This is a return to the womb of that experience, a reaffirmation of my love for this art, and a poignant reminder that no matter how awash the metal multiverse gets in trends and bullshit, there will always be those who guard the flame, and keep it burning all the brighter. To put it plainly, Phantom Antichrist is a shining, thunderous example of why I listen to music, let alone metal. \n\nYou know, it\u2019s funny\u2026 it does nothing exceptionally new or inventive, and does not even begin to break or bend any borders, or redefine what is possible in metal. It\u2019s nowhere near as artistic or forward thinking as the groundbreaking work being done by artists like Ihsahn, Mastodon, and Gojira. However, Phantom Antichrist does what it does so well, kicks your ass so hard, in such an epic fashion, and is so endlessly goddamn enjoyable, that it doesn\u2019t matter one fucking bit. A near perfect release, one of the best this year, only lacking a fraction of Enemy of God's charisma. The beautiful end is beckoning you. Time to embrace it.\n\n-Left Hand of Dog\nhttp://reaperdivision.blogspot.com/\n",
        "\nKreator did a lot of right things with this record if we look on the well chosen and dosed ingredients. Kreator include just the right amount of excellent heavy metal riffs as in the short introduction called \"Mars Mantra\". The legendary German band also added a dose of truly powerful power metal as in the incredible hymn \"Iron Destiny\" that is by far the best song on this great record but only made it on the Japanese edition. We also hear more and more Gothenborg melodic death metal structures as in \"Death in The World\" for example. Off course, numerous classic thrash metal parts can also be found on this energizing release as in the strong title track \"Phantom Antichrist\" that takes no prisoners as excellent opener. \n\nSome critics may argue that this record is just more of the same and that this new release sounds comparable to the previous three studio records since the band moved away from their experimental and gothic influenced era. This is not completely wrong but the band rarely employed all these elements so well together. This times, the four cooks didn't spoil the broth and created an outstanding menu in ten or eleven extremely delicious parts. \n\nThis album includes not one wasted minute and every song has something that makes it enjoyable to listen to. Some songs have a great drum work as \"Civilization Collapse\" with its tight opening. Others impress with incredible melodic guitar solos that are played with passion and technique that make you want to go down on your knees as in \"Victory Will Come\". Other songs have chilling calm passages as the great acoustic guitar introduction of \"United In Hate\" that makes you think of a Metallica or an OverKill ballad before a truly fast main part crashes in. That's one of the strongest points of this release. The band just found the right dose of melodic breaks that give you a little pause from all this incredibly arranged extreme metal madness.\n\nAnother strength can be witnessed after only two or three tries. Most of the songs are truly catchy and quickly grow on you. Sometimes, it's an incredible solo or melodic break you can't get out of your mind. In another moment, it's a powerful chorus that will be yelled by thousands of metal maniacs during the band's future concerts and should become a new live anthem. In other tracks, it's just a well done moshing part that makes you go insane for a while. Once again, Kreator release a record with strong emotions about inner struggles and also include socially critic lyrics here and there that make you not only want to sing along but also to think about. There's definitely a lot of diversity to discover on this release without making it sound too cerebral for only one second. There are challenging records that impress with a handful of well employed ideas in complex structures and there are enjoyable albums that will immeditaley grip you and make you sing and move along from the first second suntil the very end. This release is both of it and therefor a rare pleasure that should get the praise it deserves.\n\nIn the end, any fan of the energizing metal music should own this record. If you had only to buy three records of the year, this one should definitely be on your list along with the latest releases of Rush and Blaze Bayley in my humble opinion. I only hesitate to buy this record in my local store for one single reason: I really want to find a way to get the version with the outstanding bonus track \"Iron Destiny\" on it. If you don't have the patience to purchase the expensive import version, buy the regular release and download the amazing track but be sure to not miss this best extreme metal record of the last couple of years.\n",
        "\nA new Kreator album is always a time to rejoice, and whilst their previous opus Hordes of Chaos wasn't as well received as the epic Enemy of God I still felt it was a good album that was unfortunately marred with less than desirable production qualities. Slight history lesson aside, Kreator are back with their thirteenth(!) full-length Phantom Antichrist.\n\nHere we see Kreator breaking into new territories. Taking a few steps away from the thrash genre - although undeniably retaining that element of their sound - on Phantom Antichrist they start to flirt more with epic power metal themes and melodic death metal-style melodies. However don't let that scare you off, as there is still plenty of thrash nuances, and Kreator are of course still heavy as hell. The album kicks off as any Kreator album should and smashes your skull into pieces with the fiery title track. A definite Enemy of God vibe can be heard from the get go, and as a matter of fact I'd say stylistically Phantom Antichrist is the logical continuation of the sound kreated (did I really just do that?) on said album, as well as a slight air of Coma of Souls.\n\n\"Death to the World\" shows some of the more melodic tendencies that can be found across Phantom Antichrist, although it really serves as a precursor to the awesome \"From Flood Into Fire\" which might just be one of the best songs Kreator have penned in years. Have they been hanging out with Grave Digger? That chorus would lead you to believe so. A quality track with catchy riffs and one of the band's best choruses (probably because they don't chant the song title four to eight times). However this track sadly includes the first instance of clean vocals on the album which I can guarantee will turn some people off, fortunately they don't appear all that frequently, and honestly aren't all that bad. \n\n\"Civilisation Collapse\" and \"United By Hate\" both show everything we've come to love about Kreator's \"second wind\" (Violent Revolution onwards) and deliver all the bludgeoning riffs and inspiring leads and/or melodies required. \"The Few, The Proud, The Broken\" is a track everyone seems to be enjoying in particular and it's hard to argue otherwise, a masterful number with some superb riffs. \"Your Heaven, My Hell\" is probably the weakest on the album, although once it gets going it is good. The album closes off with two brilliant numbers: \"Victory Will Come\" is absolute magic again featuring superb guitar riffs and \"Until Our Paths Cross Again\" does everything \"Your Heaven, My Hell\" wanted to do and leaves the album closing on a damn fine note.\n\nAt first I wasn't so sure on Phantom Antichrist, as I was expecting more in the way of thrashing aggression as opposed to the majestic feel delivered. A good few listens later and I was sold however, and now I'd probably have to say this was the best move for the band. I'm the first one to complain when thrash gets stale, which happens a lot these days, and it takes a genre master like Kreator to do something a little different. An excellent album from one of the best bands on the planet, this one comes with some pretty damn high recommendation.\n\nOriginally written for http://www.metalcrypt.com\n",
        "\nYes. I am serious when I give this album a 97. This album was released in 1999, when thrash metal had pretty much been dead for 8 or 7 years. We had Destruction's ABSOLUTELY APPALLING \"The Least Successful Human Cannonball\" as well as Megadeth's \"Risk,\" and Metallica's \"Load\" and \"ReLoad.\" Now, is this a thrash metal album? No, not really. It is a gothic/industrial metal album with a small trace of thrash, but the thrash influence on here is only the leftover residue of burning marijuana in the bowl after it has been smoked. So basically, only one \"hit\" of thrash is left on here. That certainly does not make it bad in any way, and is not all that surprising. A lot of thrash metal bands in the 1990's were changing their sound. Kreator had been changing their sound since 1992's album \"Renewal,\" which showcased a much more industrial sound. However, in 1995 on their album \"Cause for Conflict,\" they brought back more of their thrash metal roots and introduced another new influence in their sound: groove metal. The groove influences would continue onto their next album, 1997's \"Outcast,\" and seemingly disappear for the most part on their master piece of a follow up which is their next album, and this album: \"Endorama.\"\n\nWith the starting track of the album, \"Golden Age,\" we get a little taste of the overall direction of the entire album. It is minimalist, with very catchy riffs and some melodic clean singing. The song starts off with a beautiful synth passage, definitely adding an industrial sound to the song. Songs like \"Shadowland\" and \"Willing Spirit\" also contain an ultra-catchy sound, but they are not really at all cheesy. This is catchy as in darkly melodic, and atmospheric. If Kreator started out this way, they would be among the gothic metal elite, with bands such as Type O Negative, Charon, and For My Pain. That being said, Kreator's thrash albums are generally much better than this, so I personally believe it is good that they started as a thrash band, and then released this....even know it has received a lot of backlash from fans. Kreator is able to capture the darkness very well in this album. The chorus on the song \"Chosen Few\" is kind of dull and odd, but it still sounds decent with Mille's great clean singing. This song beautifully merges into the next track, \"Everlasting Flame,\" which is a very good song, with meaningful and emotional lyrics. This song basically narrates someone's life, I think, as it tells the story of someone as they move through life. And, on this album, Mille's clean vocals are imperative. They almost MAKE the album what it is, very dark and melodic metal. The song \"Tyranny\" is definitely a perfect closer, with its melancholic riffs, that are very catchy (I know I have said that many times in this review, but it's very true).\n\nLyrically, I personally think Kreator has always been fairly average. Angry lyrics take up a lot of this band's previous discography, which, in all honesty, is to be expected with thrash metal. On here, the lyrics take a shit. They generally go into misery, darkness, pain, emotion....rather than the band's previous lyrical concepts. Here is a sample of lyrics from the track \"Pandemonium\" :\n\nAnd now you know the answer\nAnd now you see the truth\nSwallow this bitter pill\nAs all religion dies for you\nAnd all the things that happened\nIn all those times long gone\nGave birth to life like lies\nApocalyptic pandemonium\n\nNow, Kreator on this album is still expressing their anti-religious views, obviously. However, that is always to be expected. The lyrical ideas do not drift too far away, but it seems that the lyrics are even darker on this album, which suits the music more. And speaking of \"Pandemonium,\" there is a beautiful solo in it, and as a previous reviewer stated about that melody in the beginning resembling Iron Maiden's \"Fear of the Dark,\" that's pretty much right on. In fact, Kreator went for a very much NWOBHM influenced sound on this album. There are some beautiful keyboard parts on here, too. The song \"Entry\" is a beautiful key interlude. However, it's placement on the album is somewhat unfortunate, as it melds into one of the worst song on the album: \"Soul Eraser.\" This song could have been left off of the album. Whenever Mille chants \"SOUL ERASER,\" I just have to shake my head. The first half of the album definitely contains the finest tracks on here, but ironically, the best track on here is the final: \"Tyranny.\" Full of beautiful gothic metal-like melodies and riffs. It leaves the listener wondering what he/she just experienced, whether he/she likes this offering from Kreator or not....\n\nWell, this listener does. I think it is fantastic. Sure, not quite as good as the band's thrash albums (but it kicks the SHIT out of the three albums before it. Especially \"Cause for Effect\" and \"Renewal.\"). Would I recommend this to thrash metal fans? No. Would I recommend this to fans of a darker, more emotional style of metal, such as melodic death metal, doom metal, and of course, gothic metal? Yes Now, I would also recommend it to industrial metal fans. Solid record, meant for open minded people. It unfortunately gets a lot of shit, because many thrash fans' minds are closed tighter than a virgin's cunt. Don't get me wrong, I am a fan of thrash, but I am very open minded. I do, however, think it is good that they returned to thrash on their follow up album: 2001's \"Violent Revolution,\" because if they did not return to thrash, they would not release the album that is making 2012 such a good year for metal: \"Phantom Antichrist.\" Thank you, Kreator.\n",
        "\nSheer perfection. It can't be used to describe many metal albums. Sure I don't mind handing out higher ratings like cheap candy at a parade - if I like an album, I like an album, but that doesn't mean I think it's perfect. However, Kreator's 5th full-length studio release, \"Coma of Souls\", is pretty much perfect. From the strong lyrics to the songs' structures to the sense of melody and catchiness to...of course...the fucking RIFFS! OH YEAH!\n\nThe band was at the top of their game at this point, and arguably are still pretty damn close to this point currently. Mille Petrozza is killer as he ever was, growling and shouting like a madman but mixing it up with that sense of melody that this band can pull of so well. His guitars skills get mixed with fellow axeman, then newly-recruited Frank Blackfire, most well known for his kickass work with fellow teutonic titans Sodom. He and Petrozza make for a tour-de-force of intricacy, soloing and merciless riffage. Let's just say if you've heard his work on \"Agent Orange\" (of course you have), then you'd know you're in for a treat. Roberto Fioretti rips it upon the bass. He's never been better; his bass lines are equally intricate and just sizzle below the guitars and drumming. Speaking of which, how about Kreator's longtime drummer, good ol' Ventor? He has slowed his usual frenzy into a more technically proficient style, though some of his traditional thrash drumming nicely blares out during some of the more vicious tracks.\n\nThe production is really solid and simple; it's loud but not in your face. No Pro-Tools, none of that shit. It just sounds really good. There's 44 minutes and 45 seconds wholesome, crushing goodness to be found on \"Coma of Souls\". The songs take the heavy but more melodic and mid-paced structure that was started way back on \"Terrible Certainty\" and makes it...you guessed it...perfect. There is some raving heaviness still to be found, though, like on opening track \"When The Sun Burns Red\", a neck-snapper detailing our disintegrating ozone. Beginning with some melodic riffing and acoustic work, one starts to feel mellow, even relaxed...until the 55 second point when Kreator reminds you this is a fucking THRASH album, and the song never lets up in its relentlessness. The title track is oh so slightly slower, still clipping along viciously with its catchy riffs. Then we have the great \"People Of The Lie\", mid-paced little crusher with a catchy chorus and highly simple, but very catchy riffage. \n\nThe album never stops with the quality. We treated to \"World Beyond\" and \"Twisted Urges\", a pair of hyperactive speeders that don't even hit the three minutes mark, but still pack in all that aggression and riffage. I quite like the closer \"Mental Slavery\" for its lengthy, \"hollow\"-sounding solo and the hooky chorus. But there is one song on here that goes past perfection, that goes past being incredible and climbs to the position of, in my opinion, the best Kreator song. That song is \"Terror Zone\". This sucker should have been the album closer. It has everything a perfect thrash song should have. The chorus is stupid simple, but well executed. The lyrics are just glorious. The riffs are a thrilling mix of more melodic moments and hyper thrashing. The two main solos are just perfect, particularly the catchy 2nd (\"God I'm all alone, OH NOOOOOOO!!!\"). Well worth a purchase for this track alone.\n\nOverall, yep, this album is perfect. The band's performance, the quality and consistency of the songs, the riffs, the aggression; all spot-on. If for some sick reason you have only a passing interest in thrash, this album belongs in your collection. Hell, even if you're someone who just appreciates good music, regardless of genre, then you need to hear and own Kreator's \"Coma Of Souls\".\n",
        "\nAnd let us talk about comebacks. This has been a fairly speculated topic in thrash world since the dawn of the last decade when the world has seen a sudden resurgence in thrash metal music. Albums like Destruction's Antichrist, Mekong Delta's Lurking Fear, Sodom's M16, Overkill's Ironbound have made a great topic for discussion with many interesting views from lovers and detractors alike. Say what you will, none of the above mentioned records manage to capture the full glory of the band in the days their fans worship them for, a thing which is achived by Kreator's thirteenth full length record, Phantom Antichrist. Yes gentlemen, this record does really surpass everything Kreator has put out so far (save for maybe Coma Of Souls) and brings forth a vicious ride of neck snapping thrash metal from the masters we have come to love and worship. \n\nAs always Kreator does not loosen the grip technically. Mille Petrozza and Sami are monstrous with the guitars churning out riff after riff with the same energy as they bring forth with every record. The riffs are constructed brilliantly and executed perfectly. The lead work goes even more melodic than what it was with the last record. No; don't in any case bring that scorn upon your face. The melodies are matured and set up an aggressive tone for the songs instead of making them radiofriendly. Jurgen Reil's drum work is amazing as ever and not many drummers in the business today can rival his skills behind the kit. The production is heavy, giving a nice crunchy sound to the rhythm guitar and balancing all the instruments very well.\n\nThis album takes things down the standard Kreator road with all the usual milestones. Phantom Antichrist is a beast of a record with short, straight to the point catchy songs as was the case with the rest of their catalog. The changes we experience in this record are the choruses. The choruses are simplified to the point that many of them might feel just at home on a Blind Guardian record; not a bad thing at all I might add. Another very big positive about this album is high caliber of songwriting. The album encompases this band's years extremely well; right from their bare beginings of Endless Pain, to their glory days of Coma Of Souls and their experimental years of Renewal which makes this album sound fresh and lively instead of living on a recyled glory of some lost era. The sound of this album is that of matured men who know their games perfectly. Kreator manage a perfect variety in the record ensuring that the record does not becoming too boring and sound all over the same. The pace changes in the record are superb, making the record mildly progressive. Yes folks even with the catchy choruses the album manages to be quite a complex affair throughout; and that is the beauty of the record. \n\nThis record with its high consistency, quality of music, sharp and sensible lyrics encompasses thrash metal music in all its glory and is sure to put up a satisfactory smile across the faces of every fan of thrash metal music. This album is recomended for every person listening to heavy metal music and do beleive me it is that one hell of a ride you would never wish would stop.\n",
        "\nI know you all know your history, but this is the third album from Kreator 3.0, the group's thirteenth overall; the first five albums being classics, the next four may as well not exist, and here we are today. Stylistically, Phantom Antichrist continues Kreator's attempts at melodic death metal, the path they started in 2001 with Violent Revolution and haven't wavered from since. \n\nNow, this album sure wants you to think it's a bona-fide, ripping Kreator release. The logo is centered on top, the Kreator-demon mascot present in full force, the red art reminiscent of The Number of the Beast, they even have \"Antichrist\" in the title. But then you turn the album over. Mille has gotten a little lazy with the song titles in this incarnation of Kreator, hasn't he? \"Death to the World\", \"United in Hate\"; and then there's the song titles you could've sworn you saw on that Children of Bodom CD you haven't thrown away for some reason: \"Your Heaven, My Hell\", \"The Few, The Proud, The Broken\". I've been wrong before though, and the titles matter little to the music.\n\nWhich is pretty lame, as it turns out. Starting off with the title track was a good choice for them; starting off in the same manner of Enemy of God, in that, you hear a riff Kreator could've written in '88 to start off with, before ending up in the annoying pop-riff in the chorus, wherein Mille just repeats the song title. The song itself is passable though, everything in it has been done before (and better), but it's performed competently. Sami's soloing is still something of a high point in modern Kreator, wah-infused, melodic bits of shredding, it's clear when he takes a more extended lead that he puts some thought into these. \n\nNow, the rest of the album is basically the title track on repeat, though decaying in quality throughout. Every single song on this album sounds exactly the same. Angry thrash riff - pop metal melody - angry thrash riff - pop part - bridge - outro. It's so predictable it hurts. Hell, you can even predict exactly which stale melodic riff they're going to use after a sub-par to decent thrash bit; there's the pedal point riff that every melodeath band ever has written (you know the one), the higher string jingles, and so on. If it wasn't for the logo and Mille's voice, Phantom Antichrist is just another throwaway flavor-of-the-week album that would've fit right in back in 2006. I suppose it did, they've crossed no new ground since Enemy of God anyway.\n\nI want to bring special attention to the lyrics of this album. They're truly terrible. Depending on the song you focus on, they're boring or cringe inducing. Look at this:\nI don't know who I should belong to\nAll I know is that I don't belong\nSo if you feel the same that I have always felt\nLet's walk this path through flame and flood\n\nLet us be a part of the cure\nNever part of the plague\nWe'll only be remembered for what we create\n\nFrom flood into the fire\nOne thousand voices sing\nWe're in this together\nFor whatever fate may bring\n\n... and so on. What the fuck is that? It's even worse when you hear the insipid way he sings it, just waiting for everyone to sing along because we're all brothers in metal right\u203d Could you imagine this drek on Coma of Souls? Me neither. Throughout the album, the lyrics are all cookie cutter, uninspired drivel. Lastly, Mille tries his hand at clean singing, as in, actual singing, rather than a spoken part. I'll let you imagine how well that goes over.\n\nThe Kreator ship has sunk fellas, now the only thing to do is go see 'em live and hope they play old shit (but we know they won't).\n",
        "\nI have to be honest here and just say that I\u2019ve never really given a shit about Kreator before. I\u2019ve known they were good musicians, but their music has never interested me. It\u2019s always seemed like generic thrash, really. So, you can understand why I went into this album with quite a tentative attitude. I had heard the title track already thanks to it being produced as a single, and was interested in hearing more of the album. At first, I was taken aback by this little sneak peak, and noted the prominent melodies and harmonies between iconic frontman Mille Petrozza and lead guitarist Sami Yli-Sirni\u00f6. This wasn\u2019t the Kreator I had come to write off as a generic thrash act. But even so, I wasn\u2019t prepared for the following eight songs.\n\nAs I have already mentioned, the lead single and title track for this auditory assault did spike my interest, but I wouldn\u2019t say it was anywhere near the strongest track here. Discounting the intro track, the second track here is Death to the World, which is gleefully plagued with melodic riffs and Petrozza\u2019s impressively powerful yelps and barks. It\u2019s all intensive thrash, breaking into some refreshing harmonies, spaced with some incredible soloing from Yli-Sirni\u00f6. \n\nIf I were to describe the general feel of this album, it would be the bastard son of Slayer and Maiden. Unstoppable thrash, but with purpose and an incredible sense of cohesive structuring. The album is very fast, and Ventor is at his most focussed behind the kit. But, the album never descends into that stage of mediocre repetitiveness that plagues long standing thrash acts. The songs are distinguishable and each hold their own.\n\nSomething that seems to be condemned among thrash nowadays, to my dismay, is being catchy. There\u2019s a stark difference between being catchy and being pop music catchy. Kreator have truly mastered the art of writing an insane hook this time around. In fact, they\u2019ve done it a good nine times for this effort. It\u2019s just great balls-to-the-wall, energized and uplifting thrash. I can see this aspect getting a lot of flak from other fans, perhaps calling it cheesy, but I think it\u2019s great. Far too many bands nowadays try to be the one band that breaks the cycle, but Kreator\u2019s really just embraced being that ballsy old school band, and surely that\u2019s what it\u2019s all really about when you\u2019ve hit your 45th year on this world.\n\nThe songs are great, original, and they don\u2019t recycle the same ideas, as their peers are doing in the dawn of their fourth decade of creating music. The band performance is really astounding, particularly the soloing delivered by Sami, who really seems to understand what it means to be a thrash metal guitarist. His phrasing and scale choices are just a delight to listen to. The mastering is almost faultless. I\u2019m afraid I can\u2019t hear the bass as much as I would like. Even so, the sound still isn\u2019t worthy of complaint. \n\nI think I may have to make some changes to my top ten from this year for this record to slot in. The only disappointment I found was that none of the songs broke the six minute mark, rather hanging around the four and a half area, though I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019m only complaining because I love long songs. Still, a fantastic and emotionally charged album. I really regret writing them off for so long now.\n",
        "\nYeah, that\u2019s fucking right! Forget about those vapid retro-thrash bands and make way for the kings of European thrash, mighty Kreator! Uhh, what a fanboy-like line I just wrote there. Sorry, my dear metal brothers and sisters, it\u2019s been a few months since I wrote my last review, but I\u2019m back to charge again (not that anybody missed me). Like many of you, I was highly excited about Kreator\u2019s newest release, the blandly titled Phantom Antichrist. My favorite thrash band, no use in hiding that fact, has been on a hot streak since 2001\u2019s magnificent comeback album Violent Revolution. Both 2005\u2019s Enemy of God and the underrated 2009\u2019s Hordes of Chaos, though not as freakingly catchy as VR, have contributed to maintain the Germans at the top of the game, blowing off their veteran peers at both sides of the pond (with the exception of Overkill\u2026 maybe) as well as the abundant old-school thrash wannabes that just keep popping out of nowhere every damn second. \n\nThe recipe for this success can be narrowed to a single ingredient, nowadays somehow difficult to find in the metal world: consistency. Quality headbang-inducing riffs. Catchy and compelling songwriting. Relevant if not very sophisticated lyrics. Uncompromising attitude. Three, and now four, albums in a row! Hellyeah! These gentlemen just don\u2019t seem to start slowing down. And while this is no thrashterpiece, it\u2019s not that far either. With great artwork (personally I prefer Mr. Benscoter\u2019s standard version to Mr. Meininghaus\u2019 digipak one), and a crisp and punishing production, there aren\u2019t many flaws to find here. My biggest complain would be that there\u2019s nothing new under the red-burning sun, coming a bit predictable. Of Kreator\u2019s 21st Century output, I\u2019d say Violent Revolution is the album sharing more similarities with this one, boasting memorable melodies intertwined with outbursts of sheer thrashiness. Not much of a flaw I\u2019d say, as both albums contain enormous amounts of raw energy and passion, though PA is less catchy, and shorter.\n\nSo, the songs. Well, it\u2019s a tradition for Kreator to have an ass-kicking title-track, and \u201cPhantom Antichrist\u201d is no exception. To be honest, it\u2019s not as amazing as the past three albums titular tunes, but it will break your neck just the same. Ventor\u2019s double bass pummeling is brutal on that one. Other personal favorites, since I don\u2019t find any particular weak track here, are \u201cDeath to the World\u201d, \u201cVictory Will Come\u201d and \u201cFrom Flood into Fire\u201d, which has a somehow unusual epic feel, somehow power-metallish, but it works pretty good, and will surely sound great during a gig. Actually, that veil of glory permeates many of the album\u2019s songs, especially during the choruses, and it\u2019s the only thing I can pinpoint that\u2019s marginally different in this album to the rest of Kreator\u2019s repertoire. Aside from than, many sections of each song here recalls past works of this veterans, their performance being impeccable as usual. Great classy leads, interesting rhythmic assaults, and of course, Mille\u2019s instantly recognizable vocals\u2026 the magic is still here.\n\nWhile not a top-shelf masterpiece the likes of Pleasure to Kill or the flawless Coma of Souls, Phantom Antichrist is another deeply carved K-shaped cut on the band\u2019s demon-mascot forehead, another reason to respect, enjoy and love this legendary band, who have been thrashing around for a good 27 years now. It firmly states that a veteran act can stay relevant, true and outstanding, no matter what. Yeah, it feels good to lay lavishing praise upon your heroes, especially when they really deserve it.\n",
        "\nAfter the awesome \u201dViolent Evolution\u201d, \u201cEnemy of God\u201d \u201dHordes of Chaos\u201d the German thrash legends had yet again expanded upon their already epic thrash sound with a lot more melody than their 80\u2019s output. \n\nBecause of this many have been looking forward to the German masters\u2019 new effort \u201cPhantom Antichrist\u201d and let it be said from the start: the album doesn\u2019t disappoint, but at the same time it\u2019s a bit different from the three aforementioned albums. \n\nLike I mentioned in the start, Kreator added much more melody in their return to their thrash roots in 2001, compared to their 80\u2019s output, but this time it is even more melodic than their music has ever been before which gives the album a more epic feel. The added melody takes a bit away from the aggressiveness and thrashyness, but when the album is fast and aggressive, it contains some of the best riffs in ten years from mastermind, Mille Petrozza, like on the title track, United in Hate and Civilization Collapse. Sami Yli-Sirnio\u2019s performance also needs to be mentioned as this is his best performance with the band so far, providing plenty of great solos and melodies. To my surprise the album even featured acoustic part, like on aforementioned United in Hate. \n\nThe lyrics are typical Kreator. By that I mean lyrics surrounding society, politics and anti-religion. And the voice of Mille Petrozza has improved quite a bit compared to his more bland vocals on Hordes of Chaos. In turn this gives the album a more passionate voice, which then leads to the messages feeling even closer to Mille, and makes the listener being able to relate more. \n\nThen we have the drums, and oh my. Ventor gives one of his best performances in a long time and this record manifests his position among the best thrash drummers out there. His fast beast and fills are amazing, and yeah\u2026 that\u2019s pretty much it. \n\nSo overall Kreator delivers, as always, a great record that this time around, is a bit different with the more even more melodic parts, but without losing the speed and aggression which gave them a huge name in the metal world. So if you like Kreator\u2019s three prior records you\u2019re going to like this, and if you\u2019re a fan of the Gothenburg style death metal, you should check this out, because you might like this.\n",
        "\nThere's little better wed to the sweat-inducing vortex of a preemptive New England summer than a new studio statement from one of your favorite German thrash bands, and Kreator have seen fit to unleash Phantom Antichrist just in time to familiarize a surprisingly stable audience of both new and old for their upcoming tours and festival appearances. Placed on the group's chronological spectrum, I wouldn't say there's much new to this album that one mightn't have heard before in the past 25 years, but credit belongs to Mille Petrozza and his unstoppable armada for maintaining such a huge sense for scale after three decades of exhaustion, and for their ability to produce an album which is intelligent, contemporary and frankly competitive, making most of the youngsters invested in this genre seem pathetic by comparison.\n\nWith the exception of earlier records like Endless Pain and Pleasure to Kill, Phantom Antichrist draws upon a broad range of aesthetics from the band's backlog. You'll experience a lot of the emotion and melody that fueled efforts like Violent Revolution or the ill met Endorama. The surgical, manic, meticulous riffing that thrust Extreme Aggression and Coma of Souls into the spotlight. The political, lyrical unrest which saturated the more industrial-charged works Renewal and Outcast. And, perhaps most dominant, the refined production values which lent such a bright, bold punch to their most recent full-lengths Hordes of Chaos and Enemy of God, both of which were excellent in bringing the band back to the relevance that had been lacking since the early 90s. No one of these traits seems to supercede the others here, all are wrought impressively into a well paced and balanced record that shines in nearly every technical spec imaginable, with but a single caveat: this time around, the music doesn't quite stick with me like it has even on the album's direct predecessors.\n\nThere are some detailed, impeccable thrash hymns woven throughout the album which certainly catch the ear for a few spins, if not much more than that. \"Phantom Antichrist\" itself, and the following \"Death to the World\" were those I felt most drawn too, fiber optic aggressive precision anchored by loaded riffing sequences that reward both speed and variation, built for both moshing and reflection. Mille's vocals are incredibly well mixed to carry his volatile emotions, even when the actual prose seems rather weak or dabbles with the lyrical fixations of ethnic hostility and dystopian collapse that the band have admittedly delved into many times in the past. A few acoustic passages are spread throughout the track list, over which Petrozza manages not to entirely flub up some clean vocals, but I never felt like they added much to the album as a whole, not nearly so effective as, say, \"When the Sun Burns Red\", though clearly they were trying to reclaim that aesthetic on \"United in Hate\".\n\nIn fact, there seems a great deal of familiarity in the songwriting here, not so much that the band are directly aping themselves, but clearly were trying to reproduce the riffing architecture found in older compositions, to mixed results. Hordes of Chaos was indeed a divisive record, with some loving and others despising its direction, yet I felt like it took more chances than what I'm hearing on Phantom Antichrist; almost as if the band wanted to play it mildly safe and incestuous this time out. The melodies and leads are hardly cheap, all are effective and processed with the due competence of Sami and Mille, but they clearly adopt a more accessible tone with a broader appeal towards fans of Swedish melodeath (in this the album recalls Violent Revolution quite a lot). That said, this delirious balance of controlled bursts of brutality and melodic resonance is also a sign of the band's maturity, and hardly something to be scoffed upon.\n\nThose with a particular, prehistoric hesitation towards anything the band has released post-Pleasure to Kill will remain alienated by the sound of this, and likely anything the band ever records again, but as a gateway for newer listeners, I think Phantom Antichrist will turn quite a few heads due to the high standards in engineering and the group's continued competence. At their heart, Kreator are still writing lyrics that will matter to some in this world, and they still place an enormous emphasis on the construction of their guitar progressions, a quality lacking in so many modern thrash acts. They've got little if anything to prove, after such a staunch and interesting career, and this is a scrupulous, dependable record, if not so stirring as many of their past experiences. About on par with Violent Revolution (with better production).\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nMacht. Schnelligkeit. Simplizit\u00e4t. It's easy to make the parallel between composers and engineers when Germany is involved. For years, mechanics all over the world tried and tried to discover Ferdinand Porsche's great secrets of automobile manufacturing. Years later, he revealed them: Power. Speed. Simplicity. So works the German mind, and it's no surprise that Kreator just so happens to be the thrash band that's sitting atop the world. It has been thirty years since Mille Petrozza, Roberto Fioretti and J\u00fcrgen Reil embarked on their journey to put together one of the greatest heavy metal bands on the planet. Few bands have made it this far, and the vast majority of the ones that did ran out of gas a long time ago... but not Kreator. Aside from getting caught in the fray of classic thrash bands venturing off into the bizarre territories of the mid-to-late 90's, these ancient hellhounds have been slowly and steadily plotting their course for world domination in the heart of the Ruhrgebiet ever since they found their footing again with Violent Revolution in 2001. It's been more than a decade since then, and not only has Kreator gained light years on the majority of its Eighties thrash counterparts, but the group has done so without losing so much as an inch along the way.\n\nPhantom Antichrist is Kreator's thirteenth full-length album since the group's timeless debut in 1985, and it's arguably their finest work to date. Sure, it's always going to be the initial five or six albums that garner the most nostalgia and credit for innovation, but Phantom Antichrist is the work of polished heroes -- gods, if you will. Initially, it seemed that Kreator was simply following the basic formula that has been so effective on the past handful of albums. You know the drill: catchy title track, a few shitkickers, a few slow melodies that explode into shitkickers, and a comedown concluding track that simply says \"auf Wiedersehen.\" Now, to say the band has completely changed things around would not only be an insult to Herr Porsche, but it probably wouldn't have worked. Instead, the band decided to just get even better at what they already do best, which is construct meaningful, thought provocative lyrical themes that would give sight to the blind; create choruses that would excite a downtrodden mass of depressed followers; write riffs that would allow those with paralysis to circle pit like there's no tomorrow; and compose solos that would entice even the Virgin Mary herself. Phantom Antichrist does all of this, and in the most memorable of ways.\n\nSo what else is new? Let's start with early tracks such as \"Death to the World\" and \"From Flood into Fire,\" which will have fans chanting \"Mother Earth, what have we done to you / Mother Earth, why have we forsaken you,\" or \"From flood into fire, one thousand voices sing / we're in this together, for whatever fate may bring,\" as they march like fearless vikings to destroy the captors of their souls. And the solos! My Lord, the solos are just perfect. Every note fits perfectly into its own place while Mille and Sami play as if Quorthon and Chuck Schuldiner were fire and brimstone taking their sides. Perhaps no other songs in all of rock music today have more importance and emotion than Phantom Antichrist's next few tracks such as \"The Few, The Proud, The Broken\" or \"Your Heaven, My Hell,\" especially the softly spoken lines in the introduction of the latter of the two, which state \"After all these centuries of preaching godly wrath / Punishment and afterlife -- Pandemonium / Gods that torture, gods that judge from the guilt they make you feel / A monster siege by psychopaths, as he threw the web you weaved / Your heaven, My hell / Your heaven has become my hell / You are the virus of this torched Earth / Your heaven, my hell / Your heaven will always be my hell / Fear has possessed the hearts of MAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAANNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN!!!!!!!!!\"\n\nUltimately, there will be few albums throughout the course of one's lifetime that will always permit you to carry on with a smile, regardless of the sorrows of life's many tragedies. They're as rare as true friends, really, and should be treated as such. That, among other reasons, is why you'll find no comparisons here -- no mentioning of other bands, other great albums, or the glory days when thrash metal wasn't viewed as a thing of the past. Also, there's something to be said about a band of this stature whose members still insist on helping sell their own merchandise, talking to fans, and openly condemning shitty, commercialized and dumbed-down music. In my personal life, I've always failed to come up with an adequate response to the question, \"So why do you like this type of music, anyway?\" Thanks to Phantom Antichrist, I have found my answer: It's fast, it's simple, it's powerful; and it's the reason why I listen to heavy metal. Kreator. \n\nOriginally written for MetalReview.com\n",
        "\nThe masters of thrash riffs return with yet another mighty track to add to their already illustrious catalog. This single shows Kreator taking things in safe waters and using their tried and tested formulas, but executing it a masterful and refreshing way. \n\nThis single is basically what you expect and what you have received from Kreator over the years. It is still all the same; ballsy, catchy riffs that grab you by the throats, face melting leads, insanely catchy choruses. Though many of the fans have grabbed the underlying Kreator formula and feel that they need something more adventurous and new, this single still manages to be enjoyable as their tracks in their prime. Kreator always had a gift of writing simple and effective choruses that would remain stuck up in your head since the first listen and here we have no exception. The chorus is anthemic like a Blind Guardian with touches of People Of The Lie and Hidden Dictator all over and you will find yourself humming to it after the first listen itself. Years have not made Mille Petrozza any slouch with the guitar and here he proves just that with his supremely crafted riffs and intricate melodies. Pace changes are once good which keep the song interesting and bring to mind the glory days of Hidden Dictator and Material World Paranoia. \n\nThe single comes with a cover of Iron Maiden The Number Of The Beast, a cover that completely blows the original out of the water. Though sounding very similar to the original, this one is quite heavier, and for once Petrozza completely outclasses Dickinson in his own game. Where the song sounded like a rock and roll party anthem with Dickinson, Petrozza's screams give it a dark, wicked feel that the original should actually have had. \n\nConcluding Kreator remains one of the very few bands whom you can trust blindly and with this single they prove their status as one of the best in the business.\n",
        "\n\"Pleasure To Kill' is truly a legend in the thrash world, not to mention one of Kreator's most popular. With a flurry of borderline-death metal aggression from beginning to end, you think I would consider it a classic most others define it as. Well, while certainly kickass as all get out, the repetitive nature of this bruiser just gets to be too much at times, not to mention...gulp...A LACK OF MEMORABLE RIFFS! AAAAAHH!!!!\n\nBut first, how do the Kreator boys fare this time around? For all intents and purposes, better. The, again, shared vocals of Ventor and Mille are quality thrash awesomeness, Ventor again going for loud, throaty shouting and Mille with his trademark raspy thrash growls. Ventor's drumming kicks all ass in his path; it sounds damn good in this crystal mix, with a certain technical flair to the teutonic jackhammering. Mille's guitar is still just okay; a step up from his work on \"Endless Pain\" but only just. It's a bit smoother and crunchy, but the guy could still use some work. Fioretti's bass is actually audible here. Even still, it's only okay, keeping that rhythm and heaviness steady and brutal.\n\nThe songs are good, but there are the problems I mentioned before. Admittedly, they sound great. This is a classic for a reason, beautifully bordering on that death metal viciousness in a time when most thrash wasn't quite close to this brutality and heaviness. Even still, the problem is that these songs are so fast and vicious that, unless you dissect them on a microscopic level, they all sound the damn same, not to mention the riffage isn't as catchy or as developed as those on the debut album. If one looks close enough, there is some headbanging to be had. The title track has this neat building melody buried in the chorus, while some hookiness can be found in the bloodthirsty chorus of the great \"Corpse Ripper\". \"Riot of Violence\", one of the album's more mid-paced but still very crushing moments, has more notable catchy riffs including some killer filler moments. The same applies for the mini-epic \"The Pestilence\", which comes packed with kicking time changes, going back and forth between \"quieter\" and hyper-brutal moments. \n\nOverall, if you like to headbang, then look no further. This is good for metalheads who just wanna go fucking crazy and rip the universe a new one. But the highly repetitive songs and a severe shortage of memorable riffage make this one a bit hard to swallow despite the great heaviness. So yeah, it's overrated, but wicked all the same despite its notable flaws.\n",
        "\nThere's no thrash like German thrash. Straight outta Essen comes my personal favorite of the German Thrash Triangle, Kreator, and their completely bloodthirsty debut album, \"Endless Pain\". How fucking cool is that title, huh? While certainly not Kreator's best, \"Endless Pain\" is one of the strongest starters for any thrash band ever, totally obliterating all in its path with a then unheard of rush of hardcore hooks and riffs mixed with grisly, genuinely evil vocals. Are you ready for the pain?\n\nKreator starts out as a trio here, with Roberto Fioretti on bass, \"Ventor\" on drums, and the legendary Mille Petrozza on guitars, both the latter two sharing vocal duties. Ventor's vocals are pretty vicious, but a tad bit cleaner than Mille's, whose vox are the real main attraction here. He sounds really, really pissed and flat out evil; classic raspy German growling. His guitar work is competent though nothing terribly special; even still the guy can rip and shred a riff better than you or me. Ventor's drumming is also simple and workman-like; nothing terribly creative but he has pummel the kit like a jackhammer on crack. Speed magic! And then we have Fioretti's invisible bass, which is so low in the mix I can't properly review it. Moving on.\n\nThere are 10 songs on this album. Ten songs that are are fucking awesome as fuck, and if you don't think they are awesome, then you are weak as fuck, plain and poseur simple. While the record is plagued a bit by a lack of variation and some repetition, they all still manage to kick in one way or another. The opening title track rips with untamable Ventor vocals and one hell of a riff that starts up a bit after the minute mark. Or we have \"Tormentor\", killing all with its clean hyperspeed and the hooky chanting of the title. Beware of \"Bone Breaker\", another catchy mini-thrasher that mixes speedy brutality with some cool melody in the verses. Maybe you could \"TRY...TO RAISE...THE FLAG...OF HAAAATE!!!\" and rip a hole through your neighbor's house with help from Petrozza's throaty death growls and more catchy chainsaw riffage. Watch out for the \"Storm of the Beast\" and its immense chorus and demonic time changes. \n\nOverall, this is pure death-to-poseur, high-thrashing venom right here. Sure there is the lack of variety and a sense of inexperience, but you're not gonna care much when you're being ear-fucked by this many quality riffs and uber-aggressive thrashing. Recommended for you, and highly recommended for your neighbors!\n",
        "\nKreator doesn't really need a lengthy introduction because they've been in existence in the thrash metal community since 1984. Their lineup on this release features Mille Petrozza on guitar/vocals, Frank Blackfire on guitars, Roberto Fioretti on bass, and Ventor on drums. Every musician on this release contributed nothing but good on here. This is the type of thrash metal album you can analyze and listen to in pure amazement. I think that this release was the best one in the whole genre during the year 1990. Metallica was making a change in their style of music after \"...And Justice For All\" so Kreator put forth their unbelievably excellent contribution to the Metal community with this release of theirs.\n\nThe guitars feature a lot of different rhythms composing tremolo picked frenzies, bar chords galore, palm muted open notes, plus leads that were amazingly fast and technical. The music is memorable, every single song on here deserves a whole ton of praise because of it's innovation and creativity. They really made this album with a fresh start in songwriting that is entirely invigorating. Tempos of the songs change rapidly, but that doesn't replace the awesome and amazing capabilities that they were able to amass on this release. About 44 minutes of mind boggling thrash metal to the core. I don't think any of Kreator albums surpass this one.\n\nI enjoyed all of the songs because every one of them feature thrash metal genre perfection. I'd have to say that \"When the Sun Burns Red\", \"Coma of Souls\" and \"People of the Lie\" are the best tracks. But all of them are worth checking out if you don't own this album. The leads were the best performed by Frank, Mille's were a tad sloppy and I think that he's better equipped on rhythm guitar not lead. To me, it sounds like he's a self-taught musician. His vocals are innovative and memorable. No one vocalist can emulate his voice, it's totally original and sticks with you. That's what sets apart Kreator from the rest of the thrash metal bands. His vocals are among the best in this genre.\n\nThe production/mixing was done with precision. Every instrument was mixed in with perfection. No instrument was left out. The guitars were filled with plenty of distortion, the bass was audible to the core, vocals didn't drown out the music, and the drums were well heard. The lyrical content features them talking about death, religion, politics and war. There were no Satanic or mindlessness in the words they all had to deal with real life issues. So on that front it was good. It would've been great if Frank Blackfire was still with the band though because he sure could shred on the guitar. Their replacement doesn't come close to his talent, but he's out of the band and has been out for years now.\n\nKreator put forth something astounding here. Not to say that they aren't a good thrash metal band anymore, but the rhythms in the music are their best ever created. This is not only my point of view, I'm looking at other people's opinions on this release and they came up with the same answer: perfection. Their previous releases to this one don't even come close to achieving more success in the songwriting capabilities of the band. They must've really wanted to come out with something totally amazing and \"Coma of Souls\" is what they came up with. If you're a fan of thrash metal and you don't own this album, YouTube the songs that I mentioned so that you can hear what they sound like. Buy it now if you haven't already!\n",
        "\nAfter a ten-year \u201ccoma of sorts\u201d, mighty Kreator finally returned to their thrash metal roots with their tenth long-play, Violent Revolution, which along Destruction\u2019s The Antichrist, both from 2001, probably spearheaded the resurgence of thrash in the 21st Century. In the following years, not only the loved/hated retro-thrash movement would arise, but also many of the most important thrash metal bands of the 80\u2019s (still waiting for Vio-lence and Dark F. Angel) would release many \u201ccome-back\u201d albums to several degrees of success and quality. In the case of this German thrash pioneers, success and quality are both achieved here greatly.\n\nSomething that always bugs me with this album is how many of its detractors complain that this is too melodic for Kreator. It seems to me they forget that the Teutonic thrashers have incorporated NWOBHM-inspired melody into their brand of violent thrash almost since their inception, examples being the creepy intro to Pleasure to Kill, or even before that on the song \u201cTake Their Lives\u201d, from the Flag of Hate EP, which boasts highly memorable melodic riffs. And obviously, their greatest album ever, Coma of Souls, displays a great deal of terrific melodies, most evident on the immortal \u201cTerror Zone\u201d intro and outro. So, yes, Violent Revolution is highly melodic thrash, but that\u2019s only a logic evolution from Coma of Souls, the way it could have been had Kreator not ventured into experimentation for a whole decade.\n\nProduction values are great on this record, not as meaty as on Kreator\u2019s subsequent releases, but perfectly suitable for its contents. Add a magnificent performance by the band and we\u2019ve got a winner of an album. All instruments are clearly heard, including Speesy\u2019s pounding bass, which can be greatly enjoyed during the intro of \u201cServant in Heaven/King in Hell\u201d. Ventor\u2019s solid skin-bashing continues to be the backbone of the band. He doesn\u2019t play extremely complex stuff, but he doesn\u2019t needs to either. His fills are well placed and varied; his double bass fast and steady enough. Mille\u2019s voice is indeed a highlight, and the years seem to have made not much impact on the frontman\u2019s vocal capabilities (and that can be applied to the present time as well). The guitars are the other highlight, loud and clear, as it should be, since Sami Yli-Srin\u00f6 greatly contributes to inject new life into this monster of a band. High-quality solos and riffs are found in no short supply.\n\n\u201cReconquering the Throne\u201d opens the album, and it\u2019s a decent composition though not one of the best songs here. It has decent riffs and a groovy, head-bangeable chorus that works marvelously live, but if you ask me I would have placed it deeper into the album. I would have opened with the killer combo of \u201cThe Patriarch/Violent Revolution\u201d instead. The former is a \u201cThe Hellion\u201d-like melodic instrumental guitar intro that heralds the coming of the best song of the whole album, the title-track itself. That\u2019s how the album should have started, for this track is one of the greatest and catchiest thrash metal anthems of the new millennium. Highly memorable melodies intertwine with solid riffage and mid-paced rhythms, as Mille Petrozza sings some of the catchiest lines ever penned by him:\n\n\u201cSociety failed to tolerate me\nAnd I have failed to tolerate society\nStill I can\u2019t find what you adore\nInside I hear the echoes of an inner war\nNothing can take the horror from me\nYour sick world the loss of all morality\nMy hate has grown as strong as my confusion\nMy only hope my only solution\nis a Violent Revolution!\u201d\n\nI watched the band perform this song live during their \u201cEnemy of God\u201d tour and it fucking owned as well. And it completely summarizes what we\u2019ll find on the rest of the album. Not too fast, not too violent actually, yet highly memorable and effective mid-paced, socially conscious and outspoken melodic thrash that\u2019s more accessible than most of the band\u2019s earlier material. In fact, this was my first Kreator experience, but time hasn\u2019t changed my fondness for it, despite greatly enjoying their more challenging albums. Violent Revolution also has a slight melancholic feel like its predecessor, the failed Endorama, in its melodies and solos, most of which are top-notch. There\u2019s a balance between aggression and passion that translates into ass-kicking songs. \n\nUnlike on their following album, Enemy of God, I don\u2019t find any filler or weak songs to be found here. Some are better than others though, and my personal favorites, apart from the outstanding title-track, are \u201cAll of the Same Blood (Unity)\u201d, another anti-fascist song, displaying interesting changes in pace. The anti-religious \u201cSecond Awakening\u201d is also worth mentioning; it starts with a tribal-like rhythmic pattern and is head-bangeable as hell. It\u2019s followed by \u201cGhetto War\u201d, which has a nice groove to it and amazing melodies. Next we have the seven and a half minute opus \u201cReplicas of Life\u201d which almost reaches the same level of catchiness of \u201cViolent Revolution\u201d. Mille shows his versatility here, both on vocals and on guitar. The album closer, \u201cSystem Decay\u201d, while not as good as the already named, boasts very powerful riffing and it\u2019s a close to perfect way of ending this redeeming piece of modern thrash.\n\nLike many of my metal brothers and sisters out there, I was really glad that Kreator carried on in this direction. That said, of the three post-Endorama albums, this is, in my humble opinion, the best by far. Enemy of God would be a mixed bag for me, with some amazing tracks and some of the band\u2019s most uninspiring material, musically and lyrically. And Hordes of Chaos, while also very solid and closer to their more aggressive 80\u2019s sound, is not as memorable, both live and in studio form. I highly recommend Violent Revolution for newcomers to enter Kreator\u2019s world, and also for metal fans seeking a more accessible thrash record. Hardened thrash fans wouldn\u2019t have a problem with this either, as it has all the requirements of the genre and I bet they\u2019ll find themselves head-banging along the sweet thrashing tunes like I do.\n",
        "\nIn the eyes of some die-hard fans, the band's 8th album, 'Outcast', caused Kreator to become outcasts. The legendary, violent thrash metallers had experimented earlier with their 1992 album 'Renewal', the album that many old fans banished to the deepest abyss. However, with 'Outcast' the band wanted to experiment again, and unquestionably brave they were.\n\n'Renewal's successful, in my ears at least, thrash metal flirting with industrial elements happened again here, although in significantly different soundscapes. 'Outcast' is Kreator stripped to the bone, with atmosphere of nowadays' oppression and agitation. Metal this is, but thrash metal? No, except for a pinch maybe. It's Kreator style dark metal, I presume. I think that 'Coma of Souls' (1990) song 'People of the Lie' was a step towards to this kind of material. Anyways, let's dive deeper into 'Outcast'. Because the cover is a bad one, and not telling all about the album!\n\n'Leave This World behind' immediately introduces the melody, and familiar pedantic guitar riffage and rhythm work make this one a roller. And what, no guitar solo?! No, they're for rock stars anyway. Mille Petrozza sounds, well, Mille, in all his ugliness (his raspy throat screams and trademark end of sentence stertor are all here). 'Phobia' is the album's 'People of the Lie', fast rolling headbanger. It is already evident, that Kreator sound bare here. The sound is heavy, no doubt about it. The bass is fantastically huge in the mix, bringing it to the front with guitars. Actually every instrument and vocals are consistent in volume, but because of the job well done, it doesn't sound clogged at all. Rather, the method gives required potency for the sound. On with the album again now...\n\n'Forever' is one of the slowest Kreator songs ever. The experimenting with sound effects (not keyboards) is the key word here, they are brought in to give atmosphere and fluctuation. 'Black Sun' \"raises\" on speed level gambling; the song is even slower than the previous one! This goes almost into doom territories, let me tell you. Mille does some clean vocals, and pretty effective they are. Now you can feel other emotions than familiar violence and destructiveness from him. Whoa, the album's first guitar solo happens now! Over a slide guitar... Well, the band were experimenting, as mentioned earlier. 'Nonconformist' is more punky bullet train, at least the song feels fast among the slow songs. You can forget about guitar solos again. 'Enemy Unseen' contains very militaristic beats, but is a very uneventful and probably the simplest ever song from the band. The title song harks back to 'Renewal's atmosphere, being a fantastic piece with oppressive feel yet the chorus is totally anthemic. 'Stronger than Hate' is the most thrashing song on offer. Then it is time for songs that fall into the category of uneventful songs. 'Against the Rest' is one of the rockiest songs from Kreator, kind of predicting the future: 1999 and 'Endorama' album. 'A Better Tomorrow' saves the album from a big fall into mediocrity, but it's clear that 13 songs are a few songs too many with the amount of substance the band built them from. Maybe the melodiousness is the reason why there's not much solos. Even though the lyrics are mostly very negative and about real life, there's a few glimpses of light in them. Mille surely writes good words; he must know what he is saying. Also some of Mille's vocals are effected, but work nicely. The performances do not lack of nuances, as one might gues when looking at the line-up: \"Ventor\" behind the drumkit, Tommy Vetterli of Coroner fame on other guitar and Christian Giesler on bass.\n\nI take this album as Kreator's so called \"The Black Album\" (in fact it is Metallica's self-titled one from 1992, as you might have guessed). In reality 'Outcast' is much, much deeper album. Some ditch it for not being thrash metal, but if you like Kreator and understand the band's soul, you might like this one too. Eleven years ago I would have given this quite a much lower score, but I've started to enjoy about this for a big part. However, I still find the album lacking in songwriting.\n\n(Originally written for ArchaicMetallurgy.com in 2008)\n",
        "\n\u201c\u2026in the name of Satan spread all your fear\u2026\u201d\n\nPleasure to Kill is a favorite of many, me included, but it\u2019s possible without the pretense of this album\u2019s gift of stringent structuring and adept songwriting, PTK as a debut may have come off as an infantile, pointless frenzy (some say it is regardless, but hey...) of sonic machinery. With Endless Pain, Kreator built a full-on thrash foundation that they could go a few places with: pull it back a few notches for the lovely radio-friendly market or haul off and belt everyone with an effort even more bulldozing. Unlike Sodom and Destruction, there was no initial ep for which to test the waters, so Endless Pain became their trial by fire. Of course PTK is an intense, speed-concentrated whirl of serrated steel that may be too chaotic for some listeners, and rightfully so these people gravitate more toward this lp or the eventual slabs that would follow said sophomore effort. \n\nWhich band of the unholy trinity of kraut thrash is better is a royal toss-up. At first glance with debut eps/lps, Sodom is the most unhinged and barbaric. Destruction manage to inject their brand of bedlam with a rough intricacy that would improve over time. Kreator, the last of the trio to groove vinyl, is thrash most fearsome, yet has a penchant for solid structures and possesses an ingredient hardly any other metal band can raise a hand to - not only do Kreator have two members spraining lungs equally, but the pair of guttural voices are easily distinguishable from one another. And hell, one's the drummer. \n\n\u201c\u2026the voices of hell sound so nice\u2026\u201d\n\nThe pitchfork vocal attack is indeed a factor that sheds a more adoring light on the three-piece as Mille\u2019s voice is a tattered wind of raw shrieks that curse \u201cTormentor\u201d, \u201cFlag of Hate\u201d, and \u201cTotal Death\u201d, meanwhile Ventor\u2019s thicker, excavated-from-the-gullet broadcast crushes \u201cSon of Evil\u201d, \u201cCry War\u201d and the title cut, the latter of which, with its brashly forceful chorus, launches the lp like a viscous, quickly-picked seminar on German thrash. Ventor laughs diabolically in the faces of astonished onlookers who haven't a clue what they've gotten themselves into. \u201cTotal Death\u201d rings in with a similar velocity, then is accosted by the variety of quasi-trudging riffage, meanwhile a victorious chorus (that, yes, does resemble the chorus of Exodus' \u201cStrike of the Beast\u201d, but let's face the fact that it isn\u2019t quite the beacon of far-flung songwriting where no one else would\u2019ve come up with it) finds the highlight reel. Mild double bass tousles \u201cStorm of the Beast\u201d out of hibernation, a piece of fleshy thrash that's blotched red and white from rashes of speed and tempos of a slower, more protracted nature. \u201cTormenter\u201d takes those tamer blotches and infects them with the rapid pace many of these tracks succumb to. Then it just so happens that \u201cSon of Evil\u201d summons back what some of those unhurried strides churn up, then surges onward on the tide the lp's generous momentum has provided. \n\n\u201cFlag of Hate\u201d waves side two into motion, another rough n\u2019 tumble track that will eventually pale to its brutal, thick-wristed revamp on the not-yet-released Flag of Hate ep. \u201cCry War\u201d interchanges a methodically lethargic verve with one of the most simple, yet polevaulting main riffs on the disk that jaunts directly into the chorus. Vocally scalded by Mille is \u201cBonebreaker\u201d, one of the lp's many tunes slouchless in the areas of riffage and propulsion, and \u201cLiving in Fear\u201d, with its dramatic establishing riffs, bestial cry for war and main rhythm that spends time on the savagely epic stage, keeps the album's fervor hot with flame. \n\nWith a name that could have easily doubled as Creator both audibly and definitively, Kreator handed us a chief thrash affair on a blistered palm, an affair that\u2019s noticeably unlike most of the thrash talent that roamed not only the area, but the galaxy as well. Next year\u2019s Flag of Hate ep would show us where they were headed. Ventor hasn't stopped laughing.\n",
        "\nA swirling guitar riff churns over a frantic cymbal lead in before the whole band comes crashing in and bursts into a charging thrash assault. Mille\u2019s trademark vocals come in with the almost tangible hostility they haven\u2019t carried since the band\u2019s golden years. The murderous pace continues through the first two verses before slowing down for a slower bridge and solo. It\u2019s not until the end of the song that the band pulls out some of their new tricks, with a rather epic melodic outro. \n\nThe title track of Kreator\u2019s 11th full-length, Enemy of God, is a brutal statement of intent, an affirmation that Kreator have truly returned to the business of kicking ass. It is what the previous album's opener Reconquering the Throne was meant to be \u2013 an opener that from the first note will remind the faithful exactly how Kreator earned their spot in the unholy trinity of Teutonic thrash. At the same time, it is proof positive that the addition of melody to their sound in no way hinders their ability to incite moshpit mayhem. \n\n2001\u2019s Violent Revolution was something of a return to the fold after the band\u2019s 90s experimentation reached its conclusion with Endorama, a surprisingly good rock album forever doomed to the shitlists of metalheads worldwide for having the Kreator logo on the cover. Yet while Violent Revolution marked a return to thrash, it also brought in a heavy emphasis on guitar melodies. All well and good, but the implementation was poor and the album, although it contained many good ideas, turned out a hodgepodge of bland melodies and rather flaccid thrash riffs.\n\nEnemy of God is having none of that. Although the majority of the material here lacks the raw ferocity of the opener, this is full-out thrash. Melodies are certainly present, but they are fully subordinate to the thrash riffing. Songs like Dystopia and Impossible Brutality are based around fairly groovy, midtempo riffs, while others like the aforementioned title track and the blistering World Anarchy demonstrate utter contempt for the mere concept of \u201crestraint,\u201d but everything on here is built to get heads banging and fists flying. Kreator are at their best, though, when they give some space to the less thrashy sections, such as the bleak interlude in World Anarchy, the melodic outro to Enemy of God, or the less aggressive Voices of the Dead. \nNot all is perfect. The main riff of One Evil Comes \u2013 A Million Follow flirts with metalcore a bit too much for my liking, and the would-be epic closer The Ancient Plague is something of a dud, with a verse riff that fails to maintain the momentum required for the proper payoff. Deeper in the tracklist songs like Under A Total Blackened Sky and Dying Race Apocalypse, while good songs, don\u2019t hit quite as hard as earlier cuts. Yet these are minor complaints. This is an incredibly consistent set of songs that all have their own character, and that is pretty rare. It\u2019s hard to pick a favorite, between the headlong death charge of the opener, the epic When Death Takes Its Dominion, and the furious rush of Suicide Terrorist.\n\nThis is a very modern sounding album. The guitars are thick and crunchy, the bass inaudible, and the drums full and booming. The sound lacks character, with the kick drums thumping away like on every other modern metal album and the whole affair sounding perhaps a little sterile, but what the production sacrifices in identity it more than makes up for in its ability to capture the violence that is Kreator with precision and clarity. The band has certainly come a long way since Endless Pain. Yet Mille still sounds pissed off as ever. His performance here might lack the raw intensity of some of the band\u2019s classic works, and in my opinion he outdid it on the next album, Hordes of Chaos, but he still delivers here, his trademark snarl dripping with menace. This is an album any fan of Kreator or thrash in general should own. It\u2019s the perfect marriage of old school thrash sensibilities with modern metal stylings.\n",
        "\nKreator has returned with yet another classic album, Enemy of God. Following an extended period of gothic and industrial influences, Violent Revolution brought Kreator back into the realm of thrash, leaving Enemy of God to carry forward its legacy. Indisputably, it accomplishes exactly that...\n\nIn many cases, Enemy of God surpasses the standard set by Violent Revolution, raising the bar to new, impressive heights. The atmosphere established throughout the album, especially during songs like Dying Race Apocalypse, Voices of the Dead and The Ancient Plague, is incredible. It appears as though the album describes the downfall of mankind and humanity, creating a very resigned and accepting mood. No doubt a trait picked up during their \u2018gothic\u2019 years, however no sadness is conveyed; the fast-paced thrash swiftly eliminates anything depressing about the album, unlike earlier songs like \u2018Non-Conformist\u2019 and \u2018Endorama\u2019. Enemy of God comes across as an apocalyptic, yet aggressive atmospheric masterpiece.\n\nMillie Petrozza retains his fury from the bands infantile days, determinedly pissed off with the world, society and religion. His vocal range varies greatly from strained vocals in the latter half of the title track, to the in-your-face barks (I want to kill you!) in Murder Fantasies, to a very eerie spoken voice in The Ancient Plague. Jurgen Reil, a.k.a. Ventor consistently impresses with his resonating utilization of double kick, and expansive fills (e.g. Voices of the Dead, When Death Takes It\u2019s Dominion, and Impossible Brutality). Additionally the catchy riffs and memorable solos, frequently appear throughout the record, not to mention the almost sing-along choruses, firmly set Enemy of God far above its predecessor and any competition from Teutonic thrash giants Sodom or Destruction. The crystal clear production allows for a savoury audio experience, with every note and beat a strong, defining feature. Indeed, Kreator\u2019s sound takes on a more mature approach than in Violent Revolution, and, lyrically, they have progressed past senseless violence to a more meaningful assessment of society\u2019s shortcomings.\n\nEnemy of God definitely has the calibre to stand the test of time. Kreator have outdone themselves in every aspect, including song-writing. Voices of the Dead, The Ancient Plague, Enemy of God and World Anarchy are perhaps the best songs on the album and are sure classics, containing every desirable element of a thrash metal epic. Having said this, there is no song on this beautiful record that is not worth listening to. Personally I believe this to be Kreator\u2019s greatest accomplishment; a renewal to their original ferocity, anger and intensity, but combined with a more elegant and melodic approach. \n\nKreator proves in Enemy of God that older-age does not dampen the fire of hate, nor does it tame political, social and religious views. If this album is anything to go by, the future of Kreator is very promising.\n",
        "\nTerror Prevails is quite different from Kreator's prior live offering Live Kreation, because where that was drawn from a number of performances to get the best sounding versions of each song on the track list, this is all recorded from a single set at the Rock Hard Festival in May 2010 at the Gelsenkirchen Amphitheater. What's also unique is that this was not sold in stores independently, but included as a digi pak with Rock Hard's December 2010 issue. Terror Prevails is only half of the set, with a second disc being reserved for a future magazine, and thus it does feel mildly incomplete. But what's not in question is the excellent sound quality here and the solid, brief set you'll get, and in fact I much prefer it to Live Kreation when all is said and done.\n\nIn just 40 minutes here, Mille and crew manage to capture an amazing energy which spans a number of their excellent albums. It opens with \"Choir of the Damned/The Pestilence\" and it sounds as fresh as if it had been recorded for one of their recent studio albums! Petrozza does sound a little fainter than his usual bark, but it works really well, and the guitars are absolutely perfect. After this the band breaks into more modern territory with \"Hordes of Chaos\" from their most recent full-length, \"Phobia\" from Outcast, and then the knockout combo of \"Enemy of God\" and \"Impossible Brutality\" from Enemy of God, all of which likewise sound superb and get the crowd going apeshit hogwild insane. I know I would be! The rest of this first offering is made up of another stroll through classic territory, with \"Endless Pain\", \"Pleasure to Kill\" and then \"Terrible Certainty\", all of which honor their original incarnations with pride.\n\nIf only all live albums were this quaint and deserving of your money, we'd be in paradise, but the kicker is you can get it for the price of the damn magazine (which, admittedly, is not that cheap). I mean, outside of Destruction's epic Live Without Sense from 1989, this is the best live German thrash albums I've ever heard, ripping with clean and powerful tones, nice atmosphere and a good sense for the crowd reaction, not to mention the incredibly professional performances of the individual lineup, even if we have to listen to Mille shout 'mosh pit' in his German accent numerous times. I feel a little irate that the whole performance wasn't included together, but it's just a ploy to get you to subscribe or pick up both issues. Capitalist scum! Fortunately, the CD is worth hearing if you can get your hands on it.\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nLong have I debated to myself which of the 'Big Three' German thrash bands, at least in the currently adopted trinity (I would personally replace Sodom with Tankard, but the masses would not seem to agree), is the most deserving of the mythological crown. All of them had faltered to an extent in the 90s, Sodom the least, but if I'm to take into account the overall quality of their studio efforts, from the 80s rise to prominence through the 21st century revival, then the answer can only be: Kreator. Enemy of God, their 11th album, sees not only a band return to the form previously established in the prime of their existence, but instantly supplant any doubts on their sincerity with combat boots to the neck.\n\nThis is, in essence, what a thrash album is all about. Anger. Relevance. Social awareness. And most importantly, a crop of bloody songs that you can remember long after first hearing them, and that you can always turn towards when in dire need of a rush or adrenaline or just good sense. Enemy of God is all these things, and while it might not cross the threshold set by their masterworks Coma of Souls, Terrible Certainty, and Pleasure to Kill many years before, it absolutely dwindles there, hangs out for an ice cream and makes its presence known. But Mille Petrozza and his squad mates have not simply repeated themselves, for this album is basked in a deeper, violent, modern tonality that is mildly less technically inclined than the riffing of Coma of Souls, but produces the same barking holocaust. Sami Yli-Sirni\u00f6 has by this point become fully integrated with the band, and what they produce is dominance of the sort that the last album Violent Revolution, wildly hailed as their 'comeback', could only dream of.\n\nIt always helps, of course, when you put GOOD songs at the beginning of your album, a practice that many bands in numerous metal genres seem to forget, and Kreator has certainly done so here, placing two of the very best up front. The rampant \"Enemy of God\" itself provides nearly 6 minutes of belief smashing intensity, with a chorus that, while predictable, cannot fail. How many true metalheads don't want to shake their spiked fist at the empty sky and decry the divine, howling \"Enemy of God\" when they look upon the fallacy of the flawed creation upon which they stand? Add to this great solos, great lyrics and a mechanistic, punishing breakdown and try to sit still. Then we're treated to the \"Terror Zone\"-like intro and percussion of \"Impossible Brutality\", another instant classic due to the swaggering power of the verse guitars and another easy to guess but perfectly executed chorus.\n\nThat's the best one-two knockout punch since The Antichrist, but Kreator are not content to just shit out two hits and run with them. The rest of the album is just about, if not as good as its opening numbers. Highlights include the surgical smiting of \"Suicide Terrorist\", nihilistic drag strip of \"World Anarchy\" and the desperate melodic rush of \"Murder Fantasies\" and \"One Evil Comes - A Million Follow\", but there is also no denying the force of \"Under a Total Blackened Sky\" or the sorrow-charged glaze of \"The Ancient Plague\". In fact, probably the one track I don't love is \"Dying Race Apocalypse\", which has a heavy dose of melodic death influence similar to some of the tracks on Violent Revolution, but it's still potent enough Kreator and doesn't interrupt the flow of the album (and has a pretty thrifty melody in the bridge).\n\nIt's simply another superb album, and while it initially gave me the impression it would wear off, I still find the time to listen to it with nearly as regular a rotation as the 80s classics (along with Hordes of Chaos, which is even more mind blowing for so late in their career). That these Germans have weathered the lashings of time and change so mercilessly is a wonder, and while they might have stumble through their second decade, Enemy of God is proof of their dominance, never pandering to negligent trends, never insulting the listener's intelligence, and storming with the menace that this genre deserves.\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nSodom was not the only major German thrash act to release a double live disc in 2003, but in Kreator's case, this was something the fans had anticipated for a very long time. In the past, you could only experience their live audio from bootlegs or various cuts scattered about compilations, EPs and VHS tapes, but Live Kreator is the real deal, over 100 minutes of music that spans the band's complete career, from the barbarian roots to their divisive experimentation through the 90s. The first real live album. But similar to One Night in Bangkok, the quality of the selection varies greatly. There are a few cuts here that really just don't belong among their more exciting peers, and the overall effect of the performance definitely suffers some lulls. However, the tracks were recorded from various sets on their 2001-2002 tour, so the overall audio is simply better, and they were able to capture versions that they found the most consistent.\n\nIt doesn't really start off all that well, with \"Violent Revolution\" and then \"Reconquering the Throne\". I realize that this is an aggregate collection from multiple gigs, and the band were touring off this new album at the time, but let's be blunt: people attending a Kreator concert want the good stuff. People buying a live Kreator album, even one of this nature, to play out like an actual performance. Violent Revolution is a good album, a welcome return to what the band do best, but it would have been a better idea to open this with with \"Riot of Violence\", \"When the Sun Burns Red\", or some other timeless wonder. The newer material is executed well, but it would have been more effective if consigned to deeper in the playlist.\n\nThat said, the band do actually incorporate a lot of their earlier material: \"Extreme Aggression\", \"People of the Lie\", \"Pleasure to Kill\", \"Terrible Certainty\", \"Riot of Violence\", \"Coma of Souls\", \"Terror Zone\", \"Betrayer\", \"Under the Guillotine\", \"Awakening the Gods\", \"Flag of Hate\" and \"Tormentor\" all show up here, and almost without exception, they represent the more virile and energetic portion of the set, with the crowds getting wild in response. \"Flag of Hate\" and \"Riot of Violence\" are particularly awesome. But they also tour their later discography, beginning with \"Renewal\" from the album of the same title, which is fun enough here. \"Lost\" from Cause for Conflict also generates a positive response, and Outcast is given good representation through \"Phobia\", \"Leave This World Behind\", and the subdued \"Black Sunrise\", which offers the listener and the original audience some breathing room.\n\nOnly \"Golden Age\" has been included from Endorama, and that's probably for the best, with two more Violent Revolution tracks rounding out the affair: \"Servant in Heaven - King in Hell\" and \"All of the Same Blood\". The audio throughout is incredibly clear, with punchy guitars and Mille sounding like a pro regardless if he's barking or singing, and it serves to equalize the vast mix of dynamics in the material. There is certainly the feel of something 'missing' here, which is always to be expected when you're wishing certain tracks to be included, and I would have definitely appreciated more Terrible Certainty music and \"When the Sun Burns Red\", but as the closing of a chapter (far brighter things were to come with Enemy of God and Hordes of Chaos), it does its duty. I would also point out that the limited edition of this release is the better format, it includes the Revisioned Glory DVD, which I was foolish enough to miss out on. So if you can find that, and it's affordable, there would be more impetus to actually make the purchase. As it stands, Live Kreation is a truly solid live album, but nothing exceedingly special.\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nIt's very amusing to imagine a Frankenstein scenario after the letdown of 1999's Endorama, with a village of crazed and belligerent thrash folk pursuing Mille Petrozza and his gang into a castle on the Bavarian landscape, pitchforks and torches calling out the death of the once-mighty Kreator. However, they were soon to get to work, set up the lightning attractors and kick some life into the patchwork corpse of ideas that brought them to prominence in the first place. Amusingly, there is still a lot of Endorama within Violent Revolution, a number of the songs incorporating the same pensive melodies, but they're cast in a more explosive thrash context that summoned some of that 1989-1990 technical riffing bliss and was also bound to appeal to the melodic death starved audience that was quite wide at the turn of the century.\n\nWith Tommy Vetterli (Coroner) departing the team, Sami Yli-Sirni\u00f6 of the Finnish weirdos Waltari was brought in as replacement, and he's remained ever since (with both bands). I had always wanted to hear his guitars in a more straightforward metal context, and it turns out he's more than fluent, an excellent companion to Mille's composition. \"Reconquering the Throne\" spends a few minutes in a Coma of Souls but flexes its mellowed, melodic muscle during the bridge. I can't say it's the best opener, or the best song here, but at the very least it's a vortex of energetic and depressive riffing that smelled of better, younger days. \"The Patriarch\" is a dual guitar instrumental, and a catchy lead-in to the title track, which features stronger guitars that swerve about a solid emotional course and pure mid-paced thrashing verse. The chorus is predictable but it still makes you bang your head, and \"All of the Same Blood\" returns to the clinical, cynical speed of Coma of Souls, fairly close in composition to a \"Hidden Dictator\" or \"Material World Paranoia\".\n\nA few of the tracks strike out on a more original course, like the warlike march of \"Servant in Heaven - King in Hell\" with its grueling verses and eruptions of glorious melody, or the morose and twisting river of \"Bitter Sweet Revenge\". However, almost without exception, I found all the album's best moments to come straight in the center of the disc. \"Second Awakening\" and \"Ghetto War\" are particularly well written, meshing together the classic Kreator staples of bombast and aggression with the emotional force that was so prevalent on their 1990 master work. Deeper in, \"Mind on Fire\" also deserves credit, its opening volley my favorite individual riff here, both swagger and mystique colliding with the brief insertions of leads. \"Replicas of Life\" serves as the \"When the Surn Burns Red\" of this album, clean guitars ceding into a slugfest of dire and melodic riffs, a decent if familiar concoction.\n\nViolent Revolution was produced by Andy Sneap (ex-Sabbat), a man that knows a thing or two about speed and thrash metal, despite his less desirable credits, and it's incredibly professional sounding, with the same workmanlike clarity of their 1989-90 material, if not more vibrant. Unlike the last two albums, which were far simpler in structure, Mille Petrozza proves that he still has a fire lit under him, and the guitars are in particular the star of this show, both in tone and delivery, which has always been the modus operandi of this band. I actually enjoyed this album quite a lot when it was released, but in retrospect I believe this was largely due to the fact that the band had returned to the style I most wanted to hear them play. I still feel like Violent Revolution has 3-4 excellent tracks, but there are a number here that have no lasting impact whatsoever, and I cannot number it among their better career works. But it's a no-brainer that this is several steps above Endorama in quality.\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nThough Kreator hadn't been an in-house band with Noise Records for several years, they nonetheless found the inspiration to release yet another compilation CD to pad their quickly emptying pockets. It's a fucking shame, truly, both that something like this exists, and that Noise Records doesn't exist, because that was by far the best individual metal label of the 80s, putting out entire swaths of classic material by some of my favorite bands. Alas, it turns out their business practices were not on par with their ear or talent. To be honest, I was quite hopeful when I first saw this, because it has a great cover art and the fact that it was 1985-1992 gave me hope that it would consist largely of demos, outtakes and rare tracks.\n\nBut these are few and far between on Past Life Trauma, and 14/18 tracks are a mere recycling of material from the band's first six albums. There are obvious choices made, like \"When the Sun Burns Red\", \"Pleasure to Kill\", \"Extreme Aggressions\", \"Terrible Certainty\", \"Tormentor\" and so forth, and they're fairly evenly distributed, but let's get serious: anyone who matters will already have purchased these in their original incarnations, whether that be by cassette, LP or CD, and it's entirely redundant to recommend this to any newcomer. Just head straight for the oldies, kids, there is NOTHING to see here. The 'rare' tracks included are nothing more than some live material from Renewal, which sounds mediocre, a demo of the track \"Trauma\" which was on the Renewal demo, but obviously deemed too purely thrash for that album, and \"After the Attack\", a B-side from the Behind the Mirror single off the Terrible Certainty album. This last addition is perhaps the one thing anyone would be interested in, but despite some decent, feral riffing and a mean breakdown, it's easy to tell why this wasn't deemed good enough for the album.\n\nTranslation: Do not waste a dime on this.\n\nPast Life Trauma comes hard on the heels of two other compilations, both of which are likewise weak, but offer marginally more of value than this one. Considering that Noise already hammered us with Scenarios of Violence a few years prior, and the 90s sampler Voices of Transgression one year prior, this feels infinitely more like someone applying a rod & reel to your wallet and less about appreciating one of the greatest German bands out there. Noise might have done right by us, perhaps by issuing a cool box set of the old albums, with enhanced artwork, rare/live tracks and demos added to each, and other perks. That would have grabbed the interest of both new and old fans alike. But instead, this is yet another waste of space, with 1-2 rare tracks that might briefly pique the hardcore devotees interest for a matter of minutes before they are consigned to the potty of perdition.\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nKreator's previous collection, Scenarios of Violence, had been a fairly week offering released through Noise Records, involving some remixed and live material and a few unreleased studio cuts, but Voices of Transgression, through G.U.N. Records, is at best an asinine cash grab that should be melted into slag. I mean, who in their right mind would come up with the idea to try and capitalize on some of a band's least successful material? This was actually released prior to Endorama, and yet almost the entire track-list consists of material from that album and the previous three. Compilations can occasionally be worth their time when they assemble demos, rare recordings, and even covers and live material, but this is nothing more than a sampler from recent studio albums with a couple bonus carrots at the end of the stick. A half-rotten carrot.\n\nIf you despised the 90s Kreator, from Renewal through Endorama, then obviously you won't even blink an eye as you skip this recording, but for those who accepted the band's migration through various climates, there are a couple of bones being thrown. The first is a techno metal cover of the Sisters of Mercy's \"Lucretia\" with Mille serving both his trademark barks and a deeper clean not unlike Tiamat's Johan Edlund. It's not bad at all, if you're into this sort of thing, and further affirms the direction the band had taken with Endorama. \"As We Watch the West\" is another melodic piece which feels like it could have just been placed on that album, but despite the glistening atmosphere and subdued samples, I thought it was fairly forgettable, possibly best heard by those that like Pink Floyd influenced Gothic/doom metal bands like Tiamat (again) or Lake of Tears. \"Inferno\" is considerably heavier, with Mille's vocals taking control again, and this is perhaps the most valuable of the three, but it's not great. The cover of Raw Power's \"State Oppression\" is not news, it was released as a bonus track on the Cause for Conflict CD.\n\nAside from this, though, and an edit of \"Isolation\", the remainder of the content here is just lifted from the band's past and future albums. \"Chosen Few\", \"Golden Age\" and \"Endorama\" were from the forthcoming Endorama; \"Leave This World Behind\", \"Phobia\", \"Black Sunrise\" and \"Whatever It May Take\" from the previous Outcast, from which the paint had still yet to dry; Renewal is represented only with \"Renewal\" itself; and Cause for Conflict has \"Bomb Threat\", \"Lost\" and \"Hate Inside Your Head\". It's not a heinous selection, and it represents the band's 90s maneuvers well enough, but it's just a waste of coin. The entire effort reeks of something that is needed to fill out a record contract. It'd be far better for Kreator to just have found some way to include the Sisters of Mercy cover, \"Inferno\" and \"As We Watch the West\" with the CD release of Endorama, where they might have offered some value. A '90s retrospective' was not needed, as the 90s were not yet out of session. Avoid this at all costs, or just YouTube the unreleased tracks.\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nSt. Anger. Cold Lake. The Least Successful Human Cannonball. Risk. Diabolus in Musica. Almost all thrash metal artists of note, with extensive careers, have a black mark against them. At least one. So it says a lot for Kreator that their black mark is really not all that bad in the grand scheme of things. Not to say that this is an album worth hearing, but of all the band's 90s experimental fare, it is Endorama which deviates the furthest from the band's incredible evolution of the 80s. It is Endorama which is the 'least' thrash of anything the band would record, and yet there is still a trace of that aggression where it's needed in these compositions. Complicated this album isn't, but essentially Mille Petrozza flossing his emotional muse across the far sharper bite of the past.\n\nEndorama places Kreator in an accessible, Gothic metal context with simple chugging guitar riffs, droves of melodies and overt rock-influenced verse chorus structures. The writing is a lot slower than one would even be accustomed to from Renewal or Outcast, but those albums do certainly hint at what's to be found here, with their minor industrial tweaks that have here been translated into subtle synthesizers. It's definitely an interesting listen, but I feel that of all their efforts, this is the one that might have better fared if branded a Mille Petrozza 'solo' album or some other project. It seems largely a waste of the talents of several of its players, in particular Tommy Vetterli of Coroner who stayed on for this, but also the rhythm section of Reil and Giesler. The mix is clean but subdued, and to tell the truth there are a few chorus elements of note here, but it's an entire different ballgame than the band's legendary beasts Coma of Souls and Terrible Certainty.\n\nFirst, I'd point out the good. \"Golden Age\" is the opener, with a verse structure reminiscent of Megadeth's \"Symphony of Destruction\"; simple chugging well executed below the narrative vocal tone, erupting in a barked, but melodic chorus. Even better is \"Shadowland\" for its sunny but sad melodies, with some grooving outbreaks in the bridge, and a great lead which utilizes Vetterli at his strength, fluid and precise shredding. As much as it pushes the 'Gothic' on this disc to its maximum, I also rather enjoyed \"Passage to Babylon\", which might as well be the product of some other German band like Crematory, Dreadful Shadows or Lacrimosa (in fact, Tilo Wolff guests on this album). \"Soul Eraser\" produces walls of bristling harmonics and is perhaps the most thrashing, aggressive on the album, but I don't exactly love the chorus, and there are a few more pieces like \"Willing Spirit\" that carry the flame of \"Golden Age\" and \"Shadowland\", creating a similar effect of sweeping sunset that is married very well to the cover image. The title track, \"Endorama\" is half-decent, but basically feels like \"Golden Age II\" with a guitar line that is eerily reminiscent of Sisters of Mercy's \"Temple of Love\".\n\nOutside of this, though, there's not a lot of glaring promise on this album. Some of the softer tracks like \"Everlasting Flame\" and the \"Chosen Few\" are all too forgettable, despite their uplifting atmosphere and lilting emotions. \"Future King\" and \"Pandemonium\" each have one good riff, and the latter even packs an Artillery-like punch in the verse guitar, but I just can't stand the vocal breaks, which seem too corny coming from Mille. \"Tyranny\" is just altogether bland, since we'd already heard the same formula executed a few times already, and it feels like something Pyogenesis might have written during their Unpop and beyond phase. Also, in general, I've found that through the years I simply never even feel the urge to visit this album, even its stronger tracks, whereas Renewal really grew on me, and Outcast has 2-3 tracks that I am often compelled to hear, despite their hardcore embellishments. Endorama might have become some lost classic, some anomaly, had its content been superior to this, but it was not and never will be strong enough.\n\nObviously those who could not give two shits about this German mainstay outside of their 80s period will want to stay far and wide of this album, even if they're overcoming their obstinacy to explore the band's evolution. But at least some credit must be given that Kreator, so far from home, are stilling being guided by something of a voice. You could probably share this album with your girlfriend, or your grandmother, and they might find a few of the tracks catchy, despite Petrozza's tendency back towards his barking vitriol. And the metallic components have not been abandoned, merely molded into some cross-genre tinkering. The reaction to Endorama was not one of hell and brimstone being breathed upon the band, but understandably it was not a good one, so the follow-up: Violent Revolution would steer the band back on its thrashing course, though not entirely devoid of this album's melodic charms. I would probably rank this below Cause for Conflict as the band's least impressive full-length, but unlike so many other career missteps, it's not completely deserving of anyone's chagrin.\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nConsidering the German band's swift ascent into the elite of European metal through the mid to late 80s, I'm surprised it took as long as it did for a fan package like Scenarios of Violence to arrive. Perhaps the band had been adamant that such a release not be put forth as an empty accumulation of material lifted as is from the prior full-lengths and EPs, because Mille Petrozza himself was involved in some of what when into this Kreator collection. There are 16 tracks and 67 minutes of music here, and almost every track included has at least been remixed or remastered by Petrozza and Siggi Bemm, while there are also live inclusions, and a few previously released pieces that might spark the fan's interest.\n\nAre they worth hearing? No, not really, and there is a good reason they'd be included here and not on some future full-length. \"Suicide in Swamps\" sounds like a mix of Renewal and Cause for Conflict era-material with groove, mystique and ultimately not a damned thing catchy, and \"Limits of Liberty\" is another hardcore/punk infused track, fun while it lasts for 1:38 but just as forgettable as most of their other indulgences down this path from Cause for Conflict. The live tracks \"Ripping Corpse\" an \"Tormentor\" are quite violent, vibrant and old school, but neither are they enormously valuable. If anything, they pose the question of why Kreator hadn't released a full-length live effort yet, only VHS and a few tracks scattered on EPs and this.\n\nThe remainder of the Scenarios of Violence consist of those cuts remixed by Siggi and Mille, most of which are taken from Renewal: \"Renewal\", \"Brainseed\", \"Europe After the Rain\" and \"Karmic Wheel\", none of which I prefer to the original mixes despite their newfound cleanliness; a few others are culled from Terrible Certainty: \"Toxic Trace\" and \"Terrible Certainty\", and it's more prudent to hear these polished since the production of that album was all that held it back from perfection. There are also some tracks digitally refurbished by Bemm: \"Extreme Aggression\", \"Some Pain Will Last\", \"People of the Lie\", and \"Coma of Souls\", none of which really needed the treatment in my opinion. Otherwise, there is nothing new to be had here, and the alternate US version features other tracks that are likewise previously released.\n\nScenarios of Violence doesn't have much to offer the fan, I'll be honest, and if you're new to the band then you need to just hunt down all their albums up to Coma of Souls and possibly give Renewal a chance. This is not a band one ever needs to 'ease into' through a greatest hits package. That's really all I need say. The unreleased material here would have better been served as bonus tracks on Cause for Conflict, and the remixes could have waited for full LP remasters. So, in the end, even though more thought was put into this collection than similar cash grabs which feature nothing more than pre-released songs, it's still not worth the money you would spend on it.\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nIt's interesting that Cause for Conflict arrived during Kreator's 'experimentation' phase, because really this is a pretty straight forward thrash album with a slight, angry hardcore influence that is felt more in the political lyrics than the actual music. The moody 1992 record Renewal was not exactly well met, but that's more the fault of the listeners (including myself, at first) who couldn't adapt to the changes the band were exploring. So to an extent, Cause for Conflict is a step back into safer territory for the Germans, but it unfortunately does not deliver as well as any of the band's prior output, and it stands as one of their least impressive efforts to date, surpassed only by the stab in the dark that was Endorama.\n\nThere were a few major changes to the roster, with Christian Geisler coming in on bass (he remains with the band to this day) and Joe Cangelosi of the US band Whiplash having briefly taken over for Ventor or the drums, but I've no idea whether this contributed to Mille's decision to venture back into the angrier thrash territory that was only vaguely available on Renewal. \"Prevail\" is a solid start, a dark and grooving thrasher with pit stomping guitar rhythms and moments of excellent where a wa-wa guitar sears above a wardrumming backdrop, but the Slayer-like sudden violent thrash propulsion of the bridge doesn't yield as much energy as I would have liked, and the riffs are in general not memorable. Some of the songs like \"Catholic Despot\", \"Crisis of Disorder\" and \"Hate Inside Your Head\" sound like a mix of Terrible Certainty semi-technicality with the dour industrial hardcore of the band's next album, Outcast, but even these are not standouts.\n\nThe few flights of worthwhile frenzy are scattered through the track list, including the raging \"Bomb Threat\", which is an under 2-minute blitz of writhing thrash and Mille barking. Much the same goes for \"Dogmatic\", with some great riffs that come and go in all too short a time (1:26). \"Sculpture of Regret\" and \"Celestial Deliverance\" are both decent, casting a similar shadow to the harder biting tracks of the previous album Renewal. The 12 minute \"Isolation\" has promise, weaving through grim clean guitars and outright thrashing passages, but it's not all metal: there is a pause and then a noise 'hidden track' at the end of the sequence. Bonus \"State Oppression\" is hardcore punk, a cover of the cult Italian band Raw Power, and there's not a lot to it aside from its very predictable notation and chorus.\n\nClearly, Cause for Conflict had the tools to be a better album than this, but for some reason most of the thrash riffs fall flat of what the band were able to accomplish with legendary efforts like Pleasure to Kill, Terrible Certainty and Coma of Souls. I've seen mention that this is one of the band's 'industrial' albums, but that's not exactly the case. Perhaps this aesthetic is found in the politically motivated riffs, or the bleak tone, but there are few if any moments of electronic music here, whereas Outcast or Renewal would directly flavor the aggression with mechanical intent. This is by no means a bad effort, but having at the time just come to grips with appreciating the deceptive Renewal, I felt once again initially underwhelmed. The difference is that the prior album continues to grow upon me and impress through the years, whereas this piece is very easily shoved aside in my thoughts to this day. The lyrics aren't bad (except \"Prevail\" which is like a collage of the band's prior titles/lyrics), the cover's cool, and the music is just alright (i.e., far below what I expect from Kreator).\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nPerhaps it was my disappointment that it wasn't Coma of Souls II, but Renewal is an album I disliked for several years. Can I think back and unearth any other reason? Probably not, but everyone has a change of heart over something, and this would be one of mine. Renewal is the first in what many consider Kreator's 'experimental phase', a streak of efforts in the 90s upon which the band tried to reinvent and reassert themselves into the shifting medium of the metal realm, like the rest of their peers. Who could forget the abomination known as Neo-Destruction? Or Tom Angelripper's decision to punk it the fuck up with Sodom until he finally realized he should make a second band for that? Or Metallica becoming Creed?\n\nBy comparison, you have to admit that Mille Petrozza and crew let us off easy. Endorama and Cause for Conflict were certainly lacking, but their other side treks offered something unique. This album doesn't abandon thrash, it drags down into the fundamentals of the band's sound and glazes it with a depressive, sodden majesty ripe with quasi-industrial elements. Gone are the superb, intricate riffing sequences that dominated Coma of Souls, the go-to chorus sequences and the blistering speed. Renewal is a work of dark atmosphere, sociopolitical questions and expansive experimentation. The lineup remained the same, which is difficult to believe since almost everything but the vocals here sounds almost like another band entirely, so that leads me to believe that the entire group were on the same page as far as forging a departure from their earlier works. But at its heart, you can still hear the pulsing energy of the band's parent genre.\n\nThis is evident once you get into the bridge sections of \"Winter Martyrium\", a track that opens with an escalating slew of glorious sewer chords that cede into an almost hardcore charge in the verse. Around 1:30, you can hear the introduction of a brief, traditional Kreator style riff which might have sounded right at home in the Terrible Certainty environment. \"Renewal\" once again assumes a non-traditional intro, dense industrial rock, but it quickly transforms into this Slayer like, unforgettable riff sequence which is one of the heaviest and most effective the band have written to date. The bridge and chorus create a groove that morphs straight back into the song's dominant riff, and it's one of the best tracks on the album. \"Reflection\" diverges further, Mille whispering along some eerie guitars until the Prong-like industrial metal pulse of the verse arrives. \"Brainseed\" in contrast, is a surge of bombastic glory with a meaty and incredible riff that leads into the mosh starved breakdown, all cast in percussive noise elements.\n\nIt gets even more interesting with the doom laden elegy \"Karmic Wheel\". Once again, denser than expected riffing and Mille's clear barks create this intense, oppressive atmosphere, tribal drums and truly depressing lyrics. Another highlight for the reel. \"Realit\u00e4tskontrolle\" is sheer industrial indulgence; \"Zero to None\" a thick, thrashing brigade with excessively crunchy tone and another central riff to die for, with perhaps a spark of the hardcore foreshadowing of their 1997 effort Outcast; and \"Europe After the Rain\" a progressive stormer which cycles creepy, clean guitars and bleak lyrics into a hardcore/thrash blitz beneath the lead, though this is my least favorite track on the album. \"Depression Unrest\" closes the album with ambient rock that evolves into punchy, industrial chugging. My second least favorite here, but not bad.\n\nOnce in a while, it's good to be wrong, and I'm glad I've given this album more of a chance as the years rolled on. In fact, the weaker closing numbers aside, I feel like this belongs among the band's best works. I enjoy it more than any of the later 90s efforts, more than Endless Pain and Violent Revolution, and lyrically it's quite interesting. The better tracks here are able to offer a glimpse into some post-industrial, dystopian world on the edge of a breakdown, titillating enough that you might want to live there, despite the smoggy skies and meager rations of sustenance that the survivors squabble over. Give it a chance; or if you, like myself, were initially dismissive of its curious evolution, give it another.\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nWhile Extreme Aggression felt like a right lane breakdown for the career steamroller that was Kreator in the 80s, it was at least an important transition piece, because without that effort, I'm not sure they would have evoked the flawless masterpiece that is Coma of Souls. This is hands down one of the best German thrash recordings in history, and the career peak for one of the most riff oriented firing squads ever to explore the genre. From front to back, it's loaded to overflowing with creativity, quality, and oddly enough, emotion, borrowing little but from themselves. Honestly, this could just be called Extreme Aggression II: This Time With Flavor, and it would make no difference to me. I am a richer man for having owned this, and it's spot fucking on.\n\nThis was once again released through the CBS/Noise deal here in the States, but sadly it made almost no difference, because human beings are in general ignorant, and by 1990, many had already stopped paying attention to thrash metal altogether (they somehow managed to let Artillery's By Inheritance slip as well), or at least outside of their backlogs of Metallica and Megadeth albums. Grunge hadn't quite hit its full stride yet, but people were certainly creaming their shorts over Janes Addiction and Red Hot Chili Peppers and all manner of new sounds that were starting their push through the airwaves. It sucks, but alas, it is the way of the world, and thrashing masterworks have always been left by the wayside. Fortunately for us, none of this means a shit, and Kreator's fifth full length is just as epic today as it was twenty years past, with its pristine production values and deep roster. There is no 'going to the bench' with this album, because all ten tracks are contracted to kick your ass at all times.\n\nSpeaking of 'epic', the album is inaugurated with perhaps the most fantastic global warming warning in all of thrash metal, \"When the Sun Burns Red\", which opens with a beautiful clean guitar sequence, then lightly glazed with leads that lead to the inevitable explosion before the minute mark. The Germans cast aside the lace, then firmly re-assure us that, yes, this is a Kreator album, and you will be now be face planted into oblivion. Perfect verses lead us by the throat to an amazingly catchy chorus, and it really does not get much better than this in this genre of music. \"Coma of Souls\" picks right up from the ashes of the first track with sheer, escalating riff brilliance, and leads to another vicious conflagration of swirling leads, hostile but melodic notation and Mille Petrozza's unmistakable bark. And then, as if toying with us all, they break into \"People of the Lie\", which features hilarious but great anti-Nazi lyrics that step perfectly alongside the album's ultimate 'thrash' riff (in the verse) which Exodus probably slapped themselves wishing they had come up with for.\n\nAs an example of the album's excellent pacing, they next veer into the hyper, 2 minute piece known as \"World Beyond\", a flash of glorious, popping melodies with Ventor laying into his kit. Then comes the stretch of the immortal \"Terror Zone\", somber melodies collapsing into a march of warlike percussion and more quality guitar riffs than most thrash albums have period. The song is amazing, and it's no wonder the band have incorporated the title into their web address. \"Agents of Brutality\" follows a similar tactic, slowly building from a lurch to a frenzy of hurtling melody that explodes with the fibrous, twisted mutes beneath the chorus. \"Material World Paranoia\" returns to the belligerent drumming that first arrived with \"Terror Zone\", as the guitars paint hostile rainbows across the pre-verse atmosphere, and then unto another ejaculate inducing verse/chorus manifesto with a turbulent momentum.\n\nBy this point in an album, the band might have just attached a few filler pieces, maybe some dumb cover song and be through with it, but in Coma-land, the thrills never cease. We are next assaulted with the surgical opening melodies of \"Twisted Urges\", which rapidly transform into another majestic flight of riffage bordering on death metal. \"Hidden Dictator\" waltzes forth into a swaggering gallop, and even when they're developing up to the chorus, they're STILL inventing unforgettable guitars. \"Mental Slavery\" ends the show with a cyclic, clever notation that almost seems to imply to us 'you've had enough by now, so we'll let you off easy'. Only, it's not really that easy, just another fully kick ass Kreator track with maniacal riffs and anti-establishment lyrics, even though its slightly less energetic in tone than the rest of the disc.\n\nComa of Souls is the end of an era, as Kreator were no exception to the trend of reinvention that enveloped most of the thrashing spectrum come the 90s (the next 4-5 albums vary highly in quality with one another), but what an end it is. The amount of organization that went into the arrangements, the thought put into the (admittedly leftist hippy) lyrics, the clean and sleek finish to the studio mix. Trickling down through the years, I've heard various complaints that the album isn't as brutal as Pleasure to Kill, nor as ambitious as Terrible Certainty. These are both true, but neither has any impact on the quality here. The band had successfully collected and honored all of the steps leading to this, and somewhere along the way, learned how to be phenomenal songsmiths. I would kill for more bands out there writing at this level, taking thrash metal where it belongs, not sulking in derivation or the pathetic, recalcitrant humor manifest through misplaced nostalgia, ironically bludgeoning themselves into a coma of creativity.\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nKreator's Extreme Aggression was not only a pinnacle of the band's upwards elevation in popularity, but a success for Noise Records as a whole, as the album got a distribution deal through a major here in the States (CBS/Epic). The young, evolutionary German band had finally hit the big leagues, and curiously enough, the album even sounds like such a major label debut, cleaning up some of the flaws that marred its predecessor just shy of perfection. Unfortunately, this is also the first Kreator album in which the band took a pretty solid step in reverse. That's not to imply that Extreme Aggression is without its moments, because it is for all intensive purposes a 'good' album, but unlike the floodgates of imagination and extremity that burst open with Pleasure to Kill and Terrible Certainty, these seem to have been welded temporarily shut.\n\nAs mentioned, the production here is a lot more streamlined than Terrible Certainty, recorded in the States with Randy Burns at the helm. While this certainly makes the individual components like guitars and vocals more audible, there's also a rather sterile feel to the effort that was lacking on the earlier records. Even the cover of the album reflects this, with the band trading in their demonic mascot for a pose under a muted, red sun hue. Truly boring. The music itself is not so bad, making for the natural bridge between the band's career heights Terrible Certainty and Coma of Souls, but very few of the songs have that instantly explosive emotional power that would characterize the 1990 follow-up, and riff for riff, it's simply not as interesting, like the band were tip-toeing along in the wake of their newfound success, trying not to misfire.\n\nThey don't, but neither do they truly impress here. \"Extreme Aggressions\" possesses much of the scything, melodic precision first introduced on the previous album, but the transitions don't feel all that exciting together, and this is perhaps the most riff-tastic song on the entire album (the verse is great). \"No Reason to Exit\" and \"Some Pain Will Last\" are two of my other faves, with cold and clinical riffing that cycles through a number of catchy moments; and to a lesser extent, \"Stream of Consciousness\" and \"Fatal Energy\". \"Bringer of Torture\" is also good for a neck breaking, a fast and frenetic number with a great galloping riff and chorus that wouldn't have been out of place on Pleasure to Kill. I've never been much for \"Betrayer\" or \"Love Us or Hate Us\", which seem to ironically be two of the most popular songs on this album, but I wouldn't dub them a waste of space either.\n\nIn the end, I tend to think of Extreme Aggression of a mere warm up for Coma of Souls, an album that still blows my head off from start to finish, and the peak of the band's songwriting, despite the fact that it's so heavily derived from ideas first manifest on this album or Terrible Certainty. It's still Kreator, and it's still better than most thrash metal of its day. But it's very strange to me that the chorus of \"Love Us or Hate Us\" proclaims: 'no honesty, just sterility, a cautious sound they make without creativity'. a passage that best expresses how I have always felt about this album. Whereas the previous album was a tornado of riffs, this is a mere dust devil, forceful enough to whip up the dust, but never enough to tear your roof off.\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nWith the unbridled success of their Pleasure to Kill and Terrible Certainly albums, spreading the name of Kreator far and wide across the seas, it's not unreasonable to expect a certain amount of exploitation, and thus something like this Out of the Dark...Into the Light EP was born. It's pretty run of the mill as far as the typical 80s short form. Throw on a new song to tantalize the fans, a cover, and then some live content, and that's really all we're given here. Sadly, the new song \"Impossible to Cure\" is wholly lackluster, with nothing on any of the Terrible Certainty material aside from its cleaner production. Seriously, if this was scrapped for those sessions, I would not be surprised. Busy though it is, there are really only 1-2 choice riffs, and while Mille's delivery of the predictable chorus is functional, there's just nothing special here like a \"Blind Faith\", \"One of Us\" or \"Storming With Menace\".\n\nThe cover of Raven's \"Lambs to the Slaughter\" (from their 1981 album Rock Until You Drop) is arguably superior than the Kreator original here, if only because it's fun. That said, hearing Mille try and bust out the scream at around :45 is pretty laughable. Also, the song shares that very clean, unassuming production of \"Impossible to Cure\", which is a foreshadowing to the band's next album, Extreme Aggression, which, though good, was a bit of a disappointment to one such as I, so in rapture for Terrible Certainty's twisted, violent, carnal hooks. The live cuts here actually sound a little sloppy, though clear through the mixing board. You get \"Terrible Certainty\", \"Riot of Violence\" and the lengthy \"Awakening of the Gods\", and of these I'd say that the obvious favorite is \"Riot of Violence\". A few of the riffs in \"Terrible Certainty\" sound off in the live setting, though \"Awakening of the Gods\" isn't bad.\n\nIf you've got the European version, you'll get a few more lives in \"Flag of Hate\", \"Love Us or Hate Us\", and \"Behind the Mirror\", the second of which is a newer song from the Extreme Aggression album. Yet other editions include another NWOBHM cover, that of Tygers of Pan Tang's \"Gangland\", which is about the same quality as the Raven. Obviously, if you're collecting this and have the choice, get the one with the most tracks, but the overall value is still weak when you can just invest the money towards one of the band's legendary full-lengths, or perhaps a concert ticket next time they swing through your area. Aside from the somewhat iconic cover image, there's nothing tremendously exciting or worthwhile here to splurge upon.\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nKreator does it again. Hordes Of Chaos is a raw, angry typical Kreator record full of heavy riffs, face melting solos, powerful and technical drumming. The album is recorded live in studio, first time for Kreator since Pleasure To Kill. This has caused many longtime fans to expect an album of the Pleasure To Kill caliber and they tend to be dissapointed. \n\nIt has been 21 years since Kreator recorded Pleasure To Kill and since then there has been many changes in the band's music, and their ideas. Many of the ideas and changes like their experimentation with Gothic music in the 90s is reflected in this album. This album merges many of the melodic experiments of Kreator with their traditional face shattering thrash. I might not hesitate to add that this is their most melodic record till date. But do not imagine an In Flames or Arch Enemy here. Kreator uses the melodic approach to create an angry, extreme and tense atmosphere which has been absent in the band's music since 1990. Melodic is not equal to evil on this album.\n\nTechnically this album is just fantastic. The guitar work, both riff and lead work is just spot on. No where in the realm of thrash does there exist any guitarist better than Mille Petrozza, and on this album he proves just why. The drumming is just fantastic. This is the best performance by Ventor so far & on this album he truly becomes drumming legend. Again considering that this album was recorded live, I don't think that many bands will come out to challenge these guys technically. The production is a kind of let down. The rhythm guitar could be more crunchier, but still it gives the album a required raw feel.\n\nThe consistency fo the album is fairly good. kreator keeps a good ariety in the songs like straight forward thrashers, mid paced numbers, and more complex multi-sectioned songs. the main highlight is the quality of songwriting which is very high and successfully merges the raw, brutal, in your face thrash with the more melodic elements. The album is strong in it's share of highlights like the highly catchy, multi-sectioned title track or the high-speed straight forward basher Warcurse, or the more experimental Amok Run. Similarly there are a few mishits as well. Demon Prince doesn't quite stand out and we would have expected a much better end to the album, To The Afterborn isn't quite inspiring as well. The lyrics of the album are some of the angriest by Kreator and match the tone of the album perfectly.\n\nThis album is a huge over the last two albums which according to me were both competent thrash metal records. The songwriting which manages to create something different than the usual Kreator formula but still manages to sound quite traditional and primitive thrash is just superb and it that which makes the album so effective. Believe me if you like Kreator and are a fan of their 80s material you will not be dissapointed. Do not be afraid to give this a try.\n",
        "\nAs the 80s wore on, the cauldron of straightforward speed, fire and vitriol was running dry. Its ingredients no longer seemed enough to satisfy the artistic impulses of many of thrash metal's most promising constituents. Song structures would become more advanced, more creative, and naturally, more dynamic. Kreator's third full-length, Terrible Certainty, is an adequate example of this transformation, and a brilliant one, with single tracks seeming to contain more effort in their composition than nearly all of Pleasure to Kill. Now, I'm not trying to knock that previous year's opus, because its a timeless and sinister transgression, and certainly this album trades in a little of its violent overtures en route to its transitions, but I consider the contents of this album 'trading up' as far as Kreator's long standing appeal.\n\nEach of the eight tracks is a tour de force of comprehensive, talented riffing that must have taken Mille quite some time to plot out, not only for the technical qualities but the actual moods they project. Where Pleasure to Kill and Endless Pain created atmospheres of slashing and burning hostility, this album frightens with more than mere barbarism, but schizoid nightmares that are delivered straight through the relentless rhythm section of Rob and Ventor, and the exhausted, stunning finger work of Mille and Tritze. \"Blind Faith\" opens with an escalating exercise in depth, a complex intro riff that shifts into some of the savagery of the band's past, as if to exclaim 'we have not forgotten you, maniacs'. The bridge riff here is also noteworthy, as it climbs from a mid paced sequence of pummeling to a fluster of brilliant speed solos. This is followed by \"Storming with Menace\", which features one of the most incredible dual guitar rhythms on the album, and remains a personal favorite. What a chorus!\n\n\"Terrible Certainty\" itself does not skip a beat, with an excellent drum and bass intro, Ventor using his limbs as the bridge into the mayhem of thick, prodding chords. Yet, the track becomes even better once the pre-verse guitar rhythms erupt, toiling and playful like a mastermind lunatic pulling your strings from an asylum. \"As the World Burns\" goes for a straight, rocking thrash vibe, but never loses the weighted ballast of the amazing musicianship, sordid guitar fills climbing up and down the frets before Mille lets us all have it with the verse. \"Toxic Trace\" is straight back to the technical wizardry, at least technical compared to so much of what we were hearing from thrash bands across the sea, the verse riffing stunningly similar to \"Where the Sun Burns Red\" from a few years in the future, and I absolutely adore the manic breakdown as the bass pumps over the atmospheric chords around 3:30.\n\nThe album would already seem to have enough supreme content to be considered masterpiece, but some of the best is yet to come. \"No Escape\" is methodical and distinct with a tight mid pace, and the chugging, creeping of the chorus segment, under which Ventor is all over the place. \"One of Us\" presents one of the most freakish schizoid riffs on the album in its intro, then shuffles into a bustling, busy sequence that must have had every German dashing his blood and guts over the mosh pit. As usual, Petrozza's vocals taunt us through the heavily saturated slurry of guitars, so much that it's nearly impossible to believe he's playing and singing at the same time, despite the beloved crudeness of his delivery. A chill, beautiful clean guitar intro will introduce us to the grand finale, \"Behind the Mirror\", which is just as spring loaded with impossible cruelty and power as anything else here.\n\nPerhaps the only element holding Terrible Certainty back from my perfect score is the production, which feels a little smothered, as if it were taking on more than it can handle. As such, a little of the power is lost in all the instruments, sort of like Deathrow's unbelievable Deception Ignored. But this was not mixed by Harris Johns. The result is that the album feels slightly dated in tone, but it's easy to overlook when the musical content is so stunning. I won't claim that this is the very best of Kreator, that is still to arrive in several years, but it's quite fucking close, and the combination of the aggressive vocals and individual ability displayed a clear emergence from the brutal confines of 1986's butcher-works like Pleasure to Kill or Dark Angel's Darkness Descends. It's no surprise at all that the quality of this record would be critical in the band's acquisition by CBS/Epic Records for US distribution, which led to the more accessible Extreme Aggression, because it would have been a crime to go unnoticed.\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\n1986 was a year which saw the arrival of some of the wildest and most intense thrash metal albums in history. Darkness Descends and Reign in Blood arose from North America, to be answered by the second full-length chapter of Germany's young Kreator: Pleasure to Kill. To dub this album 'hostile' wouldn't do it justice. It has all the subtlety of a live mortal shell landing right in your lap; the restraint of a hot poker in your eye. Apparently, some of us were left not only standing after Endless Pain, but healthy, a fact that Mille, Rob and Ventor were none too pleased with, and so they unleashed this inferno of unrepentant velocity to clean up all survivors, their iconic devil/creator taking himself to war with a phalanx of skeletal scions that are about to be mulched onto the bone pile.\n\nThough I wouldn't call its contents 'primitive', that is certainly their ultimate effect, to club the listener as quickly as possible. The melodic guitar intro \"Choir of the Damned\" seem almost too friendly, too inviting, before the shitstorm appears in \"Ripping Corpse\". The simplistic, terrifying guitar lines show an immediate increase in speed from the debut, and with this much tremolo picking involved, it's hard not to consider Pleasure to Kill one of the fundamentals in not only thrash, but death and black metal, since it's like a brutal spawning pool for ideas crucial to each of these genres. And it doesn't let up, with \"Death is Your Saviour\" and \"Pleasure to Kill\" following the same carnal currents, the same bristling guitar tone dismantling the intellect in crescendos of vibrant pain, Mille barking across the top, more a hurricane hammer of spit and venom than a man, nearly tripping over himself as his hasty diatribes murder all opposition.\n\n\"Riot of Violence\", however, arrives at the perfect time, a slower piece that is unquestionably the most catchy and hallowed on this entire record. Mid-paced, plundering thrash with an amazing, unforgettable pre-chorus (watch any live gig as the entire crowd mouths along) and some spikes of unexpected, clinical melody before the trampling of the actual chorus. 'Wyatt of violence? Wyatt of violence?' This more 'sensitive side' of the band ensues through the caustic triplets of \"The Pestilence\", at least for 30 seconds until it's clobbering time once more, the band stretching their limbs as far as possible in a giant clusterfuck contraption of searing speed. \"Carrion\" follows suit, and then \"Command of the Blade\", which is my second favorite here after \"Riot of Violence\", with its escalating dynamics and Slayer-like bridge riff below the solo. \"Under the Guillotine\", another well known song, is the closing chapter here, and like its namesake device, it cleanly severs the listener's skull from his body, with a superb if predictable chorus in which Mille growls like a proto death metal god.\n\nPleasure to Kill is one of those incredibly authentic cult offerings which doesn't show even the remote traces of age. There is no rust on this weighted blade, it cuts as well as it did 25 years ago, and represents the perfect dynamic bridge between Kreator's blunt origins and the wealth of impressive, technical talents they would begin to shell out on the imminent followup, Terrible Certainty. The bass is good and loud to anchor the guitars, and Ventor really never sounded better than here; his kit sounds highly present and organic, like it were emanating straight from your basement. Really, the only fault I could attribute to this record is that in some of its race to conquer all, it tosses in a few less impressive riffs here or there (\"The Pestilence\" and \"Carrion\" represent the weakest quarter of content). But honestly, it flogs most of its peers with a metal barbed whip. Obsessed by Cruelty and Eternal Devastation are both great records, but they don't have much on Pleasure Kill. About the only German thrash I liked more this year would have been Tankard's Zombie Attack, an opinion I share with perhaps only a handful of people across the world, but that album is nowhere near as dark and volcanic as this.\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nAfter the surprising debut Endless Pain, anticipation was running wild for whatever the young band Kreator could come up with next; how their raw, brutal but accessible sound would evolve. So Noise Records issued this three-song EP to tease fans for a few months before the arrival of the band's landmark sophomore, Pleasure to Kill. Flag of Hate has by now been issued in numerous formats, and most will own the tracks as a part of the Pleasure to Kill re-issue CD, but it's original European incarnation had but three songs: \"Flag of Hate\", which we'd already been flattened with on the debut, and then a pair of longer pieces which would be the true gist of why anyone might want to hunt this down.\n\nI speak, of course, of \"Take Their Lives\" and \"Awakening of the Gods\", both of which are quite mandatory if you're at all enamored of the band's first three albums. The former is an aggressive brute which opens with a series of two fisted, mid paced thrash riffs in the verse, wonderfully fused to Mille's barking, and a solid chorus. The track is eerily representative of the direction the band would take for Terrible Certainty, their third long-player. \"Awakening of the Gods\" is the more sprawling track, 7 1/2 minutes long, the most ambitious of the band to date, with a drawn, warlike intro sequence that transmutes into a disgusting splatter of dense, meaty fast thrash that feels more like the body of work that wound up on Pleasure to Kill. The chorus is a little underwhelming, but the riffs betwixt these and the bridge breakdown/lead do compensate, and ultimately it's a worthwhile addition to their catalog.\n\nAs for whether this is worth tracking down or not, well, it's almost a moot discussion. Those just interested in the contents can easily snatch them up elsewhere with a killer full-length album to boot, and even the cover image is included. As a collector's item, there's a certain nostalgia for a title like this, that while later rendered irrelevant, once contained some promising new material that you couldn't find elsewhere. \"Take Their Lives\" and \"Awakening of the Gods\" would be well worth acquiring to that rare Kreator fan who has only an original LP of Pleasure to Kill or Endless Pain, and Flag of Hate on the whole would make a nice gem on any collector's shelf, if they're concerned with the authenticity of original pressings. Otherwise, not much value to the article itself.\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nMille Petrozza and company might not have been the first to the well, but their debut as Kreator would arrive soon enough to join the rank and file of Sodom and Destruction among the earlier, major German thrash releases (post-demo stage). Formed a few years prior as Tormentor, with the members in their teens, the band had been jamming on covers, performing a few odd gigs, and releasing a few tapes, one of which caught the ear of Noise Records guru Karl Walterbach, who promptly signed them and asked them to change their name (legal reasons). Kreator had been born, Endless Pain was produced, and though it might not hold a candle to much of the band's 1986-1990 catalog, it's still quite impressive considering the age of the roster and the crude crunch of the writing.\n\nFrom a technical standpoint, I might place this somewhere between In the Sign of Evil and Sentence of Death in both songwriting quality and musicianship. It's not quite so blistering and bedazzling as Destruction's EP, but a little more involved than the punkish hymns of Angel Ripper. The rather unique, expressive architecture of Mille's chord selection was already in place, even though it wasn't nearly as refined as Pleasure to Kill or Terrible Certainty, and his harsh, barking vocals weren't unlike Angel Ripper's in that they'd later become a major influence upon the emergent black metal scene. Indeed, Sodom and Kreator are very often considered proponents of the 'first wave' of that genre, and that's a distinction I certainly won't argue with here. However, aside from the intro riff to \"Total Death\" sounding a little like \"Mad Butcher\", and carrying a similar leather & bullet belts image to Destruction, there was something fresh, bludgeoning and unique about this young band that foreshadowed their ascent.\n\nThe vocals are an immediate highlight of the title track, a sadistic glaze over its rippling, busy guitars and the steady crashing of Ventor's drums. Rob Fioretti's bass might not have been a major factor here, but the thick pulse would at least offer some concrete support to the chords. The construction of the notes was easily on a level plane with what was coming out of California, even if the band were not writing hits of Kill 'Em All or Show No Mercy caliber. In particular, I'd call out \"Tormentor\" and the epic \"Flag of Hate\" as the real hits here, the former hailing from their demo days under their previous moniker, the latter good enough to get its own EP release, with tearing, radioactive guitars and a killer bridge hook. However, there are other pleasures here like the brute \"Bone Breaker\", with its hilariously blunt chorus verse, or the cutting velocity of \"Son of Evil\" in which Mille warps his vocals into a higher, screaming velocity not unlike old Slayer or Whiplash.\n\nA few tunes don't exactly rise to the occasion, like \"Cry War\" or \"Storm of the Beast\" (with a title like that, I wanted it to be better), but there are no real hangups even on a complete listen one quarter century post-release. It's superior to In the Sign of Evil, as there's simply more to hear and the guitar patterns feel more bloodied and aggressive, but not quite a match for the riffs of Sentence of Death. However, I do like the production here more than either of those EPs. Even before the touching up in re-releases, it sounded fresh and as if the band were due a successful future. As it turns out, fate would deliver countless tours and further label deals, but as the time, Mr. Petrozza and his stalwarts were thrilled just to produce an album in their teens, and that enthusiasm and vibrancy is omnipresent in this recording.\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nKreator is one of the most well known German bands, apart from their hard rock counterparts, the Scorpions. They play a blend of classic and melodic thrash, and with this new album, a lot has changed without having been changed (I know, it doesn\u2019t make sense now, but let me finish). Hordes of Chaos, their newest album, explores formerly uncharted territory for the thrash masters, but it is not a perfect album by far, as it does have several non-fatal but undercutting errors. \n\nFirst off, Hordes of Chaos is filled to the brim with melody. Whether it be in the format of a dual guitar lead (Escalation, Hordes of Chaos), a clean vocal passage (Amok Run, To The Afterborn), or just a melodic break (Warcurse, Corpses of Liberty), Kreator manages to inject what some may see as melodic death metal influences into their vein of thrash. The most obvious example of this is the chorus of To The Afterborn. Mike Petrozza sings, albeit in a gravely, raspy tone, overtop of harmonious riffing and pounding double kick drums, not unlike the title track of Seasons In The Abyss. Corpses of Liberty, a melodic interlude, involves clean guitar and no vocals. Another fine point is the soloing, which is very melodic in nature. The sweep picking in Absolute Misanthropy is the perfect example.\n\nAnother upside to this album is the abundance of double bass by drummer J\u00fcrgen Reil. Warcurse, the thrashiest song on the album, begins and shows off his talent immediately with a galloping double bass/toms fill that is both speedy and brutal. Songs such as Escalation, To The Afterborn, and Demon Prince contain portions of rapid double bass that rival those on Enemy of God and Coma of Souls, but nothing beats the post-chorus of Absolute Misanthropy, where Reil drops a double bass blast that shatters anything else on the album. The main difference between Enemy of God and Hordes of Chaos is that the drumming on Hordes of Chaos is much better and more technical than that of Enemy of God. I give him props for stepping up his game.\n\nPetrozza seems like he is immortal; his voice doesn\u2019t age like certain thrash singers have *coughJamesHetfieldcough*. An angry tone is embedded deep in his vocals, and he shouts his lyrics with passion, again, unlike other unnamed thrashers (not to point at anyone, Tom Araya). One of the best examples of this is in the title track, where he screams, \u201cHORDES OF CHAOS! EVERYONE AGAINST EVERYONE, CHAOS!\u201d If the listener can resist shouting along with those lyrics, then they need some psychoevaluation. Oddly enough, Petrozza does a bit of singing in this album, most notably on the song To The Afterborn, but also in the beginning of Amok Run. His voice is not entirely clean (it has a very harsh tone to it, but he is singing), but it fits well into the song. \n\nHowever, there are 2 main places where the flaws of this album are very pronounced. First up on the chopping block is the production. Kreator recorded this album via a process called \u201clive in studio\u201d, where they all played at the same time and were recorded at the same time, rather than the typical way of recording each instrument one at a time. While this does give the album a completely different atmosphere than a regularly produced studio album, there are parts that undercut it, such as the kick drum sound. It is very thin and clicky sounding, not unlike a pencil rapping against a desk. Another complaint I have is that one of the guitars, rather than have a crunchy, distorted tone to it, has a fuzzy, grating tone to it. This gets a little annoying after a while.\n\nThe final complaint I have is about every metalheads favorite part of an album (uh, should that be least favorite?): filler. Yes, this album does have an abundance of good songs, but unfortunately, it has its fair share of filler as well. Amok Run was a good concept, but in practice, it didn\u2019t turn out so well, making the song nearly unlistenable with the lack of a catchy chorus like those in Hordes of Chaos or Warcurse. Furthermore, songs like Destroy What Destroys You, Radical Resistance (the chorus of this song is so dull, I have to click the forward button on my iPod every time) and some parts of Demon Prince don\u2019t have enough material to keep the listener interested. Sorry, Kreator, try harder on that front the next time you put out an album.\n\nAll in all, this is a good album. The choruses to most of the songs are very catchy, there are plenty of hooks, and it retains the spirit of classic thrash that seems to be so absent on many new releases today. If you can look past the flaws, then this will be a very interesting listen for the average thrash fan. CHAOS!\n",
        "\nIf you love thrash, you have to like Kreator. What thrash metalhead couldn't get on board with such tempting aggression and speed that can give you a case of whiplash from headbanging to classic stuff as found on this album? Coma of Souls is one of those genre defining albums and they had other classics like it besides this one but this one will be remembered too. Perhaps the most striking detail about the record is the band's fresh ability to infuse melody into these tracks while ripping and blitzing just as bestially as Slayer did at the time. Of course, this is Teutonic thrash metal. Which means Sodom must get mentioned in any such discussion. 1980's Sodom was good but they just weren't as talented as Kreator and Coma of Souls pretty much convinces me of this. I can get lost in these riffs all day! That was the dealmaker for me. Earth and all her humanity seem primed for wreckage when listen so closely to these blazing riffs and screams by Mille Petrozza. The intensity is all right here: solos, blasts, vocal prowess and tightness of songs. It's one tootsie roll wrapped with Teutonic treatise in thrash and the lesson learned is this: death metal and thrash metal is a very thin line when you listen to these Kommandants of Kick Ass Metal and what better album to showcase it than Coma of Souls? And yet, to hail it just on the premise of mere display for those genres would be obtuse.\n\nBut what else is there that makes this album so rich while staying true to thrash and death? Well, let me pose another question to get down to it: Do you like Iron Maiden? Why, yes you do. You at least certainly must appreciate their influence if you enjoy this album because the Maiden quotient figures quite prominently in much of this as well. I have heard this Iron Maiden-ish configuration in other continental thrash bands. Notably Coroner. It's in that added layer of epic melodism where I notice this bent. I realized it with the opening riff on Terror Zone and three quarters through the track with the the legato and closing riff as another example. And doesn't the acoustic guitar part in the first song remind you that of Moonchild's opening? These Iron Maiden decals displayed in the sound are mostly small and florid but indeed present. Where the genius lies is how the band can so fluidly transition into that relentless death metal sound i.e. When The Sun Burns Red with its hellish riffs styled just like on Altars of Madness by Morbid Angel. Agents of Brutality has riffs that sound just as violent and picked at a more visible sounding speed than them however. Mille can alternate pick with the best of them. \n\nVeil's blasting beats cannot be overlooked either. His playing is just a strength as anything else. On Twisted Urges or Material World Paranoia, his furious skinning cued for the wicked death metal guitar solo add much fire. You really get the vibe for the destruction touted by the lyrics. How the band plays this is a technical wonder and they are superior to their thrash peers on both sides of the Atlantic in this regard. This line-up play spectacularly together. Each of the songs from top to bottom basically boil down to one singular speed in general. There's no diversionary clutter like Master of Puppets had or some of the slight silly moments that littered Agent Orange. And it doesn't have a couple of the filler tracks that Reign in Blood has. \n\nBut is this album perfect? There is not a song I don't like on Coma of Souls. It is mostly perfect in execution. Do I love it? I think \"really,really\" like and \"very impressive\" would be how I myself would judge it. As good as the drumming is, some of the slower progressions are not as I prefer for thrash metal. The production is not as raw as once was and hence I would like this more if it had that. Many of the songs also tend to end in a repeated fashion. All these are design choices anyway. The pluses outweigh them. I award this classic status for thrash metal and the album is worth your hard earned cash without question.\n",
        "\nOf the \"big three\" german thrash bands (the other two being Sodom and Destruction), I'd say Kreator is by far the most progressive and aggressive of the bunch. They're relatively popular for a thrash metal band, they fuse various melodic elements into their style, and they make music about people; not just war and killing everything in sight (though that can be awesome). Mille Petrozza's \"angry man\" personality only helps the mix.\n\nExtreme Aggression is certainly no Pleasure To Kill part 2, but it certainly is worth your time. The thrash is still there, the anger is still there, and Mille's germanic hate lyrics still make you wanna smash some heads. It isn't perfect, but like the title of this review suggests, it's angry music for angry people. The riffs, although being typical thrash metal riffs, are mixed with some melodic interludes (Betrayer, Fatal Energy) and occasionally have a heavy metal-esque sound to them (Don't Trust). All in all, it's a very different sound from the previous three albums. I actually prefer this one over all of the others. This album was also one of the first albums where Kreator began to write lyrics about PEOPLE and SOCIETY, which is cool because it really helps as a stress-reliever and it gives the music an amount of depth to it, as opposed to the ever-repetitive \"RAWR RAWR RAWR ZOMBIES KILLING EVERYONE HAHAHA!!!\"\n\nThe only I didn't care for was \"Some Pain Will Last\", which was long as hell for a Kreator song and had an intro that fails to grab you by the neck like all the other songs do on this album. Aside from that, they all rule. All the songs have heaviness to them and all the songs retain Kreator's trademark brand of thrash aggression.\n\nThe production on this album is phenomenal. It's clear and crisp, yet so raw at the same time. All the instruments can be heard clearly and it feels like the music just upgraded your speakers to 5.1 quality. The drums sound smooth, the guitars have a FANTASTIC tone to them, and the bass is heard when it needs to be. This is definitely their cleanest record from the 80s.\n\nSo even if it isn't as aggressive as Pleasure To Kill or as down to earth as Endless Pain, this is a thrash masterpiece with all the aggression and brutal honesty you could want. Buy it now.\n",
        "\nKreator takes huge steps up in songwriting and deliver their most mature effort to date. All the songs have variety in them, all are highly technical, yet they are effective, coherent, catchy and grounded. The production is much polished compared to other Kreator\u2019s efforts, but this is polished in the best possible way. All the three departments (guitar, vocals, rhythm) are highlighted equally well in the mix. The guitars are pure sledgehammer, slicing the listener into pieces and forcing him to bang his skull against the wall until the end. \n\nThis album marks the debut of ex-Sodom axeman Frank Blackfire. With Mille he forms one of the best guitar units in thrash history. Together they put to record some of the most maniac thrash riffs which are executed to perfection. You won\u2019t notice even a single weak or sloppy riff. All of them are violent, technical, and catchy at the same time. The lead work of these two is practically flawless. Never before in any thrash metal album were such great solos present with equally great riffs. Ventor improves tremendously in his skill in using his kit, especially his use of double bass. Ventor establishes himself as one of the best thrash drummers right up there with Lombardo or Hoglan through this album. The bassist mostly follows the guitars and also you don\u2019t expect to hear bass in this guitar, drum fury. But still the bass plays a good role in this album. The vocals are great, violent and tailorly made for this album\n\nSongs range from being practically flawless to being very good. The album features 10 songs each no less triumphant than the last. I won\u2019t go into pick up highlights or describe each song as all of them are excellent and there is no weak track. The songs have a great tense atmosphere in them. Here we have short, straight forward, all-out thrash metal songs which are specially crafted to beat the listener senseless (World Beyond, Twisted Urges), we have longer, more developed songs which go through many sections (When The Sun Burns Red, Coma of Souls, Agents of Brutality, Hidden Dictator, Material World Paranoia), we have three of the best midpaced songs in thrash history (Terror Zone, People Of The Lie, Mental Slavery). The choruses of most of the songs are complex, in which the song either slows down or changes pace dramatically. People of the Lie and Hidden Dictator include some of the best choruses in thrash history.\n\nThis according to me is not only the best thrash metal album ever recorded but also one of the best album recorded in all of metal. Hence I recommend this album to any one listening to heavy metal. This may not be the most extreme record ever, but the song writing, riff construction, rhythm section, and execution is really outstanding. Hence I will conclude that you waste no time in adding this stellar album to your collection and I hope you will never regret your decision.\n",
        "\nWell, it looks like our classic Kreator thrash is back up and running, seriously I'm humiliated at how they tried industrial metal, leave Rammstein to finish that job for you. There is much more to compliment on than complain about here and is really actually a very good album, especially considering most good 80s bands sort of suck today like Metallica and Slayer for instance, not saying Kreator flubbed Hordes of Chaos with a one hit track album but regardless, Kreator is somehow able to keep things going and adding more variety and keeping up the creative ideas in their music. However we have a lot to cover on this 14 track album, so let's get down to it.\n\nI think it may be more suitable for me to get my rambling criticism out of the way first and leave the best stuff for last. I'll start by saying one thing, where did those heavy guitar riffs go? I mean the ones here were fine, but looking back at some of their earlier stuff like Pleasure to Kill, Extreme Aggression, and Coma of Souls, fucking brutal riffs, so where did those old classic heavy riffs go, did you toss them down the drain or something, or was it laziness? It's like hard rock riffs while stamping the name \"thrash metal\" on it, c'mon, bring back at least some of the classic influences. Second, Mille has a fucking awesome scream, and that brutal high-pitched voice is good and all, but mixing it with your softcore riffs is really out of the ordinary and is a some points quite annoying. Either stiffen up the heavy guitars or drop the brutal vocals, choose. Third, the lack of good songs is quite apparent, and needs to have more than just Enemy of God and Impossible Brutality to get you job done. Dont get me wrong, while I loved Impossible Brutality and Enemy of God, I also loved World Anarchy, Under a Total Blackened Sky, and Suicide Terrorist, but a few more tracks that really stick out are what is needed more of.\n\nNow that I've got my criticism out of the way, I must give in my two cents for compliments. First is that they have some really good tracks and is really good compared to some of their other stuff, I mean, their mid to late 90s stuff was terrible bull crap, but here, we bring back some of our old Kreator thrash style, if we exclude the strange guitar riff jump to hard rock, we will see an awesome thrash metal band redeeming themselves and clearly giving everything 110%, fucking persaverence, and it pays off too, and from what it would seem, germans are much better at giving 110% on their newer stuff rather lazy american bands (with the exception of Megadeth). Okay, maybe that crack was to some sorts off, but the american big four thrash metal bands, three of them are starting to suck. I also must compliment on the solos and intros, they truly are nice and are worth hearing and honoring, while I cant exactly say the same about their riffs here, they truly are of a classical thrash sound. While they may have lacked stand-out songs, they made quite a few good songs, just songs that never get old to the point where you'll be popping this album in five years from now, so with the very long attention span this album offers, it's definitely worth the buy, rather than buying it then popping it and and going \"shit, I just wasted 20 bucks on some load of bull shit.\", well not here it seems. Now here in this album, as far as performance, they did a good job not tossing one part in the middle of the often loved part of the oreo cookie, it either rocks or sucks, which I'd much rather have everything suck than have one good part two middle of the road parts and everything else suck donkey dick, here they keep their consistency and show that your actually thinking about what come up with, rather than throw random shit on the table and jump to the recording studio. So now that we've gone over the pros and cons, let's move on.\n\nThere are six songs that are truly pure awesomeness, those would be: Impossible Brutality, Enemy of God, World Anarchy, Under a Total Blackened Sky, When Death Takes its Domination, and Suicide Terrorists. All these songs show true awesome solos and great intros with at least mediocre riffs to add on with everything that was done perfectly and sounds awesome, for instance, Impossible Brutality, nice drum intro and fucking badass drums and vocals as well. Enemy of God, sweet intro, solo, and riff, truly the only truly awesome riff on the entire album with totally badass vocals and lyrics, however before I get to far on my praise, what makes the vocals so \"badass\", simple, a high-pitched voice with some screaming, like Bruce Dickinson, Rob Halford, or even David Draiman for instance, use a high-pitched voice and scream to help the vocals stand out more when the guitarists are riffing, this makes a good classical metal sound. World Anarchy, nice guitar parts, but best of all, I fucking loved that scream after the intro, and the rest of the vocals were very good. Under a Total Blackened Sky, nice heavy guitar parts, now lets stop here, what makes a guitar \"heavy\", truly we all have heard a heavy guitar part, but they make it by truly making those low-pitched yet pretty fast picking, however, the fact that these guitar parts are fairly high-pitched while still sounding \"heavy\" is amazing.\n\nTo review everyones part, I must say, the vocals were done best, and I liked them the most, Mille has a particularly catchy style of vocals like David Draiman, Ozzy Osbourne, and Rob Halford, and Mille shows it off totally here. The lyrics were really good too, I loved the fact that they put rhymes and ballad lyrics in the songs as well. Guitar parts are good, but could be improved, mixing softcore guitar riffs with brutal intros isn't the greatest way to go. Bass lines, I'm beginning to wonder if they even used a bassist here, where the fuck did that bassist go? Drumming was brutal and epic, but they showed it off truly the most in Impossible, where I'm beginning to wonder if that drummer has a third leg.\n\nSo to end this, any Kreator fans who dont mind hard rock riffs with you still classical Mille vocals, get to the store NOW to pick this up.\n",
        "\nLet me start off this review by first saying that I am a huge fan of Teutonic thrash. In the words of infamous ShamWow salesman (and prostitute beater) Vince Offer, \"Germans always make good stuff\". This album is no exception. While this may not be 1986, Kreator still delivers thrash that puts many modern bands to shame. Now let's get on with the actual review.\n\nI find it hard to believe that the band recorded this album live in studio. The production is very clean and the timing is almost too precise for such a process. While it might not sound as heavily produced as a Britney Spears CD, it's definitely no Pleasure to Kill. This is by no means a bad thing. If the album was meant to sound like Pleasure to Kill, the band would obviously not have done any growing or maturing in 23 years. This would be a sad thing indeed considering how much great music has come from the German outfit over the years.\n\nThe opening track starts out with a riff that reminds me of something that would start off a Scandinavian record oddly, but it doesn't sound bad at all. This track sets an accurate tone for what's to come on the rest of the record: aggressive thrash metal with a pissed-off mood and melodic riffs. Kreator aren't happy with the way the world is and they let you know in a way that seemingly only a thrash metal band can do. This is definitely a highlight of the disc and is one of the most memorable song on it.\n\nThe next few tracks, while none of them are particularly memorable, are varied and reach into different areas of the band's creative areas. While one of them comes out ripping like with old-school 80's thrash feel, another utilizes a soft, slow opening and alternates between slower and faster parts. The solos on \"Destroy What Destroys You\" sound awesome and the chorus is possibly the most memorable of the first half of the disc.\n\nThe second half of the disc is where this album really shines. \"Radical Resistance\", \"Absolute Misanthropy\", and \"To the After Burn\" are all my personal favorites of the release. They combine most of the best solos, best choruses, best riffs, and just make you want to headbang all the way through. You can really feel the evil and hate in \"Absolute Misanthropy\". \"Corpses of Liberty\", while not being a bad interlude, seems out of place considering the only song left is the \"Demon Prince\". It seems like this interlude could have been better placed. \"Demon Prince\" while not as strong as an offering as the previous three (actual) songs, is overall a pretty decent track with a very majestic feel. Very good ending track and a power metal band would kill to have thought of these solos first.\n\nOverall, I thoroughly enjoyed this album. The band is still very much influenced by Slayer, but still has it's own unique musical identity. Even after the band has been in existence for over a quarter of a century, they are still able to pump out a strong thrash album that puts many modern efforts to shame. This release is definitely worth checking out.\n",
        "\nIn all of the ratings below 50%!\n\n-Start rant-\n\nThis is my first review, so I figured it would be appropriate to give it to what I thought was the best album of 2009.\n\nI don't understand why people are whining and bitching about this glorious production. The production of this album was done completely live in studio, which, will guaranteed have some people complaining \"It's not Pleasure to Kill.\" Of course it's not Pleasure to Kill. That album (While the most glorious thing to come that year) was from 1986, and here emerges this, 23 years later. Kreator have aged, had numerous lineup changes, and have gone through an experimental period where they dabbled in industrial and Gothic metal.. But this is all thrown out the window when they come back into the thrash revival scene with this album. Sure, it's not the thrashiest stuff around, and sure, there were better albums released in 2009, but this proves that even though most of the members are 40-50 and above, they can still jam better than most modern bands.\n\n-End rant-\n\nAnd now, on to the review!\n\nKreator have done it again, and have come back blazing with a brand, spankin' new thrash masterpiece. But that is to be expected, coming from one of the most influential bands from the 80's, having given us influences in all of thrash, black, and death metal! They have crunching, in-your-face riffs, most intense drumming since Coma of Souls, and Mille screams like he wants to murder some infants who ripped off his riffs.\n\nGranted, as most thrash bands have been doing for most of the existence of the genre, the lyrics are generally centered around politics. But, there are also non-politic related gems in there, such as Amok Run. The album delivers intensity, speed, and aggression in so much supply that you shit yourself the moment you hear the main riff in the title track.\n\nHordes of Chaos - A Necrologue for the Elite gives you a clear example of what to expect from the rest of the album. Fast riffing, a small example of Ventor's fastest drumming since their golden days, Mille's patended pissed-off screaming, and the rest can only get better. Warcurse is one of the fastest songs on the album, starting off with Ventor blasting away on his toms. Escalation is your classic Kreator song, with your intense start. Speedy drum fills, quick riffing, and a classic Mille scream with a classic Mille-pissed-off chorus.\n\nAmok Run starts off with your 90's style Gothic intro, and once you realize what Mille's said, you're hit with a blast that feels like a straight punch to the stomach, and quickly gets into Mille tearing your face off with quite possibly his angriest vocals yet. The middle of the album is fairly decent, but consists of the earlier points. \n\nBy the time you get to Corpses of Liberty, you're trying to settle down your nerves from the forcibly induced headbanging which occurs automatically, and just as you settle down and think that this mellow instrumental is the end of the album, you get hit with the closer, Demon Prince, the most melodic, most intense, most gut-wrenchingly awesome track on the entire album. As soon as the first chorus finishes and you think you're still hanging onto your sanity, you're hit by one of Mille's best solos in the last 20 years, which just oozes aggression, hatred, and gets out all of that pent-up rage Mille has acquired over the years.\n\nAll in all, Hordes of Chaos is Kreator's most solid album since Coma of Souls, and any metalhead worth their salt should give this a listen.\n",
        "\nWhat a huge, monumental disappointment this was. For an album so highly regarded, I expected so much more from this than what was on offer, because this CD only serves to demonstrate how far Kreator have come from what I now realize were very humble beginnings. This brand of prototype thrash does have its place, but what is on display here is groaningly outdated and almost totally irrelevant. There are 1 or 2 good moments on \u2018Pleasure to Kill\u2019, but a \u201ctimeless classic\u201d this most definitely is not.\n\nCase in point, the intro, \u2018Choir of the Damned\u2019, is an embarrassment, with its clumsy guitar work tripping itself up over poorly chosen pseudo harmonic scales. This honestly sounds like a learner practising a guitar lesson, yet after the retarded guitar finally comes to a stuttering end, ethereal keys and acoustic guitar work founded from actual chords seep through, which is the first thing that can be gleaned from this CD; the songwriting and ability of the band is in no way up to the standard needed to communicate the vision of the album, because some of the ideas expressed on \u2018Pleasure to Kill\u2019 could hold a lot of potential if they weren\u2019t so badly executed.\n\nWe go into \u2018Ripping Corpse\u2019 which, after a promising intro, thunders into a world of musical confusion. The band are out of time with each other, no one seems to know the meter... it feels amateur, which is not something you expect from one of the most revered bands in thrash metal. When they finally manage to sort things out and bring some coherence to the song, it\u2019s\u2026 OK. Yeah, it\u2019s an alright riff, but let\u2019s be honest, it isn\u2019t groundbreaking, is it? The solos on this song (and indeed, entire album) are truly grating, because every single one of them is nothing more than one big chromatic beehive of randomly chosen notes, many of which are audibly mistimed or poorly played. They\u2019re too wild to be interesting, and in the end you just want to swat them away like the flies buzzing around the proverbial piece of shit that they are. How people aren't levelling the same argument towards Kreator that they love to burden Kerry King with I have no idea.\n\nMost of the actual music on \u2018Pleasure to Kill\u2019 lingers between being close to not bad and totally boring. Essentially, the bulk of material is a bunch of stereotypical mish-mashed tremolo riffs with fast drumming and frantically barked vocals, all of which just don't seem to connect with each other at all. None of the elements seem to make any attempt to compliment what everything else is doing, its just \"right, you play fast, I'll do something like this, you do some aggressive vocals or something, and you do something over that\", which some might consider a reliable formula, but its one that comes pretty cheaply as far as actual music goes.\n\nThings only really start to pick up around the title track, which doesn\u2019t really produce anything different musically, but just has a more together feel about it. The elements that were so self corrosive before somehow begin to work in each other\u2019s favour; the riffs on show have a bit more impact, and the little hooks are more tightly fastened to the drum fills. The solos are still complete rubbish, but there is a pretty cool mid-paced section on this song that does get my attention.\n\nAnd therein lies the key; when Kreator SLOW DOWN a bit, then the more memorable riffs slowly come drifting through. \u2018Riot of Violence\u2019 actually sounds like it has been rehearsed a bit before recording, each instrument combining and contributing towards a complete whole, as opposed to just playing really fast without any real end goal in sight. Even the vocals, that have sounded hurried and at times breathless up until this point, manage to carry some weight at last. Without doubt one of the best songs on this CD.\n\nThis is where anything remotely valuable in the way of songwriting ends. \u2018The Pestilence\u2019 is 6 long minutes of musical shit. When I saw 6 minutes I was dreading the \u201cprogressive\u201d direction that I had assumed the song was going to take, but I was wrong; it was literally six minutes of exactly the same pointless thing over and over and over again. \u2018Carrion\u2019 has all of its good moments shot down in flames by those fucking solos, and \u2018Take Their Lives\u2019 demonstrates that early Kreator can be boring and uninspired even when they slow down, and \u2018Flag of Hate\u2019, try as it might, just can\u2019t recapture an interest in this album that to be honest was lost a long while back.\n\nRaw vocals, check. Raw production, check. Fast riffing and pummelling drums, check. So they\u2019re playing thrash metal, then. But just because they\u2019re doing thrash right does not mean they are producing anything of musical worth. This won\u2019t be getting many spins at all from me I\u2019m afraid, which is a real shame seeing as I really wanted to be blown away by this CD. My advice would be this: ignore this album entirely, unless thrash of the most mindless variety is what you want. For Kreator, get anything from \u2018Coma of Souls\u2019 onwards, but for classic thrash, seriously\u2026 get \u2018Reign in Blood\u2019 or 'Hell Awaits', because \u2018Pleasure to Kill\u2019 couldn\u2019t last a single round against early Slayer.\n",
        "\nBut to be honest if, after 24 years of musical evolution, you are STILL waiting for another \u2018Pleasure to Kill\u2019 to come around, then you\u2019re only setting yourself up to be let down. Kreator will never write another \u2018Pleasure to Kill\u2019. Metallica will never write another \u2018\u2026Puppets\u2019, Slayer will never write another \u2018Hell Awaits\u2019 or \u2018Reign in Blood\u2019, Black Sabbath won\u2019t get together again and write another \u2018Paranoid\u2019. And yet still some people will let that simple fact detract from their more recent releases and will be forever disappointed by what are perceived as musical shortcomings. Well, I do not think you should be disappointed with \u2018Enemy of God\u2019, because this album is a highly important release that exhibits the best elements of thrash from different eras under one big collective, mish-mashed effort, and it is because of this that it comes across as a hugely varied album that feels relevant and accessible yet unmistakably thrash metal.\n\nThe title track opens this CD, and it cuts straight to the no nonsense stuff; gritty, speedy riffing and thundering drums, and it puts a great big stupid smile on my face because I know straight away that this is not an album I am going to have to work too hard to enjoy. Frontman Mille sounds properly pissed off about something as he barks out the chorus (a far more rounded vocal performance than on \u2018Pleasure to Kill\u2019) before a solo straight out of Slayer\u2019s back catalogue whizzes through the proceedings and careers off into the chaos. \u2018Impossible Brutality\u2019 and \u2018Suicide Terrorist\u2019 slow things down slightly with a groovier, mid-paced approach, but the intensity is nevertheless maintained throughout, much of which is courtesy of drummer Jurgen \u2018Ventor\u2019 Reil, whose footwork and precision prove to be two of the album\u2019s most consistent strengths.\n\nGenres don\u2019t just happen, they take time to properly evolve into a recognisable entity. \u2018Pleasure to Kill\u2019 came from a time when thrash and death metal were pretty similar in terms of musicality, and that likeness is definitely tangible on that album \u2013 I mean, there are moments on there where you could be forgiven for thinking you were listening to \u2018Scream Bloody Gore\u2019 or, indeed, \u2018Altars of Madness\u2019, and this admittedly is something that you don\u2019t get with \u2018Enemy of God\u2019. As the album progresses, as mentioned by other reviewers, yes it does indeed inherit a more melodic feel. But even so the delivery and drive is still there without sounding like a cash in on easy melodies, and songs like \u2018Voices of the Dead\u2019 and \u2018Murder Fantasies\u2019 exemplify this perfectly, laced with just as much aggression and edge as they are with harmony.\n\nKreator have inevitably evolved with the thrash movement, but this album proves they have done so in a way that has not left them redundant and forgotten at the bottom of the heap. On the contrary, this album couldn\u2019t have come at a better time for music: just as the thrash revival begins to get out of control with Metallica and Testament clones boring the life out of anyone willing to listen, along comes a mature and comprehensive aural documentary of thrash music that exhibits all of the genre\u2019s strengths; technicality, musicianship, speed, songwriting and riffs in abundance, and it serves to remind us all that there is another side to thrash music besides its own-self celebration at the hands of people that don\u2019t really understand it. And anyway, who better to influence a thrash revival than a band who played such a vital role in its identity the first time around?\n\nEssential listening, whoever you are.\n",
        "\nPlaying thrash metal mostly on and off for over 25 years, Kreator is devoid of needing an in-depth introduction. I'd have to say however, that the 1990's version of the band didn't strike me very well. \"Renewal\" was not as I'd hoped for and the other few releases during that era didn't capture my attention. \"Coma of Souls\" was the only album from 1990 that I'd say still remains to be their best. Though after that, it didn't remind me of what the true Kreator really used to be like. Their first few releases including \"Endless Pain\", \"Pleasure to Kill\" and \"Terrible Certainty\" were what the true German thrash metal releases the band strung forth. There might've been reasons with their record company and change in line-up that caused their downfall. Though they're back in full throttle once again, and \"Violent Revolution\" was a return to their thrash metal roots.\n\nThe music on here was wholly melodic to the point of perfection. Their aim it seemed here that they achieved a level of success once again; and was more like the \"Coma of Souls\" of the new millennium. The first few tracks are the most memorable because of the musical rhythms by Mille Petrozza combined with Sami Yli-Sirnio's lead guitar riffs, making the songs sound more intriguing and interesting to listen to. However, the whole album features these kind of rhythm/lead combinations. The main rhythm guitar was very heavy, though all of the songs seemed to flow in perfect grace. The chorus of each track features some great moments, thus including the bridges. These highlights make the tracks very memorable. It isn't just monotonous, stale or bare musical outputs that was encompassed during the bands 1990's era.\n\nSome tracks feature a few clean tone guitar parts as well as clean vocals. They didn't play them on all tracks, just brief points on a few songs. Soon thereafter would enter the heavy distorted guitar riffs. A good example would be on \"Replicas of Life.\" It starts off with a clean guitar/vocal introduction then expands into a heavy yet once again melodic guitar melodies with heavy rhythm overtones. The first three tracks are the most memorable, though each song has key points that keeps you interested as a listener. Twelve tracks on here and clocking in at about sixty minutes in length, no thrash metal listener should keep \"Violent Revolution\" out of your ongoing Kreator collection. I would stress that you do listen to the first three tracks, as I previously mentioned.\n\nThe tempos of each song are varied. There aren't any tracks that are very fast, though the intensity is still exhibited. You could really hear a great deal of double kick drum parts along with slower ones. Everything seemed to flow well from that aspect. The focus here was not only intensity, but originality and melodic guitar overtures. Mille's vocal outputs were very intense. There were some moments to where he exhibited some screaming, especially during the bridge/chorus parts. A good example would be the track \"Servant in Heaven - King in Hell.\" Everything seemed to mesh together in unison.\n\nThe only real bad points of the album is the flat production sound and the guitar solos. The mixing of instruments was well despite these shortcomings. There is no doubt that Kreator exhibits utmost talent as far as the rhythm/lead riff sections. But guitar solos aren't very well thought out. If they were better played, the album would deserve a higher rating altogether. Their previous lead guitarist Frank \"Blackfire\" Gosdzik shredded way harder than Sami Yli-Sirnio and Mille Petrozza in the solos category. It would've made the album to be near perfection if they were stronger from this aspect. Nevertheless, the rhythm/lead melodies make up for this mishap. They should've focused harder than they did with their solos as they did with their rhythms/melodies.\n\nKreator chose to focus once again on a variety of different issues in the lyrical department. That would include death, politics, religion, society, war and terrorism. These topics seem to be featured on pretty much all of their releases. However, they still are intelligent and interesting to read. They seem to think the lyrics out with an utmost effort. You can understand Mille's vocal outputs pretty well without even reading the lyrical sheets. Anyhow, they're still strong in this department so there are no complaints from this aspect. They don't usually do cover songs at all really. Everything is usually all of their original tracks.\n\n\"Violent Revolution\" is a must to own if you favor thrash metal played with melodic parts to it. Kreator doesn't seem to copy any other bands' styles. This is a great comeback album of theirs which was extravagantly and elegantly played. It was really admirable and well exectuted. This album for me can be one that you can give it numerous spins without really getting sick of hearing it. Mille's vocals/rhythms, Sami's lead melodies, Christian's bass guitar parts and Ventor's drum outputs were very well played. It's really admirable that they decided to come back with more memorable thrash metal that was solely their trademark during their earlier days.\n",
        "\nThis vintage German thrash metal band was originally founded under the name of \"Tormentor\", which they used for a few years before changing it to \"Kreator\" in 1984. Two original members are left, Miland \"Mille\" Petrozza on vocals/guitar and Jurgen \"Ventor\" Reil on drums. The newest members are Sami Yli-Sirnio on guitars and Christian \"Speesy\" Giesler on bass guitar. Their best lineup, however, would be the one that transpired during the \"Coma of Souls\" era. This is the eleventh full-length release for the band, which includes some of their greatest studio work since \"Violent Revolution.\" Aside from \"Coma of Souls\", Kreator of the 1990's didn't strike me as much as their more recent releases. They switched back to focusing more on their older thrash metal roots. This is where the band shines the most. When they abdicated from their older and more aggressive approach, I lost interest.\n\n\"Enemy of God\" features total melodic thrash metal guitar work that sticks with the listener in an utter and total amazement. In terms of analyzing the entire album, it has its peaks and valleys in their guitar executions. Some tracks are more memorable than others. This release is monumental for many reasons. The music features heavily tremolo picked guitar melodies, gallops and bar chords. There are some songs that feature acoustic guitar parts and spoken words, but not in its entirety. The release primarily deals with fierce written thrash metal riffs, raging tempo changes, clean guitar parts and total originality to its musical writing. This newer band's approach has taken an energy-laden action by going back to their aggressive thrash metal writings.\n\nThe variety of this album is heavily orchestrated thanks to frontman \"Mille\" Petrozza. All of the songs captivate the listener, especially during the bridge and chorus parts and, most notably, during the title-track and \"Murder Fantasies.\" The latter track includes Michael Amott, who exhibits a short, whammy bar lead guitar part. Thrash metal doesn't get executed much better! Its well produced and recorded instruments are well mixed together. You can hear every guitar riff, guitar lead, bass guitar and drum work with an utmost clarity to it. As for the overall playing, the only thing that were not very effective were the guitar solos. That is my most critical statement of this released by Kreator. There was just no real innovation in this aspect.\n\nThe lyrical concepts focused mainly on death, religion, politics, war and terrorists. Some of the most intelligent words that I've heard from a band in this category. The lyrics mesh well with the guitar parts. Aside from the brilliant guitar work, the lyrics are a close second. The album doesn't feature any cover songs or live tracks. It's just under 60 minutes of ingenious thrash metal. In summation, thrash metal doesn't get comprised better than in this phenomenal album. With so much originality and variety, Kreator belts out one of their best works out of their entire discography. As was previously mentioned. the lead guitar parts to each song are nothing spectacular. However, the melodic guitar riffs and lyrics are the highlights. If you're still skeptical, be sure to check out the title-track and \"Impossible Brutality\" first.\n",
        "\nBy the turn of the new decade, Kreator had already put out more than a few thrash metal classics at this point. They all had top quality instrumentals, The sharpest guitar riffs, The fastest drumming and great production. But what they seriously lacked was in the vocals and lyrics department. You could see Mille writing good lyrics in his previous albums, It's just that his accent wasn't good enough. He still had his powerful screechings but the impact of the lyrics was softened. \n\nSo what's the big step up on this album?. I think Petrozza took some english classes here and maybe even took some help from people fluent in english. Maybe his english just improved. The lyrics are certainly Impactful and intelligent. They will leave an impression in your minds. His vocals are not as annoying anymore, His vocals are less harsher and this time he tries to sing everything unlike in 'Terrible certainty' where he just uttered out the last words in a line. The production values on this one are mind blowing to be honest. The Drums just sound perfect, They are damaging and don't have the weak 'click' sound that Exodus and Overkill had at this point of time. The vocals feel raw and fresh and aren't over produced like you see on Megadeth's albums in the 90's.\n\n'When the sun burns red' embodies all the best qualities of german thrash metal, We have really technical and intricate guitar work, The breakdowns are original, The lyrics go out to prove a point, The solos are technical masterpieces. Mille's an excellent guitarist as he's always been. While Sodom can be too unoriginal at times and Destruction can sound too american. Kreator fly the flag of German thrash metal very high. The title track is a classic kreator song, like the ones found in 'Extreme aggression'. The lyrics are politically charged without being funny like Sodom. The drumming, Well what can i say?. This isn't the fastest or the hardest drumming I've seen but they way sound through the speakers is perfect. The production on this album beats that of the more popular thrash bands at this time. \n\n'Agents of brutality' and 'Twisted urges' are the two best tracks on this album. The lyrics deal with slavery of a girl by the evil organisations. Twisted urges has a really good breakdown and the solo here is a good one, Mille's vocals express the horror of being captured, tortured and beaten etc. \n\nBest thrash album of the 90's?, Could be. Most bands adopted a commercial approach by this time and Kreator where no different. Their albums after this one are far more simpler and influenced by bands like Pantera and machine head. Pretty much everything they produced in the 85-90 period is a classic, With coma of souls being the best of them all. If you enjoy Thrash Metal with dark lyrics, Harsh vocals and grim political and philosophical themes, It doesn't get better than \"Coma of Souls\".\n",
        "\nBeginning with Renewal in 1992, Kreator started a phase in their career of mild experimentation, which would last five albums until returning to 'normal' on 2005's Enemy of God. Like so many other bands of the 90s, the pressures of metal's decline and the rise of other, alternative musics seemed to shake itself off on the Germans, thus provoking an evolution of sound. To their credit, Kreator still felt and sounded like Kreator throughout all of these works, even the much maligned, Kreator-lite album Endorama. As far as this perior, I feel Renewal was the brightest and the best, an album that has truly grown upon me with its brand of grim, industrial thrash metal, but Outcast was no slouch.\n\nThe outside influence on this particular album is a rowdy punk/hardcore aesthetic, in addition to some hints of industrial noise, and the result is a pretty even smorgasboard of fist pumping Kreator-core anthems that range from fun to just there. Do not be misled by my description: the album is in no way silly or anarchistic. It retains the social political consciousness that Kreator has been scripting since Terrible Certainty. It's simply got a punk aesthetic fueling it, which is little surprise, as Mille and crew have always been fans of decent punk. This manifests in tracks like \"Phobia\", \"Nonconformist\", \"Against the Rest\" and \"Whatever It May Take\". But they're not alone here, the band has written some simple (by their standards) thrashings like \"Alive Again\" and the groovy \"Forever\", which is one of the best songs on this album. There are also a few tracks like \"Enemy Unseen\" which make use of the industrial waste backdrop and provide a foreshadowing of the band's dreaded Endorama to come.\n\nAs far as atmosphere, the record is mixed extremely well, and despite the various tempos the tracks will move at, it all comes together to create a consistent experience, though unlikely to be memorable unless you're a diehard Kreator fan who followed the band through the peaks and valleys of their 90s output. I can draw some slight parallels here to other industrial/metal bands of that decade, a little Pitch Shifter, a little Thought Industry, but mostly to sewer thrashers Prong. Outcast is not heavy on electronics, they are used for sheer atmosphere. Also of note is that Kreator had recruited Tommy Vetterli (aka Tommy T. Baron of Coroner, another band to experiment with a cold industrial edge in the 90s), but I would consider him wasted here. His playing is fine, but being condemned to such simple song structures must have felt like Hell to one so talented. Or maybe not... The drums thunder, and Mille sounds quite good using these simpler patterns of lyrics and repetition.\n\nOutcast is not a failure, far from it. It's an interesting change for the band which brings forward a few of the ideas initiated with Renewal. I like this album far more than its predecessor Cause for Conflict, or the following Endorama; just don't approach it with the thought you're going to hear Extreme Aggression or Coma of Souls' wall of manic, incredible riffing thrash.\n\nHighlights: Phobia, Forever, Enemy Unseen, Whatever It May Take\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nFor their 12th full length album, Kreator have not only accumulated their best material in nearly two decades, but have also set the standard early for thrash metal in the year to come. Hordes of Chaos is a phenomenal new effort, combining elements from several phases of their career into a punishing, unified whole. I've only had a few days to listen to this and I can already say with certainty: it's better than anything they've released since Coma of Souls. Enemy of God might have been a nice fluff up, but this album is the money shot. What's more, it has a few features which mark a positive evolution for Kreator, namely the perkier melodies in a few of the tracks.\n\nAn example of this opens the title track and the album; an infectious, uplifting riff which transforms into 100% pure, Teutonic thrashing mayhem. \"Warcurse\" begins with some beaten toms and a tech thrash and then evolves into something you might hear on Coma of Souls or Extreme Aggression. \"Escalation\" is a mid-paced, catchy track with a great, pissed off Mille chorus. \"Amok Run\" actually begins with acoustics and a few lines of gothic style clean vocals, but wait...before you think you're in for Endorama 2.0, it erupts into amazing thrash. \"Destroy What Destroys You\" and \"Radical Resistance\" rage just like their glory days of the late 80s. \"Absolute Misanthropy\" begins with some adventurous riffing, then follows suit. \"To the Afterborn\" has some great melodic riffing, and it's a nice prep for the final track. After the mellow guitar/bass instrumental \"Corpses of Liberty\", you are treated to \"Demon Prince\", which begins with an amazing melodic twin lead which is far more reminiscent of melodic power metal than what you're normally accustomed to from these mad Germans. The distraction doesn't last long, as the thrash returns quite quickly and it's perhaps one of the best tunes on the disc.\n\nHordes of Chaos is both organic and exciting. The mix is superb and gives the songs a vibrant, live feeling. Ventor's drumming is the finest it's ever been, and the rest of the band makes their speed and level of riffing efficiency seem positively simple. This is a more melodic Kreator, to be sure, but it works here far better than on Endorama or Violent Revolution. This is a testament to the fact that thrash metal is still very much alive, and can sound new and refreshing yet retain all of its historical energy and nostalgia. For Miland Petrozza and crew, it's a major notch in the bullet belt. \n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nThe mixed blessing of a new Kreator album arrived at our offices (yeh right) recently, eventually finding its way to me. You may be wondering why I didn't grab it with both hands as after all I am the 'Thrash maniac' on the forums, but the sad truth is that recent Kreator has bored me. The majority of \"Violent Revolution\" (2001) and the entirety of Enemy Of God (2005) had the misfortune of being good records, but mostly uninteresting and revisionist in nature. In recent years Kreator have sounded a little tired in the generation of the classic riffs of yore, with crucially, given how pissed off the band has always intended to sound, the anger coming across more contrived than I would like it to be. I s'pose like Slayer, Metallica and others have proven, thrashing in your 40's like you're 22 again is difficult enough; having the same issues with the world as you did back then is an entirely different proposition.\n\nAs much of my recent dissatisfaction with Kreator has been down to their sound and production as the songs themselves. Whereas old classics benefitted from the sound of Endless Pain and some Extreme Aggression, not to mention a very real Pleasure to Kill, 21st century Kreator lacks the cutting edge of these behemoths despite the extra muscle afforded with more advanced recording techniques. While \"Hordes Of Chaos\" was billed was as being a return to a more organic sound, I for one struggle to hear much discernible difference from the glossy Andy Sneap-produced era they have only just left. The element of Scandinavian melody that has grown to be key to the Kreator sound today has resulted in the majority of songs sounding broadly similar, and disastrously, a struggle to remember at the album's conclusion. Show me a \"Ripping Corpse\" or \"Under The Guillotine\" on \"Hordes Of Chaos\" and I'll show you my pet leprechaun.\n\nThankfully grandaddy of thrash (he's earned by that title by now right?) Mille Petrozza still sounds startlingly unique - don't ask me how for he's never been a Warrel Dane (Nevermore) or Blitz Ellsworth (Overkill). As soon as he opens his mouth you know who you're listening to, which is reassuring given how much of a snarl he has always employed. Given previously made comments picking stand-out tracks is difficult for I find it difficult to pick out unique moments from this palette, though \"To The Afterborn\" boasts the catchiest chorus of the lot with also a more relaxed pace. \"Destroy What Destroys You\" and \"Radical Resistance\" are reminiscent of the album at large, set at speedy tempos featuring blistering solos and feral choruses that will of course be entertaining live but they aren't going to do much to ensure \"Hordes Of Chaos\" replaces \"Pleasure to Kill\" as my no. 1 Kreator album. By no means bad, but an album for fans of modern sounding thrash over those passionate for the brutality of our beloved 80's classics. \n\nOriginally written for Rockfreaks.net\n",
        "\nRead the name \"Kreator\" and the title \"Pleasure to Kill,\" and take a look at the album cover. This should give you some ideas about what this is album is like: cruel, brutal, evil, bloody, primitive, grim, devastating, destructive, ... These are accurate descriptions. Sharp, slashing riffs, rapidly pounding drumming, relentlessly dissonant guitar solos, and the alternation between the poisoned-dagger-throwing vocals of Mille Petrozza and the blunt strikes of Jurgen Ventor come together and form a destructive force, somewhat of a sonic equivalent of that red monster on the album cover \u2013 this is auditory punishment. This much will be obvious as soon as the first minute of Ripping Corpse is over. However, there is more to the violence of Pleasure to Kill than mere brutality. The carpet bombing is certainly there, but there is also the surgical precision and high-technology torture devices calculated to inflict the maximum amount of pain. Behind the blades and fists, Pleasure to Kill awaits with an intelligently designed labyrinth of riffs.\n\nThis certainly was one of the most brutal albums when it came out, but pure brutal extremity is not the most important aspect of Pleasure to Kill. While this is no longer the most brutal album in the world, it is perhaps still the cruelest album ever recorded. Although not as light or agile as a band like Megadeth for sure, Kreator here is closer to a spear impaling with its sharp point than a giant tank trampling everything. Certainly, there are elements of tank-like heaviness: Ventor is more blunt than sharp, both in the percussive and vocal departments, with the drumming resounding on the bass territory rather than piercing through the treble, and some of the riffs (e.g. the break riff of the title track) rely on typical thrash down-picking. There is even employed a technique of one guitar striking a chord repeatedly with the drums pounding in unison while the other guitar plays the riff, which provides immense rhythmic compulsion, similar to something that would later be heard in death metal (see the intro of Ripping Corpse and the middle break of Death is Your Saviour). The spear-like qualities, though, triumph overall, with various elements contributing to this. First of all, Mille Petrozza's vocals are very forward thrusting rather than deeply resonating, ready to jump out of the music and pierce the ears of the listener. While he retained the sharpness on later releases like Coma of Souls, it is only on Pleasure to Kill (and Endless Pain) that he really spews out venom and blood, giving the impression of daggers, each made out of a viper's fang, flying out in rows like the those of a shark's teeth rather than the strike of a polished sword forged in an expensive blacksmith. Also, the production slightly favors the treble, with pronounced guitars (the bass guitar is audible, but rarely go beyond that), and a significant number of riffs are high-pitched compared to most other thrash riffs. Another factor is the scarcity of down picking. Most of the riffs employ alternate picking, with even the breakdown riffs not necessarily being based on down picking (hence the effect that a breakdown on this album is often not as distinguishable from the rest of the song as a breakdown on most other thrash albums, though this also owes its debt to the long length of middle sections), and there are a lot of tremolo-picked riffs as well, emphasizing the feeling of minute slicing, not heavy crushing. But there is one more: the melody. \n\nOf course, \"melody\" here does not refer to the beautiful or saccharine incarnation of it, but its angular, Slayeristic, aggressive form. While this type of melody is present in most riffs in a dissolved form, there are also many riffs that put special emphasis on it (examples are very numerous, but for the most obvious one, see Riot of Violence). The difference with Slayer include that fact that Kreator's melodic riffs feel more distinct, or separated from the more normal thrash riffs, but fundamentally the difference is that they express different things. While Slayer's riffs express such things as the depths of hell and demonic malice, Kreator's riffs represent violence as an abstract concept. The difference may have been accentuated by the fact the guitar tone here is prominent and thrusting, unlike the obscured and dark tone of Hell Awaits, but there is also some difference on a compositional level, namely that the Kreator riffs tend to be a little more dissonant in general (this would be supported by the fact that the heavily chromatic riffs in Angel of Death sound Kreator-like compared to other Slayer riffs). These riffs are distinct from the normal thrash riffs in that those are closer to the physical embodiment of violence while these are more like a platonic idea of violence. These riffs add a layer of psychological torment to the already existing physical violence and bring about a permeation of hemorrhagic stench in the atmosphere. In addition to these, the usage of melody also shines through in the tremolo riffs that rip with chainsaws (see the middle part of Ripping Corpse) and proto-death metallic riffs that emphasize sudden melodic changes within high velocity (e.g. the riff right before the final refrain of Death is Your Saviour). \n\nThe compositional prowess of Pleasure to Kill is also apparent in the structural aspect. Generally there are three choruses with two or three verses, but the intros, bridges, and outros surrounding those verses and choruses are very long and often take the major role in the development of the songs. The middle section, starting after the second chorus, is especially a very long series of riffs with several guitar solos, and always much more than just a thrash break and a guitar solo as is typical in an average thrash song, except for the title track (and Flag of Hate if the bonus tracks are counted). Hence, instead of being repetitive, the songs actually progress. The riff arrangement is sensible, with quite a many of them, usually the more melodic ones, appearing again in a different key, and occasionally there is a transitional phrase that bridges different sections smoothly \u2013 sometimes they are just several power chords, such as the phrase right before the guitar solo in Flag of Hate, but at other times they consist of a more elaborate melody, with the transition in the slower section of Under the Guillotine being perhaps the best example. There is also some development of the riffs; the title track's main riff and The Pestilence's riff in the slower middle section appear in modified forms near the end of each song. The album is also structured well. The songs, while retaining a consistent atmosphere, are varied in their constructions, from the more straightforwardly thrashing title track to the comparatively slow Riot of Violence with an elaborate verse-chorus cycle to the death metallic tremolo riff usage of Death is Your Saviour to the extremely non-repetitive structure of Carrion (one riff reappears at the end, but otherwise there is no real repetition), and the alternation of vocal duties between Petrozza and Ventor strengthens the sense of variation. While Pleasure to Kill is certainly bloody violent for the majority of its duration, there are numerous occasions on which it feels almost blatantly epic (by thrash metal standards), though this quality is obviously based on the riffs and atmosphere and not synthesized strings, choir, or anthemic singing; examples include the part with narrated vocals in Riot of Violence, which is arrived at only after passing through a tunnel of riffs, the intro of The Pestilence with complementary drumming, the second half of Under of Guillotine, and last but not least, the songs Take Their Lives and Awakening of the Gods. In fact, there is an overall tendency throughout the album of becoming more epic as it progresses, especially if the bonus tracks are taken into account \u2013 and they should, since the bonus tracks (which are all from the Flag of Hate EP) have production and instrumental and vocal timbre nearly identical to that of the original album, and the structure of the album is not only preserved but also greatly enhanced with the inclusion of those tracks. There are, however, exceptions to this trend \u2013 the grandeur of The Pestilence is not topped until the second half of Under the Guillotine, and the straightforward thrasher Flag of Hate is placed between Under the Guillotine and Take Their Lives, for examples \u2013, making it less predictable and keeping it fresh until the end. The album could have closed itself with Under the Guillotine, which, contrary to its obsessive insistence on the slashing main riff during the first two minutes, becomes seriously epic and glorious like a blood red sunrise announcing the dawn of execution with two urgent riffs followed by an upbeat guitar solo (one of the two upbeat moments on the entire album, with the other being a part from Carrion) and a slower section of two riffs, with the more heavy and dissonant riff preceding the more relaxed and consonantly resolving riff. However, the ending with the two epics Take Their Lives and Awakening of the Gods is simply perfect. Take Their Lives sounds rather typical of this album, but after a series of riffs it reaches what is likely the single most epic moment in thrash metal: a cry of \"take their lives!\" coming in with a melody of heroic and grim resolution, followed by a harmonization by the second guitar, a release of tension with a different riff, and the return of the first melody with a different harmonization. Awakening of the Gods does live up to this high standard set by Take Their Lives: it has a very \"Chthulu\" atmosphere consistently maintained throughout the song, and feels almost like Metallica's The Call of Ktulu, except that this is still very aggressive and thrashing, though slightly less so than other songs on this album.\n\nWhile it is certainly a masterpiece, Pleasure to Kill is not perfect. There is a minor problem that not all transitions are ideal (e.g. the transition from the slower section to the last pre-chorus in The Pestilence does not seem to have been given much compositional attention), but most of the problems are related to the soloing. The guitar solos are basically dissonant aggression all the way, and while none of them are really distinctive or memorable (except the two solos of Awakening of the Gods, which not only greatly contribute to the atmosphere through their hellish, almost Morbid-Angelic nature, but are also rather enjoyable pieces of music themselves), they do fit in with the rest of the music quite ideally (certainly, an Agents of Brutality solo would ruin the album). The real problem is that the under-solo riffs are in many cases, though not usually, filler material, and that the solos are too numerous; it certainly does not mean that the solos are annoying at all, but the album could have benefited from supplanting some of the solos with more focused riffing. Nonetheless, Pleasure to Kill was one of the most developed albums of its time, with the melodic employment and structural development almost bordering on death metal. This may be described accurately as proto-death metal, but it is not merely an anticipatory release whose value mainly rests on historical interest. While its brutal side, often praised rightfully, warrants a high regard by itself, this is a true classic that offers much more on a closer listen.\n",
        "\nTo even fathom reviewing 'Hordes of Chaos' fairly, I have to play a little game in which I pretend that this is Kreator's first album ever. That is the only way that this review will end up with more than \"This is sucks because it's not 'Pleasure to Kill'\" copy-pasted for about 50 page lengths. Don't let this instil you with false hope however because even in the context of the present, 'Hordes of Chaos' is an atrocious album regardless of the band who happened upon those instruments and managed to produce the sequence of notes, beats and vocals I've been subjected to.\n\nI'm not going to use the \"s word\" because frankly, the sound present on 'Hordes of Chaos' is simply an further devolution of that which was present on 'Enemy of God'; an album which was yet more proof that 80's thrash band come backs are the physical equivalent of receiving a cleveland steamer from a sweaty, overweight bloke who just came back from twelve hours at an all-you-can-eat mexican buffet.\n\nFor all intents and purposes 'Hordes of Chaos' is basically a melodic death metal album that flirts with modern influences. Despite my frequent dismissal of melodic death metal, it is not a completely disposable genre; though certainly not from a lack of trying. Unfortunately Kreator can be lumped in with the majority of bands who have gleefully driven the genre so forcefully into the ground they've made it to China twice. Kreator haven't crossed over into the cock-swilling keyboard-ery of Dark Tranquillity and similar gothenburg contemporaries but basically write a whole bunch of fast, pseudo-thrash riffs \u00e0 la Blood Tsunami, 'Virus'-era Hypocrisy and mid-era In Flames. The main riff to \"Destroy What Destroys You\" is probably the only one I remember if by virtue of being the slowest and the only riff that didn't remind me of the aforementioned bands; it's still awful though.\n\nBecause variation is the instant ticket to awesome song writing Kreator will throw in a pretty melody line or guitar harmony somewhere in their songs; usually in the chorus or as a bridge. This happens in every song without fail and is about as impressive as my most recent bowel movement; they're all fairly average, inoffensive and are particularly reminiscent of Darkest Hour and similar bands that forever smudge the chalk line between melodic death metal and metalcore with their converse sneakers. Although \"To the After Burn\" is the biggest offender in this field with at least half the song being composed of melodies that were cut from 'Whoracle' for being too insipid and effeminate.\n\nNow as it stands from the descriptions thus far, 'Hordes of Chaos' doesn't sound completely awful; pedestrian and uninspired surely but not worthy of complete scorn and having Mille cursed to an eternity of damnation working in Pauline Hanson's fish and chip shop. Listening to generic riff after generic riff is bearable if not boring but Kreator are like a small child forced to sit through a three-hour lecture on the importance of statistical mechanics in the field of advanced prediction of fluid properties and thus they fidget excessively, throwing in stupid ideas that are head-shakingly pathetic and loathsome. In the previous paragraph I can name at one stand out track that exemplifies the problems exhibited by this album but choosing the worst section is truly an impossible task; I may as well try and decide whether I'd rather be fucked by an alligator or a crocodile. \"Amok Run\" is quite notorious, managing to not only to have a boring, acoustic opening with Mille doing clean-ish vocals but also for having an awful transition from a fast riff into similar slow, clean section with a half-assed melodic solo that wouldn't sound out of place on 'Ascendancy'. \"Absolute Misanthropy\" takes second place for the worst song title on the album (first place being \"Amok Run\") but also has Mille semi-whispering over a breakdown in a fashion not unlike Dolving on 'The Dead Eye'.\n\nActually all the breakdowns on 'Hordes of Chaos' are cringe-inducingly awful and while they never descend into a Parkway Drive style chug (although the title track comes disturbingly close at moments) they usually throw in some superfluous elements in a sad attempt to hide the fact that the song writing department is phoning it in, like typing a bunch of cats together and saying it's a cow. \"Radical Resistance\" is a great example with some atrociously repetitive lead work over the top or the flood of double kicks obscuring the breakdown like in \"Warcurse\".\n\nDespite trying to avoid thinking about Kreator's past, it's inevitable that I'd give up at some point in this review and face the fact that they once wrote some excellent thrash metal albums back in the 80's. Now it's unfair to tell Kreator to make 'Pleasure to Kill' or 'Coma of Souls' five billion times over (not that this would be a bad thing mind you) and that a band expanding their style can be a rewarding experience and more importantly can prove that they have song writing talents that extend far beyond what the listener previously thought they were capable of. However this does not mean that Kreator can go about writing utter fucking pig swill like 'Hordes of Chaos' and expect accolades because they're simply doing something different from what they previously had done. 'Hordes of Chaos' is not innovative nor is it an evolution of their sound; it is the death rattle of a band who is desperately clawing at any genre that is popular in the current metal scene and hastily stitching together whatever chunks they've managed to obtain in a vain attempt to keep afloat and stay relevant.\n\nTo be apt; 'Hordes of Chaos' is the musical equivalent of dick/ovarian (choose where applicable) cancer. Destroy on sight.\n",
        "\nPleasure to Kill is (for me) THE benchmark for the classic 80s style of thrash - it encompasses all the right ingredients of the German thrash sound with a a hint of Venom and adds the instantly recognisable Kreator \"touch\".\n\nPleasure to Kill is not sophisticated. It's not been overproduced. It's simply 57 minutes of pure, uncensored, raw, visceral and (most of all) UGLY thrash metal. It has a very obvious violent and slightly unsettling feel to it (shown by the lyrical content and the often brash and \"extreme\" nature of the drumming). To start with, the album opens with \"Choir of the Damned\", a very solemn and trance-like guitar-based instrumental, which provides a massive contrast when the album finally bursts open with the head-smashing \"Ripping Corpse\", undoubtedly one of Kreator's most \"definable\" songs, showing what the band is all about in 3 and a half minutes - low, detuned tremolo-picked guitars, blasted drum beats, wailing (and often quite sloppy, actually) guitar solos and of course, Petrozza's thick, raspy vocals. \n\nEssentially, that's the formula that most of the album follows - be it with a few changes, like Jurgen Reil's vocals on tracks like \"Death is the Saviour\", or some slightly slower passages on tracks like \"Riot of Violence\". Despite this, each track maintains its own little personality and \"unique-ness\" to it - whether it's the strange-sounding drum intro to \"The Pestilence\" (which sounds like it's being played on a Xylophone) to the simply unforgettable chorus to \"Ripping Corpse\", which will undoubtedly go down as one of the most iconic choruses ever.\n\nIf I have any criticisms, it's mostly with the solos, which sound very sloppy and quite cringe-inducing - they easily ruin a very, very good song by making it seem like, when the solo came, they simply handed the guitar over to a 10-year-old (or perhaps Herman Li?). I could go so far as calling them lame and rather shite.\n\nBut ultimately, what Kreator has achieved on Pleasure to Kill is simply remarkable - they've taken primitive German thrash metal, added their own personal touch and at the same kept true to its roots, and to top it all off, made every track more memorable as the last. It's far from perfect, but few albums are, and Pleasure to Kill is a historic turning point in the development of metal as a genre - highly recommended!\n",
        "\nWhereas PLEASURE TO KILL is Kreator's wicked sick thrashing death metal explosion of rage, TERRIBLE CERTAINTY is their sharp as steel, honed to perfection exercise in precision aggression. The sloppy, willfully chaotic aspects of PTK are swept aside in favor of one of the tightest yet most full barreled thrash metal assualts ever laid down. And as with other classic albums, the song writing keeps pace with the savagery, the album being a nearly flawless run of memorably destructive music. \"Behind The Mirror,\" \"Blind Faith,\" \"As The World Burns\" and \"Storming With Menace\" are perhaps the top of the heap, quality wise, but the entirety of the album is assured. The production, which captures every riff, every beat in sterling form. But the real achievement here is how Kreator have moved from a bunch of kids making the most ripping metal in their power, to a band writing some of the genre's most intense and flat our best music ever. Mille Petrozza morphed from a denim and leather demon to a confident frontman, sounding assured in the fact that his band was whipping a doozy of an album on the world, and the remainder of the band easily keep pace with him. \n\nIf you own this album, Holy Terror's MIND WARS and Dark Angel's DARKNESS DESCENDS, you can be assured that you are hearing thrash metal at it's best. It wouldn't hurt to also grab key releases by Whiplash, Sacrifice and Razor, but if you only want to hear the absolute best, TERRIBLE CERTAINTY is a must have.\n",
        "\nCertainly not. Not in this case, at least. The new Kreator album is more melodic than Enemy of God, but also heavier. It\u2019s less than 40 minutes long, which shows pretty clearly it\u2019s very straightforward. And it is \u2013 except for a few short moments it\u2019s heavy, fast, powerful thrash with some melodic influences from the beginning to the end.\n\nJust like Enemy of God, it starts from the title song, and after a melodic beginning, there is no doubt: it\u2019s Kreator. Strong and relentless, with some melodic parts here and there, we reach the chorus, and basically at this point we can already say a lot about the album. First of all, it\u2019s the production, which is one of the best I\u2019ve ever heard. It sounds raw and modern at the same time, it\u2019s very easy to distinguish the instruments (ok, the bass could be a bit more audible) and you can hear it\u2019s a new album, but it really emphasizes that it was meant to be heavy, even heavier than Enemy of God. I\u2019ve also mentioned the chorus \u2013 it\u2019s often on Hordes of Chaos that the chorus is quite simple (usually one sentence) and repeated several times. It might be annoying - normally I hate if something is repetitive, but in this case it\u2019s not a problem to me for some reason, and there\u2019s a good side of that \u2013 they\u2019re really catchy and very memorable.\n\n\u2026but OK, we\u2019re just through the first minute of the album, and there\u2019s over 38. Nine songs (+ one interlude, Corpses of Liberty). What has also improved since Enemy of God is that the album is less repetitive \u2013 there, from time to time I had an impression that I\u2019ve heard this before on the album \u2013 not often, but it happened. Here it doesn\u2019t, the album as a whole is very consistent, but each song is different in a way - also in the way it\u2019s built, usually something more than verse-chorus-verse-chorus-solo-chorus. The style is also varied, from really heavy, powerful thrashers (Warcurse), through extremely fast and absolutely insane songs (Escalation) to something a bit lighter (To the Afterborn). And if we\u2019re talking about variety \u2013 Amok Run is probably the weirdest song on the album, starting with acoustic guitar and clean vocals (!), reminding a bit of Voices of the Dead, and then slowly passing into something even more insane than Escalation, with certainly the catchiest chorus on the whole album - I\u2019m wondering how Mille can catch his breath singing this song, since there are almost no pauses at all. (It\u2019s probably been meant to work awesome live \u2013 and well, I had the luck to find out it does. Actually, the album as a whole has that feeling they were thinking a lot \u201chow would that sound live?\u201d, and the production adds to that.) Amok Run certainly stands out on the album, but my absolute favourite is something else \u2013 the closing track, Demon Prince. It\u2019s probably the most melodic on the whole album, but also the most complex, most varied and simply awesome. I think it\u2019s also the best written song on the album, every part is long enough to be memorable, but also short enough not to get boring (also, the first solo and the way it passes into the chorus\u2026 pure art). Another two highlights are Warcurse, which is probably the heaviest song on the album, and Escalation \u2013 like I\u2019ve mentioned, really fast and relentless. Probably the only weaker points of the album are songs 7 and 8 \u2013 Absolute Misanthropy and To the Afterborn. They\u2019re good, but there are some things I don\u2019t like about them. In the first case, it\u2019s a bit repetitive, in the second \u2013 a bit too long chorus and a few parts which aren\u2019t very interesting. However, those are not serious weaknesses.\n\nWith all the good things about this album, there\u2019s something that shines the most. It\u2019s the guitars, both the riffs and the solos. It sounds just like it should, heavy riffs are really heavy (the production helps, again) but they\u2019re not playing the-same-riff-for-two-minutes, the feeling of boredom is what you\u2019ll never experience on this album. And the solos are truly awesome and great pleasure to listen to (the solos on the title song and Demon Prince are probably my favourites). Like I mentioned, the album as a whole is also more melodic \u2013 especially the solos, but it fits the album very well and doesn\u2019t feel out of place in any way. The drums are also great and complex (the song where they shine the most is Escalation). Unfortunately, I can\u2019t say much about the bass \u2013 it\u2019s the only weakness of the production that it\u2019s not that easy to hear, but what I could hear sounds very good. However, I haven\u2019t said anything about the vocals yet, and they\u2019re really good. It really sounds like he\u2019s angry and not just screaming to sound dark and evil. Mille\u2019s vocals have always been great, but from all Kreator albums I\u2019ve heard, here they\u2019re definitely the best, sounding mature but very powerful at the same time.\n\nTo put it all together \u2013 Hordes of Chaos is a powerful, melodic and straightforward album, with a lot of memorable parts and great production. It can be heard they\u2019re a very experienced band that still has a lot of ideas, creativity and strength. If you liked Enemy of God together with the melodic parts \u2013 you\u2019ll probably love this one. If you disliked it, but love the old albums \u2013 have a look at Hordes of Chaos, it\u2019s rawer and more aggressive. In my opinion, this album has few and not very important weaknesses, and has reminded me that Kreator is the band which recorded Enemy of God \u2013 an excellent band.\n",
        "\nNow, that\u2019s how a band reaches the top. I\u2019m not talking about albums sold, popularity or anything like that, but quality and the impact the music can cause on a fan of the genre. Anyone that likes thrash should listen to this one. I hope I make myself clear why they should with this review. \n\nComa of Souls is their best album and it is on the top five best thrash albums ever. There are no flaws here. The band has grown on a musical level that very few bands can compete. \n\nFirst notable thing here is that riffs are better than ever and there\u2019s a strong use of melody, which makes this album very diverse. Second thing you should note is Mille. He has improved his voice and vocal melodies. Some of his most memorable choruses are here (\u2018Coma of Souls\u2019, \u2018When the Sun Burns Red\u2019).\n\nLyrically with have a winner. There are no more problems with grammar or childish lyrics that you would find on the first two albums. Compared to the previous two (\u201dTerrible Certainty\u201d and \u201cExtreme Aggressions\u201d) it is also better. Check out \u2018People of the Lie\u2019 for a strong use of lyrics. \n\nBass is not really the highlight here, but in \u2018Hidden Dictator\u2019 it assumes a far more important play. On other songs it just fits perfectly to the music. Drums are far more audible. Ventor gives us an impeccable performance and even better than on \u201cExtreme Aggressions\u201d. \n\nSongs structures are also very good. For example, \u2018World Beyond\u2019 and \u2018Twisted Urges\u2019 are short songs, which is important because they are very fast speed/thrash assault and would get boring with four or five minutes. \u2018When the Sun Burns Red\u2019, \u2018Terror Zone\u2019 and \u2018Mental Slavery\u2019, on the other hand, are bigger but much more developed. \n\nThen there\u2019s another great thing: soloing. Very few thrash bands have come up with albums that had so great solos. This is an exception. \n\nBest songs? All of them. It really just depends on your taste. If you\u2019re into straightforward thrash \u2018bang your head against the stage\u2019, you should be pleased with a couple of songs here. If you\u2019re into more developed thrash with some cool melodies, you would like too. If you\u2019re into both (like me), then you realize this is something special. That simple.\n",
        "\nI have to confess that my pulse quickened slightly when I read that Kreator would be recording 'Hordes of chaos' in lo-fi fashion, with the basic tracks all being taken from the band performing the songs live in the studio. The 38-minute running time had me even more intrigued \u2013 could Mille Petrozza - the anti-Hansen himself - and his associates really be casting aside the politician-sleek production style of their last 2 CDs in favour of a raw, 'Pleasure to kill' style rifforama? \n\nThe logical (read: cynical) part of my brain quickly piped up with \"no, idiot\" and was of course proved correct. But while 'Hordes of chaos' is sonically in the same vein as the preceding post-millennium Kreator CDs, in terms of spirit and concise bluntness it is as close as they are likely come to recapturing the snarling aggression of their glory era before the wilderness years of the 90s. \n\nThe final product doesn't sound drastically different to its predecessor 'Enemy of God', (though thankfully Ventor's drums no longer sound like an adding machine) so we're still not dealing with a full thrash CD here, but the songs are a far leaner bunch that generally keep a much firmer grip on the attention. \"Warcurse\" is among the thrashiest Kreator songs in years, with a wicked main riff and no pause for breath as it hurtles from beginning to end via a terrific chorus. \n\nMelodic guitar playing (described as Gothenburg-influenced by some, which the band flatly deny) remains a key feature of the new Kreator sound, though in general they use it in a more tasteful fashion than they have been doing in recent times. For example, \"Amok run\" opens in a similar fashion to \"Voices of the dead\" from 'Enemy of God', with a rare bit of clean singing from Petrozza over some gentle strumming before the song properly kicks in, but there is no overly-sugary chorus melody this time around as the song proves to be one of the best on the CD. This embracing of melody, for all the flak draws, also allows Petrozza and the flying Finn Sami Yli-Sirnio to really show off their talent as lead guitarists, with some really excellent solos and harmonies scattered all over the place. \n\nDespite the overall improvement though, there are still a few misfires and points of contention \u2013 \"To the afterborn\" just doesn't get going after a promising start, and the chorus strays just too far into fully melodic territory, while \"Absolute misanthropy\" just feels uninspired and is hampered by some juvenile lyrics. The CD also suffers from too many songs having a chorus that consists of a short phrase \u2013 usually the title \u2013 being barked repeatedly, and the formula becomes quite grating after it becomes so apparent. At the same time Petrozza's shouted vocals occasionally just don't mesh properly with the softer parts of the songs, and feel somewhat out of place compared to how they used to fit like a glove on the less polished early material. \n\nAfter complimenting 'Hordes of chaos' for stripping things down a bit and providing a bunch of shorter, more direct songs, I'll now have to contradict myself and say that the best of the bunch are the opening and closing tracks, the only 2 that get past 5 minutes in length. The opening title track doesn't sacrifice aggression despite its vaguely complex structure, while the closing \"Demon prince\" makes use of an epic, NWOBHM-style lead part in its intro before leaping into a real ripping thrash tune, complete with the only skittering, atonal solo on the CD. \n\nIt is definitely not perfect, and definitely not a pure thrash CD, but 'Hordes of chaos' represents the new Kreator style in its best incarnation to date. No doubt it will receive just as much over-the-top praise and unjustified scorn as 'Enemy of God,' but for my money it is a definite improvement, and a CD that fans of melodic thrash ought to give the time of day to. Going in expecting a bruising piece of 80s aggression will only end in disappointment, but taken on its own terms 'Hordes of chaos' has plenty to offer those prepared to give it a shot. \n\n(Originally written for http://www.metalcdratings.com/)\n",
        "\nKreator were a thrash band once and have become one again for three albums in a row now. I especially liked Violent Revolution because of the quality but even more the surprise to hear them returning to their roots. Yet there was something about Enemy Of God which made that album decent instead of good. When finally hearing \u2018Hordes of Chaos\u2019 it\u2019s now clear what I actually didn\u2019t like about EOG. The sterile production! And of course non-thrash metal songs like \u2018Dystopia\u2019.\n\nEOG, despite having a handful of great tunes (Suicide Terrorist ruled!), was just a bit too modern for me. Not as much as those modern 21st century pedantic over-produced Exodus records or Testament\u2019s attempts at becoming more melodic and including death metal ideas at the same time (fail!). And I\u2019m not stating I never like \u2018modern\u2019 things. I\u2019m just having difficulties with icons from my youth throwing overboard what made them famous in the first place. Kreator however have more credit than your average US band. Don\u2019t ask me why\u2026 The benefit of the doubt. Never liked Outcast though and Endorama was cute but nothing special.\n\nAnyway, of the last three albums \u2018Hordes Of Chaos\u2019 is the most old-school one compositionally. And this time the production follows the music. It\u2019s not as ancient as Terrible Certainty but it does build a bridge between the polished sound of Coma Of Souls and the sharp, clear and dry approach of Extreme Aggression. And this mixture is exactly what the music needs.\n\nThe opening title track is a typical fast Kreator song but it\u2019s second song \u2018Warcurse\u2019 which is an even better thrasher. This is an instant classic and I do hope the band will play this song till their very last day! And let\u2019s not forget Kreator were one of the few ancient thrash metal bands who could also write good midpaced pounders (remember People Of The Lie and Some Pain Will Last?). This time it\u2019s \u2018Destroy What Destroys You\u2019 which shows their strength. The thrash metal beauty of closing song \u2018Demon Prince\u2019 even brings \u2018Fatal Energy\u2019 to mind. \n\nThere is something however about this album I must mention. At first listen I found it too predictable! I heard it and thought \u201cyeah, well, another typical Kreator album and you can almost predict each break and tempo change\u201d. But somehow it grew one me. Each time I listened to it. Until I knew the songs by heart. And by now I can\u2019t imagine my Kreator without it. So take your time with this one. It needs time to grow.\n\nI know I must be sounding like a fanboy but this is one of the few new albums from an old band which I actually like and play regularly. It\u2019s not another Terrible Certainty, Coma Of Souls nor even remotely close to the masterpiece \u2018Extreme Aggression\u2019 but it sure as hell is one of their best albums since Renewal!\n",
        "\nSon of a bitch. Well, my Gone Thrashin' series is now over, and I am stuck here staring down the barrel of a steaming load of festering, ugly bullshit called Hordes of Chaos. Yes, it is Kreator's new album, and I am sad to say that I don't like it much at all, especially after how good Enemy of God was. I'm no Kreator aficionado, so I won't make any comparisons to the rest of their work, but seriously, how the fuck do you go from Enemy of God to this? That album was everything a modern Thrash album should be, with heavy, crunchy and melodic guitar work and a clear sense of direction, accompanied by absolutely fantastic vocals from vocalist Mille Petroza, all layered over with a heavy dose of balls-out aggression. It wasn't any sort of modern classic, but when I heard about this, I was hoping the band would expand on it and make something even cooler.\n\nWell, they didn't do that. What is so bad about this album, exactly? Well, let me explain. Hordes of Chaos sounds like the music of a bunch of old men trying to desperately recapture the glory days of the 80s with modern equipment in a world that has moved away from that old sound.\n\nWhat? What do you mean that's what it is?\n\nOh, ahem. Well, then. I think the main problem with this is just as I said; it sounds like the band is trying too hard to recapture the old days of the 1980s, where they were a sloppy, primal band of heathens, hellions and maniacs out to bash everyone's skulls in with riffs. However, like the one-time headbangers that have grown up, put on suits and raised families, Kreator is not the same band that they were back then. Their influences have changed and their sound has changed, too, and what's the problem with that? Well, apparently there was some problem with that when Mille and co. were writing this album, because this reeks of a bad \"back to the roots\" attempt more than my kitchen reeked of peppermint muscle rubbing cream fifteen minutes ago.\n\nThe production is sort of hollow and tinny, very \"dirty\" sounding, and I'll eat my hat if that wasn't intentional. This isn't old school, you guys, this is just bad. It sounds more grimy and putrid than it does gritty and raw, which is the problem most bands have when they try to do this. The songwriting is sloppy, too, with little regard for the coherent and calculated evil that their last album exonerated in spades. The riffs are just sort of chucked out in this rapid, old school Thrash-esque way, except here it doesn't work like it did on Pleasure to Kill, because the band is trying too hard to sound angry. Back then it sounded natural, like they just sort of bashed it out when they were pissed, but here it's different. Here they are trying consciously to sound old school, forcing it down our throats and over-doing everything in an attempt to sound like they're bringing back that old sound. The old school Thrash bands didn't succeed by doing this, you guys! You know, just letting you in on this most sacred of secrets.\n\nIt was...more genuine back then. Not that I think the band is being dishonest now, but they are definitely trying to prove something here, and it gives Hordes of Chaos a very displeasing feel - Thrash is supposed to be headstrong and arrogant, in-your-face and aggressive. This sounds desperate and weak, especially when coupled with Mille Petroza's juvenile vocal delivery. He doesn't sound horrible, just sort of inoffensive, and the manic, strained way in which he's singing is not the method of a man who has been at the mic for twenty five years. No, this is the voice of a doe-eyed teen in his first \"heavy\" band, shouting at the top of his lungs and trying to get the listener's attention not by using subtlety and simple talents, but by over-emotiong to the point where you're just embarrassed for him. He's trying too hard. Just listen to that God-awful \"Everyone against everyone\" bit in the title track, or pretty much the entire duration of \"Radical Resistance\" (\"People from the EAST! People from the WEST!\"...shut up already!).\n\nIt's really a shame, because it isn't like the material here is flat out bad. Most of these tracks are pretty decent, just unmemorable and half-baked. They'd be kind of fun to headbang or mosh along to live, I imagine. Maybe that's all they were intended to do in the first place. But as I listen to this, I have a hard time really sympathizing with it. \"Warcurse\" has one of the shittiest main riffs I've ever heard out of a big Thrash band, and \"To the After Burn\" starts out great, but then the band decides they don't like being cool, and they throw in a bunch of fucking horrible mallcore-ish parts that I just can't stand. \"Destroy What Destroys You,\" \"Escalation,\" \"Absolute Misanthropy\"...these aren't bad songs, but they seriously just go in one ear and out the other, and that's not what a Thrash song should ever do. \"Demon Prince\" does rule, though, so they get some points for that.\n\nThe bottom line is, Hordes of Chaos takes what sounds like a good idea and fucks it up with mediocre songwriting and half-assed thrashing that doesn't work. My advice to Kreator is that they should get their heads out of their asses and start moving forward instead of backward. The 80s have been done for going on twenty years now, and while I will never get tired of the 80s Metal ideals of pride and rebellion and the good old leather and spikes and chains, I simply cannot condone such a sloppy and poorly written album of this sort of mushy, featureless, annoying gunk. Kreator don't have anything to prove, so what the fuck, guys? Where's the fire? Hordes of Chaos is weak, half-baked and even surprisingly boring, and you might as well just skip it.\n",
        "\nThis album would be their best if they hadn\u2019t released \u201cComa of Souls\u201d. Yes, \u201cPleasure to Kill\u201d and \u201cTerrible Certainty\u201d are quite as great and their last three albums for many people are as well. But let\u2019s face it; they almost reached perfection on this one. \n\n\u201cExtreme Aggression\u201d is the perfect title for this album. All songs are furious as hell and truly memorable (with some very few exceptions). Because of the great production and many melodic touches here and there, this album does not sound as the previous ones.\n\nRiffs here are incredible. Just listen to \u2018Extreme Aggression\u2019, \u2018No Reason to Exist\u2019, \u2018Betrayer\u2019 and many others. It is done in a way with so much passion and inspiration that clearly make this album one of the best thrash albums ever.\n\nMille sounds pretty much like in \u201cTerrible Certainty\u201d, but more refined. Still kinda raw, still evil. Lyrics are basically about \u2018being rebel and pessimist\u2019 and not so interesting as on other albums. Of course, they do not compromise the whole thing, and some people may even identify with them.\n\nWhat I like the most about this album is that you never feel anything is going downhill. The songs sound like Kreator is really enjoying what they are doing, so this is not an artificial experience. While some songs aren\u2019t as great as others on the album, they\u2019re at least decent. Plus, soloing is really strong and powerful, a good development considering their solos on Terrible Certainty. \n\nAnother aspect to be mentioned is the drums. Ventor is one of the best drummers in metal and he is more than decent. Pay attention to his performance on \u201cSome Pain Will Last\u201d or \u201cBetrayer\u201d, for example. \u201cBetrayer\u201d is probably their best song ever, because it has their entire proposal well worked and it is so freaking catchy. \n\nBass is not that listenable, since the obvious focus here is the guitars. However, Rob Fioretti really adds something special in \u2018Some Pain Will Last\u2019 and some other parts of the album. \n\nHighlights here are the already mentioned \u2018Betrayer\u2019, \u2018No Reason to Exist\u2019, \u2018Extreme Aggression\u2019, \u2018Fatal Energy\u2019, \u2018Stream of Consciousness\u2019 and \u2018Some Pain Will Last\u2019 - almost the entire album. \u2018Don\u2019t Trust\u2019, \u2018Love or Hate Us\u2019 and \u2018Bringer of Torture\u2019 are usually under appreciated by many fans, although I particularly like them very much. \n\n\u201cExtreme Aggression\u201d has one problem though. It doesn\u2019t really have much variation and in the beginning the riffs sound pretty much the same. Of course, after some listens, this problem is easily solved. Is nothing like the feel you get when you first listen to \u201cReign in the blood\u201d or \u201cTerrible Certainty\u201d, but it can still put you off. \n\nUnfortunately, they lost themselves after the other masterpiece \u201cComa of Souls\u201d, although doing a good job in some of the records after that. Yet, none of them can be compared to what \u201cExtreme Aggression\u201d, the previous ones and \u201cComa of Souls\u201d are. This I truly recommend for any thrash fans and also metal fans in general, if you don\u2019t mind Mille\u2019s vocals, which are unusual even for thrash metal.\n",
        "\nOK, now this is what *I'm* talking about. This is proper thrash metal for you right here. You can take your newbie happy go lucky Exodus worshipers and stick 'em, this is the real deal right here, right now. Mille and company have more than proven themselves in the past, and this is another fine effort on their part. They've made their share of missteps, which is to be expected in any band's career, and they've made up for them starting with \"Violent Revolution\" leading up to now. \"Hordes of Chaos\" is a fine slab of prime Teutonic thrash by one of that scene's progenitors showing that yes, indeed, they still have \"it\" and how.\n\nMille is in total rant and scream mode throughout most of the album, except for \"Amok Run\", where he shows off a rather good clean singing voice in a Goth vein in the beginning. His voice has deepened with age, so no more screeching like he did back in the day, which is a good thing in my mind and ears. His screaming is far more bearable these days for that reason. He also sounds really, truly pissed off throughout the album as well. His lyrics are still dealing with mostly political subject matter as well as some social commentary and the usual anti-social/misanthropic sentiments, and it's nice to see him sticking with more intelligent lyrical matter. Of course, his viewpoint is rather nihilistic, but with today's political climate, even with America's new President making attempts to actually do some good in the international arena, who can't be?\n\nThe band is in excellent form, also. Jurgen \"Ventor\" Reil is most improved here, by far, with his signature Neanderthal thunder thud drumming style refined with a finer sense of control and grace--a matter of degrees, mind you. Christian Geisler's bass is actually there in the mix and he anchors things well, even popping out now and again for all to hear like in the intro to \"Amok Run\". Sami of the long Finnish last name acquits himself well with his usual melodic and tasteful lead style starkly contrasting Mille's noisier old school whammy bar mauling. While the album's production is more raw than one would expect, everyone has a space in the mix and it has a good balance of polish and dirt. The guitar sound in particular benefits from this, with a pronounced old school vibe in that it has some dirt and aggression instead of sounding meticulous and perfect, and for Kreator this works to their advantage.\n\nSong wise, the aggression is there in spades. There is melody present and unabashedly so in the guitars, mostly in song intros like the title track, but that gets a nice brusque riff crashing the party and away we go! They're not too fast, either, the riffs (or the drumming), and while they're not as fast as some newer bands out there, the sense of irresistable forward motion is very present and really gets your heart pounding. People have been commenting lately about how many new school bands are so fast they seem slow, and this is not the case here. Even \"Amok Run\", which features a soft and melodic intro, is no ballad; it goes into a slow and heavy bit that leads into the high speed chorus with Mille ranting \"RUN! AMOK RUN!!!\" and we go back into thrashville. The band sounds energized and excited throughout this album and it helps a lot in the long run. \"Amok Run\", the title track, \"Absolute Misanthropy\"--where Mille really gets into it vocally and sounds like he really wants to hurt someone--and \"Destroy What Destroys You\" get top honors on this album from me. There are also lots of catchy scream-along choruses for us listeners to latch onto and it leads to a more memorable album in the long run.\n\nAltogether, this represents Kreator and Mille Petrozza showing that they are easily still able to show the new school thrash wannabes (are you listening, Merciless Death, Fueled By Fire, etc.?) where it's at. This band of veterans still has what it takes to show the kids what real thrash metal is, and I for one love it. It took a few listens to grow on me, but once it did, it owned me. Definitely a candidate for Top 10 of 2009 already!\n",
        "\nKreator's second album is one of those \"moments\" where everything a band does seemed to coalesce at the time into this huge, festering ball of inimitable quality. Much like other perceived \"classics,\" Pleasure to Kill was extremely influential, creating a new sound that would go on to be ripped off by countless bands, both new and old. Yes, many retro bands would rack their brains for good, brutal sounding band names before looking at the back of their Pleasure to Kill re-issued CDs, randomly pointing to one of the track titles with their eyes closed, and then calling up their buddies to tell them what a cool, original tribute to the Thrash greats they had come up with all by themselves. But this album isn't about that, it's about the music, where Kreator pushed forward this violent, gritty wall of noise that would come to be known as a classic of the underground, even despite the bewilderment of all the poor every-day folks who heard this and dismissed it as, well, a violent, gritty wall of noise.\n\nThis album basically took the standard Celtic Frost/Venom extremity and turned it up about ten notches to create something even more depraved. Every song on here just bashes away for three or four minutes at a time, doing nothing and aiming for nothing but to achieve the utmost expression of animalistic brutality capable while still retaining musical structure and coherent songwriting. These songs don't attempt to slow down or allow you to keep up; if you can't do it, you're fucking out, and that's all there is to it. No compromise, no fucking around, no bullshit. That's the amazing thing about this; other bands came close to doing this, but none of them quite reached this level of inhumanity before Kreator did with this one. Pure, natural brutality all the way to the core. It is not the best Thrash album or even the most influential, but Pleasure to Kill has made its bloody paw print on the Metal scene, and there it will stay.\n\nThere is something appealing about this unholy, ripping carnage. Perhaps it is the dark, sinister way in which the album unfolds with a somber, melodic orchestral piece, the ultimate contrast with the opening blast of \"Ripping Corpse.\" Metallica had already done this with Ride the Lightning, but Kreator's method was so much more unsettling and creepy, so much more effective in the grand scope of things. Perhaps it is the simple-minded way in which the elements clash: Mille Petroza's raspy grunting, the jack-hammering riffs, the galloping, primal drums and the strange, dirty sounding bass lines, all topped off with the sloppy, ear-piercing guitar solos to create a monster of a ferocity that the world had not yet seen.\n\nPerhaps it is the songs themselves, beautiful and yet also horrifying in their simplicity. This album is just full of great shit, from \"Ripping Corpse\" to the high-speed \"Death Is Your Savior,\" to the dark, pounding apocalypse of \"The Pestilence,\" with its catchy, classic Metal-inspired riff, to the full-on aggression that is \"Carrion,\" to the catchy \"Command of the Blade,\" and every other song that I didn't mention, too. They're all ready to Thrash your face off, and they won't have even one regret doing so. Everything here is so sloppily constructed, and yet it is not unappealing at all, once you have a grasp on why this kind of thing is so appealing - that is not really something anyone can teach you, it just sort of happens, like a bolt out of a blue sky. One day, you might just wake up to find out that you like Kreator's Pleasure to Kill, and with it, Celtic Frost's early material, and Venom's, and Morbid Saint's. That is the power of Heavy Metal.\n\nWhatever it might be that makes this album so wonderful, Kreator's Pleasure to Kill is a certifiable Thrashterpiece and even a bona fide Metal classic on a broader scale. Booming with great riffs and enough simplistic, bashing insanity to put you in the madhouse where you probably belong, this album rocks, and if you haven't heard it, you definitely need to.\n\nOriginally written for http://www.metalcrypt.com\n",
        "\nEveryone's always talking of the Pleasure to Kill album, or the Endless Pain. Personally I think they're fucking wrong. Those two were incredibly great thrash releases, but like every other release, they have to bow down towards this champion of thrash. Everything that thrash stands for is used, and perfected in this album.\n\nAlthough I don't like to combine music with math, I have to say that each song on here has more riffs than a Killswitch Engage (or Metallica if anything) album ever had. Some are lighting fast, looking more like the riffs Endless Pain had while some are somewhat slower, like Outcast (with the difference that Coma of Soul's riffs are actually fucking awesome and brutal as hell). The difference in speed is just the diversity this album needs, and it works very well.\n\nThere is this gem called People of the Lie, which is quite slow compared to the usual thrash songs. It's still very headbangeable, and destroying your house still works fine with this song. Terror Zone and Mental Slavery are the other slow-paced tracks. That means that the other 7 are fast, and fast they fucking are. There are still slower breakdowns and bridges in those songs, but generally the songs feel like a riot gun sticked in your heart with the trigger pushed relentlessly.\n\nAlthough the album is brutal as fuck, it's also quite the melodic one. Intro's of Terror Zone, Twisted Urges and When the Sun Burns Red are all about the melodies but it is the solo's you should care for. This album contains some of the greatest thrash solo's ever. Just listen to the second part of Coma of Soul and feel the adrenaline spouting out of your eyeballs.\n\nThis release is not only unique of it's original way to combine the melodies and the pure thrash but also in quality. No song is less good than decent, and the first 7 songs are anthems that belong in the great book of thrash. Yeah, it's THAT good.\n\nRecommended tracks: Agents of Brutality, Coma of Souls, When the Sun Burns Red, People of the Lie, World Beyond, Terror Zone, Material World Paranoia\n\nThe last 3 songs are also great\n",
        "\nTerrible Certainty is the third, and probably the most underrated of all Kreator albums. It follows the trend of many other third albums like Megadeth's So Far... So Good... So What!, Destruction's Release from Agony, and Overkill's Under the Influence that are all underrated and overlooked. I believe Terrible Certainty is Kreator's best album after Pleasure to Kill. With this album, Kreator proved that they could follow up with the raw Endless Pain, and the brutal Pleasure to Kill. If Pleasure to Kill didn't cement them among the Gods of Thrash, this album definitely did.\n\nThe main attractions of this album are the high tempo technical riffs, the powerful drums, and the vocals. No, this definitely is not a trademark riff deprived Testament album; just about every song is recognizable by its riffs, and each song has blisteringly fast riffs to offer. Songs like \"Storming with Menace\", \"Blind Faith\", and \"No Escape\" have some of the most powerful and technical thrash metal riffs created by Kreator. With the new production, the sound of the drums has definitely improved. Instead of being masked by guitars, the drums can actually show off their power. In Terrible Certainty, Mille finally took the reigns of the vocals almost completely from Jurgen. His voice sounds sharper, and has more kick to it.\n\nHowever, the album has much more to offer than the riffs and drums. Though many thrash fans will cringe when they hear the words \"better production\", this album definitely was not marred by production. No, the production did not take away from the aggression. In fact, Terrible Certainty preserves nearly all of the momentum, raw power, and aggression created by it's predecessor, Pleasure to Kill. The lyrics have also changed from complete violence and destruction a la Pleasure to Kill to a more \"mature\" approach which now includes ... destruction of religion and the earth. The choruses are also more appetizing this time around. Overall however, the lyrics are more catchy, and are still extremely thrashy. The chaotic solos still remain, but there are fewer solos per song in general. \n\nHowever, there are small problems here and there in the album. First of all, it's far too short. Clocking in at just over 35.5 minutes, there definitely could have been more in this album. When \"Behind the Mirror\" ends, you think \"ALRIGHT WHAT'S NEXT\", but most are disappointed when there isn't anything. Secondly, I am not very big on slow intros, and \"Behind the Mirror\" happens to have one. Not a huge problem, but I just don't like them. A small problem with the album is that the bass tends to be put at the back, and is completely dominated by the guitars and the drums.\n\nMy favorite tracks were probably \"Blind Faith\", and \"Terrible Certainty\". Both of the songs boast ingenious riffs, blistering speed, powerful lyrics, the chaotic solos, and are definitely among the best creations of Kreator. \n\nOverall, this album is a complete riffology, that maintains raw power, aggression, and the chaotic solos of Pleasure to Kill. It boasts many things that PtK could not, like catchier, more intelligent lyrics, catchier choruses, better vocals, better production, and the power of the drums. This album is a must for any thrash fan, and everybody else would be wise to give this album a try. This album has everything a thrash album must have, and much, much more. Remember not to overlook this album because it has so much to offer.\n",
        "\nKreator supposedly had a bit of a resurrection in 2001 with Violent Revolution and the subsequent Enemy of God. Truth be told, both those albums left me cold. The band seemed to be rehashing past glories with some very calculated \u201cmodern\u201d elements creeping into their sound and were being fellated by critics and fans alike. Well, this month will see the band release its 12th album in close to twenty five years of existence and unfortunately things are not looking too good (or are looking great depending on which side of the fence you\u2019re on).\n\nHordes of Chaos basically has a formula and sticks to it. There\u2019s a melodic guitar line, there\u2019s one kickass thrash groove in just about every song, there\u2019s a chugga-chugga Lamb of God/ God Forbid type American metal core section for the mosh pits and there\u2019s the sing-a-long chorus that I\u2019m sure will be a big hit when these songs are played live. That\u2019s the formula with every song on this album. Now, please bear in mind that the kickass riffs sound like they came off Coma of Souls, so your appreciation of those riffs will depend entirely on how much you like Coma of Souls.\n\nI\u2019d pick out stand out tracks but there really aren\u2019t any. Every time the band sounds like they\u2019ve locked in tight to a kickass groove and going for the kill, the momentum is ruined by a melodic guitar line or one of those chugga-chugga grooves or even worse, a Gothenburg type saccharine sweet riff. Also, Mille\u2019s vocal lines get irritating very quickly. There\u2019s a retarded repetition of words that threatens to rival Blaze in Maiden\u2019s Virtual XI. The solos when they do happen are generic modern thrash solos and nothing to write home about. Amok Run is the mandatory ballad like melodic song that\u2019s also a bit more embarrassing than anything the band did on Endorama although it is the bog standard Destroy What Destroys You that sees the band dropping IQ all the way down to sub-sub-basement with another retarded easy to remember chorus made up of the title repeated over and over.\n\nThe demography that this is aimed at will in all probability love it. There are enough popular metal touches on this album for it to become a favourite among anybody who\u2019s first taste of the band was Violent Revolution. It might even appeal to older fans of the band but I\u2019m not sure why or how that will happen. As it stands, this is an album that simply did not appeal to me.\n\nOriginally written for http://www.kvltsite.com\n",
        "\nI have been waiting for this album for years. Even though \"Enemy of God\" wasn't a purely thrash metal album, it was very well written and catchy as hell, as I still find myself listening to the album without any boredom. After that album I couldn't wait for the next one. \"Hordes of Chaos\" is a bit different from the last two albums, but not in a bad way. I have heard a lot of negative reviews about this album already, but I honestly do not see much of those negative criticisms as being valid. Whether in two years I will find this album as catchy as \"Enemy of God\" is still a question to be answered, but this is a very good album and probably will be one of the best in 2009.\n\nThere are several things different on this album and they namely include the vocals and production. The production is weaker allowing for a more raw sound, but this is a good thing. It reminds me more of old Kreator and the production isn't bad enough for it to be an annoyance or a negative. Mille's vocals also sound more raw, but that is because they were recorded live and not much was done to enhance them. I like this as it makes Mille sound more natural. This album is also thrashier than the last two. There are still melodic periods but overall it does sound heavier. People have said that this album just doesn't sound as angry anymore but I disagree. Obviously at times, like the chorus of \"Radical Resistance\", Mille doesn't exactly sound too convincing with the \"People from the east, People from the west\" line, but if you can tell me with a straight face that the main riff after the intro to \"Demon Prince\", the main riff of \"Warcurse\", and \"Absolute Misanthropy\" don't sound evil/angry you're a lost cause. \n\nThe other thing this album really excels at is the solos. \"Enemy of God\" had some good solos, but the soloing in \"Demon Prince\", \"Warcurse\", \"To The Afterborn\", and the title track \"Hordes of Chaos\" is absolutely epic. A lot of the solos are melodic, but the melodies soar high and low and are unbelievably addicting. The first solo in \"Demon Prince\" is definitely the best one, and while it is short, you'll find yourself going back to the song over and over again for that brief solo. \n\nOverall this is an excellent album and I can't wait to see Kreator play some of these songs live. And while I'm still listening to this album non-stop I'm already looking forward to the next one. The album isn't perfect, but it is still one worth buying and listening to.\n",
        "\nBarely forty minutes of in your face 21st century thrash. That's what Kreator offers us once again, and those among us who have enjoyed their last two offerings as a breath of fresh air into a once stagnating genre will once again rejoice. One cannot live off their past glories, folks, unless you run a museum or you're Kiss, of course.\n\nMany have mentioned the fact that Kreator has changed a lot over the past ten years as if it were a bad thing. Well, I am among those who definitely disagree. Milles has become a much better singer, something that is expected from any talented frontman, especially after so many years. Just barking out the lyrics may be cool enough when you're just young and silly and not able to do any better, but it doesn't quite cut it after so many albums and so many years. Mr. Petrozza keeps the agression and adrenaline levels high on this album, specially on tracks such as the three opening tracks, but dares to add clean vocals without sounding silly or commercial on Amok Run.\n\nCredit must be given where it's due, and Ventor has practically reinvented himself as a drummer, to the point of my having people ask me whether Kreator has got a new drummer since Violent Revolution. The double bass and fills are simply mindblowing, mainly when compared to their past works, and really contribute to the overall sound and heaviness. It is certainly refreshing to see a drummer evolve like that, in a world where other famous pseudo-thrash drummers have done exactly the opposite and just plain suck nowadays. And once songs pick up speed, you can just see the moshpits before your eyes with a smile on your face.\n\nThe riffs having become more melodic is another point at which complainers and those like me simply stand at opposite extremes, since I see it as another major improvement that makes Kreator's sound more diverse, complex and enjoyable, without taking away any of the band's aggression, but just adding beauty and technique. If you're a music fan, a metal fan more than a fan of one specific genre, you really don't care whether riffs are pure thrash, melodeath or whatever, and you don't want to hear the same ideas repeated again and again over the years. Hordes of Chaos never gets boring, and it leaves you wanting more.\n\nOne thing that used to displease me about Kreator's past albums was the lack of decent production, although many view their raw sounding production from past albums as a positive thing. I do not. I think that is lame and has been fixed since the band's so called return. It might even be nice to see what those albums would sound like if they were to be re-recorded today. They might have been good enough at the time, but just sound weak nowadays. With Hordes of Chaos you get fast, heavy, loud, aggressive, but modern and clear production, the way it should be.\n\nI doubt any other thrash act will release anything better than this in 2009, and I dare you to listen to this album as loud as possible and not find yourself screaming \"CHAOS!\" or \"Unite to fight, unite to FIGHT!\" after only the second listen...\n",
        "\nI got it as soon as it came out without thinking twice. But before I heard it, some of my musically trusted friends said it just wasn\u2019t good. It was a little hard to believe since their last two albums had been amazing, and also because Mille said that the production is going to be similar to Pleasure to Kill. \n\nNow I\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s wrong with it\n\na) The horrible mixing \u2013 The drums and vocals are way louder than they should be. This is a problem I see with quite a few albums these days. It\u2019s unfortunate that this is thrash we\u2019re talking about, where production can ruin the best material and at the same time has to power to make the most generic stuff sound skull crushing. \n\nb) The pathetic vocal lines and the change in technique \u2013 Just when you thought that the production was the only thing that made it sound metalcorish, the vocal lines come in. They are somewhat deeper throated compared to his signature harsh style and unfortunately land somewhere near the kind of vocals a typical -core band would have. I don\u2019t know if this was on purpose, \u2018cause then even if it wasn\u2019t, I must say Mille is showing signs of aging. They somehow blend with the music in such a way that you get that picture of Korn in your head. \n\nNow coming to why they don\u2019t deserve a complete thumps down. \n\nThe riffing and soloing are perfectly fine, far from bad, in fact catchy and memorable. Musically speaking, this would be definitely one of the best works Kreator has done. The number of riffs is more and quality & consistency is high as well. Not for one second will you feel that they are forcing/pushing it just to sound cool/complex, everything is perfectly in place. And lyrically too, there are no flaws.\n\nI don\u2019t want to name any strong or weak tracks because my response to all of them was almost the same. After a minute into each song I was like, \u201cOh come on, does the name Kreator mean nothing to you?\u201d but just 30 seconds later they\u2019d come up with an impressive interlude which would make me take my words back. Though if I really had to, I think the title track & Demon Prince are the best, and Amok Run & To The Afterborn are the worst. \n\nIt\u2019ll be safe to say that this a case where the band tried it\u2019s best but something just went wrong. The album is worth listening to about twice or maximum thrice, not more than that.\n",
        "\nKreator, being one of the most popular and influential thrash acts out of Germany, or anywhere else even, had a lot to live up to with this album. Their audience, being as large as it is, was very skeptical, diverse, and even apathetic, ranging from old school thrashers to metal newcomers, lovers of the new, lovers of the old, and even people who detest anything after Coma of Souls. Because of the diversity of the crowd, and the diversity of their opinions, feelings about the new Kreator offering will be very diverse as well. Basically, if you hated Enemy of God, look elsewhere for your thrash fix in 2009. This album is not, in any way, a return to the violent days of Pleasure to Kill.\n\nFor the rest of you, I will say that this album is definitely worth a try. I do not advise you go out and buy it, but have a taste and see what you think. This is yet another solid offering from one of the thrash greats, and though sure not to please everyone, is sure to prove to some that Kreator are still on fire.\n\nThe intensity and speed are very much still there. Intense, heavy riffing and fill-heavy drumming, along with lots of double bass, add a lot of beef to the album. On top of this, Mille still has that rough, gravelly sound in his voice that one might think would be missing after over twenty years of performing. Of course, over time, you could start to lose it, as it is evident Mille has begun to, but he still has it maintained as best he can, and is providing an angry, loud, hateful vocal performance that outdoes what many modern thrashers are doing these days.\n\nThe riffing is yet another thing to love about this album. Many have accused this of being a melodeath album, which I really disagree with. It is rather a modern thrash album with melodeath tendencies. There are a few melodeath riffs to be heard here, but there are even more thrashing riffs to behold and adore. Mille does a great job keeping it tight, melodic, and still thrashing as all hell.\n\nAlong with Mille, Ventor has only gotten better with experience, with lots and lots of fills, fast and complicated drum patterns, and employment of more double bass than heard of older Kreator albums, from the eighties. If you\u2019ve worked so hard, why not show it? Ventor has become a very skilled drummer indeed.\n\nOne thing that might split the fan opinions is the production. It is very clean and modern. I would very much like to hear older-sounding production jobs, and that would have definitely made this album MUCH better. But, you can\u2019t please all the people all the time, so I\u2019ll take it. Besides, this is 2009. This is one of those modern things Kreator have embraced and put to use.\n\nThis is a very strong, heavy album and another great addition to my own collection. If a band has been thrashing this long, you\u2019ve got to accept the fact that they will change. The old Kreator formula isn\u2019t there, but the old Kreator fire is still alive like it ever was. Whether in the intense sound or the great lyrics and concepts, the fire burns.\n",
        "\nKreator return in early 2009 with one of the best thrash metal albums in recent memory. This reviewer can't think of an album in the last 15 years by the Big 4 of US thrash (Metallica, Slayer, Megadeth, Anthrax) that even comes close to the thrash assault offered up by Kreator. Even in Germany, the only album that comes close to matching Hordes Of Chaos in old-school thrash intensity mixed with modern musicianship and writing is maybe Sodom's latest self-titled release, but Kreator just blows it out of the water and is sitting comfortably on the thrash throne.\n\nThere are some moments in this album where you might begin to dismiss as not being thrash (beginning of Amok Run), but Kreator fixes it right away with speedy riffs and headbanging breaks that make it feel like the '80's thrash movement all over again. These remedied faults are the low point of the album but they don't so much detract from the album as they just serve as the \u201cgood\u201d part before the \u201cawesome\u201d part. Even when the guitars aren't blisteringly fast, the mid-tempo songs (Radical Resistance, To The Afterborn) are really fist-pumpingly great. A note about \u201cTo The Afterborn\u201d though: Milli really should not try to sing. When he screams, he sounds like the world is ripping in half, but that really does not do a good job of transferring to his singing vocals. It really doesn't take away from the overall strength of the album, however.\n\nEvery song has a bit in it that was practically written to include the crowd in it. This album would transfer over to the live setting extremely well. There are breaks in the thrashing for lots of headbanging breaks and vocals that were made to shout along to (just about every song on the album, in fact). I can imagine screaming along with \u201cAmok Run\u201d or \u201cHordes Of Chaos\u201d live. \u201cEVERYTHING AGAINST EVERYTHING!\u201d Kreator really should play this whole album live.\n\nWhen the speed let's up in those rare moments, Hordes Of Chaos makes sure to make you bang your head and never gives you a moments rest. The solos are here, the aggression is here, the vocals are top notch, and everything about this album makes it work. I'm no expert on thrash, but as far as the big US thrash bands and the Teutonic thrash bands, this album is leagues ahead of what any of them have done in the past 15 years, Kreator included. An undeniable high point, if not peak, of their career. Do whatever it takes to get this album, and then cherish it for many, many years to come.\n\nHighlights: Hordes Of Chaos (A Necrologue For The Elite), Amok Run, Absolute Misanthropy, Demon Prince\n",
        "\n'Enemy Of God' was by far the best Kreator release in a decade and a half. The departure of Tommy Vetterli and the arrival of Sami Yli-Sirni\u00f6 saw Kreator take a slight return to their Thrash roots and mix that up with a touch of melodic Death Metal on 'Violent Revolution', an album with great songs and a to sterile production. 'Enemy Of God' sounded much more vicious and was an even better collection of songs as well. To some extent, 'Hordes Of Chaos' can be seen as a combination of both of the songwriting quality of the latter and the sound complaints of the former.\n\nKreator took a different approach to 'Hordes Of Chaos'. They brought in a new producer (Moses Schneider instead of Andy Sneap) and decided to record all the basic tracks (drums, bass and rhythm guitars) live in the studio. I'm not sure if this approach actually worked, because especially the guitar sound on the album ruined my listening pleasure at first instance. One of the guitars has such a muffled and muddy sound, that some of the fast parts don't have the power they're supposed to have. A rhythm guitar in Metal is supposed to sound crunchy, it's not supposed to sound like you're strumming a clothesline with your penis. Okay, that may be a tad extreme, but I'm sure Kreator should be able to get a better guitar sound, as they had on this album's predecessor.\n\nHaving gotten past this complaint, I do have to admit that this album shows a progressing Kreator. The songs are unmistakably Kreator, but they seem to have mixed the 'Enemy Of God'-sound with some NWOBHM-touches, which gives the album a surprising twist every now and then. For a second, I'd swear I was listening to 'The Hellion' by Judas Priest, but it was really the intro to 'Demon Prince'. And the structures and dramatic climaxes of several songs - 'To The Afterborn' somehow springs to mind right away - are quite reminiscent of the NWOBHM-heyday.\n\nA definite highlight for me is 'Amok Run'. The song starts out tranquil, almost balladesque - with Mille Petrozza's deep, clean voice creating a goosebumps atmosphere - and builds towards a Metal epic with blazing riffs and solos like they haven't done for what seems like ages. I also think Mille's vocals sound best on this particular song.\n\nSurprising is 'Absolute Misanthropy'. The song has a structure and a handful of riffs rather atypical for the Germans and any variation is of course always welcome on a Thrash Metal, since the genre has - despite being the most beautiful kind of music ever created - the risk of becoming a bit monotonous. Kreator has probably foreseen this risk and has put the songs which are a little different at strategic positions on the album.\n\nRounding out and highlighting the album is the sort of a trilogy consisting of 'To The Afterborn', the short instrumental 'Corpse Of Liberty' and the massive 'Demon Prince'. As I've said before 'To The Afterborn' is probably the prime example of why I think this band has been listening to a lot of NWOBHM while writing this album. The song builds up in strongly dramatic way and is decorated by a surprisingly clean and catchy chorus and a majestic solo by Sami Yli-Sirni\u00f6. In addition, I hardly ever heard a Kreator song that relies on twin guitars as much as this one. They sound a bit weird though, as one of the parts was recorded in the \"live backing\" session and one was overdubbed later with the guitar solos. But that's only a minor complaint.\n\n'Demon Prince' starts out with eighties Metal euphoria. I really can't describe that mighty twin guitar intro any different, you'll have to hear for yourself to believe. The song builds up to be a Thrashfest like only Kreator can record, but once again the NWOBHM-climaxes shine through, especially during the chorus. Mille delivers a chaotic, screaming guitar solo and Sami a slightly more structured, melodic solo. Very impressive. Almost as impressive as 'The Ancient Plague', which closed 'Enemy Of God'. To my ears, that song was the ideal soundtrack to the end of the world and I once jokingly said Kreator should have called it quits after that song. I'm glad they didn't. This is Metal and this is why I like the genre.\n\nOther songs - like the opening title track and the following 'War Curse' - are rather typical Kreator songs, which is of course a good thing. The melodic intro to the title track may throw you off the first time, but it builds up to be a cool Thrasher. And, in good Kreator-fashion, the riffs are all over the place here.\n\nLyrically, this album is once again nothing special. I find Mille's \"I hate you\"-lyrics a bit childish ('Enemy Of God' had 'Murder Fantasies', this album has 'Absolute Misanthropy') and not one song is a poetic masterpiece, but that hardly is disturbing. I don't think many people buy Kreator-albums for the lyrical brilliance. But then again; a band that honestly admits, in a CD booklet, that \"AAAAARGH!\" ('Demon Prince') and \"GGGGGRHHHH\" ('War Curse') are actually lyrics, deserves nothing but praise for that!\n\n'Hordes Of Chaos' is a safe buy for anyone who enjoyed the recent outings of the German Thrashers and for those who don't mind a slightly more melodic Kreator. Just the guitar fetishists among you might be thrown off by the guitar sound at first. But then again, I may also be nagging in your opinion. If that is the case, just ignore anything I said about the production and go buy the damn album.\n",
        "\nTwenty five years of thrash metal. Try to say it\u2026.twenty five years of metal\u2026gosh, this is awesome. I can only imagine the satisfaction of a band that passed through all these years, facing difficulties, falling but immediately getting over. It\u2019s hard to follow a style for all these years and maybe Kreator fell in a specific part of their career, like most of the thrash metal bands did. But they survived and they got experience from that missed occasion, whose name is Outcast, forging a sound that takes all the elements of the past, filtered through the more melodic process they started with Endorama. Not so often we have seen a band that is always great in mixing perfectly the best years of its career with the musically worst ones. This is style, this is intelligence and this is expertness. \n\nSince the 2001 comeback, that awesome and massive Violent Revolution and passing through the emotional Enemy of God, we couldn\u2019t believe to our ears. The fanzines and the sites were literally awestruck for the return of a band that seemed dead at the end of the 90s. The old lady of thrash metal surprised everybody and a lifting was enough to shock the fans and reconquer them. The time has passed so fast that now, in 2009, we have the third album by Kreator after the thrash metal comeback. Other years have passed but the energy of this band never fades away. Hordes of Chaos is simply another very good album and once more it takes everything from the career of this band to create a personal approach to the modern thrash metal. Kreator\u2019s penchants for the mixture of old thrash metal to the more recent melodic style find the way to come out once more. \n\nThis new album immediately caught my attention even before the releasing date. I looked at the number of the songs and the length: it\u2019s been a long time since this band didn\u2019t release such a short output. This positively increased my curiosity and now that I have the possibility to describe this latest album I\u2019m really carried away. \u201cHordes of Chaos (A Necrologue for the Elite)\u201d features a more melodic introduction with the lead guitars in the first line, while the speed restart is just behind the corner and we slow down just for the epic chorus. The riffs are in perfect balance between the modernism (with style and without horrid parts) and the old school style. The lead lines are just there to add a sort of gloomy touch. \n\nMille\u2019s vocals are always great and it seems that the time hasn\u2019t passed. I wish it could be so. However, let\u2019s take joy from this moment and prepare to be annihilated by the following \u201cWarcurse\u201d. Once more, the influences are from an album like Coma of Souls with the melodies of Endorama. The production exalts perfectly the more impulsive sections and the more melodic ones as well, without detaching too much from the one on Enemy of God. The second part of this song is definitely more melodic with the introduction of a guitar solo before coming back with the main riff and restart on speed. The massive power of the galloping riffs on \u201cEscalation\u201d contrasts perfectly with the more melodic attention to the few lead notes.\n\n\u201cAmok Run\u201d begins with a clean arpeggio bringing to our mind the ethereal atmospheres of Endorama. The vocal turns to be melodious and clear. The atmosphere is dark but also sad before the distorted instruments take dominion maintaining that original dark touch. By the shouted refrain, the tempo turns to be an up one and the violence takes the vacant place of the melodies that come out on the final part. \u201cDestroy What Destroys You\u201d is not an extraordinary mid-paced track. The groove and the more modern elements are definitely more present even if the whole thing is not annoying. Let\u2019s simply say that the violence of \u201cRadical Resistance\u201d is definitely better. The few breaks let the groovier or melodic influences come out as the band brutalizes the verses. \n\n\u201cAbsolutely Misanthropy\u201d has a perfect, more mid-paced, introduction to give power to the following up tempo section. There are lots of calmer moments even if the catchiness and the quality level are always quite high. The guitars solos have reconquered lots of the 80s impulsivity and nastiness, being shredded on most of the parts. The long notes to give the atmosphere, create a contrast with them. \u201cTo the Afterburn\u201d has lots of elements from Outcast, at least on the first part with more reflexive moments and the massive use of the melodic lines. Lots of bass drums triplets announce the up tempo section by the end, supporting some modern ideas on the riffs and continuing with the classic fast and melodic solo. \n\n\u201cCorpses of Liberty\u201d is a clean arpeggio track, preparing us for the last \u201cDemon Price\u201d and its well-displayed love for the melodic thrash metal. However, don\u2019t be taken in by the more melodic introduction as the rest in far heavier. The up tempo seems neverending and they support the blend of different riffs in a faultless way. The mid-paced section is by the middle to finish with the long and more melodic guitar solo, leaving us with the pleasant sensation to have listened to another very good album by this immortal band. In my humble opinion, modern masterpieces like Violent Revolution and Enemy of God cannot be overwhelmed but this new effort is a reason for the band for always walking tall and never back down.\n",
        "\nKreator has been one of the most important figures in the history of thrash and have the biggest fan base when compared to the three stalwarts from German thrash history. Their unique style of aggression and power has molded the thrash genre more than most bands have and who can blame them? Five consecutive thrash masterpieces since their inception namely Endless Pain, Pleasure To Kill, Terrible Certainty, Extreme Aggression and Coma Of Souls. So when they decided to altogether give up their thrash sound when they reached the pinnacle of the career it surprised dedicated fans of the band worldwide.\n\nAfter nearly 10 years they decided to \u201cgo back to their roots\u201d. The albums they put out (Violent Revolution and Enemy Of God) were not thrash but \u201cthrashy\u201d. The band\u2019s new tracks all embraced the new, more melodic and not-so-aggressive modern thrash sound to its very core. I pretty much decided not to give \u201cHordes Of Chaos\u201d a try but what changed my mind was the fact, and I state from Wikipedia: - \u201cIt has been described as their most organic album to date due to the fact that, barring vocals, guitar solos and some melodies, the album was recorded in a live setting on a 4-track analog tape recorder with no overdubs. Front man Mille Petrozza noted that this is the first time they have recorded an album this way since Pleasure to kill\u201d. The fact that one of the stalwarts of thrash was trying to do something, even if it was just the production the old way was reason enough to try out this release.\n\nNow where do I begin? Mille just cannot sing the aggressive sounding vocal style of thrash anymore and the vocals are probably the most annoying thing on the album. The riffs are way to uninspired and melodic. They set out to create if not a thrash album at least a thrash release and what they have created is basically a melodic thrash album (WTF?). The bass is hardly audible and most of the drum lines are similar. The songs in it are extremely predictable and pretty repetitive. The band seem to have forgotten and seem to have given up what they seemed to always have in their grasp. Sheer aggression. Hell, even the last two albums had tinges of that. I mean, come on. Even compare the album titles. Endless Pain, Pleasure To Kill, Extreme Aggression and now Hordes Of Chaos? No thank you. The brain cells of the band seem to be dead when it comes to thrash now.\n\nBarring the opening riff of the title track and the chorus of \u201cRun Amok Run\u201d this album is pretty much a waste of time, energy and money. The fact was and still remains that the thrash in Kreator is dead. Even the band\u2019s German counterpart \u201cSodom\u201d has been releasing good decent albums on a regular basis even though they too have the modern thrash sound to them now. It is pretty unrealistic to find bands, which play, thrash nowadays which lies in the vein of early thrash but a few bands like Hypnosia, Evile and Torture Squad do. Bands like the one\u2019s I just mentioned listened probably grew up listening to Kreator and maybe was even one of its inspirations. Ironically, Kreator must now listen to these bands to get some sort of inspiration to play thrash again (hopefully). Recommended to fans of modern thrash. Fans of old school thrash, look away.\n",
        "\nConsidered by many the most technical album by Kreator, this Extreme Aggression is a very good album that, by the way, has something less memorable than Terrible Certainty. Kreator still goes strong on the way to the most technical but always violent thrash metal and the death elements seem so far. The way they play now is far more mature and the compositions now joy of a newfound songwriting with more ideas and well-balanced parts between the classic assaults and the less impulsive restarts. As always, the riffs are the heavier and more audible element on their sound and this is surely one of the best periods for this band. \n\nThe production is more polished but always sharp, adding a more powerful touch to the volumes. We begin with the title track and I can already notice more technical riffs and less impulsivity, also when the tempo is faster. The most extreme element is the scratchy voice by Mille and the riffs are always precise, powerful. A sense of \u201cchirurgical coldness\u201d is present on them and the more polished production is very good to exalt the now more canonical form of thrash metal by this band. However, we must say that the few death metal parts on the previous album were always great. The tempo changes are far more present and the lead lines appear on the mid-paced parts.\n\nThere\u2019s a hint of melody in more parts and this is good to give variety to the music. The same elements can be found also on the galloping riffs of \u201cNo Reason To Exist\u201d and its tempo changes with more mid-paced sections. The drumming is excellent and precise, filling the songs with a sort of technical style, but it\u2019s also always violent and accurate. The open chords riffs and the less impulsive parts are also reminiscent of the old Metallica because they are, as I said, more technical and more thrash metal oriented. The distortion too is a sign of change, being massive but also quite clean and never excessive. \n\nTracks like \u201cLove Us or Hate Us\u201d, \u201cStream of Consciousness\u201d and \u201cBringer of Torture\u201d are examples of heavy and fast thrash metal with always an eye to the completeness and the strong structures in order to create always well-balanced compositions. The old school brutality is mixed with several mid-paced breaks to create more assorted but always catchy compositions. Finally the guitars solos are a perfect way between the not excellent speed of the past with the acquired technique to be vicious but also well-done. The incredible vocals by Mille are unmatchable for their schizophrenic style and they represent one of the most evident trademarks in this sound. \n\nThe longer \u201cSome Pain Will Last\u201d shows different structures and more of those dramatic lines we could sporadically find in other parts. The lead riffage is essential in giving the right attitude and sounds. The mid-tempo is preferred to grow by the end and announcing \u201cBetrayer\u201d, the best track here. It\u2019s fast like few others but it\u2019s always well-written and with a recognizable refrain. The riffs are numerous and the stop and go parts of the rhythmic session are perfect. The last \u201cFatal Energy\u201d shows more lead lines and a less impulsive tempo to close this album in which Kreator displayed their acquired knowledge in music. \n\nThis Extreme Aggression is a sign of what will come with the following album, with more technical parts and always better structures.\n",
        "\nExtreme Aggression was the most controlled output from the German thrash titans at that time of its release. Gone is the perpetual drum assault of Pleasure to Kill or the frenetic pace of Terrible Certainty but those has been nicely traded-off for more restraint and tight execution. The production is also superior to their earlier attempts being more clear and more even in the mix. The greater clarity in the sound is suitable to the overall aim of a more reined in effort. \nWhat is also missing here is the dashing burst of unfettered creative energy that filled to various degrees all the earlier albums. This is a feature that can be both welcomed and regretted. On the one hand, such frenzy can work well and create a monster (Behind the Mirror) but on the other it can result in half-baked mess that offers little other than blistering pace (Ripping Corpse). \nOf course, Extreme Aggression should never be misunderstood for being anything less than top-notch thrash . The album is loaded with all the characteristic attributes of the genre staple , from deadly riffs to solid drumming. All songs have a great sense of structure building around a basic tune. The riffs are all simply awesome- mostly mid-paced and razor sharp, with interesting development and progression forming the perfect base for the music. Neat breaks and tempo changes are present all through too. Such a reined-in album has the added benefit of every song being a distinct piece from the other. \nThe drumming is excellent, very accurate and never missing a beat. It is, in fact, quite technical and creative but never dazzlingly so and that is how it ought to be because every song has a definite focus and development. Nonetheless, the drumming undoubtedly adds a new dimension to the songs and make them so much more enjoyable. The solos are good and on the more melodic side but they are never over-used. I generally do not care much for vocals but I find that Mille Petrozza's shrieks and venomous cries has a natural place in the music.\n\nThere is no point in song-by-song deconstruction but Betrayer and the closer Fatal Energy are my favorite, but not by any significant margin. In conclusion, this is an excellent thrash album and represents a style that Kreator would go on to perfect in their nexelease.\n",
        "\nIn my humble opinion Terrible Certainty is a too overlooked piece in the Kreator\u2019s discography just because it\u2019s stuck between two representative albums. Pleasure To Kill is a manifest of the primordial brutality by this band, while the following Extreme Aggression is the very first, complete example of the new way this band chose to be a bit more technical and mature. A sign of this maturity was already present on the Flag Of Hate EP and this new album is nothing but a stronger confirm, just one year after and this shows also the speed of a band in a continued growth. \n\nIn more or less half an hour, the band takes no prisoners thanks to this schizophrenic riffage and the savage assault of the drumming. The production is finally clear and pounding at the same time, as the most thrash elements are stronger and crushing. The guitars are constantly fast with the opener, \u201cBlind Faith\u201d. Mille is completely pissed off against the Church, the visions and the followers. Also from this point of view, we can notice a maturity and a care for more real and close to us things. By the way, the up tempo parts are massive and the riffs are relentless, with a precise structure and stuck in a defined song-writing. \n\nThe violence is no more the one of an immature band and the following \u201cStorming With Menace\u201d is another example. The catchy chorus and the easily recognizable riffs are just great. The songs here show also different patterns in order to be less monolithic and yes, direct but with style and precision. Mille\u2019s vocals are closer to the ones on the recent times but they are always nasty, strong and with a bigger personality. The guitars solos, still remaining truly fast and direct, are also a bit better done but some parts are unquestionably bound to the recent past. This is a direct bridge between the two periods of this band. \n\nThe title track is again unmistakable with the fantastic riff at the beginning. This time we can find the first mid-paced progression but soon we are obliterated by the up tempo parts in which the unique and fast palm muting work is one of the best here. The galloping parts are mixed with fast notes and everything is like the classic examples of how mixing brutality to catchiness. Precisely this point shows the real maturity the band has acquired. \u201cAs The World Burns\u201d is a slab of thrash that settles on mid-paced progression to be even more apocalyptic. The intensity never goes down and the band is always dynamic at passing thorough lots of riffs. \n\n\u201cToxic Trace\u201d is one of the most unbelievable examples of Kreator\u2019s progression in sounds and structures. The riffs are fast like bullets from a machine gun but they are sloppy no more. The pure thrash metal arises and the length is remarkable. The intensity goes at high peaks. With the more mid-paced \u201cNo Escape\u201d and the terrific assault of \u201cOne Of Us\u201d we stay on the top. Even the mid-paced breaks are fucking well-done, convincing and full of riffs. We can notice a sort of hidden melody in some parts but nothing so well-shown because the riffs are just here to destroy everything. \n\nThe last \u201cBehind The Mirror\u201d is the track that features the strongest dark elements. The arpeggios and the way more audible melodies are good and a sign for the most recent style by this band. Anyway, soon after, the riffs enter and the destruction is recreated over the several up tempo parts and the dynamic switches of paces. The chorus is always catchy and brutal, leading us directly to end of this fantastic album. Finally Kreator come to thrash metal and they do it rapidly and with style. These compositions are finally mature and well-developed. Here we can find mandatory material for a thrash metal fan.\n",
        "\nThe EP that followed the Pleasure To Kill album is considered by many a real small cult for the extreme scene of the 80s. To put out this EP Kreator didn\u2019t wait even a year from the first album and this Flag of Hate is made of three tracks. Two of them immediately catch the eye for their length that is much higher than the usual standard by Kreator. By the way, this Flag Of Hate is remarkable also for another aspect: the music. First of all, we start from the production that is now a bit less chaotic and raw than the one of the first album. The drums, especially, have acquired a sharper touch and they are far more audible. The snare drum is finally higher in volumes. \n\nAnother thing we can notice is the songs\u2019 structure. Even a fast one the title track is better developed thanks also to thrasher riffs and less common, childish brutality. The riffs are far better and more mature, taking more influences from the classic thrash. This song is finally a good way to hear a brutal load through different and more complete structures. The violence gains lots of point thanks to these parts and it\u2019s more convincing and blowing. The following \u201cTake Their Lives\u201d is a long semi mid-paced track with some faster restarts. The riffs are more mature and the thrash/speed parts are concentrated on the faster sections. The solos conserve that bestial, chaotic style but we can find an evolution here too. In some parts they are better in style and technique, they\u2019re more polished and the breaks are even more melodic. \n\nA special mention is for the vocals by Mille. They changed a bit in style and they follow the new style of the music. They are far less impulsive and fast, with fewer intentions in following the too fast patterns. They are more pissed off and better in power and personality. The open chords riffs on the longer parts are almost a new thing for this band and the solo lines behind them are good to the atmosphere in order to give variety to the already good tracks. If you listen to the following \u201cAwakening of Kings\u201d we can find even dissonant riffs and galloping parts. This style is the one that this band will follow on the future albums. The violence always lies on several up tempo parts but they are different from the recent parts and they are different in a good way.\n\nThe band finally returned to good levels and their technique at the instruments brought them to compose better songs with a stronger songwriting. The variety is far more present and the maturity is coming out. Another thing to notice is the catchiness of these songs that is a direct reflex of the maturity that, as I said, was emerging and we cannot find boring or derivative riffs anymore! It\u2019s incredible how much Kreator grew in a one year period and this is where they choose a less impulsive path to follow, signing officially the road to the very good albums of the end of the 80s-beginning of the 90s. If Pleasure To Kill let you down or simply it was too extreme for you, check this one instead to enjoy these compositions.\n",
        "\nContrary to the most of the thrashers\u2019 ideas, I\u2019ve never found something so special on the first Kreator\u2019s works. This band always released good stuff back then, don\u2019t get me wrong, but for the structures and the more mature songwriting I prefer the new efforts. This is a truly rare thing for me because usually I always defend the old school instead of the new one, but this is just my personal idea and I\u2019m sorry if I let someone down. By the way, as you can see, I\u2019m not gonna give this album a weak mark, not at all! It was just to explain the reason why of the following comments on this Pleasure To Kill and the quarrels that can come after having compared a milestone of brutality like this album to higher-scored efforts like Violent Revolution or Enemy of God. \n\nSurely a blowing, furious and nasty album like this one was very important for the growing black or death scene but, going deeper into the sound we can find some flaws and that\u2019s normal for a band that so often pointed its young and still immature songwriting on the sheer speed and brutality. In spite of other influential releases back then like Seven Churches, Reign In Blood and Darkness Descends just to cite a few, Pleasure To Kill was not that well developed and it went down in many parts, starting from the monotony that lies among these tracks. Someone can say that Reign In Blood is more monotonous and I say that maybe it\u2019s right, but remember that I\u2019m still a bit on the personal path and the tastes are different for anyone, fortunately. \n\nThis album always gave me the idea of a band that wanted to play too fast for their skills and, maybe a little more of focusing and attention would have not caused so many flaws. In some parts, the drumming is so fast that the guitars sound in trouble in following the patterns\u2026 The intro is just to prepare us for the first massacre, \u201cRipping Corpse\u201d. The production is truly sloppy and evil, while the guitars are essential on their palm muting riffs. The vocals are always on the borderline between thrash and death and the use of some tremolo picking is good to fill the air with gloominess. For those who found ridiculous the Jairo T. (Sepultura) solos at the guitars, listen to these ones and prepare to laugh. At least Slayer did better things even if they were not the Dream Theatre of thrash metal. \n\nThe best things come when the band is more focused on different patterns instead of the ones on up tempo. In those parts, we have a more convincing and thrash riffs while the other parts don\u2019t shine so much in technique or fantasy but more on the pure attack. The main thing that lacks on this album is the \u201cmemorable\u201d word. Everything is brutal and nasty but I cannot find the right way to enter this sound and really enjoy it. The forest of riffs avoid me from having a general idea of the compositions and in many parts what I hear is a mountain of tremolo pickings put together with the glue and elementary palm mute sections. Surely the title track has the privilege to be catchier and somehow more convincing thanks also to a more recognizable chorus. \n\n\u201cRiots of Violence\u201d is better because shows more mid-paced tempo parts and a more complex riffage on the various chords to show also some speed metal oriented riffs and that\u2019s exactly what I was searching for: better songwriting, always present riffs and less useless and, at times, incomprehensible violence. The guitars solos are just to forget once again. Maybe just \u201cCommand of the Blade\u201d has more recognizable riffs but the rest is normal, simply normal with a hint of mediocrity. The last \u201cUnder the Guillotine\u201d is a good track to end the album with more brutality and it\u2019s remarkable also because it\u2019s still played live and has a good refrain. As always, forget anything related to \u201cmelody\u201d because the power lies on the frontal assault and the carnage it comes. \n\nThis album could have been very important for the growth of death metal but still nowadays, after several years passed on it, concentrating my forces and mind, I can\u2019t totally immerge myself in it. Maybe, it\u2019s for its blasting fury, but I don\u2019t know\u2026as you know I\u2019m used to listen to this stuff regularly and I\u2019m not a power metal fan. There are several other extreme works that captured my attention in a strongest way and I don\u2019t know what to do with this one. To me it\u2019s lame in many parts and quite repetitive. Not for this is a bad album, absolutely. Even if the structures were a bit common and not yet mature, it displayed also good signs of the future evolutions as well as a non common heaviness.\n",
        "\nI really don\u2019t know why people always whine about new efforts by old, mythical bands. Kreator, in this case, are a band with lots of years back and with a lot of experience in thrash metal but someone is still able to complain about the recent efforts, that are, by the way, the best they\u2019ve put out since the beginning of the 90s. During that period, Kreator, such as lots of other thrash metal bands, were stranded and they lost a lot of their original aggression. Those days were really bad and the climax was reached with the terrible Outcast, the most representative sign of their downfall.\n\nBy the way, that period seems so far now and since the 2001 comeback with the unbelievable Violent Revolution, the things are great again. The new Kreator\u2019s style was able to mix lots of influences and sounds from their long career. So, the technical, less impulsive approach of an album like Extreme Aggression and the sense of melody of Coma Of Souls with hints of Endorama were the ingredients of the refound glory of this band. The brutality of its thrash metal was perfectly mixed with more melodic breaks and lines in order to create a well-balanced album and this Enemy Of God follows the same style. \n\nThere are a lot of similarities between the two albums that marked the return to thrash metal for this band. First of all, the production that is always clear, powerful and perfect to exalt all the instruments. Even the songs\u2019 structure is very similar and perfectly balanced between melody and aggression. The title track is all power but the melodic lines are always present in the riffs and they are also remarkable for their catchiness. The palm muting riffs are relentless and the vocals by Mille are just great with his typical timbre and scream. The sad, almost apocalyptic tunes are stronger on the following, superb \u201cImpossible Brutality\u201d. This is easily one of the best compositions ever by this band and the second part is on open riffs with more melodies.\n\n\u201cSuicide Terrorist\u201d is again very good and mixes up very good tempo changes. The more mid-paced parts are pissed of as well, but the up tempo restarts are blowing by the end and on the chorus. The guitars solos are always a way between the most impulsive style and the melody. The frontal assault of \u201cWorld Anarchy\u201d is terrific and shows always catchy lines and easily recognizable parts. Mixing perfectly the brutality to catchiness is a thing the shows all the maturity level by this band. \u201cDystopia\u201d marks the return of the melodic lead lines on the chorus and marks also furious bass drum parts while the intensity grows.\n\n\u201cVoices of the Dead\u201d is the most melodic track here. The influences from Endorama album are massive but very good and some clean vocals parts are amazing to break the impact of the guitars. Here even the lead guitars are far more present in their melodies even if the thrash riffs are always present, not like in the past. \u201cMurder Fantasies\u201d and \u201cWhen Death Takes Its Dominion\u201d are two fast tracks with always catchy choruses and catchy riffs while \u201cOne Evil Comes (A Million Follow)\u201d shows some Outcast oriented arpeggios on the always fast paced patterns. The arpeggios are again on \u201cDying Race Apocalyptic\u201d that features again more melodies.\n\n\u201cUnder a Total Blackened Sky\u201d is surely more violent but check always the melodies out of the guitars in several parts. So far, they all have been great and something that adds variety, fantasy and even darkness through dramatic parts. The final \u201cThe Ancient Plague\u201d is more in Outcast direction once again and even being quite good has less memorable moments. By the way, the arpeggios breaks and the melodic parts are always well-done and stuck. At the end, I still don\u2019t know why this album is so criticized by many. It is complete, it has everything, from power to melodies, from aggression to variety and that\u2019s really good to me. \n\nKreator\u2019s songwriting and experience are bigger than in the past and you definitely can hear it on this great album.\n",
        "\nReleased back in the glory days of thrash - that is, the mid-eighties - this was the REAL beginning of Teutonic thrash. Forget Infernal Overkill; even that masterpiece pales in comparison to the giant known as Endless Pain. Never before had a band taken their hatred and violence to such an astounding level. Fast, brutal, and above all, skilled musicianship abounds in this 1985 monster. There's no shortage of menacing riffs and shredding solos, the drumming suffocates, and the guitar and bass obliterate. All of this is possible due to a truly crushing production job.\n\nThe vocals in particular destroy everything in their path. Mille is Hell's equivalent of Jesus; he can be no other than the Devil incarnate. He's at his most demonic here, showing elements of what would become death and black metal, and on no other album does he sound so purely blasphemous. His growling is made all the more frightening by the fact that one can still decipher the lyrics - which are, by the way, evil at its best. Unfortunately, he would lose a bit of the deathliness of his vocals on subsequent releases.\n\nEach and every song is worth a listen (hell, they deserve WAY more than that), and no track is weaker than any other. The most memorable may be the title track, \"Total Death,\" \"Flag of Hate,\" \"Tormentor,\" and \"Bone Breaker.\" An honorable mention goes to \"Dying Victims,\" which opens with a pretty interesting bass solo. \n\nThe guitar solos are somewhat atypical for shredders; they are actually highly memorable. Some are fairly long, which in this case is a huge plus. They're extremely intricate and equally deadly and effective. This album's solos are some of the best thrash has to offer, which is saying a lot in a genre known for its solos. Rob Fioretti deserves major credit for his bass playing. Instead of quietly following the guitar as bass players are prone to do in metal, he plays fairly loud and independently, sometimes rivaling the guitar itself. The drumming is also very sound. Always precise, always powerful, Ventor redefines just how fast and how well one can play the drums. The instrumentation along with Mille's Satanic vocal delivery adds up to a completely devastating listening experience.\n\nEndless Pain marks the beginning of a five-album trend of nearly perfect brutal thrash metal. From here all the way up to Coma of Souls, Kreator would make a name for themselves as the head of the death/thrash movement. Though they later became a band of inconsistent quality, for now they were at the top of their game.\n",
        "\nKreator have been thrashing around for some time now and this release is a testament retrospective. The fit-to-burst CD/DVD is an expanded re-release of the classic \u2018Live in East Berlin\u2019 tape from 1990 combined with the horror short \u2018Hallucinative Comas\u2019.\n\nThe CD, the live audio from the concert, contains a strong setlist with numbers that are still staples in the band\u2019s live set today, namely \u2018Flag of Hate\u2019, \u2018Extreme Aggression\u2019 and \u2018Pleasure to Kill\u2019. The quality is commendable for a release from a vault long ago. The live atmosphere sharpens the music and intensifies the bloodshed, from the lacerating opener \u2018Some Pain Will Last\u2019 right to the classic \u2018Tormentor\u2019 closer. For some reason, there are actually only 14 tracks on the CD version, omitting the drum solo (for good reason) whereas it is featured on the DVD version.\n\nThe concert footage has been re-edited and upgraded all round, with legendary producer Andy Sneap mixing it in a clean 5.1 sound format. It utilizes experimental and varied camera angles interspersed with grainy shots and a raw feeling. Unfortunately, these stylistic features appear to be the footage\u2019s downfall; frequently the shots appear amateur and very sketchy, the imperfections are bold, some shots are blurred and all the cameras seem indecisive as to what they should be focusing on, the biggest victim being the guitar solos of which are never focused on in any great or consistent detail. The drum solo is a fairly mediocre one and it is no great sin for its lack of appearance on the CD counterpart. Whilst Kreator\u2019s stage presence is hardly brimming with epidemic charisma, the performance is verily austere and commanding. However, it seems a shame various portions of the audience are not thrashing madly.\n\nThis concert (Kreator playing with Sabbat, Coroner and Tankard) was one of the first metal shows in East Berlin since the Berlin Wall came down and die-hard metal fans packed the venue. The accompanying documentary is more of a history of the East Berlin metal scene from the eyes of fans and journalists of the time, rather than the history of Kreator. Still, this feature is definitely worth checking out for those even remotely interested. It is probably more useful than the concert footage itself.\n\nThe so-called \u2018Horror Movie\u2019 is a somewhat conceptual one, playing with visual aids rather than a clearly presented storyboard for twenty minutes. Every so often, a more archetypical music video of the band playing a track is substituted in. Although the film heralds little adequate and substantial suspense, there are a few images of gore and extra scenes absent from the original release because apparently \u201cthe censors just couldn\u2019t stomach [them] back in the day\u201d according to frontman Mille Petrozza. For those expecting a fully-fledged 'Cannibal Ferox' gore fest or even a compelling story, you will be severely disappointed.\n\nWhilst it is a challenge to not fall in love with the great Kreator, this DVD/CD piece is far from essential and really should be for the avid collectors. The live CD is no doubt the best element followed by the mini documentary for reasons not so linked to Kreator. The rest of the material is far from tedious; it just feels like padding at its core and is unsuccessful at presenting anything new.\n\nOriginally written for www.soundshock.net\n",
        "\nThe 90s will forever be remembered as the worst years for metal and especially for thrash metal. Kreator fell into a sort of limbo for two/three albums and this Outcast is the lowest point in their career. The following Endorama will be more gothic oriented while this album is darker and features modern elements in Kreator\u2019s sound, grabbing directly from the modern influences that were invading the metal in that period. If you really want to listen to this album, there are few things I must say to you: forget about the violent death/thrash of the previous works, forget about the riffs, forget about the fast tempo parts and forget about the brutal vocals by Mille.\n\nNow, are you ready? Let\u2019s enter the new conception of music by Kreator in those days. The first song already shows how the album will be. The riffs are almost embarrassing and dull. There\u2019s a will to make the melodies stand out and also the will to erase most of the metal elements. If the following Endorama at least will feature catchy lines, this song is incredibly weak. The modern elements can be found in some synth parts in order to create weird sounds behind the instruments, like programming and artificial noises. Yeah, the atmosphere is quite dark but the song is incredibly boring. The following \u201cPhobia\u201d is the song that I like the most here because it\u2019s a bit heavier and it\u2019s catchy. Still nowadays it\u2019s played live and achieves the goal of bringing up the tempo parts and my general attention.\n\n\u201cForever\u201d is obscene because is supremely flawed and boring in the songwriting. The riffs are repetitive and tedious. The modern effects are still present and also some vocals parts are filtrated. The whispered vocals and the obscure moments are in contraposition with the loud restarts where the vocals are utter crap. The groove tempo and the guitars parts are even worst in the following \u201cNonconformist\u201d. The stop and go parts are unbelievably shitty and the following \u201cEnemy Unseen\u201d follows the same style with all the flaws and the mallcore addictions. Kreator are now experts in crappy groove/modern sounds. The title track is mid-paced (yes, we need that after a BRUTAL song like \u201cEnemy Unseen\u201d!!). I\u2019d rather cut my balls and eat my intestines instead of going on with this utter piece of steaming horse shit. But I must go ahead in describing more aborted pieces of music\u2026\n\nActually, when we listen to songs like \u201cStronger Than Before\u201d and \u201cRuin of Life\u201d there\u2019s nothing else to say. They are nu-metal and really addicted to modernism. The vocals are simply ridiculous and they\u2019ve lost everything in nastiness and brutality. The riffs are inaudible (no, sorry\u2026there are no riffs!) and there are various duets by the guitars with hyper tasteless and inoffensive melodies. \u201cWhatever it May Take\u201d, \u201cAlive Again\u201d, \u201cAgainst The Rest\u201d and the final \u201cA Better Tomorrow\u201d are very similar to the rest of the album. Thus, expect massive dosages of mallcore, weak parts, two riffs per song, dark parts and mid-paced tempo. The drums are on the same patterns from the beginning \u2018till the end.\n\nThe boredom reigns supreme among these unbelievable compositions by a band that lost completely the way in this period. To me \u201cPhobia\u201d still remains the best here, while the other compositions could fit extremely well for \u201cThe Crow\u201d film soundtrack. Thrash metal addicted, you have the chance, don\u2019t enter in 1997 Kreator\u2019s world.\n",
        "\nThe 90's were pretty fucked up times for metal, at least in the mainstream. Even though you had some pretty good underground bands at the time, you also had those little bastards who wanted to throw everything they were worth through the board; and decided to copy the Metallica's and Pantera's out there, dumbing out their sound for some commercial attention. Poor Megadeth was a victim of this, as well as Slayer, and other countless bands who probably got a single in the top 10 for a week. This sellout virus (I'm not going to call it 'change') also ended up affecting Kreator; but unlike most of those other 90's records, this isn't as abysmally awful like Load/Risk/VDoP/Diabolous in Musica.\n\nThe German former Thrashers sort of got it right by doing really catchy songs without resorting to groovy rhythms, and instead opted for a more Gothic-industrial rock album. They are able to pull some really catchy stuff as well, but that doesn't save this album for being bad. The greatest problem with sellout 90's albums is the lack of consistency; bands go for few radio hits, while using the whole album to package it between a sandwich of sub-par songs. We have fucking horrid shit like the Title Track, which has one of the most annoying choruses I've ever heard, Petrozza going \"It's getting closer/follow my friend/endorama is crushing you\" I hate it! It gets on my nerves.\n\nThen there are many fillers; maaaanyyyy. 'Shadowland' does nothing with that pseudo groove 'riff', 'Willing Spirit' starts pretty damn good with a very catchy melody, but then it's just fucking silly, full of some shit behind the verses which can't be called anything. There's no over-the-top choruses, and I can't even notice when it ends, just when 'Pandemonium' begins. Talking about that, 'Pandemonium' is pretty good, it starts with a melody that I swear it was taken straight from Maiden's 'Fear of the Dark', and it has some decent riffs, and a fancy sweep-picking solo. There's also (this is a guilty pleasure of mine) 'Chosen Few', which even though it has Petrozza singing in an almost *gasp* CORN (hehehe, fuck their name!) voice, it managed to make me like it, with that \"a new era has begunnn\" chorus, which sounds really lame, but it's fun in a Breaking the Law-like way.\n\n'Everlasting Flame' is very good; as long as you're not expecting Thrash, and are instead ready for some violin (synth probably?) hooks, and a piano--Damn right, Kreator with a piano, seek shelter! The vocals sound just a little bit mallcorish, but not much, and the hooks are enough to keep you tuned. Hell, if all of Endorama was like this, with some little hooks here and there, probably better riffs, and more guitar solos...Well we would have Youthanasia, but that album is good! The 'heaviest' song in here is 'Soul Eraser', which has the most metal riffs, a bunch of hooky melodies, and if it wasn't for the annoying robot-like vocals, it would be the best song in here, just cause I find incredibly awesome to sing 'SOULLL ERASER!'.\n\nI'll dedicate a paragraph just for the highlight of the album, which is the opener 'Golden Age'. It manages to keep itself fun for the whole duration, with a very over-the-top yet catchy chorus, and a cool guitar solo, even though it has some really ugly 'riffs' (if you can call them that way). But 'Golden Age' probably works better because it's at the beginning of Endorama, and since it's the first, it feels fresh, and at least at those moments you're not thinking \"fuck I could be listening to Coma of Souls or something\".\n\nSo yes, Endorama may be 'experimental', and different from Kreator's Thrash outputs, but that's not it's problem. The problem with this album is that it's too inconsistent, with good sing-along stuff, followed by completely forgettable crap. It gets really lame at times, specially Petrozza's voice and the usual groove riff. I really these kind of albums when they're done correctly, like Youthanasia, full of over-the-topness and blazing guitar solos; and even Metallica's ReLoad (though it also has the same problems as this, it's too inconsistent). I don't think you should buy this, unless you're into Gothic/Industrial type of stuff, if not, get it for those 4-5 songs which sort of make this album not suck completely.\n",
        "\nAfter the release of the brutal and very influential Pleasure to Kill, no one knew what this glorious band from Essen would do to top PKT. Their answer to that: this nice little record consisting on three tracks (six if you got the reissue). This record demonstrate us a change in Kreator, the pace was more varied and the vocals were lower than the regular vocals Kreator used at that time.\n\nThe guitar tone in this record is as sick as hell, but for the first time in Kreator we can see some melody in the guitars. The song lengths are longer than those of the first two releases. In this record the drums are heavier and thicker than in PTK, and the bass is almost inaudible, but is there and really complement the drums and guitars.\n\nFlag of Hate already appeared on Endless Pain, but this version is heavier, faster and the vocals have more of a death metal touch. Also this version have more of a death metal feeling than the version on Endless Pain, who have more black metal traits.\n\nAwakening of the Gods starts with heavy guitars and strange drums that lead into the agressive vocals of Mille Petrozza. In this song there are some black metal traits commonly found in Endless Pain. It is over 7:30 minutes long, but don't worry, you would not get bored in any second of this song. \n\nTake their Lives is one of the heaviest song I ever heard from Kreator. It is not too fast but it will keep your head banging. The solos on this song are the typical Kreator solos, with a lot of tremolo picking and whammy bar.\n\nIf you like the agression and brutality of Pleasure to Kill, but also the melody and variety of Terrible Certainty, try to get this ep!\n",
        "\nThat\u2019s right, someone left a window open and Mille is being savaged by a disgruntled crow! But little did they know that this aviary-come-studio related mishap would contribute to one of the best thrash albums around. Technical, yet not for the sake of it, Kreator\u2019s \u2018Coma of Crows\u2019 is one of the highlights of the whole thrash scene, hell, I\u2019ll even let them off for technically being members of Thrash for Conserving the Rainforest. What does the rainforest have to do with thrash? Do the weird-cong live there? \n\nThis is the first album to feature the rather trouser tightening combination of Mille and Frank \u2018Blackfire\u2019 Gosdzik. I must say they do an excellent job and deliver some memorable riffs and solos. Perhaps, Mr Blackfire is more suited to Kreator\u2019s technical, melodic yet still savage approach to thrash as he never seemed truly content with Sodom\u2019s more austere slant on the genre. The leads are particularly of note and certainly aren\u2019t merely playing second fiddle to bludgeoning riffola. It\u2019s not just a calculated and sterile shred-fest either, the solos contribute to the over all conflict, drama and tension of the album, \u2018When the Sun Burns Red\u2019 being a particularly excellent example of this, as the leads break through the stormy onslaught of riffs like a brilliant sunshine. So yes, they make me thing of pleasant Sunday afternoons in the park feeding the crows\u2026CAW CAW! Technicality, is thankfully never overdone, this isn\u2019t one of Chuck Schuldiner\u2019s unadulterated wankathons. Even better is this is a technical album which actually manages moments of great atmosphere, those storm clouds in \u2018When the Sun Burns Red\u2019 being a particularly spine-tingling moment and recalling what is quite possibly the most metal moment ever in \u2018Rime of the Ancient Mariner\u2019. \n\nIn terms of quality \u2018Coma of Souls\u2019 never really lets up at all, riff after riff, the scars I bare are the wounds of thrash! \u2018When the Sun Burns Red\u2019, a cautionary tale of the dangers of global warming, is a clear winner. Although I can\u2019t say I care much for its lyrical sentiment. I live in Yorkshire, melting polar icecaps and such will only flood the south, creating some sort of Atlantis out of all those chimney sweeps, Lords and Ladies, with their manor houses soon to be a haven for all sorts of colourful sea life; the mighty cod! The exquisite fish finger! The fierce haddock! The triumphant whiting! Hail to thee British sea life! Anyway, it\u2019s a marvellous song, setting the tone for the rest of the album with brisk and breezy riffing (it\u2019s about the weather, I can use weather girl terms!). \u2018Agents of Brutality\u2019 is another clear stand out with the sing-along refrain of \u2018Manic! Panic!\u2019 and frantic riff work. \u2018Coma of Souls\u2019 is the most straight ahead thrash metal song here, and all the more effective for it. Mille\u2019s vocal patterns are particularly pleasing in this one- lethal, vicious and effortlessly catchy. \u2018People of the Lie\u2019 has some quirky parallel harmonised riffs that rather than somewhat gimmicky as Death\u2019s approach, actually make for a great listen. Also of note is that Carcass would lift the chorus from this song into their own \u2018Heartwork\u2019 and one can be sure Mr Steer and Amott lent their ears to Mille and Frank\u2019s twin guitar approach. \n\nDetractors of this album, strange fellows they are, rely on a comparison to Metallica\u2019s \u2018Ride the Lightning\u2019 and \u2018Master of Puppets\u2019 albums. I never really got a strong Metallica vibe here, one of the riffs does sound similar to the title track of \u2018Ride the Lightning\u2019 but other than that nothing jumps out and screams Metallica. Also, stating a Metallica comparison as a negative thing is ignoring the fact that those records, despite Lars Ulrich being one of the most evil men in existence and a complete moral despot, are actually good. So borrowing from them effectively is hardly a bad thing. If anything the unashamed technicality combined with a brevity in song length is a nod to Megadeth\u2019s more agile approach. \u2018Coma of Souls\u2019 is the perfect partner to Megadeth\u2019s proficient and much loved \u2018Rust in Peace\u2019. But whatever the influence \u2018Coma of Souls\u2019 is far from a bland thrash album, if it was wouldn\u2019t it be Korma of Souls? \n\nIn short \u2018Coma of Souls\u2019 is a fine thrash album, it turned me into a far greater Kreator fan than I once was. It\u2019s an exercise in technically proficient state of the art thrash and while it may lack, ahem, some of the extreme aggression of say \u2018Pleasure to Kill\u2019, it makes up for it with stronger song craft and a more acute sense of melody\u2026but don\u2019t take my word for it, Mr Crow? \n\nCAW!\n",
        "\nI\u2019m honestly flattered when Kreator dishes out crucifying thrash, and I also think watching live DVDs are fun, so what would ever inhibit these two things from working together in an enjoyable fashion? Let\u2019s make it easy for our slower readers: try mixing terrible performances, quality that pisses on your senses, bare-bone extras, and over two hours of wasted time into one shit-filled package that\u2019ll make Kreator fans wish they never even considered coughing up money in the first place. Basically, this release sucks more than any live video I\u2019ve seen, and there\u2019s little doubt it shall ever be dethroned from that disgraceful position. Ten out of ten physicians agree: Kreator\u2019s pulse during \u201cAt The Pulse of Kapitulation\u201d is flatter than a pancake.\n\nOnce our attention is finally focused in, Kreator\u2019s miserable show originally caught on the \u201cLive in East Berlin\u201d VHS shows exactly why it was, and still is, a mistake. For one, the audio and visual quality is vaguely mediocre, often times appearing foggy or lagging; now imagine such ugly features balancing an entire show for over seventy minutes. Also, where are the cameras? I can see three different perspectives at most \u2013 showing J\u00fcrgen Reil\u2019s percussion, Mille Petrozza\u2019s microphone, and an occasional audience shot \u2013 all bringing on the same scenes again and again. It\u2019s like everything was caught with piss-poor equipment from the early 1990s. Oh wait\u2026\n\nWhen it comes to the overall energy of the performance, Kreator is soulless. All four members stand still like frozen statues with their heads lightly bobbing again and again until the show finally finishes. I know that\u2019s quite a bold thing to say considering the concert\u2019s legacy, but watching J\u00fcrgen Reil piss out the most uninspired drum solo I\u2019ve ever seen was when his minimal passion crushed my (remaining) moral; everyone else follows his pathetic attitude like mindless zombies. They do, however, occasionally pitch curve balls by taking a few steps across stage every three songs or so, but still not soil-your-pants worthy like Kreator is known for. Is there anything that doesn\u2019t suck? Watching Mille Petrozza speak to the audience, mainly because his German narration is an identical copy of his singing voice, and it\u2019s kind of funny when you see how alike they are. But yea, it\u2019s shit beside that.\n\nFinally, we have the infamous \u201chorror movie\u201d entitled \u201cHallucinative Comas,\u201d which sounds interesting, but I\u2019m still left wondering what the fuck it is. Picture multiple music videos with Kreator (yea, ok!) and some bald douche bag glimpsing through gory pictures, and presto! You got \u201cHallucinative Comas!\u201d After four songs of that shit, the antagonist (at least I think so) decides to slaughter a random babe with a hook while our German buddies still rock out in the background, making it the one piece of awesomeness in sight. Unfortunately, that little pocket glorifying random murder and boring thrash quickly dies within time, and soon enough, empty videos just keep on coming. I do think the title is fitting, mainly because REM cycles had raped my mind beyond measure when it finally finished. Thanks Kreator, for inducing one hallucinative (that\u2019s not even a word, you twits) coma after another!\n\nI find this set\u2019s moniker rather humorous, because Kreator\u2019s pulse slowly loses its spike from powerless performances, pseudo-films, and crappy extras not even worthy of dirt; it does, however, excel at collecting dust, and can also provide good blunt force if needed. When analyzing a DVD release, anyone can typically find something good, but \u201cAt The Pulse of Kapitulation\u201d is a special case lacking substance in all areas, even when boldly attempting things like a horror movie; it\u2019s really too bad. The white sheets haven been placed over Kreator\u2019s disgraceful effort, and all I can do is suggest you avoid this pompous abomination like a horde of gremlins trucking toward your asshole.\n\nThis review was written for: www.Thrashpit.com\n",
        "\nSeriously that cover is so \"metal-ist-krieg!\" I almost died of lead poisoning. *sigh* bad joke, I know. But it's still a damn good cover. The other thing about the package is that it comes with song lyrics unlike every other live album I've bought. Though the formatting of the lyrics is weird (see \"Pleasure to Kill\" in the booklet) and the liner notes are wrong (it says live in Sao Paulo but Mille says \"How are you PUSAAAAAAN?\").\n\nThe live atmosphere is kept here and it's very...well it makes you fell like you're front row center. You can hear everything (but the bass) nicely and the songs are pretty true to the album versions. Mille's voice sounds fucking hoarse and it's not like his old style at all, it's like he's becoming Perseverance-era Chuck though not as screechy but still high pitched. Given he's what like 40 when this was released? I suppose it's not that bad, but it's a tad off-putting.\n\nSongs...lots of new ones, lots of old ones. The classics are all here of course. Why there's \"Extreme Aggressions\" and \"People of the Lie\". Is that \"Terrorzone\"? Hey \"Coma of Souls\"! Yep it's a pretty eclectic mix alongside such 'new classics' as \"Violent Revolution\" or \"Renewal\". However they played a truncated version of \"Pleasure to Kill\" that breaks off at the bridge. Other than that, most of the old songs are played with heart, they sound like they're 20 again, except Mille for reasons above. Ventor's drumming is done admirably in a live setting, the guitars are pretty clear, but the bass sounds pretty similar to the guitars most of the time. The crowd is energetic for Asians (hehehe), and the do all the things crowds do.\n\nAll in all it's a great live album, for a FIRST. For a band that's been active for the better part of 20 years, you'd think they'd have a few live albums but no, it's they're first one and it took nearly 20 years since their debut to have one. Yes go ahead and buy it, you'll be getting your money's worth.\n",
        "\nAlright, call me crazy but I like this album. I\u2019ve always thought that Kreator were a bit too monotonous in their way of doing extreme thrash even if their first albums are very violent and enjoyable. Something changed from Extreme Aggression and new elements filled their sound, that was becoming more technical and less impulsive album after album. Renewal and Outcast were two examples of that (r)evolution, especially the last one where the band took another direction, focusing on the more dark and almost gothic side. \n\nAfter two years from that Outcast, Kreator returned with a brand new album. The \u201cGerman thrash metal scene\u201d was a bit in crisis due to the Destruction\u2019s musical fall and the new punkish influences by Sodom. Talking about this Endorama, Kreator have abandoned definitively thrash metal to become almost totally goth-electronic rock. Finding something metal here is very difficult and it can be considered just according to some guitars riffs. \n\nThe atmospheres are dreaming with that always present, dark touch inherited by the Outcast album. The songs are always very, very, very catchy, losing completely the impact. The vocals by Mille are far less screamed with more whispered parts. \u201cGolden Age\u201d is a very good opener and features always sweet melodies with an Arabic oriented solo. The tempo are mostly mid paced and almost martial. The following title track is a bit faster but always martial with weird vocals.\n\nWhat makes the difference in these songs is the constant use of the lead guitars lines that lead the game, filling them with odd or melodic parts. The rhythmic guitars parts are constantly in balance between arpeggios or single note palm muting, just to create a support under the wall of melody and synth sounds. The melodies on \u201cShadowland\u201d are really great (for a rock band) with a faster bass drum work and some more \u201cmetal\u201d sounds during the verse. \u201cChosen Few\u201d is average with less ideas, instead of \u201cEverlasting Flame\u201d that has lots of gothic influences in it. This is one of the most beautiful songs here, but it\u2019s not metal at all.\n\nThe keyboards sounds are preponderant in most of the songs, like in the following \u201cPassage Of Babylon\u201d or \u201cFuture Ring\u201d, that unfortunately mark a weaker songwriting than the other songs before. Anyway, they are always quite enjoyable. \u201cEntry\u201d is a very romantic, instrumental piano song, destroyed by the modern approach of \u201cSoul Eraser\u201d: a quite shitty song with plenty of filtrated vocals. \u201cWilling Spirit\u201d is ok in the melodies, while \u201cPandemonium\u201d is very similar to \u201cPhobia\u201d (Outcast) in the tempo and rhythmic riffage. \n\nThe last \u201cTyranny\u201d is average in melodies and catchiness. Surely, they gave their best in the first part of the album, while the second one features some fillers. Overall, it\u2019s a quite good album by a complete different Kreator. An album for open-minded people, so forget thrash metal here.\n",
        "\nThe 1985 Kreator\u2019s debut is a fucking brutal assault. The thrash influences are preponderant but we can find death ones also because the group seems really bad ass, pissed off with the rest of the world and the violence of execution is inhuman for the period. With the title track we can really taste the group\u2019s essence, made of thousands guitars riffs, restless drumming and the screamed vocals by Mille.\n\nIt was so hard to do this kind of metal at the beginning of the 80s and they were surely the precursors of a new form, a new conception of extreme music. The pure thrash metal was the main genre at the time but this goes beyond, for sure. \u201cTotal Death\u201d has in it riffs directly taken from Destruction\u2019s \u201cMad Butcher\u201d and Exodus\u2019 \u201cStrike Of The Beast\u201d during the refrain. Funny! Here the vocals are on the borderline between thrash and black! Unbelievable.\n\nThe mid paced parts finally come from the third track, \u201cStorm Of The Beast\u201d with a great galloping guitars work, more various than in the previous tracks. This song is definitely more \u201cpure thrash\u201d but as you know, also the production contributes in creating a gloomier sound that sometimes can be categorized as death metal. The solos are very similar in these songs but terribly good without being technical or melodic. They can be seen as simple free rein in pure Slayer style with shredded parts. \n\n\u201cTormentor\u201d is a piece of death/thrash history that still nowadays is played in every single gig by Mille and Co. The main riff is really old school thrash. The sequence \u201cSon Of Evil\u201d- \u201cFlag of Hate\u201d really takes your breath away reducing you to ashes. I thank a lot the mid paced beginning to \u201cCry War\u201d because I was almost exhausted\u2026I longed for peace and quite but the punkish, Sodom-inspired refrain pushed another nail in my already bleeding head. \n\nTo say nothing of the speed/thrash blast of \u201cBonebraker\u201d and \u201cLiving Fear\u201d\u2026pure madness. This is where groups like Sepultura, Death, Obituary and many, many others took inspiration to set up their music. This is a piece of history and the true beginning of the mythical, worldwide known GERMAN THRASH.\n",
        "\nAh! Melody! How terrible! Seriously... I think this album gets a lot of criticism that it just doesn't seem to deserve. I would like to first point out some of the things that I have heard for this release that I just don't understand.\n\n1.) Enemy of God was the only 'thrash' song on the album - I'm going to have to completely disagree with this. In fact, it's not even the fastest song on the CD... It's actually paled in tempo highly by the track Murder Fantasies, as well as several of the other tracks. It's actually, from a technical standpoint, one of the more simple songs on the CD.\n\n2.) This album is a melodic death metal release - ...No... Just... No... I could only see this if you have a very, very open interpretation as to what exactly death metal. Vocally, this is not even remotely close to a death metal style voicing at all (\"But he's growling!\" uh... No. It's just his particular way of screaming in a way. Screaming is not death metal, think of your old thrash bands for a second). In terms of drums, also a no. Guitars? Maybe a little, but here's a little side note: the guitar work in melodic death metal is extremely similar to that of thrash metal.\n\n3.) There's too much harmony - Oh no! Tonal variance and intricacy! Let's make things more simple, that's metal, right? There's a difference between shit harmony and good harmony. Shit harmony is either entirely in thirds or all in one interval. If you look at the harmonies in Voices of the Dead you'll notice that there are a lot of parts that are harmonized in opposing directions, a quality that isn't exactly common in this day in age.\n\n4.) It was produced to cleanly - Yes, it's such a terrible thing to actually be able to fully hear and understand the notes and emotion behind the songs. What a terrible concept. Thrash isn't a production style.\n\nAnyway, on to the review.\n\nEnemy of God is a powerful and yet different release from Kreator. If you're actually willing to be open minded about a band being open about it's own interpretations of their genre, then you probably won't have any problem with Enemy of God. It's not an old-school thrash release by any means and yes it is more melodic than Kreator's previous releases, but that does not in any way stop this album from being thrash. It seems like many people seem to confuse what it really meant to be thrash and as of such have sort of lost touch with the original roots of the genre. New styles of neo-metal which have developed a strong sense of melody seem to be tampering with many people's opinions of this CD. I will say that this is a very melodic release from Kreator but I will also say that this in no way decreases the instrumental quality of this album. I will in fact say that this is a better step for Kreator, and is in my opinion the most expressive of all of their releases.\n\nThe entire album is an extremely emotional experience which is kind of odd for a thrash release and I think this is again where a lot of people can get confused. It seems like Mille actually managed to get his feeling back when he wrote Enemy of God, but it also seems like the main feeling for the entire album is despair rather than hate. This is very different from most of Kreator's previous releases, but again I have to reiterate that just because something is different from what you expect, it does not make it bad. To be honest, I think this is actually a great change from their typical release because it not only creates a different sound from what you've come to know, but it also created much more emotionally powerful songs. This is even weird for me to say, but I will actually go out to say that Enemy of God is the most unconventionally emotional thrash release I have ever heard.\n\nI like to think of this album from Mille's point of view. He didn't just set out to make an album that you can scream out in rage, he actually set out to make something new and different for himself and it seems in this age of the metal community that's something that we only want from newer bands. If Kreator didn't have a 20+ year career under their belts you guys would be all sitting here applauding about the next step forward for the band, but it seems as though you've all come to expect just one thing from a band.\n\nIs Kreator stepping into new territory with Enemy of God? Yes. But I say good for them. If they want to become more creatively diverse than I will applaud them for that. In the mean time, we get an album that is not only instrumentally spectacular, but also ripe with the aggression of the old while adding in things we haven't seen before from Kreator.\n\nGood things: It's a really good thrash release no matter how you look at it. It has a good array of different sounds on the album and it makes the listening experience a lot less monotonous once you really start listening to the album. I also like Mille's voice a lot more on this recording than I have in previous recordings.\n\nBad things: It's not what you're hoping for as a long time Kreator fan, but try to think outside of the shackles you've put on the band and you can actually find a really great album.\n\nMy personal opinion: I have been a fan of thrash for many years, although probably not as long as most of the people here (I'm only 19, give me a break). Bay area thrash was my genre, and the German style really didn't play that much into what I've listened to. That being said, I would like to point out exactly how great I think this album is.\n\nThis is my favorite album. Period. I have never heard a better release from any band. I have yet to find an album more suiting to my musical tastes and personal emotional responses that I get from this CD. I would also like to say that when I first heard this album, I actually wasn't that much of a fan. I was also a bit put off by it not being what I expected, but once I got past that I realized exactly how amazing this album really is.\n",
        "\nThrash is a stagnant old soldier of a genre that hasn't exactly been flourishing in the last 20-odd years, but there have been several diamonds-in-the-rough sorts of bands popping up that have revitalized it a bit and kept the \"old school\" sound alive. While the modern school of Thrash is not usually viewed as anything worthwhile, this album is what I'd consider an example of that school done right - punchy, heavy riffs with melodic, winding solos and gritty, rough vocals that are still understandable and nowhere near the Metalcore territory. Kreator have been taking some heat for this one, but by the Gods I can't see why, as this is a damn fine album from a veteran band.\n\nThis album isn't always a straight ahead riff-hammer bludgeon attack, with some more melodic leads and matured songwriting tendencies over the 80s Kreator, but make no mistake, this IS a purebred Thrash record through and through, and Mille and co. do not let you forget that. The leads might be more melodic and profound than those on Pleasure to Kill, but Enemy of God is still 12 tracks and almost an hour of intense, face-ripping Thrash that is sure to please just about anyone who isn't stuck in 1987. The title track just fucking smokes, and it's easily the best song on the album, but then we have smoldering slabs of Metal like \"World Anarchy,\" \"Dystopia\" and \"Impossible Brutality\" to keep the flame burning. The album takes a bit of a dip around \"When Death Takes Its Dominion,\" but picks up again at the end with two killers in the form of the vicious \"Under a Total Blackened Sky\" and the slow, pummeling epic \"The Ancient Plague.\"\n\nMille Petrozza is in top form here, shrieking and blaspheming his way through every single track with manic energy and rock-solid conviction, every bit the perfect narrator of the apocalypse. The guitar tone is thick and meaty and it will smash your skull to smithereens, and the production as a whole is just excellent - clear and polished, yet not at all neutered, with every bit of the aggression that a Thrash band should always have. Very well done.\n\nDon't pay attention to anyone who tells you this is weak or limp or any of that, for Enemy of God is a triumphant Thrash monolith in a time when there aren't too many others. Not essential, and there are a few too many fillers here, but this is ass-kicking good all the same. Recommended.\n\nOriginally written for http://www.metalcrypt.com\n",
        "\nAfter two weak albums (for thrash metal only but not for the genre itself in my opinion), mighty Kreator\u2019s comeback to roots is amazing! Well, not really to the roots (1985) but we can consider this album an excellent follow up to the great Coma Of Souls or Cause For Conflict. After the goth oriented albums it was very hard to imagine a thrash metal comeback but every doubt was destroyed by \u201cViolent Revolution\u201d.\n\n\"Reconquering The Throne\" is a fucking great opener, one of the best ones I\u2019ve ever heard. Fast bass drum, up tempo and good thrashing riffage with an eye to the melody, always, but at the same time so fast and made for pure mosh madness. \"The Patriarch\" is kinda melodic intro to the title track. This is a fucking epic and violent song. The refrain is awesome. \"All Of the Same Blood\" seems to come out from Coma Of Souls with an excellent, always inspired guitar work, made for pure hadbanging. Even here the refrain is awesome and the solos are always well balanced between melody and speed. \n\nThe bass/guitars melodic intro to \"Servant In Heaven, King In Hell\" is a prelude to a massive semi-mid tempo song. Great and damn heavy. \"The Second Awaking\" is probably my favourite song here: pure thrash with fast tempo, awesome riffs and the Petrozza vocals at their best. It's very good to notice that the most brutal parts are always well balanced with influences from the most melodic period of the group.\n\n\"Ghetto War\" seems to come out directly from Outcast album for the guitar riffs and the tempo, but this one is surely better structured and more thrash oriented. The arpeggio and the melodies of Mille\u2019s vocals are immediately blown away by a fast attack on \"Replicas Of Life\", a good example of how doing a 7 minutes song without being boring. Perfect. The martial drums intro to \"Slave Machinery\" is followed by a perfect balanced song between pure thrash and melodies during the refrain (some arpeggios under the electric guitar sound).\n\n\"Bittersweet Revenge\" is more impact in the sound with up tempo and fast bass drum. \"Mind Of Fire\" is more melodic and with more Outcast influenced while the final hit is \"System Decay\", in pure thrash style with a melodic solo and the evocative vocals, immediately forgotten by some up tempo and fast drums. Well, aal in all a great comeback followed, in the same year, by the Destruction and Sodom ones. They reconquered the throne!\n",
        "\nSo here is how my experience of Pleasure to Kill went. I got it quite a while ago, a few years I think, in part because I'd heard a lot of good things about it and in part because the cover was absolutely badass. I was disappointed. Now, all this time later, I've gone back to it to try again, as I feel my tastes have progressed and developed since then, so maybe I'll think differently.\nBut I'm afraid not. It still comes across as the same pile of over-the-top, poseurish, exagerrated \"blargh, look how extreme we are!\" tripe. It has one or two redeeming moments, but certainly nothing worth the endless praise it often receives. It feels far too much like it's trying desperately to be interesting, and missing the point.\n\nIt's just plain boring. I can see why some people go on about it, but to me that's a kneejerk reaction. When you first hear it it -does- sound very brutal and vicious, but it soon wears thing. It just sounds too much like one long beat. Individual songs by many other thrash bands have more variation than this entire album. And in truth, even ignoring that blandness it's fairly average at best. The riffs may be delivered with a fast-pace, but this is thrash, they usually are. To me what sells riffs in this genre is not just speed, but technicality and memorability, and Pleasure to Kill is lacking in both. They have a degree of technical flair, but nothing to write home about, and they're very much lacking in the latter, they're totally bland and default \"Play fast and slap on a blast beat\" stuff.\n\nThe sound itself isn't too bad, although still not particularly to my tastes. It's trying too hard to be extreme, and doesn't carry it off. Also, it sounds too much like a precursor to death metal, I have trouble liking anything that sounds like it influenced the development of that particular genre (it's also worth noting that, as in a lot of cases, this albums seems to be reviewed by many as a death metal album without them realising it. How you see something influences it. In short, as thrash this is lacking, as death it was something special at the time).\n\nThe songs just aren't memorable in any way. They all flow into one another and by the end of it I feel I've not heard anything interesting or exciting at all. Maybe it was fairly new in it's day, but today it's just boring. And not because there are more extreme things, but rather because it's trying very hard to be extreme and doesn't have the substance to back it up.\n\nThe lyrics are pretty mediocre, basic waffling about death and so on. Don't get me wrong, songs about death are great, but I like them to be a bit more developed than\n\"He eats the heart of your wife\nAnd rips her cunt inside\nYou know now it's your turn\nThe others have already died\"\nCompare the album to something like Metallica's \"Ride the Lightning\", another one dealing with death as a theme, and the difference couldn't be more apparent. Kreator's \"Pleasure to Kill\" just feels too simplistic, while Ride the Lightning shows real intelligence. Again, brutality is good, but there needs to be something behind it. I can't really give track specifics, because as I say, they all kind of blend into one another. Any points made apply to all of them, really.\n\nOverall, it just seems underdeveloped. Kreator might sag in the 90s, but I feel they went on to produce far better works beyond Pleasure to Kill. Extreme Aggression had the same amount of anger and ferocity, but the riffs were much more audible and memorable, and the lyrics more developed, while still striving for a punchy simplisity. Equally, their latest works, Violent Revolution and Enemy of God, beautifully combined their early aggression with their later melody to create a very nice end result. Both these eras surpass Pleasure to Kill, they might not have as much sheer anger or evil, but that isn't all there is to thrash or metal.\n\nSo to summarise, it's nothing that special as thrash metal goes. Metallica did things more intellectually, Megadeth did things more fun, Destruction managed brutality without seeming so overblown, and Morbid Saint did evil thrash with much more impressive and catchy riffs. Any number of bands did thrash better, and while there's nothing inherently bad about Pleasure to Kill, it is far too heavily praised. Not only do other bands do thrash better, but even Kreator themselves did, eventually. It's trying to be more impressive than it actually is, relying on extreme value and a never-ending stream of rapid riffs and drumming to get it's rather flimsy point across. I've given it the score I have because there -is- some skill in here, hard as it is to make out, although it would be much better utilised on other albums.\n",
        "\nDoes it work out? For the most part, it does. However, this new style for Kreator would not be perfected until theit next album, Coma of Souls. This album still has good riffs, but alot of them feel a bit watered down, and don't punch as hard as their earlier albums. The majority of songs on here are still quite good though. Kreator, for the meantime, were just at a creative slump. They weren't sure rather to keep going with their trademark aggressive sound, or go for a more melodic and catchy, yet still heavy approach. Kreator tend to do a little of both on this album. Sometimes, it works out (title track, Betrayal), and at other times it doesn't quite work out (Some Pain Will Last).\n\nThe title track and Betrayal are the best songs on this album. They mix the right amount of melody and aggressiveness and both songs are rather catchy as well. They preceeded what was to come on their next album. No Reason to Exist and Bringer of Torture are also great songs as well. However, it's just songs like Stream of Consciousness and Some Pain Will Last. The formal was rather dull but not too bad, but the latter is rather mediocre. It's probably the worst song Kreator ever made in the 80s. The song is too slow and long, and tends to bore the hell out of me after a few listens. However, the good outweighs the bad on this album.\n\nThis is the worst album out of Kreator's first five. However, considering the score I gave it, it's still a pretty damn good album. It's just that Kreator did a whole lot better before and after this album. It has a little bit of both aggressiveness and melody. However, if you want aggressiveness, get their first three albums first, but if you're looking for more melody and catchy/memorable songs, get Coma of Souls first. Regardless, this should be the last out of the first five Kreator albums you should get. It's still worth your time though.\n",
        "\nSo this is the debut album of one of the most influential and aggressive thrash bands ever. This band makes Slayer sound like wimps. They're a lot more aggressive and overral better than Slayer as well. Speaking of Slayer, this album reminds me alot of Slayer's Show No Mercy. Just l;ike that album, It has a very raw and NWOBHM-ish sound to it. However, just about every song on here is fast, angry, and most of all evil. To add to it, this album features two vocalists. The first one being Ventor who amazingly also plays drums here. Then, we have the second and better fitted singer for this band, Mille. He sings with a black metalish style, and on this album, it fits perfectly.\n\nAmongst the highlights here are the title track, Total Death, Tormentor, Flag of Hate, and Bonebreaker. Bonebreaker oddly has a fun punkish sound to it, but it still has monster riffs. The other songs are raging thrashers that you must headbang to. Mille's vocals are what really makes this album great. I mean, his voice just fits the music almost perfectly. Ventor isn't too shabby either, though. Another thing about Kreator is that whenever they play fast songs, they never fail to impress, but whenever they play slower songs, it always sounds a bit dull and uninteresting. Dying Victims is a great example. It's not a bad song, but it's just not as bloddy awesome as the other songs on this album.\n\nIf you're a fan of raw sounding thrash ala Kill 'Em All or Show No Mercy, or just love very aggressive thrash, then by all means get this album. Sure, it's no Pleasure to Kill or Coma of Souls, but it's sure as hell worth your time.\n",
        "\nKreator's breakthrough album. Released in 1986, this album joins Slayer's Reign in Blood, Metallica's Master of Puppets, and Megadeth's Peace Sells...But Who's Buying? as a thrash classic from 1986. What a year.\n\nIs this really their best album? In my opinion, no. Extreme Aggression, Terrible Certainty, and Coma of Souls are all better, with better songwritting and composition, but Pleasure to Kill still remains one of the best thrash metal albums ever.\n\nPleasure to Kill is very different from their later albums. It's faster, rawer, and much more extreme. The lyrical themes are all about death, gore, and violence, a very typical theme for an extreme band. After the opening intro, Chior of the Damned, a soft melody on guitar, the album explodes with Ripping Corpse, going at speeds of about a hundred miles an hour. The speed continues on the follow up, Death is Your Savior. With drummer Ventor doing vocals on this one, it's amazing to think, he can sing and drum at that speed at the same time. Both tracks are easily two of the best songs on the album. The title track is even better though. The intense speed is still here and the overall song is just brutal and outstanding. Next, Ventor returns on vocals on the slightly slower Riot of Violence, other standout track. This song makes me headband like crazy everytime I hear it. The Pestilence is another great thrasher. Carrion is even better, starting out as a thrash classic and slowing down in the interlude, followed by exploding into a thrash powerhouse. Ventor returns for one last take on vocals with the followup, Command of the Blade, another crazy headbanger. Mille returns to singing on the next song, Under the Guillotine. Not much is different from the other songs in this one. It's got speed, power, and a very kickass series of solos. My version of the album includes the tracks from the Flag of Hate demo, three more thrashers. Flag of Hate is an instant killer with powerful riffs and vocals. Take Their Lives is another great song with a nice opener. The final track is the 7 minute epic, Awakening of the Gods, easily the best song on the demo.\n\nThe vocals on this album are very unique. Mille's voice is aggressive and raspy and at the same time, you can still understand what he's saying. He's not one of those Deathcore vocalists who just grunt a bunch of random shit. Ventor's vocals are a little more extreme. Not as good as Mille, but he's still standsout a lot on Death is Your Savior. \n\nThe guitar work is amazing, a necesity for a thrash album. Each riff is outstanding and will make you want to mosh until you die. The solos on this album, however, are a little bit of a disappointment, as they are very sloppy and not meaningfull. Still the solos are always good to listen to. The bass is hearable, something I really like, even though he's mainly sticking to following Mille's riffs. Ventor's drumming is intense, very intense. It's what makes the album more extreme than their other albums. Overall, the musicians all standout very well.\n\nThat said, this album is a must have for any thrash fan along with Coma of Souls, Terrible Certainty, Extreme Aggression, and even Kreator's newest album, Enemy of God. Easily one of the greatest thrash metal albums.\n",
        "\nSometimes I don\u2019t get thrash fans. All Kreator albums from \u201cEndless Pain\u201d to \u201cComa of Souls\u201d are rightfully regarded as thrash classics, but as soon as \u201cRenewal\u201d was released, Kreator died for a large part of their fanbase. I have to admit, I have not heard \u201cRenewal\u201d yet, but \u201cCause for Conflict\u201d is pretty fucking excellent. \n\nIn the early 90s, Kreator grew tired of writing about the different pleasures of killing, pain and aggression, therefore they not only changed their lyrical content, they also decided to shift their sound into a new direction. \n\n\u201cCause for Conflict\u201d is quite different to their older work, while still retaining some of their former core elements. \u201cCause for Conflict\u201d is still mainly thrash metal, albeit a tad more modern with slight death metal tendencies and a healthy dose of hardcore punk and slight groove metal touches. It surely is one of the thrashiest albums of 1995, a time where thrash was not only on its knees, but more like the remains of a rotting corpse.\n\nMille\u2019s vocals are entirely different to their older work, as they quite resemble a typical hardcore bark. Yet, to my own surprise, I actually prefer them to his old, not exactly great vocal style (I always thought that his vocal work was way worse than that of Destruction or Sodom). His delivery tends to be a bit monotone at times, but overall, he\u2019s decent.\n\nJoe Cangelosi\u2019s drumming is very diverse, showing proficiency in all speeds. Some awesome fills, interesting offbeat rhythms and generally wicked drumlines spice up the album to a great extent. \n\nThe bass playing is heavy as hell, giving the overall sound an extremely thick bottom-end, which is definitely suitable for the general sound of this album.\n\nThe only drawbacks on here are the fastest parts which often are a tad too punkish and sometimes even descent into mid-\u201cReign in Blood\u201d incoherence (I agree with the common opinion that about all songs in-between \u201cAngel of Death\u201d and \u201cRaining Blood\u201d lack any distinctive, memorable parts).\n\nApart from that, the album is quite great, especially in the songwriting department. Original and overall coherent songwriting and the courage to experiment make this album a winner.\n\nI don\u2019t see why this is hated so much, as it\u2019s quite an excellent thrasher. It's not exactly an essential album, but check it out if you enjoy your thrash a tad more experimental/adventurous. \n\nHighlights: Catholic Despot, Hate Inside Your Head, Dogmatic, Sculpture of Regret\n",
        "\nWhen a band reaches their peak in a certain style, it\u2019s hard to come up with something similar and yet fresh. A lot of bands tend to experiment. Take \u2018Force Of Habit\u2019 (Exodus) or when Quorthon didn\u2019t know what to do after \u2018Twilight of The Gods\u2019. Same thing happened with Kreator. They lost control after Coma Of Souls and didn\u2019t fully found their thrash metal roots back again until 11 years later\u2026.\n\nAnyway, this does not mean that everything they did in between is bad. Far from it. It was just different and some ideas were better than others. And concerning \u2018Renewal\u2019 I can only say I really like the album. I\u2019m glad I got the chance to see most of these songs live when Kreator toured in 1992. Songs such as \u2018Winter Martyrium\u2019 and \u2018Karmic Wheel\u2019 were simply mind blowing in their live versions that tour. I liked these songs on the album as well but with the light show and dynamics these songs rules the setlist. I\u2019ve always been fond of industrial influences in metal when used properly and I really like the atmospheric section of \u2018Karmic Wheel\u2019. Yes, these two songs are definitely my favourite songs on renewal.\n\nThere is also something to complain here. As said these song sounded better live. This was partially because of the production. Although the dry sound on \u2018Renewal\u2019 had its charm, I would have especially preferred a better drum production and more definition in the guitars. A good example is the song \u2018Zero to None\u2019 which would have stood out more if it\u2019d had a \u201cExtreme Aggressions\u201d or \u201cComa Of Souls\u201d sound.\n\nSecondly the vocals. Mille shouldn\u2019t have done this. There was nothing wrong with the way he sang earlier records and of course one may grow but on Renewal the monotony was killing some songs. Best example of this is the title track. It was a more than decent mid tempo thrasher in their earlier People Of The Lie (Coma Of Souls) style, but the vocals are very monotone and do some real damage to the song. Pitty. I must however state that his vocals on the chorus of \u2018Depression Unrest\u2019 are superb and with ease the best on the album. \n\nRenewal had some marvellous ideas and songs (Winter Martyrium, Karmic Wheel, Depression Unrest) but the production and vocals are really lacking at times. Therefore it\u2019s a very good album, but not an excellent one.\n",
        "\nOne could say on this album Kreator made the least progress compared to the previous release. They only slightly improved some elements. Especially the production. The sole reason this album is not my favorite Kreator album is because Extreme Aggression was slightly more aggressive and had a less polished sound. Apart from that almost everything is perfect on Coma Of Souls save a few lesser interesting songs.\n\nThe first 5 songs are all brilliant. \u2018When The Sun Burns Red\u2019 is a typical up tempo opener. Fast, catchy and filled with riffs and great leads. Welcome to Frank Blackfire. \u2018Coma Of Souls\u2019 is an excellent sing-along title track. \u2018People Of The Lie\u2019 however is the best mid paced song Kreator has ever written in their career. Hell, the chorus was so good even British gods Carcass actually stole the essence for their own song \u2018Heartwork\u2019!\n\nOne thing you can\u2019t deny about \u2018World Beyond\u2019 is that the song sounds happy. There\u2019s something funny about it. The vocal line, the polka beat. It\u2019s a happy tune but a good one. This is followed by \u2018Terror Zone\u2019 which compositionally is reminiscent of People Of The Lie approach but has more up tempo moments, is slightly extended and to be honest a highlight of Kreator\u2019s career.\n\nThe second half of the album is superb as well but not with the same grandeur as the first half. \u2018Agents of Brutality\u2019and \u2018Material World Paranoia\u2019 just continue the awesome thrash metal assault and I\u2019ve always had a soft spot for the incidentally groovy \u2018Hidden Dictator\u2019.\n\nWhat can I say, it is their second best album ever and I wonder if that will ever change.\n",
        "\nHoly hell what a progress Kreator made here. Going from \u2018Pleasure to Kill\u2019 to this piece of madness within 18 months. Don\u2019t worry, they hadn\u2019t gone soft but they did get started writing better riffs and more complex compositions. Some songs here still sound over the top enthusiastic but the sloppiness of \u2018Pleasure to Kill\u2019 was left behind and also the production was remarkably better this time.\n\n\u2018Blind Faith\u2019 is an immediate thrash metal highlight and one of the best up tempo Kreator songs in their entire discography. \u2018Storming with Menace\u2019 is slightly less impressive but good as well. The title track has become a classic and is still played live after all these years. Great song but obviously I will always prefer \u2018Blind Faith\u2019. \n\n\u2018Toxic Trace\u2019, \u2018One Of Us\u2019 and \u2018Behind The Mirror\u2019 are other highlights as well being less aggressive than Kreator used to be on their previous album but very genuine thrash metal compositions with typical Kreator riffs, good changes in pace, key and easily their most dynamic songs so far.\n\nThis leaves only two songs I\u2019ve never been too enthusiastic about. On \u2018As The World Burns\u2019 and \u2018No Escape\u2019 the mid and slow paced sections sound too generic and dull. I do play these songs for the continuity of the album though, I never skip them. They do in fact have a useful effect on the album.\n\nThe album is overlooked by many but for me it is their third best album. Can\u2019t live without it. Blind Faith!\n",
        "\nWith the thrash metal revival that\u2019s been going on now for some years a lot of albums have been rediscovered by those only now discovering the eighties thrash metal. The newbies focus their archaeological results on \u2018Pleasure To Kill\u2019 as being Kreator\u2019s best album because it is their fastest and most aggressive album and therefore they claim it is their best and most old school thrash metal album. Being the fastest and most aggressive Kreator album might be a true statement, but it surely isn\u2019t their best album. The following three albums were compositionally simply better.\n\n\u2018Pleasure to Kill\u2019 almost kills itself with enthusiasm. The compositions are extremely simple and transparent but the enactment is extremely sloppy. The pace is so high the band themselves have trouble keeping it up. This of course gives the album that extra edge of aggression resulting in a very hyperactive classic piece of thrash metal. The intensity and energetic continuity of \u2018Pleasure to Kill\u2019 makes up easily for the inconsistent debut \u2018Endless Pain\u2019.\n\nA few classic Kreator songs can be found here, the most famous ones being the title track and \u2018under The Guillotine\u2019. Drummer Ventor is lead vocalist on three songs but his performance is poor compared to Mille\u2019s parts. \u2018Riot Of Violence\u2019 is a simple composition with a few changes of key and pace but objectively speaking the song has a copy-paste feeling surrounding it. Putting a few riffs and rhythms together and calling it a song in this case doesn\u2019t work. I never understood why this song became so popular but I have to admit liking the very catchy chorus. No, I\u2019d rather hear the earlier mentioned two classics and the powerful thrasher \u2018Death Is Your Saviour\u2019 in third place . On this song I have to say Ventor\u2019s vocals work out fine .\n\nIt may seem I\u2019m bashing the album a bit but do not fear. I still consider this to be a Kreator classic, and I stress the \u2018A\u2019. Can\u2019t imagine my collection without it nor can any thrash metal collection be without it. Therefore I just have to give it 85 points.\n",
        "\nNot a single bad song or note to be found here! Extreme Aggression was released in an era when being only fast wasn\u2019t enough anymore for thrash metal bands. The fans wanted more and Kreator provided successfully! Surely there are still plenty of fast songs and moments to be found here that are easily some of the best Kreator thrashers ever. \n\nDid I hear anyone say \u2018Betrayer\u2019? That\u2019s right! One of the best speedy thrashers Germany has ever unleashed upon mankind! Same goes for the title track by the way. Not forgetting to mention the up tempo catchy tunes \u2018Stream Of Consciousness\u2019 and \u2018Bringer Of Torture\u2019.\n\nWhat gave Kreator an extra edge on \u2018Extreme Aggression\u2019 was their stop-and-go mentality. Play furious, hold back for a moment and then go again increased the experience of speed very effectively. Kreator could also change pace so easily one wouldn\u2019t even notice. And when you did notice it, it brought the tension to the material. \n\nOther tracks on the album that exceed the average level of excellence are the extremely dynamic \u2018Love Us Or Hate Us\u2019 and \u2018Some Pain Will Last\u2019. These songs reveal Kreator\u2019s true potential of changing pace and key fluently without losing control of the composition.\n\n\u2018Extreme Aggression\u2019 is the missing link between their earlier raging period and their very clean Coma Of Souls-techno thrash era. It has the best of both worlds and therefore remains their strongest album to date.\n",
        "\nI have tried for a long time to enjoy this band just as much as their Bay Area counterparts. Kreator is often praised by 80\u2019s metal enthusiasts, and don\u2019t get me wrong, they have several good songs and are highly influential. But they still suffer frequently from a trait that should particularly be absent from this type of music: boredom! Their earlier albums never had the aggressive catchiness of Kill \u2018Em All or Pleasures of The Flesh, the epic solos of Bonded By Blood or the near-apocalyptic sense of urgency of the equally speedy and masterful Reign in Blood. You can be as fast as humanly possible, but without melody it\u2019s useless!\n\nUsually \u201cexperimentation\u201d and \u201cthrash\u201d are two words that should not go together (post 1988-Metallica, Diabolus in Musica, Youthanasia and the entire Machine Head catalogue are some examples that come to mind). But \u201cEndorama\u201d avoids this trap, and while often crossing the boundaries into industrial and (gasp!) goth elements, generally works musically. For starters, Mille Petrozza\u2019s vocals and lyrics are decent. His thrash equivalents are above-average, and the trend continues throughout this album without sounding too whiny or lame. The opening two tracks \u201cGolden Age\u201d and \u201cEndorama\u201d have memorable riffs and leads, with the former containing the best chorus on the album. \u201cEverlasting Flame\u201d has a solid intro and overall song structure that makes you forget about the slightly mallcorish vocals. \u201cEntry\u201d is a brief but highly effective interlude, while \u201cWilling Spirit\u201d has another great chorus. \u201cPandemonium\u201d is the album\u2019s biggest hint at thrash, and is actually above average for Kreator. \n\nThat being said, there are some real duds on this album. \u201cShadowland\u201d suffers from the typically dull Kreator riffs and overdone drumming, while the break in \u201cFuture Ring\u201d is very lame, and \u201cSoul Eraser\u201d is downright annoying (especially since it kills off a great instrumental track). Much electronica is used throughout this album, but it is still largely guitar driven, so it thankfully still sounds more like metal than Nine Inch Nails. The groove-oriented riffs and (you guessed it!) melody in \u201cEndorama\u201d are a welcome change in pace for this band, although it appears Kreator have returned to their roots with the mediocre thrash in \u201cEnemy of God\u201d.\n",
        "\n\u2018Violent Revolution\u2019 is widely regarded as Kreator\u2019s big return to Thrash Metal. Stilistically, this is correct. After the \u2013 in my eyes \u2013 succesful experimentation on \u2018Renewal\u2019 and \u2018Outcast\u2019 and the disasters known as \u2018Cause For Conflict\u2019 and \u2018Endorama\u2019, \u2018Violent Revolution\u2019 is a return to the Thrash compositions they are known for. For me, there is a strong sense of ambivalence about that though. It\u2019s nothing compared to \u2018Coma Of Souls\u2019 and the album sounds horribly uninspired at some points.\n\nMaybe I made a mistake by checking out this album after checking out the live album \u2018Live Kreation\u2019. The songs from this album sound much better in a live setting. Opening track \u2018Reconquering The Throne\u2019 is a painful display of that. Mille Petrozza\u2019s lead vocals sound as if he wanted a day off rather than recording his vocals. In addition, the production is probably the most boring I have ever heard on a high-profile Thrash album, which is quite surprising, as it is an Andy Sneap-production. Instead of making the music come alive, it makes it sound rather one-dimensional, completely lacking any aggression.\n\nOn the upside, there\u2019s the title track, which is easy one of the best songs Kreator has recorded so far. Awesome guitar work, killer lyrics and building towards a strong climax. The intro to it, \u2018The Patriarch\u2019, is very good as well. Another highlight is the seven minute epic \u2018Replicas Of Life\u2019. Once again, the climax of the song is quite strong and there is some outstanding drum work throughout the song, which is probably Ventor\u2019s finest moment.\n\nIt\u2019s not all that bad for the rest, the live album prove that \u2018All Of The Same Blood\u2019, \u2018Servant In Heaven \u2013 King In Hell\u2019 and the aforementioned \u2018Reconquering The Throne\u2019 have the potential of being awesome Thrashers, they just needed a different production to really come to life. In addition, the Finnish new kid on the block Sami Yli-Sirni\u00f6 is easily the best and most versatile lead guitarist the band has had so far. No offense to Tommy Vetterli, but Sami has everything he had and even a little more. The whole of the album is just boring, drawn out and the last few songs are quite bad. But then again, Kreator\u2019s best songs were rarely stuck to the end of the album.\n\nWhen you want to have the good songs of this album, I suggest you\u2019d get \u2018Live Kreation\u2019 and try to find a compilation, or maybe some promo or sampler, with \u2018Replicas Of Life\u2019 on it. Then you actually do possess Kreator\u2019s new found greatness. The big return to Thrash Metal is much better displayed on the follow-up \u2018Enemy Of God\u2019 from 2005.\n",
        "\nKreator are literally back with a vengeance. After the last 4 albums and Kreator's brave efforts to widen their horizons and include different music styles, Kreator have returned to their thrash throne to reclaim what was once theirs. Even though I would say their experimentations were not all pointless I will say that it is nice to hear Kreator back to their original genre and kicking ass more than ever.\n\nViolent Revolution couldn't be more right as Kreator return to form (in a more modern sense of the term thrash) and are in fine shape. Violent Revolution is something every thrash fan can enjoy - chaotic writing, stunning performances, and seething vocals. Although it is approached with a more modern sense of production and writing, Violent Revolution is still pure thrash.\n\nThe guitar work hasn't been this chaotic and fast since Coma of Souls and its nice to hear it. Kreator does add quite a bit of variety to the guitars though too. This isn't an hour of pure chaos and speed. There are nice tempo and time changes for the guitars. The riffs are heavy and bombarding and the leads and solos will slice through the heaviest of rhythms. It almost feels as though Kreator never missed a step and this album feels as though it could have come right after Coma of Souls. There are also some great melodies on the album that will hook you and keep you listening.\n\nThe bass work is still a tad quiet on the album (it is a thrash album though) but the bass is still very audible without being too foreboding. Nicely produced, the bass keeps a good heavy end to the music without crushing the melodies along with it.\n\nThe drum work is some of the best in Kreator's career. Having a better and more modern production helps with this, but even the writing for the drum parts seems to be better. A little more diversity is added and a new found confidence that the drums don't always have to follow the guitar parts. The bass drum is a bit loud for a thrash album at times although its definitely not a huge problem for the album.\n\nMille has lost of the gothic and hardcore tones from some of the experimental albums and he returns to his harsh vocal style that is almost the archetype of thrash vocals. His anger and intelligence comes through the lyrics and vocal styles and although I appreciated his trials at diversifying his range - its wonderful to hear him come to his core style again.\n\nThis album isn't perfect though - the songs on the latter half of the album tend to run together a bit and as was said before, the modern production does hinder the raw energy of Kreator too. These are little nit-picky comments though and the album is definitely a solid release and one of the best in Kreator's catalog. This is the solution to our problem...and it happens to be Violent Revolution.\n\nSongs to check out: Reconquering the Throne, Violent Revolution, Slave Machinery.\n",
        "\nIn 1990 the thrash scene had almost completely died. Band A sounds exactly as band B which sounds like band C which sounds exactly like almost everything else out there. There was nothing new to create, and except for the pioneer bands and some really outstanding cases, the thrash was full with unimaginative bands which did the same idea but always in a more boring way and sounded like a second rate poor imitations for themselves. But then we got Kreator, which released in that year their best album after a series of some serious killers thrash monsters. \n\nThis album is a really classy one. The production- flawless, the riffs- creative, the vocals- merciless, the drumming- brutal as hell! I mean, there is nothing bad with this album, it sounds like the final step in the development of a great musicians with a pretty creative minds, and the result is far beyond brilliance or outstanding album, here it's a fucking great one with a unique feeling and different mind which really sounds like something else and inventive.\n\n'When the Sun Burns Red' begins with clean guitars in a mysterious interlude which suppose to prepare you for a massive attack of brutal riffs and total mania, you know, it's like the calm before the flood in a way, then the distorted guitars comes in and a thrilling scream cut the air and the thrashing annihilation begins!\nEach moment is excellent, each riff sound like it were written punctually, each note sounds like it has been placed in his perfect position after a long thought and they all creates together a flawless riffs. 'Coma Of Souls' begins with a catchy power chords riff and then it becomes much faster with some buzzsaw riffs which sounds piercing and overwhelming. In 2:39 there is a great lead break, which sounds pretty shreeding and then becomes more melodic in the end. Then there is a cool tempo break and the song becomes more moderate with some palm muted riffs, and then it returns to the great main riff with some creepy screams: \"COMA OF SOULS!!\"\n\nThe vocals are pretty evil, Petrozza has a voice which sounds like half low grunt death metal growl and half black metal scream, and he still sounds clear and you can understand the lyrics pretty well. The lyrics are also have a real meaning.\n'People Of The Lie' is an anti nazi song and Petrozza doesn't hide his opinions about them (\"you are to me the waste of flesh and blood \").\n\nAnother worth description track is 'Terror Zone'. It's the longest track here (6 minutes) and has the darkest atmosphere in the album! It begins with a riff which sounds like the apocalypse, then it becomes more aggressive with a moderate riff and some backing guitars and then it becomes a merciless killer! It has a great drums work and excellent riffs, and also there are some great shredding solos and then it takes a full speed ahead in 250BPM and then slowly backs to the first riff in 80BPM and then it's over...damn, you must listen to this stuff! it's absolutely one of the best thrash songs ever!\n\nIf you never heard thrash before, take this album first and listen to it carefully!\nIt's definitely not for wimps or posers because it's has unstoppable riffing which will blow them away till the terror zone...and than the whole way back!\n\nHighlights: 'When The Sun Burns Red\", \"People Of The Lie, \"World Beyond, \"Terror Zone\" and \"Material World Paranoia\".\n",
        "\nBefore this, the only album I had from Kreator was \u201cComa of Souls\u201d. So I had little reference to what they have churned up throughout their early years. In fact I bought COS not long ago before I purchase RENEWAL so my know how of Kreator\u2019s style is just limited to COS therefore I didn\u2019t expect anything except that I was curious to what the new Kreator has to offer. Enter \u201cRenewal\u201d, Kreator\u2019s outtake in experimentation, mixing industrial shadings to a slightly altered playing style emphasizing more on vocals and drums. A major move for the band leaving many dissatisfied and somewhat felt betrayed because of the surprising shift in sound, disappointed was the word but not all felt the same because beneath the initial trauma lies a foreboding Kreator Gem.\n\nRenewal is a dark piece of brooding but menacing work of metal with a very twisted atmosphere but still \u201cThrash\u201d in a very odd form. Mille at this time was rather tired of their thrash metal attack pacing that he slowed things down. The once frenzied steady guitar riffing has been replaced with some experimental versions of riffs varying from slow, mid-tempo to fast depending on the songs focus and direction and at some climaxing points is still ripping and barraging the Kreator way. That\u2019s for the rhythm guitars only and for the lead? Twisted in a bad way, some works some not. The vocals are still Mille Petrozza in style and execution but the snarls are lower , one of the big factors that gave this album a darker feel. The drums are experimental too, Ventor playing some drum beats and pattern that are quite unlikely for Thrash Metal. (Opening drums on Winter Martyruim, Verse drums on Reflection, bridge part on Brainseed, and intro on Depression Unrest) but made things interesting to hear and with comes to thrash things up, Ventor delivers a riveting backbone to the music making him and the vox the vocal point since they were higher in the mix than the guitars.\n\nIn the song writing department, the songs twist and turn from a slow emotive passage to an energetic one then some climatic outburst to really shake things up. Milles emotional snarl rings so true, having that aggressive dark edge tone that captured very well the atmosphere of his compositions. The world conjured here is something like a near death drama that the world is going to end. This is pissed-off Kreator that wants to express aggressiveness in a different angle. \n\nGive this one chance, it\u2019s a real grower. Recommended if your tired of all the clich\u00e9d Thrash o rama but want your music to be still fast.\n",
        "\nEPs can be a very strange thing. For me there are 3 categories of EPs. The first category is a EP is one that acts like a mini LP. These \"mini LPs\" can be a EP full of all new studio recorded material or an EP of all new live material. The second catagory of EPs is what I like to refer to as the 'glorified single'. By this I mean the EP contains one song off of a LP along with a some new material (studio or live) exclusive to the EP release (usually more unique material than what would be considered a single). The third type of EP is the what I like to refer to as the 'mish-mash' EP. This is an EP just thrown together of new studio recordings, live recordings, and other odds and ends. Kreator's \"Out of the Dark...Into the Light\" EP is one of these 'mish-mash' releases.\n\nThese mish-mash EPs are usually my least favorite kind. The reason is because they just feel thrown together with no thought. They take a few studio tracks, a few live tracks and just thrown them together, release an EP a what seems to be a quick cash grab. Though this is a mish-mash EP, I still like it better than most out there (as opposed to..let's say...Testament's Return to Apocalyptic City).\n\nThe reason I like it is because the new studio tracks exclusive to this release are really good. The EP opens up with the song 'Impossible to Cure'. This song sounds just like material present on Kreator's album Terrible Certainty (the precursor album to this EP.) This makes it a good thing that this EP was added as bonus tracks to the remastered release of that album. My guess is that this song was recorded during that albums recording session and was either cut or left out on purpose with the possibility of making it appear on a \"cash & grab\" EP. I can't imagine it was cut because it is a good song. Nice 'groovy' riff and fast lyrics (Mille almost sounds like he has a hard time keeping up). The only thing wrong with this track is that it only clocks in at 2:40. Too damn short! The second track is also a studio recording which is a cover of Raven's Lamb to the Slaughter. This is a really good cover and it's thankfully over 3 minutes. Apparently the original vinyl release contained a third studio track which was a cover of Tygers of Pan Tang's Gangland. This song sadly is not on the CD release of the EP. Die-Hard Kreator fans make this song sound 'godly' so it's a shame it's not included anymore. I have not heard the song (as I have this EP on CD) so I cannot make any comments on it.\n\nAfter the two studio tracks e get 3 live recordings of 'Terrible Certainty', 'Riot of Violence', and 'Awakening of the Gods'. The live recording of these tracks is pretty good (the drums are the low point' but the two new studio tracks really make this EP.\n\nUpon hearing this EP it seems Kreator was confused. It seems that they weren't certain whether they wanted to release an EP full of new studio recordings or an EP of a live concert so they mashed it together. I would have much more preferred an EP of new studio recordings or a live concert as opposed to this. For one thing it would have been awesome to have an EP full of studio recorded cover songs as Lambs to the Slaughter rocked and from what I hear so did the cover of Gangland\n\nAs it is it's still a nice EP to have for Kreator fans as the new studio tracks are good but it's definitely not a must have. The price of this EP on CD is the same price a full length album and there just isn't enough great material on this to warrant the price so I would've been a little disappointed. However since the EP is now included as bonus tracks on the remastered edition of Terrible Certainty it's more forgivable.\n",
        "\nKreator have been through a lot of \u201cexperimental\u201d albums in the last few years. Four or five albums, when you look back at their discography. Violent Revolution was minor return to style for them, although it was a groove focused album. Enemy of God is a true return to style for Kreator compared to the last few albums where they deviated from their extreme thrash music.\n\nEnemy of God is pure, aggressive Teutonic thrash. Kreator really kicked it in the ass when they decided to write this album. The guitars are non-stop thrash riffing overlaid with leads that will literally rip your ears apart. I haven\u2019t heard dueling guitar work like this from a thrash band in a long time. Musically, Enemy of God is one of the most aggressive albums that has been released in the last few years. Now, when I say its \u201cold-school\u201d thrash, I don\u2019t mean that it is purely an hour of nonstop speed and anger. There is a quite a bit of variety on display through the entire album. Some songs retained the groove presented in the experiment albums (Impossible Brutality) and there are even some songs that present the atmosphere they experimented with (beginning of Voices of the Dead). But the difference with these deviations from thrash is that they aren\u2019t separated from the thrash. They are incorporated within the aggressive thrash style that Kreator is reverting back to. Thusly, Enemy of God is the best of all the styles that Kreator have tampered with. All of this is present with the guitars for the most part. The guitars are varied and never boring from heavy riffing to melodic lead parts. The bass and drums help structure the guitar work but are never really a take a lead role in the music. \n\nMille Petrozza is one of the best thrash vocalists that are relevant to the metal scene today. His vocals are both harsh and livid without being overwhelming like most new thrash vocalists. Enemy of God is a perfect example of how good Mille throws out his voice to the music. No death growls clutter this thrash album. One of the most compelling reasons one would listen to Kreator is for Mille\u2019s lyrical content. The lyrics are dark and thoughtful giving credit to sociological concepts and stories of life and death. Some of his best work is present on Enemy of God (not that any of his lyrics have ever been boring).\n\nEnemy of God is the new mark for which all modern thrash albums should be based. It\u2019s a great combination of \u201cold-thrash\u201d mentality with a modern approach. Kreator have really stepped up to the plate with this latest effort. The one bad thing about Enemy of God is just one question, \u201chow in the hell are Kreator ever going to top it?\u201d\n",
        "\nFor some reason in the world of metal, if you\u2019re fast and brutal, you\u2019re praised eternally. On the other end of the spectrum, if the music has an abundance of melody and lack of speed, it is criticized endlessly. So if one extreme is viewed as negative, why isn\u2019t the other? The only explanation I can come up with is that there are too many metal fans that are more concerned with intensity than quality. And that is one of (but not the only) reason why I long for the days of metal that had a hint of melody to it. Damn any interesting song ideas or any sort of riffs that are fierce yet maintain some melody. This is just straightforward brutality that would inspire many future tedious acts for years to come. This is a token album for geeks to throw in your face when you praise classics like \u201cRide the Lightning,\u201d or \u201cPeace Sells\u201d, not having a clue that brutality does not necessarily equal greatness. In this case, I would take this nerd\u2019s Kreator CD and smash it in his pimply face, and go about my business of listening to what my ears command me to. \n\nThe album starts off the way you\u2019d expect a thrash album to. \u201cRipping Corpse\u201d has a nice evil lead into an intense wall of sound. No complaints here, problem is once you\u2019ve heard this song, you\u2019ve pretty much heard them all. They vary little from this formula and it quickly grows dull. There are no catchy, maniacal riffs that speak to you and force you into a serial killing career. There are no NWOBHM inspired choruses that command you to scream along until your throat swells up and chokes you to death. No melodic punk inspired vocal passages that are implanted into your skull and you welcome their company. Basically, none of what I truly love about thrash metal is present. This is not thrash born from great heavy metal like Judas Priest and Iron Maiden, this is the bastard child of harsh acts such as Venom, Hellhammer, and Bathory. More defined and more brutal than their predecessors, but without a clue of what makes Bay Area thrash great. \n\nThe drums are the real lowlight for me. They\u2019re way too loud in the mix, and really drown out the riffs. The intro's are great but I couldn\u2019t tell you what 75 percent of the riffs that follow them sound like because of those annoying drums. Would it hurt to get a little fucking variety here Jurgen? Once a song gets going it\u2019s an endless pounding of the kit that I honestly don\u2019t understand how anyone could take without swallowing a whole bottle of aspirin. Millie\u2019s vocal style, while not really a subject for criticism, doesn\u2019t really add much to the album either. \n\nNot to say it's all bad. The riffs are definitely unique and the music technically demanding. The songs, in all their mind numbing glory, are at least complete and thought out. Kreator accomplished what they set out to do, to become the most vicious thrash band of their time. But the cost was too great, and the quality really isn\u2019t here. The highlight of the album to me is \u201c Riot of Violence\u201d. Easily the best offering here and what a shocker, it's the only one that is really distinctive in style. The riff under the chorus is great and catchy, something this album desperately lacks. \u201cCarrion\u201d has some great mid paced riffing in the middle that does provoke some head banging. \u201cCommand of the Blade\u201d features an opening riff that is awfully similar to Dark Angel\u2019s \u201cDeath is Certain (Life is Not)\u201d, perhaps Gene might have ripped them off, who knows. I can't remember which album came out first. Those are the only times I can remember cracking open an eyelid during this snoozefest.\n",
        "\nHaving only been a Kreator fan for a short while now, this release had passed me by. After reading the review for it here on Metal Archives I was a little sceptical, but decided to pick it up cheap on eBay. What I had found was a pretty good video concert that, despite its flaws, is still quite worthwhile.\n\nThe general quality of the footage is very good considering it\u2019s sixteen years old (at time of writing) and the sound is reasonably clear throughout the concert, with all the instruments audible throughout. Sometimes Ventor\u2019s drums get lost in the wall of sound and some of the guitar solos are a bit quiet at times, but it doesn\u2019t detract from the show too much. The camera work is a bit hit and miss however. There are some very good shots of the band but, as is all too common on live footage today, when Mille or Frank are shredding their way through a guitar solo, we are shown shots of Ventor or Rob instead, which can be very frustrating as the quality of solos on display is very high here.\n\nThe selection of material is pretty good, drawing from all of the studio albums up to that point, generally focusing on the Extreme Aggression and Terrible Certainty albums. As stated in the previous review, the material from those two albums comes off very well here, particularly the title tracks from both of the aforementioned records. As also stated in the previous review, material from their first two albums, Pleasure to Kill in particular, suffers a bit. While songs like \u2018Under the Guillotine\u2019 and \u2018Pleasure to Kill\u2019 are performed competently enough, they sound a bit laboured and uninspired at times, notably in the chorus of \u201cPleasure to Kill\u201d, which seems to drag on and on when the band should be tearing through it.\n\nDespite these flaws, I found the concert to be enjoyable. The crowd seems into it and the band is evidently enjoying themselves. If you can find this for relatively cheap (though it is quite rare), it is well worth it, as some of the songs featured here don\u2019t tend to get played too much nowadays. Although Live Kreation is a better representation of the band live, this is still a quite worthy account of the band in the flesh.\n",
        "\n\"...you know you're helpless till the end of time...\" \n\nFlag of Hate enters the fold aurally pissed and thrown into circulation as a fully formed bridge to a place in Kreator's history that wasn't yet realized, let alone built. The ep surveys the situation. Peering back at its rear foundation, it chokes on poisonous smoke billowing from still smoldering \u201cTormenter\u201d, \u201cEndless Pain\u201d, and \u201cTotal Death\u201d \u2013 three gasket-blown brutes given longevity on this six-tracker (this is the Combat bridge, by the way) to continue twisting solid steel like damp sponges. Looking ahead, the ep naturally sees the cavern below, however solid places to begin and (especially) end bridge construction is sketchy. Is it even worth the trouble? Deeply downwind, however, floats something of a dangerously gassy spore, one wafting a harmfully-sweet aroma, like pre-ignition fumes of a flamethrower, or a leaking oil tanker that's moments away from blowing as it slowly floats through the inferno it's responsible for creating. Then from the cavern below something rumbles, palpably, like the personal thunder of some vast entity still shielded from human eye. Something\u2019s awakening down there, something more transcendentally bestial than the three-piece's initial slab, something that can ensnarl with Endless Pain-like vengeance, yet boils with an authentic severity that's thicker than the debut's bile. It's fresher bile that's blacker, is more congealed and lovingly decorates Lord Intensity\u2019s sunroom. In its path to full power, this unknown organism from below manages to possess the body and soul of an old soldier in Kreator\u2019s armed forces while simultaneously breeding a pair of new life forms in barbed and blistered test tubes. \n\nWith possession comes vivification, and this hellion ep roars the true future fury of Kreator. \n\n\u201cFlag of Hate\u201d is reborn here - given breath and unchained by what boils up to an even more malicious Kreator than the one that penned perilous Endless Pain, an album that was far from shackled, but in light of this unexpected uncoiling of might, suddenly seems so. The tormented yet slightly irresolute stride of the original \"Flag of Hate\" now stampedes on all fours, bristling with an explosive intensity that'd be rivaled by few and envied by many. It\u2019s thrash\u2019s simple pill - intensity's pure domination amplified by a production that's massive and fully on the throttle. \u201cTake Their Lives\u201d gallantly flies off in a different direction and lurches with a serrated main riff that's like a cryptic, yet incendiary commandment menaced by a bottom end that crunches against the rocks of the cavern floor below. This gears up for the bludgeoned bombardment and thick gargle of speed-shifting mania that is \u201cAwakening of the Gods\u201d - at the time the closest \u2018epic\u2019 specimen they could proudly sign their name to. Mille, one of the band's two craftsmen of crazy vocals, sticks all three of these tracks under his bullet belt as his acid-corroded bray invents new sounds of a leprous and tortured kind.\n\nNow three tracks would\u2019ve been just fine, but the US version throws the three aforementioned Endless Pain tracks in their original unhallowed glory into the scrimmage - a joy for the Americans who missed their tumultuous debut (most chain record stores were usually off in some metallic la-la land where Killer Dwarfs roam, meanwhile indie shops were commonly frightened by the extra import shipping costs - and as a former record store owner I've totally crept through that same forest). \n\nNot only is Flag of Hate a bridge to Kreator\u2019s more outer-serving, feral din much in the way Expurse of Sodomy links Sodom to thrash\u2019s more precise and intricate level, it\u2019s a gangplank to the implosion of then-contemporary thrash metal. It's the formerly sleepy beast that sees the new horizon as something to stampede over, but hunger persuades it to wait for the construction crew to finish the bridge to the chasm's other side where they'll promptly become snack food. It\u2019s also three dudes cementing themselves into the three-pronged Teutonic warmachine that made average Kraut rock seem more and more like a warped square dance recording. \n\nSo Dave, what the hell have you been spewing on about for the last sixty or so lines of text? \n\nWell, at the end of the day, the beast - Kreator's inner-beast - angrily climbed free of its red-eyed cavern slumber completely awakened by Flag of Hate's sweat-soaked a-side. Three months later the construction crew hammers the final nail in the bridge traversing the cavern and are devoured by this inner-beast. With hunger pains gone and new fuel ingested, the act's inner-beast immediately rushes toward the November horizon, full stomach and all. Exploding from Kreator's soul in mid-charge, we finally glimpse Pleasure to Kill and its nifty Phil Lawvere cover - the sonic holocaust often heralded as the time's next (and in the opinion of many fans, unsurpassed) embodiment of thrash Armageddon.\n\n\"...I'll bring you down to your knees...\"\n",
        "\nThis one really takes me back to my skater days, back when life was simpler and joy could be found just hanging out in my room writing zombie stories whilst Kreator, Death and Dark Angel blasted from my boom box(I had actually yet to discover Overkill until late in '88). Over the years there have been several pressings of this half live, half b-side ep from the German death metal Gods, but this review is of the original, which I was only recently able to find on CD a couple years ago. \nI had the Noise/Futurist re-issue with bonus tracks from the early '90's on CD, but that re-issue also cut one of my favorite tracks off, for some reason. The original pressing featured six tracks; three were b-side recordings, including a Godly rendition of the Tygers of Pantang classic 'Gangland,' as well as three live tracks from the band's 1988 appearance at the Dynamo club in Eindhoven, Holland. \nThe three live tracks are the better mixed and produced of the six songs, and include for the only time in my huge Kreator kollection, a full live version of 'Awakening of the Gods,' one of my top ten of all time songs from my favorite band, which originally appeared on the phenomonal 'Flag of Hate' ep in '86. The three studio tracks, which also include the short but relentless 'Impossible to Cure' and 'Lambs to the Slaughter,' which I believe is another cover because none of the Kreator band members had a hand in writing it, and Allmusic.com has nothing to suggest otherwise. \nOddly enough, despite the listed order of material on the CD, unlike the cassette, the live songs appear first, followed by the studio tracks. Again, no big deal, but just a little quirk.\n",
        "\nNB - I wrote this review before I read the others, am pleased I did this as this album certainly divides opinion.\n\n- - -\n\nTalk about a \u2018difficult\u2019 album, this one was a minefield! Not only was Metal dying on it\u2019s arse (it was 1992), but Kreator\u2019s last album (Coma of Souls) had been slated for a lack of progression from their previous (oft-touted-as-the-best-one, especially by people who think PTK is a bit too wild) album Extreme Aggressions. Now while I must agree that Coma was a bit of a safe album, albeit one with some great tracks (and overall better than the overrated EA in my opinion) I don\u2019t think anyone really expected the band to re-invent themselves so completely.\n\nThe aptly named \u2018Renewal\u2019 arrived in 1992, and was a breath of fresh air for Thrash. Gone was the over-produced sound and in came Industrial samples, a much more \u2018live\u2019 sound and a general griminess that gave the whole thing a new lease of life. I guess the rising popularity of Death Metal was by now affecting the Thrash scene and the band realised that they had to change somewhat, but without simply returning to their roots. (Although you\u2019d have to say that a lot of their fans would have been a lot happier if they had!).\n\nMille\u2019s vocals changed too. No longer satisfied with the simple yet glorious German tinted voice of old, Mille was now barking into the mic in a somewhat monotone voice that for some reason just worked. The perfect example of this would probably be the excellent \u2018Europe After the Rain\u2019, which was apparently inspired by the rather bleak paintings of Max Ernst (not that I know a lot about that). Thankfully the band didn\u2019t decide to ditch the guitar solo\u2019s and Frank \u2018Blackfire\u2018 Gosdzik gives a fine farewell performance here (he, well everyone except Mille, was booted from the band before the next album in 1995). \n\nIt is said that this album was recorded through a haze of pot smoke, and though I\u2019m not a partaker myself I can see how that would be the case. (The words LEGALIZE MAJIHUANA!) appear on the back cover for fucks sake!) This is not an album composed by right-thinking people, even today the whole thing has a crazy atmosphere about it (like maybe old Pink Floyd?) as if the whole thing has been lashed together to stop all the craziness sending it completely off the rails. It may have been an over- reaction to the somewhat straight-ahead style of Coma of Souls, but whatever it was it certainly worked - for me! \n\nBut alas, many of those who lambasted the band for their staidness, now dismissed them and their new style. It was a tragedy really, that this album came out when it did, because it deserved so much more attention than it ever got. But in 1992 the underground only cared about proper Death Metal and the Metal mainstream was cutting it\u2019s hair lock stock and barrel and falling over themselves to buy shite albums from Seattle. \n\nIt\u2019s hard to pick highlights on such a great album, but for me \u2018Karmic Wheel\u2019 deserves a special mention. Slow and hypnotic, this track is one of those rare Metal tracks that manages to convey some kind of deeper emotion - listen to the middle section (better still get the remix version where you can hear the voice properly) where you hear about the pressure the guy\u2019s been under and tell me you don\u2019t feel sick when you hear him shoot himself in the head. This is no studio re-enactment, this is actual footage and the screaming is real. Shit, I can\u2019t ever remember being affected like that before, it leaves me fucking cold!\n\nBut it\u2019s an awesome coldness. This album will chill your neck and make you want to hit things, but you just have to accept it as the brilliant one-off that it is. It\u2019s like Kreator\u2019s \u2018Into the Pandemonium\u2019\u2026. it probably never should be repeated, because to recreate it would be to undermine it\u2019s impact. At the end of the day, for me this is Kreator\u2019s second best album. Third would be Endorama and fourth? Well I dunno, maybe Endless Pain. You all know what number one is anyway and you won\u2019t find much PTK-ness here. Best to view this as a unique album that (much like Endorama) if it had been released by another band, might JUST have made them superstars\u2026\n\n\u2026.but of course it didn\u2019t and the fallout was that 1995\u2019s return to the norm album Cause for Conflict did little to regain lost ground. 98\u2019s Outcast was a bit too dull for it\u2019s own good and then the band really upset the applecart with the \u2018absolutely brilliant if it had been anyone else\u2019 Endorama, before eventually giving in to the fans and harking back to the 80\u2019s with the lacklustre \u2019Violent Revolution\u2019.\n\nSad really, when you think that every time Kreator brought out an album that really kicked ass the next one moved away in style, and the one time they did try to inject some continuity they were lambasted for it. Ah well, never mind, if you can approach it with the right attitude, this one will make a fine addition to your collection.\n",
        "\nMy expectations of this DVD were shattered. I heard so many good things about it the anticipation grew and grew. Finally I purchased it off eBay and anxiously awaited its arrival.\n\nIn comparison to some other music DVDs I\u2019ve seen, this one lacks in content. It has a concert of 17 songs, band history with 10 music videos, a making-of of the DVD, a fan section, merchandise links and two bonus songs played live. At first glance this seems like a healthy load of content. Well, that\u2019s at first glance. It\u2019s not until you view these pieces individually do you see how useless they really are. I\u2019ll begin with the concert, since it was what I was anticipating the most.\n\nFor any DVD, the concert is the main \u201cattraction\u201d. Everything else is icing on the cake (or, in DVD terms\u2026 bonus material). This was the part of the DVD I wanted to see the most. I\u2019ve seen Kreator live two of the three times they\u2019ve been to Toronto, so I knew the kind of live show they put on. Unfortunately any expectations I had for the concert swiftly disappeared. There are three things that piss me off about the concert; two major and one minor. I\u2019ll start with the minor to get it out of the way. \n\nThe concert is actually two concerts amalgamated. The annoying part is they go back and forth between the two (South Korea and Brazil) to create the setlist that is listed on the back of the DVD (minus the last two songs). It shouldn\u2019t really matter, but it just bugged me after a few songs it\u2019d go back to the location they had just left. Kreator\u2019s setlist doesn\u2019t change that much, couldn\u2019t they have gotten a very similar setlist from just one of those locations? I guess not. I suppose they wanted to do something different.\n\nOne of the major things that annoyed me with the concert was the production quality. It\u2019s too good! I know, that sounds like a really stupid thing to complain about for a live recording, but it\u2019s true. Throughout the entire concert I felt like I was listening to the CDs. Only when the band paused and you could hear the crowd cheering did I feel like I was watching a DVD or listening to a live recording. That really bothered me because when I watch a music DVD I like to feel like I am there, or at least get a live feeling from the experience. When that fails, I am greatly disappointed. I know Kreator wouldn\u2019t dub over their songs (if they did I would lose a lot of respect for them), but they completely erased any live feeling from the DVD. I felt like I was watching a really long music video. I wasn\u2019t connected to it at all, and needless to say I was bored.\n\nThe second thing is the camerawork. Holy shit. What is it with retarded colouring, inverted colours, superimposing images on top of one another and other random stupid shit that is so attractive? Again, I felt like I was watching a music video. The entire time the colours would be fucked, inverted or something else. The angles were decent but a lot of the time I couldn\u2019t even see the band. And even if the camera was focused on the band or a member they were invisible because they decided to cover them in blackness or some other shit. When the colours weren\u2019t inverted or the negative wasn\u2019t shown, there was this constant green hue to replace it. I guess the editors had a blast creating this DVD. It\u2019s unfortunate that crap like this plagued the entire concert from start to finish.\n\nThe history section isn\u2019t anything special. It basically reiterates what any Kreator fan would know while throwing in a music video every now and then. The music videos are a nice touch, but nothing special or something to save the DVD. Thankfully you can bypass the useless history lesson and just watch the videos if you wanted.\n\nThe two bonus live tracks suffer from the same things as the concert; ridiculous editing and overproduction. They\u2019re listed on the back of the DVD as part of the setlist but aren\u2019t actually part of it, so I guess that\u2019s how they justify them being \u201cbonus tracks\u201d.\n\nThe fan section is also pointless. It\u2019s just random video of fans from all over the world giving the devil\u2019s horns and screaming \u201cKREATOR!\u201d to the camera. Oh, and they had to show how dedicated they were by showcasing their Kreator tattoos. At least the fan section on Slayer\u2019s DVD was entertaining.\n\nThere are also appearances of band members from several other bands, but nothing to get really excited about. Most of the time they just compliment Kreator and tell you (the viewer) to have a good time.\n\nOnce again, the making-of is pointless. It\u2019s a couple minutes of a video just showing people setting up the audio equipment. That\u2019s it. Not much of a making-of. I was very disappointed with this part. And after viewing all this mediocre, sub-par material you get to browse the Kreator merchandise!\n\nIt\u2019s unfortunate that there\u2019s very little good to say about this DVD. At least it\u2019s in Dolby Digital 5.1 surround sound, and some of the videos and the concert are in widescreen format. The setlist is solid, though I wish they played something from Endorama (I happen to think that album isn\u2019t that bad); they start and finish the concert like they usually do, so nothing new there. The music videos are okay, but not worth the purchase. Everything else isn\u2019t worth it. Perhaps you\u2019ll want to see the concert, but probably only once. I know I only want to see it once. I\u2019d like to give the band the benefit of the doubt and use the excuse that they rushed the DVD, but I can\u2019t even do that because it\u2019s their first DVD release, and they\u2019ve had forever to put it together. You would also like to think that after 20 years of making music and exhaustive world touring that they\u2019d be able to provide some more (quality) material. Perhaps they\u2019re holding out for their next DVD release or some kind of boxset or maybe this is the best they can do. I\u2019m just glad I only spent $11 on it.\n\nI would recommend this DVD but watch it before you buy it. I wish I did.\n",
        "\nThis is some fine German Thrash Metal. Kreator's 4th full-length album's as solid as any other. Is it magnificent? No. I'll explain why. Coma of Souls was released just a year after this and it's basically the same stuff - the same song-structures, the same production, the same guitar-sound, the same everything. The only thing that's different is that Coma of Souls has more memorable tracks whereas the tracks on this particular album take their time to settle in.\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, the strength of this album lies in the solid song-writing, not the catchiness-aspect. This is perhaps for hardcore Thrashers or fans of Kreator only. The strength of the album doesn't rely on single tracks (as is the case with Coma of Souls) but on all the tracks. Overall, this is pretty strong stuff. Decent solos, good, crunchy, Thrashy riffs and a few melodic passages here and there. \n\nAs far as the extreme aggression bit is concerned, I'm not sure if this really is Kreator's most \"aggressive\" album. I'd rate Coma of Souls and Pleasure to Kill over this any day. Having said that, on it's own, this stands strong and is better than anything that comes from any Thrash band these days. Reccomended for people who like Thrash.\n",
        "\nThis is Kreator at it's peak. This album is the result of years of striving to reach a certain point on the part of Kreator. Although the previous albums were excellent in their own right, Coma of Souls takes it to another level altogether. Even Kreator itself cound not produce anything better than this.\n\nThis album consists of 9 of the best Thrash tracks you'd ever get to hear. The formula is simple - Thrashy but paced intros to every song, followed by fast, relentless riffs. Add in some mind-blowing solos with bends coming in from all over the place - what more would you want? Although the formula is the same for each track, as it has been with almost all Kreator albums, every track is unique. This is another thing that makes this album great. Too many times, a lot of riffs in different songs start to sound similar but Kreator's managed to come up with great individual songs this time around.\n\nThe German-accent vocals are absolutely mind-blowing. Although you won't find as my growls as you did in Extreme Aggression, you won't be dissapointed here with the swift Blackish vocals. The drumming is up to the mark and is well co-ordinated with the guitars and that's evident from the first track with Coma of Souls.\n\nAll in all, this is a must-have for anyone who claims to have any interest in Thrash Metal. Although Thrash is, more or less, dead, they're albums like these that still make if a lot of people's favourite genre. \n\nI don't care if Kreator hadn't musucally \"moved forward\" with this album because if you just give this a listen, you'd realize there was no need. This album is for REAL Thrashers, not poseurs.\n",
        "\nI say not great because I have seen what Kreator is capable of, through all their albums, numerous bootlegs, and seeing them live as well. That being said..\n\nThe production is standard, sounds like a good bootleg or something. The drum sound is pretty bad, it sounds like Jurgen's snare is a trash can lid or something of the like. I guess he didn't fix his trigger before they started. Bass drum work, sloppy, like Smith on Human Waste, off time consistently. The guitar playing is rather sloppy, namely on Tritze's part. Sloppiest live playing i have EVER heard, it actually embarasses me when I listen to it. Mille's vocals as well, sloppy, it sounds like Tom Angelripper back in the mid 80's. He kinda just doesn't aim for the mic very well, all you hear often is him shouting what it seems like 100 feet away, and even then, he sounds pretty drunk as well. The bass you can't really hear.. which isn't really vital in this band anyways.\n\nIt would have been nice to get a solid recording from these guys in their prime, because they really do kick so much ass. I suppose only a nostalgic Kreator fan would really like this, so if you are just getting into the band, or just getting into metal, don't bother.\n",
        "\nMy god this is a solid album. This is Deutsch Thrash with a doctorate, and it fucking rules. This is kreator back when kreator was something most mortals feared. When they just wanted to Thrash and rip the brains out of as many humans as possible, when they wore Leather and Spikes and had lyrics about Death, Satan, Zombies and other lovely subjects that dragged you off into a wonderful and totally fucking Metal world of warlords, monsters and the undead. PTK immediately transports us to this world with the surprisingly atmospheric and gentle intro Choir of the Damned, which has a very medieval feel and makes use of soothing lead guitar melodies, wind samples, keyboards and acoustic guitars. Its pretty interesting but is very light sounding, but maybe that was the idea, to give contrast with the sheer brain-fucking armageddon that we are to be beaten with after the abrupt end of the intro. \n\n\"Ripping Corpse ATTAAACK!\" Fuck yeah. Ripping Corpse immediately bashes you with brutal Thrash riffs, bound to make people jump after the intro suddenly fades out. The chorus of this song totally fucking rules and demands worship. \"Await death by the blade! Run before its too late! Await the axe in your back.....Ripping Corpse ATTAAACK!\" Again, Fuck yeah. Awesome fast DEATH METAL riffage underlies this chorus and makes it sound so fucking evil, and then after the 2nd verse, more brilliant death stuff, and a couple of nice, chaotic, technically terrible Kreator solos to round things off nicely. Thrash anthem. 97% \n\nDeath Is Your Saviour has a really nice death riff in it somewhere which smashes you round the head unexpectedly and commands you to bang. Excellent all round with trademark kreator machine-like riffing, which gives the impression of technicality without actually being technical. 90% \n\nTitle track. Quick drum intro, evil verse riff, evil Mille vocals, evil lyrics (rampaging vampires anyone?). Solo, and then......THRAASH!! Absolutely AWESOME riff, best on the album, and your neck has absolutely no free will. \"I return to the cemetary!\" Face-fuckingly brilliant. 95% Riot of Violence. Indeed. Great riffs and an interesting pre-chorus, that odd little melodic break is nice. After the \"I must save myself\" part out of absolutely nowhere comes an obliterating death riff, and the chorus fucking slays, \"Riot of Violence!\" 90% \n\nThe Pestilence, quite a long track replete with all the brutal [Note: not br00tal] riffs and lovable, honest, bad-but-great solos that we all love Kreator for. Great riffset from 2:16 - 3:38, but its all solid really. Nice (i.e. not generic intro-verse-chrous-verse-solo-verse-chorus-outro) structure. 89% \n\nCarrion, more corpse-ripping brutality. This really is the album that inspired the Death Metal genre. People say Reign in Blood but come on, this is so much more death metal! Not only the riffs but the way the riffs are played (as said, very machine-like and heavy), revolutionary vocals for '86, and just the whole vibe is very traditional death metal. I must mention the vocals at this point, as there are two vocalists who take turns on each track. They sound similar yet different, Mille is higher and slightly more evil and Ventor is lower and more brutal, they are very complimentary. Speaking of Ventor, his drumming is very unique, in a good way, the fills have this pattering quality which would doubtlessly inspire Hellhammer (the Mayhem member). Anyway, Carrion rules- 85% \n\nCommand of the Blade- weakest song here, simply because its very repetitve. Still highly fun and head-bangable though. The \"His aim is to give you......DEATH!\" bit rules utterly. 81% Under The Guillotine is excellent as well, emotional solos, the 2:45 riff crushes immesurably, and, fuck, there's lots of solos! 83% \n\nThis is a milestone in Thrash and Heavy Metal. The quality erodes slightly as it goes on but who cares. The fact that there is only one guitar here is quite odd for a record like this but does not detract at all, infact it adds to the character of the album, and the bass plays a greator role. Kreator pushed the boundaries here and, along with Possessed, gave birth to death metal in the mid eighties, while Metallica were busy degenerating. Revolutionary aesthetic, riff style and overrall intent on this album brought Metal to darker and more exciting places. Oh yeah, and the ownage of the cover art is stratospherical.\n",
        "\nAlbums just don\u2019t get much better than this. From start to finish, this is one of the greatest thrash albums ever. Ultra-heavy, blazing riffs with shredding solos combined with crushing bass licks and scorching drums make this one vicious recording. Mille\u2019s vocals are outstanding, with him spitting, snarling and screaming like his life depended on it! There isn\u2019t a single weak song to be found here. How do you even begin to review a masterpiece such as this, an album that every self-respecting metalhead should already have heard?\n\nThe first two tracks, When The Sun Burns Red and Coma Of Souls are speedy, bruising pieces. Both contain riffs upon riffs and solos of the highest caliber. They command you to bang your head! The drum work is amazing, with it\u2019s precision and aggression. The music so unbelievably tight.\n\nPeople Of The Lie is a personal favorite. I love the crushing feel. It\u2019s mid-paced and heavy as a train loaded with steel. If that chorus doesn\u2019t get stuck in your ear all day, you\u2019re deaf. With that riff running behind it, it doesn\u2019t just get in your head, it opens your skull up and climbs inside!\n\nWorld Beyond goes back on the throttle, simply blitzing the listener with it\u2019s speed. At just over 2 minutes, it is short but gets the job done. Caution, whiplash may ensue! It\u2019s followed by Terror Zone, which kicks off with a somewhat melodic riff, while the bass and drums crash away. Nice drum fill afterwards leads into some chainsaw guitars and a stomping slower pace. Kreator uses a broad array of tempo changes throughout the song to keep it flowing along.\n\nThe highlight of the album for me is Agents Of Brutality. If one were giving away a truth in advertising award, this song would get it! The band come after you seemingly with the intention of beating the piss out of you with the music.\n\nMaterial World Paranoia and Twisted Urges continue to pour on the speed and fury. Material World Paranoia is the longer of the two, and uses a few tempo changes throughout. It\u2019s still a fast and furious track, though. Twisted Urges is shorter, at only 2:45, and has a mid-paced section right in the middle. As usual, the vocals are venomous and aggressive. Riffs just rip all over the place and the leads shred.\n\nHidden Dictator starts in with the bass thumping and a cool, heavy riff comes in over it. After about thirty seconds things turn deadly serious with some all-out moshing! I just can\u2019t get enough of this stuff. I am a sucker for thrash!\n\nMental Slavery comes last, and it seeks to give you a final beating on the way out the door. The riff at the beginning is heavy and has a monster hook. Not quite as fast as some of the songs present, it\u2019s still upbeat and heavy enough to smash bricks.\n\nIf you\u2019ve never heard this album, you should be shot where you stand. This is cornerstone of the thrash genre. No one can call themselves a metalhead without having this album in their collection in SOME format.\n",
        "\nExtreme Aggression is Kreator's fourth album and it is yet another masterpiece. It has a few changes, and definately sounds more like \"Coma of Souls\" in the melodic sense, as you can hear more melodies. \n\nThere are also some other changes on this album. Ventor doesn't sing here which is a slight disappointment as I liked his vocals as well. They were different but just as good as Mille's. Also the solos are more melodic and are higher pitched. There are fewer of them so that is definitely a negative but you get to appreciate the ones that are present even more. However most of this album just follows what its predecessors have done. The riffs are excellent, as great as in \u201cTerrible Certainty\u201d. The drumming is also good and Mille\u2019s vocals are at their best here out of all albums. Mille makes them sound as evil and angry as usual but seems to have more control over them to make them sound even better.\n\nSome highlights on this album are definitely the title and first track, \u201cExtreme Aggression\u201d. There are catchy riffs and lyrics. This song also contains the best solo on the album. \u201cStream of Consciousness\u201d starts off with rather slow riffs, but they are still very catchy and once the song speeds up it ends up being one of the best on the album. It also contains a great solo. \u201cBetrayer\u201d at 0:10 has the catchiest riff on the entire album and probably one of the best Kreator invented. The rolling-style drums in the background add to the enjoyment of that second or two. The lyrics here are also the best on the album. For example, \u201cYou used my trust to satisfy your brainless lust, your word isn\u2019t worth more than puke in the dust\u201d. \n\nAs for any down moments, there really aren\u2019t any. Each and every track on this album is enjoyable. This is definitely another thrash lover\u2019s essential.\n",
        "\nThis album is very different from Kreator's previous works which composed of some of the best thrash ever produced. This album tones it down. There isn't much thrash here and as a whole it feels more modern rockish which certainly isn't something a well-respected thrash metal band wants to do.\n\nSome other changes on the album are that the music is much slower. The guitars still sound metal enough so that is good however the drums are rather slow. It sounds like Ventor is banging drum sticks on an empty paint bucket which really decreases the quality of the drums. Also Mille's vocals are very crappy here. He shouts instead of his usual growl, or spitting forth of words which really makes him sound different. Mille shouting is definately weird however its not totally horrible on all songs especially on \"Winter Martyrium\". Another change is the solos are very few and very much toned down. They do sound rather uninspired and are far from chaotic.\n\nThere are still moments on this album that are relatively good and enjoyable. \"Winter Martyrium\" still has some decent riffs and has at least some agression. The melody is rather repetitive, however definately one of the more enjoyable songs on the album. There is a solo on here, which would be the best on the album however a big mistake is made here. Instead of the usual solo with drums in the background, here the solo is put in the background while the shitty drums are still very loud. \"Renewal\" is another slow moving song however it is one of the more enjoyable ones with a rather nice melodic chorus. \"Brainseed\" has a few decent riffs as well as some agression. \"Zero to None\" probably has the best riffs on here which could have led to a decent song that almost sounded like it could have come from the previous album, \"Coma of Souls\" however it is ruined by much more melodic guitars that have almost no power whatsoever, rather bland and repetitive drumming, and of course Mille shouting. \"Europe After the Rain\" also has some decent riffs and the song sounds more heavy than most on here except the beginning of \"Zero to None\". Mille's vocals here are probably the best as they sound agressive and the shouting element is not as obvious here. We also have a solo here, but once again it is in the background.\n\nNow we also have many songs on here that completely suck. \"Reflection\", \"Karmic Wheel\", and \"Depression Unrest\" are all weak songs with hardly any riffs, very weak guitars and drumming, and just seem to meander all over the place for a good 5-6 minutes. All 3 of these songs are basically a waste of space except for maybe a few short sections. And then we have the biggest insult to the whole album, \"Realit Atckontrolle\" which seems to compose of a bunch of weird noises put together, such as a screech from a guitar, some banging, some moaning, and it repeats for a little over a minute. And the fact that this load of shit is only 1:22 is the only good thing that could be said about it.\n\nOverall this is a rather weak release for Kreator especially considering what preceded it. I am a bit forgiving with the grade as if this had come from an average rock/hard rock/industrial metal band I wouldn't have considered it horrible, but coming from Kreator this is definately a huge let-down.\n",
        "\nThis is Kreator's third album and one that continues the excellence and quality that Endless Pain and Pleasure to Kill brought. While it is unable to live up to Pleasure To Kill it is an excellent album nonetheless. Still sounds very harsh, Mille's vocals are still great if not better here, and the chaotic solos are still present. \n\nSome changes on this album is that Ventor only gets to sing on \"As The World Burns\" and I feel it is the weakest song on this album. The riffs and drumming just aren't very memorable to me and while not a horrible song, it warrants skipping through after a few listens. Ventor's vocals are still great and I feel he should have sung on more than just one song here. \n\nThe chaotic solos on this album are still present and a perfect example of this would be the screechy and quick solo in \"Blind Faith\" which is definately a great song with great lyrics. However there are less solos here. Its more like one solo per song instead of one to as much as four. \n\nThe drumming on here is very tight and and very enjoyable as I still think Ventor is one of the greatest drummers out there however the drumming seems more plainer than it was in Pleasure to Kill, it is still quick and furious though. \n\nThe riffs are also something of a very big highlight on this album. I talk about the drumming being more plainer and fewer solos however the riffs here are just unimaginable. There are tons of them, and they are all so very catchy. I don't think I've listened to an album with at least half as many catchy riffs as this album. This is definately a riff heaven and the biggest advantage of this album.\n\nAnd if I could think of another negative it would only be that this album is pretty short, not even 40 minutes, although it does make up for it in quality. \n\nSome excellent songs and highlights of the album are definately \"Blind Faith\" with its quick and harsh melodies and great lyrics such as \"Roman Empire, Christian persecution is here Strongest desire: eradicate the new sectarians\" as well as the vocals. \"Terrible Certainty\" is also one of the best songs here with its excellent drum intro. \"Toxic Trace\" is certainly up there with Mille's great and extremely quick vocals and with the extremely catchy riffs. The lyrics here are also excellent such as, \"Pesticide in torrents, how fast it flows Total pollution the earth can't stand much longer\". \"One of Us\" also has some very catchy riffs. \"Behind the Mirror\" is one of my favorite songs on this album. It starts off with a very nice guitar intro and explodes into very catchy riffs and lyrics as well as vocals. This song also has a very raw feeling to it.\n\nA complaint for the album would definately have to be the production which really isn't very good especially on the last song, \"Behind the Mirror\". It makes the album sound even rawer and a little better production here wouldn't hurt. Other than that and one mediocre song this album is virtually perfect, though I don't think anything, at least now, will ever rival \"Pleasure to Kill\".\n",
        "\nThis album is just an incredible masterpiece and has to be one of the top 3 albums I've ever listened to. It has everything that is essential to a thrash album and more from chatoic solos to being assaulted by 34857827852 terrific and all memorable riffs, to being able to break your neck while headbanging to the album. \n\nWe start off with an intro called \"Choir of the Damned\". This can't really be called a moodsetter for the rest of the album because its not crazy enough and is rather quiet. What follows it is \"Ripping Corpse\" and this will seriously rip you apart. It starts off with great loud drum banging from Ventor who plays terrifically here, and then come in the guitars and eventually chaotic solos of which you will usually find 2 or more in each song. Another highlight, well basically all of them, but the best ones are likely to be \"Pleasure to Kill\", which has some of the best lyrics ever written to a song, \"The Pestilence\", which is the longest and probably most powerful thrash assault ever created by Kreator, to \"Command of the Blade\" which has some some of the most furious drumming I've ever heard.\n\nAnother highlight of this album is that we not only have Mille doing the vocals, but Ventor does the vocals on \"Death is Your Savior\", \"Riot of Violence\", and \"Command of the Blade\". Ventor's vocals are much different but they are still very good. In fact, I can't honestly say that Mille could have done a better job but its hard to compare the two vocals because they are different. Mille has a very angry growl and it actually sounds like some guy who hates children is scolding them. Ventor sounds different. His voice is more loud and aggressive. But they are both great. \n\nEven the three songs taken from the EP \"Flag of Hate\" are some great raw thrash/death metal songs although they really are raw and have poor production. They are still enjoyable though.\n\nEither way be prepared to be amazed by this album whether it is thrash or even death metal you like as Kreator does have some death metal influences in their music. It is just amazing and one of the best thrash albums ever recorded. If you are a thrash fan and don't own this album by now, I don't know where you've been but get it and quick. You will not be disappointed.\n",
        "\nYou can get a pretty good idea of what you\u2019re in store for with a glance at the DVD cover, which has the Kreator Coma of Souls guy slicing the heads off of attacking demons. Which is kickass German thrash metal. This, being released at the same time as the double live album, has the same performances as Live Kreation with the exception of the closer Flag of Hate/Tormentor (those being from the With Full Force Festival). Not all of the songs from the live album are on the video but those are made up for with all of the DVD\u2019s special features.\n\nThe sound is fucking awesome and the footage is great. Mille plays away fiercely on stage and knows how to get the crowds feeling \u201caggressive.\u201d The crowds in Korea respond surprisingly well, singing along enthusiastically. Ventor bangs away furiously and even takes over vocal duties (Allright Busan!!!!) for Riot of Violence. The only person that I had a problem with was Sami Yli, not because his playing wasn\u2019t good it was just that he had no stage presence. While Mille is headbanging like crazy he just kind of stands there looking bored. But that hardly takes away from the concert. The new shit is played really well. A definite highlight is the great version of Lost, which I originally thought of as just another shitty 90\u2019s Kreator song.\n\nBetween songs they show different clips of the Violent Revolution tour with some appearances by Sodom, Eric from Testament, Gene Hoglan, Paulo from Sepultura, Snake from Voivod and a bunch of other people. One of the best parts of the DVD is the history section which is a little documentary about the band with all of there videos (without Coma of Souls). It has some cool interviews and shit in German so you\u2019ll need to put on the subtitles during this section. This is really cool and also lets you see the sad decline from Toxic fucking Trace to Endorama. Other special features are the usual discography which has pretty much everything Kreator has ever done, a small \u201cmaking of Live Kreation\u201d thing, and a slide show. \n\nThe only thing I guess I could complain about is that they could have replaced Servant in Heaven or something with Under the Guillotine or Awakening of the Gods for the DVD. And that the in between fan footage can get annoying. Oh wait a second you can choose to watch the concert by itself without that crap. Nevermind.\nHighlight performances: Betrayer, Flag of Hate, Terrible Certainty, and\u2026 Terrorzone = Fucking YES.\n",
        "\nI must confess that it's very hard to review this album, because I'm currently listenning to it and I'm wearing a Kreator's \"Pleasure to Kill\" t-shirt and I can't stop banging my head, so it makes it 666 times harder to write this review!\n\nAnd now - the review.... \nThis album opens with a great instrumental intro, it's silent and calm, but it's only a short calm before the mighty storm, the merciless Thrash attack that's caled \"Ripping Corpse\"! This is one of the most agressive songs I've ever heard. Neither slayer nor even Dark Angel have ever played so brutally! And the lyrics are so fuckin' loaded with horror that I can't believe that this band made such albums as \"Extreme Aggression\" a few years later...... This is one of the best Death/Thrash Metal songs ever! The main riff is catchy yet very fast and brutal, and the solo is just made perfectly. Ohhhhhhhh, my poor neck!\n\nThe next song is \"Death is your Saviour\" and it's title speaks for itself.... You don't even have to read the lyrics in order to understand that if you don't like this album and you don't bang your head like a maniac while listenning to these lethal riffs, the meaning of it is that you're a fuckin' poseur who doesn't understand what metal is all about and only an immediate death could save you from your meaningless existance! I was really surprised to discover that this song's lyrics have nothing to do with poseurs..... Well, death to the fuckin' poseurs again, anyway!\n\nThe following song is \"Pleasure to Kill\" and I don't recommend that you read this song's lyrics before going to bed, kids! Maniac song, maniac riffs...... What else can one ask for?!\n\nAnd then comes a TOTAL FUCKIN' RIOT OF VIOLENCE!!! This is the best song in this album, in my opinion, yet this song is the worst thing that Kreaor could play live, since the vocallist here is not Mille but Ventor, and though Ventor made his job in the studio perfectly, both as a drummer and as a singer, this song is so fast, agressive and mad for being played during live performances, that it isn't really possible to sing so fast and agressively while drumming so brutally. Anyway - this song is really brilliant both musically and lyrically. It's one of the first songs where Kreator started to criticize the crappy society that we live in, instead of singing horror-stories styled songs (not that their the horror stories styled songs don't kick goddamn ass!) and it's definately a great start!\n\nIf you survived this crazy riot of violence, don't think that it's over..... It has just begun, so you still have a great chance to die by The Pestilence!!! Fuck, Ventor so rulZ! The drumming in the beginning of the song just rules, and Ventor keeps exploding the listenner's ears during the whole almost 7 minutes long song! \nDoes anyone know how many riffs are there in this song? I tried to count, but I failed... This song is really a crazy riffs-assault and the solos here are very impressive too. Don't expect to hear a one 7 minutes long guitar solo here, kids, since we're not talking about a crappy Dream Theater's song, but about a bloddy & merciless metal attack! Kreator were deeply inspired by Venom and not Malmsteen and that's why they've become one of the greatest metal bands ever. This song is one of those great examples where you can see that one doesn't have to be Paul Gulbert in order to play good solos, but it's enough just to play from your fuckin' crazy heart, play fast and agressively, just play metal!\n\nAfter the long and massive attack aka \"The Pestilence\", comes \"Carrion\". In this song, Tormentor meets Kreator and the result is total destruction of all the world! This song's lyrics remind Tormentor's songs from the \"Blitzkreig\" demo, yet here they have a different meaning. These guys definately grew up since their \"Tormentor\"'s era and their lyrics' level grew up with them ass well. This is definately not a stupid song about the devil and other shit, but a serious political song and it's also a well done one! \n\nHere comes the before last song and I'd like to stop here, since the only thing that I'm feeling in my neck is ENDLESS PAIN, but I won't do it, since I'm afraid that I'll get a Command of the Blade, if I stop reviewing this killer album now. Ventor's vocals sound more agressive then ever here and I really don't unerstand why so many people so fuckin' dislike his voice.... Personally I don't think that Petrozza could do it better. Anyway - this song rules and I don't have anything more to say about it, except that it's just fine!\n\nFor those violent thrashers who really survived this thrash attack thus far, I'd like to wish all the best! For all those whose ears weren't strong enough to survive this flesh ripping album, I have nothing to wish but death, Under the Guillotine!!! \nYes, I know, many other bands have written great songs about people who were sentenced to death penalty and described their feelings just before they met their death. Iron Maiden's \"Hallowed Be Thy Name\" and Metallica's \"Ride The Lightning\" deal with the same subject, and Aria's \"Night is Shorter than the Day\" doesn't differ from these songs too (though it was recorded many years later), but this song rules not less than every one of these songs! Catchy riffs, catchy lyrics, yet we're still talking about a killer Thrash fuckin' attack! A perfect way to finish a perfect album!\n\nThis album is a must have one and I hope that if you're reading it - then you're doing it not because you have never listened to it and you just wonder what the Hell this album is about. If you really haven't listened to this masterpiece yet - it means that you must get this album right now, even if you'll have to sell your soul to the Devil for it!\n",
        "\nGee\u2026seems as though the new Kreator disc has stirred up an array of differing opinions on the boards since its release in late January. Some of the backlash directed its way had me reeling on occasions. There are some fans out there who believe that after 20 years, the mighty Kreator are now but a puppet to the melodic death sound that is such an endemic part of the current metal scene. Not worth a pinch of dog shit they say. Fucking hell punters, what are they listening to? \n\nIt all smacks of highbrow elitism as far as I\u2019m concerned. Sure, everyone\u2019s entitled to their opinion, but for some to write off Kreator and \u2018Enemy of God\u2019 as pure drivel is simply insane. If \u2018Enemy of God\u2019 is a Scandinavian laced melodic death album, then put a fork in me folks. I\u2019m done. Personally, other than the appearance of Arch Enemy\u2019s Michael Amott, I cannot for the life of me hear anything Swedish about this new album. Granted, there\u2019s a modern warmth about the Andy Sneap production and the melodic lead elements are a significant development for the band, but for the most part, this is straight up signature Mille Petrozza thrash. \n\nI love my Kreator folks. I\u2019ve a real soft spot for them. Having met Mille once on their \u2018Renewal\u2019 tour and interviewed him since a couple of times for metal radio, I\u2019ve always been impressed with the guy\u2019s humility and down to earth mannerism. This has only strengthened my adoration for the band. I treat the release of any new Kreator album as a major event and the arrival of \u2018EOG\u2019 some three years after the excellent \u2018Violent Revolution\u2019 has me rather excited.\n\nThe greatest aspect about Kreator is their longevity. Along with Slayer and Overkill (and maybe Testament), they are perhaps the only other 80\u2019s Thrash act that has held stead fast and true their style. The 90\u2019s weren\u2019t kind to Kreator, but they survived and as far as I am concerned they\u2019ve never actually released a \u2018dud\u2019 album (although there is merit in questioning the direction of \u2018Endorama\u2019). In 2005, Mille Petrozza still has his band firing on all cylinders, and while \u2018EOG\u2019 doesn\u2019t exactly re-write metal history (maybe because they\u2019re responsible for much of it anyway) in terms of musical ideas, it is nevertheless, another completely thorough, consistent and well constructed Kreator album. In light of what \u2018Violent Revolution\u2019 did in exploring the \u2018old-school\u2019 ground of their \u2018Extreme Aggression/Coma of Souls\u2019 period, \u2018EOG\u2019 delivers exactly what you would expect. \n\nIf there is one slight development on \u2018EOG\u2019 that has crept its way back into their sound it is the melodic component of their compositions. It\u2019s not quite a solid meeting of the \u2018Endorama\u2019 headspace and the sharpness of \u2018VR\u2019 but the vibe it there. Particularly so in the excellent lead work that Sami Yli-Sirni\u00f6 is allowed to explore throughout this album. Furthermore, some of the chorus structures and phrasing that Mille has written (particularly on \u2018Voices of the Dead\u2019) also have a somewhat \u2018catchier\u2019 or edge to them. For me, it\u2019s all positive and it\u2019s achieved without ever compromising their aggression. However, if you\u2019re looking for some sort of Pleasure to Kill \u2018riot of violence\u2019 style vocals, then it just isn\u2019t the case. This is not to say Mille has taken up singing lessons \u2013 far from it \u2013 vocally, 98% of this album is delivered in the distinctive scathing and spitting venomous fury style that you expect from Mille Petrozza. \n\n\u2018Enemy of God\u2019 is an excellent Kreator album. It marks the logical follow up to the old-school rediscovery captured on \u2018Violent Revolution\u2019. Sure, it\u2019s not a ground breaking thrash album like most of their earlier material, but what it does represent is a band that has continually grown and evolved. \u2018EOG\u2019 is the result of 20 years of honing and perfecting a style all their own. \u2018EOG\u2019 is a thoroughly dynamic and carefully molded modern metal album. It has maturity and class and more importantly, integrity stamped all over it - If only other former \u2018thrash\u2019 acts could still produce the quality that has been captured here. Swedish metal? Fucking Bollocks!! All hail Mille Petrozza.\n",
        "\nI suppose after the seminal Coma of Souls many Kreator fans were anxiously anticipating the next chapter in this thrash legend's ongoing tradition of aggressive, ripping thrash metal that made Slayer look like PETA members. \n\nRenewal, however, is no Pleasure to Kill, instead of breakneck tempos, violent lyrics and relentless pounding from the rythum section, it focuses more so on vocals, chugging riffage, and mild industrial overtones. \n\nThis isn't to say Renewal is worthless, Winter Martyrium, the title track, and Europe after the Rain are likely to please fans, however, they fail to support the whole album. \nThe lyrics are more interesting, in my opinon, certainly a step up from the \"I love to kill things\" crop of their earlier work. However, the vocals are put too far in the forefront in the production, and moreover, it sounds likes Mille is shouting because people in the back can't hear him, and his overall performance is rather uninspired on the whole.\n\nFurthermore, the guitars are too quiet, getting behind the drums and vocals, leaving you craving a screaming solo, or even a good riff to headbang along to. These elements, when put together, create a slow paced (for Kreator) mess instead of a concise, aggressive performance. When take in consideration with some poor songwriting on quite a few tracks, and a senseless filler track (Realitatskontrolle), Renewal becomes a fairly forgettable album instead of breaking headway in the new direction Kreator wanted to go. Mostly uninspired, but worth a few listens.\n",
        "\nKreator sounds like they're really all out of ideas... from being visionary thrashmasters, then moving on to their own little direction (Renewal) which wasn't all that good, but still was sorta interesting... then finally sinking to Endorama levels before coming back with the formulaic Violent Revolution. \n\nThis is basically the even more formulaic Violent Revolution. They've jumped on the Gothenshit bandwagon with both feet this time, and other than a few riffs here and there, this isn't much of a thrash album. It's got an In Flames/Arch Enemy production, and riffs to match... seriously, this is such an Arch Enemy album it's not even funny, from the vocals to the random harmonised guitars, to the weak pseudo-thrash riffage... to the awful breakdowns and that horrible unlistenable melodic shit that plagues all \"metuhl\" releases nowadays. I have no idea who decided that putting Iron Maiden through a fagginess filter was a good idea, but hey everyone's on the bandwagon, so why not a legendary thrash band too?\n\nThe whole thing lacks punch. Where Violent Revolution had decent production and did a reasonable job of throwing in some face-snapping riffs, this one just muddles the lead and rhythm guitar together into an unrecognisable slop that is neither the brilliant lead work (see: Agents of Brutality - now THAT is how to make a melodic solo!) nor the face-spiking riffage (do I need to give an example??) of classic Kreator.\n\nYeah, Pleasure to Kill this isn't.\n\nLemme just get the one highlight out of the way... the title track... fucking awesome. This is better than anything on Violent Revolution, and compares well to the classic stuff. The middle break is completely fucking raging and even manages to be somewhat original. When it kicks into high gear after \"timeless glory awaits\", you can't help but bang your fucking head... man, this album starts off so damn promising, like another Coma of Souls. The vocals aren't nearly as mean, the production is far too slick, and the end drags out some, but one can hope.\n\nHope dies fast with the impossibly formulaic second track. Now this one does not yet completely bring the ass-sex, but it's just really damn boring, combining a not particularly distinguished under-verse riff, with a horrendous Big Dumb Chorus (see: Virtual XI for poorly done choruses of this sort). There's one pretty cool riff at 2.40, but it's surrounded by pointless melodic-lick soloing, and again, the production is just really damn bad - this is supposed to come exploding out of your chest, but it's fuzzy around the edges and sounds generally weak. It fills the soundscape nicely, but nothing buzzsaws out in particular. This is the type of whiffle-thrash that made Sacred Reich \"famous\". It wasn't good then, and it's not good now.\n\nThen comes the slow decay into awfulness. See the modulated, harmonised opening riffage of Suicide Terrorist, which is of course a take on the Riff Everyone Uses (from Megalomania to Aces High to Overkill (Overkill) to to to ...) that finally explodes into some triumph during the verses, but again there are so many random extra guitar parts... they of course throw in another one of Everyone Uses this Riff type riffs... this is of course Under the Blade, which morphed into Feel the Fire, and Heathen, and Beneath the Remains, and even Brainseed from Renewal... go ahead, hear that riff at 1:45... it would be a damn schweet riff if given the proper production, but this just sounds like excrement here in such a modern context.\n\nSo up to here this is just a bad thrash album with bad production and one AWESOME track, but no, around 2.42 of the next track, World Anarchy... oh NO, here comes the ASS FUCK!\n\nSeriously, what the fuck, did I download an Opeth album!?! Holy shit. Then throw in a bad bouncy breakdown (go and listen to that next riff, it's like a fucking Meshuggah mathcore riff) with distorted Outcast vocals... oh crap. \n\nIt's all downhill from here... see the awful meandering chorus of Dystopia, the too-few-and-far-between riffage, and again, all that faggy melodic shit. Voices of the Dead attempts to be epic, and fails, and they repeat that melodic lick a few too many times, but overall it's the best of the faggy Endorama-meets-In-Flames stuff. Still, not something I'd pluck out for listening to, unlike the title track.\n\nI honestly have listened to the *entire* album only once, because the signal to noise ratio of everything after track 3 is completely terrible - it's not worth sifting through the horrible melodic breakdowns to get to the occasional okay thrash riff. Beyond the first song, there isn't an actually memorable riff to be found here. Then the production kills the been-there-done-that riffs. Who knew, that you could make Under the Blade sound pussified.\n\nThat's an accomplishment. \n\nThey better not suck live. That's all I gotta say. Because this album is really damn bad. Download the first song, forget the rest. Oh yeah this doesn't sound anything like Coma of Souls, so don't hope for that.\n",
        "\nHoning their sound through two initial studio albums, Kreator screams back with even more speed, technicality and tight musicmanship. Less raw and brutalising than the seminal \"Pleasure to Kill\", and now sounding more menacing with crisp and crunchy guitars and skull cracking drums. Mille Petrozza takes over full time on the vocals which give this album Kreator's inimitable quality, helping his ferocious hiss separate the band from the pack. The songwriting is more focused and concise, and in turn more standardised but never predictable. It\u2019s altogether an album packed in tightly with intricate riffs and furious drum patterns but doesn't take off in any labyrinthine fashion. This also marks the band\u2019s transition from a death/thrash boundary pusher to a more regular, but certainly not run of the mill thrash outfit. \n\nTheir full complement of lethal ideas, more experience of handling their instruments and further refusal to slow down even a notch (in fact I think this is in places faster than its predecessor) is testament to this. It takes in more outside influence and reflects the development of the genre, but there is still more Kreator present in this album than anything else though lead guitar is still pure Slayer worship. The band manages to execute their new ideas flawlessly and with little difficulty, as the songs tear along smoothly with the complex but catchy riff assault. Each song is always turning new corners with \u201cBlind Faith\u201d, \u201cTerrible Certainty\u201d and \u201cToxic Trace\u201d standing out from the rest.\n\nComplaints are minor with its relative shortness the biggest annoyance by far. My version of the album includes the original tracklist version of the \u201cOut of the Dark\u2026 Into the Light\u201d E.P. which contains two acceptable songs that could have fit into any given place on this album, and some rather disappointing live tracks. Messy and sounding a little unprofessional, it seems they weren\u2019t so comfortable performing their newer material live yet.\n",
        "\nNow here's a band who's hit the bottom of the curve and worked their way up. A lot of bands that have been around for at least 15-20 years have had that happen. Maiden, Megadeth, Priest, Metal Church, etc... And now Kreator.\n\nNow for a history lesson\n\nAfter Outcast, and then Endorama, the band hit an all-time low. After the 90's, the band released Violent Revolution. It was good, but about halfway through, it kinda slumped. Now that Kreator has gotten all the weeds out of VR, we're left with this. ENEMY OF FUCKING GOD!\n\nAll I can say is that as soon I listened to the first track, i was astounded. The last time I heard something this fucking awesome was Deathchain's \"Deadmeat Disciples\" back a few months ago. THAT is album is just nuts. EOG is fucking insane, and better production as one said about this album. It's true. The older albums were good, but the production turned me off a lot. But on here, everything is heard nicely and is very crisp.\n\nThe title track starts out the album and just blows the skin off your scalp. Mille Petrozza just sounds so infuriated like he's ready to kill someone. Even some semi-melodic riffs can be found, without taking away from the intensity. The chorus is well done. The bridge is very well executed. Nice little melodic outro too.This is sure to be in Kreator's set list for a long time, as there is some instant classic feel to it as well.\n\nNext is Impossible of Brutality. There's some melodic death metal tendencies around here, but again does not fail to deliver. My god, these vocals are filled with so much fury. Think of Tom Araya in his prime, ala Reign In Blood and South of Heaven. And the drums here are excellent.\n\nSuicide Terrorist is very nice. Not the most insane song but still good. It's nice to see the band does not give in to letting up one bit, as some older thrash bands do these days.\n\nWorld Anarchy is AWESOME! Some nice screams and use of the whammy. And just let me bang my head for a moment... ok... wait...\n\nOk, now we move on to Dystopia. I could see Slayer doing this around the Seasons in the Abyss era. This is very mid-paced but still thrashy.\n\nVoices of the Dead is kind of the first chance you get to catch your breath, although the only chance one should have to catch their breath is when an album is FUCKING OVER! But nonetheless, it doesnt last long. The song moves into a semi-melodic piece, which itself moves into some nice heavy riffs. The vocals are harsh, only one complaint. The little lead thing in the chorus is annoying and shouldnt be there. Above average solo.\n\nMurder Fantasies is good, but doesnt stand out as much. Kind of like Suicide Terrorist. Nothing all out great here. Reminds me of Violent Revolution.\n\nWhen Death Takes Its Dominion starts out really dark. Nice build up as well. The rest is just pretty straight forward.\n\nOne Evil Comes (A Million Follow) has some Death influence with a galloping flow to it. These choruses are getting slightly annoying. The past few songs have been average and would really stand out if the choruses were better made and/or just created havoc on the world. Maybe some more leads would help too.\n\nDying Race Apocalypse starts out kinda weird but the main riff has a good beat and the vocal line is pretty cool. The double bass is crazy.\n\nUnder A Total Blackened Sky. Speed is the name here. Where the middle of the album was kinda average, things starts to go back up. This is awesome thrash. More harsh vocals and good riffs. One more complaint. The chorus is still kinda sour, and almost sounds [email\u00a0protected]#*^[email\u00a0protected]^$%% Dont let it scare you though, as long as you can handle it for about 10 seconds.\n\nThe Ancient Plauge is the album closer. It has an epic feel to it. Some acoustics and harmonic leads. At the minute and a half mark, the song really picks up with HEAVY ASS RIFFS! WHOA! This is a well made song, and nice way to close the album, even though I'd have preferred a absolutely spine crushing closer, this is just fine.\n\nGet this you'll enjoy this.\n",
        "\nPast Life Trauma was my first Kreator album, after having heard a few mp3's a few months before I bought said album. As a compilation, it's very well rounded, with a great mix of early pseudo-death metal era, and plenty of mid era riff madness Kreator. I happen to prefer the mid era stuff (Terrible Certainty-Coma of Souls) because I love the songwriting, even if the performance isn't quite as furious as Pleasure to Kill. That having been said, this cd gave me a good feel for what stuff I loved (Extreme Aggressions, People of the Lie, etc.) and that which I liked, but felt was unremarkalbe or underdeveloped (Under the Guillotine, Flag of Hate). Kreator has come to be one of my favorite thrash bands, and this nice best of was an excellent introduction for me into the world of German thrash. \n\nHighly reccomended to any metal fan not familiar with Kreator. Otherwise, I don't really see the point of \"best of\" albums and tend to avoid them unless they are my first purchase of a band's material.\n\nThe \"rare\" tracks (Winter Martyrium-live, After the Attack, Trauma, Europe after the Rain-live) are all very cool, and I especially like after the attack - cool lyrics about a post nuclear world. Europe after the Rain has a long speech in the beginning which is apparently an anti-facist statement, altough I don't speak German. Still, the song is good stuff, as is Winter Martyrium. \n2 horns out of 2 \\m/\n",
        "\nYou will be thrashing it around nonstop.\n\nFirst of all, if I had to sum up this album in a few words: Fast, loud, guitar harmonies, killer vocals.\n\nMost of my exposure to thrash vocals prior to listening to Coma of Souls is more in the vein of Steve Souza or Chuck Billy. DAMN! This is something else. They're kind of like BM vocals, but better. They're raw, they're raging, and articulate, for the most part. No studying the fucking liner notes so you can sing along here.\n\nAs per almost every thrash album in existence, this one has an intro with acoustic guitars. Then a distorted melody line... THEN DEATH AND PESTILENCE TO ALL! The riffs are fast, and have an odd atonal melody to them. I know \"atonal melody\" sounds complete nuts, but it makes total sense with this riffage. The opening track, When the Sun Burns Red, for me, is the biggest standout. Even the verse riffs kick ass, thats how good this song is. And the chorus riff is nuts. Then things slow down and solos rip your eyes out of your sockets and play ping pong with them.\n\nThe title track is pretty fucking sweet, too. Brutal opening riff. Did I mention you can hear the bass? You can. And it's nice and rumbly and stuff. It'll make your floor shake right good. The rhythm section is rounded out by fucking precise drumming. I mean laser guided missile into an air vent precise. The bass drum is tight without sounding like some fuckhead tapping on his desk in Calculus.\n\nMy only real complaint about this monster is that, in the end, it all goes by too quickly. It's fast, it's slow, it's heavy. It's fucking Kreator and they're the best thing to come out of Germany since Oktoberfest. Also, in some songs, like People of the Lie (which has an awesome drum fill in the middle), the vocals are a little too quiet. Oh yea, and People of the Lie has a killer melodic solo.\n",
        "\nStarts off with even \u201cworse\u201d production than Pleasure to Kill, but this album/EP has tormentor on it, so you cannot complain. I like Pleasure to Kill more, but this album has value, and you have to excuse them for minor things because it\u2019s a really early EP. The song Flag of Hate is a lot of fast screaming with some great inaudible riffs in the middle. It\u2019s rough around the edges, also not leaving one second for you to recover from the thrashy madness. The drums sound very loud and the double bass is amazing, having this bubbly sound to it. The sound is really open, but still closed, like being recorded in a small room with the resonance of a warehouse, the sound goes everywhere, but is still closed\u2026\n\nTake Their Lives has a great thrashy intro with a killer riff. Mille enters with his typical dissonant black/thrash vocals. It\u2019s a midpaced thrasher, with some awesome guitar fills and interesting rhythm. The feel is harsh, commanding, yet desperate, trying to get something he can\u2019t\u2026 reaching out somehow, especially in the last part where he screams \u201cTake their liiiiiiiiiiiiiiveesss\u201d. The song changes completely in the middle, to a little faster paced thrash, with a lovely dissonant solo in it. The advantage of the album is that it just gets better and better, through the fast attack Awakening the Gods, and Endless Pain, which seems to have different vocals on it, or at least altered Mille vocals. The classic Tormentor is on this too, which is even better live, cus he uses more growly vocals rather than the high vocals on here\u2026 Total Death is in the same vein as Tormentor, but with more poisonous vocals\u2026.\n",
        "\nFunny how Pleasure to Kill starts off with a soft acoustic intro, and then turns into this big thrash\u00a1K ahhh the beauty of contrast. Ripping Corpse, a great example of groovy thrash with no production whatsoever. The drums rape your ears, not letting go only for the fast drum fill here and there. Mille, a young brat then, screams like a madman, while playing really sloppily, this is the sound of underproduced thrash, but it sounds so great and so primal, you just feel like acting out their song titles listening to it. The bass is so muddy on this album, even when I put the bass all the way down, it still penetrates the guitars, or guitar, since Mille was alone on this album on guitars and vocals.\n\nDeath is your Saviour (yes, with a \u00a1\u00a7u\u00a1\u00a8, he learned it the tr00 way ;)), really fast unintelligible vocals, fast solo that sounds like it wouldn\u00a1\u00a6t have mattered if it was there. This album goes so fast, even time speeds up when you listen to it, ripping through song after song. It doesn\u00a1\u00a6t ever let you rest, except in the short breaks between songs, and I bet if they could, Kreator would just keep playing for 30 minutes long, just to destroy your brain. The solos really are lame in the Slayer sense of lame, but they\u00a1\u00a6re so appropriate. The riffs are simple, but catchy as hell, who needs musical wankering now? Pleasure to kill, probably my favorite track on the album, and I can actually hear what he\u00a1\u00a6s saying on this song too, and the part where he goes \u00a1\u00a7PLEASURE TO KILL\u00a1\u00a8, just gets me going every time\u00a1K.\n\nDidn\u00a1\u00a6t really like this album at first, as it seemed like the songs were all the same, but that\u00a1\u00a6s the beauty of it in my opinion, there are some serious differences, but they\u00a1\u00a6re not immediately clear to people, and a pop listener probably would just leave it with \u00a1\u00a7it\u00a1\u00a6s all the same\u00a1\u00a8, and let it catch dust. It\u00a1\u00a6s definitely a great album for an early thrash band, and live they\u00a1\u00a6re even better with these songs, tearing it up.\n\nIt\u00a1\u00a6s definitely not chamber music, and I would highly recommend it for workouts or other activities where you just needs some primal energy. Songs like Riot of Violence show again that you do not need skill, just catchiness in a song, the main riff is extremely hooky and catchy, but a kid with a guitar up his ass could play it with his sphincters \u0192\u00ba.\n\nYou will always see traces of the early stuff people played in later albums, as can I with Kreator, Riot of Violence, Ghetto War, and Terror Zone all have the same feel to them, yet are from totally different years.\n\nThe drumming is actually really catchy on this album, and the little drum intro to The Pestilence is just weird how cool it is, even though they sound like someone ran the tape through dirt after they recorded it, it has a great edge to it.\n\na classic thrash album.\n",
        "\nSince my first contact with them I have always been a big fan of Kreator. Mille's vicious snarl accompanied by the out-of-this-world heavy riffs is an embidoment of all that is good with real metal. Also, for those new to Kreator who've only heard \"Violent Revolution\", this is an excellent way to get into the material from their glory days. Most of their classic songs from the Pleasure To Kill-Coma of Souls era are featured here in great versions. \n\nThe production job by Andy Sneap is another brilliant thing about Live Kreation. The crisp, clear, yet crushing sound pushes excellent Thrash songs like \"Coma of Souls\", \"Extreme Aggressions\" and \"Flag of Hate\" to the maximum. Many of their somewhat unpopular mid-90's songs do really well here as well. The best example is \"Phobia\". This song is just catchy beyond all known catchiness.\n\nThis live 2CD is all win. 24 great songs with great production. It initially proves what Violent Revolution and the brand new Enemy of God have been indicating. This band is back with a vengeance, bringing real Thrash in the days of pussy-ass trends and Hatebreed kids. If there's one live album a fan of Thrash should buy, it's this one.\n\nSong highlights: \"Coma of Souls\", \"People of The Lie\", \"Reconquering The Throne\", \"Extreme Aggressions\", \"Terrible Certainty\", \"Flag of Hate\" and \"Phobia\"\n",
        "\n\"Endless Pain\" kicked your ass over and over again, a non-stop lesson in violence and brutality, and then they come up with this. Holy motherfucking corpse of christ, this is EVIL. Just look at the album cover, is that awesome or what?! A demonic figure tearing apart raging skeleton warriors wielding aces and swords. Just evil monsters, terror and all that stuff, which is what this album brings. This is Kreator before they became politically aware, and when they were only out to tear apart your skull. But man, as songwriters they grew hugely from \"Endless Pain\" to \"Pleasure To Kill\". Not only can you find some of the best riffs in thrash fucking metal on this record, but the songs have much more personality and variety in them, and as individual tracks are far more recognizable than most of those thrash classics that are usually known for their total fucking brutality (\"Darkness Descends\", \"Reign In Blood\" - man, 1986 was one hell of a year).\n\n\"Ripping Corpse\" has that slightly offbeat structure in the main riff and is quite odd, but man, it fucking works. \"Pleasure To Kill\" has that devastating slowed down middle section (\"I return to the cemetary, and my bloodlust is stilled!\"), \"Carrion\" has an even more vicious middle section - HEAR THE SOUND OF BOMBS AS THEY FALL! Fuck yes, that's like the best moment on the album. Or how bout \"Under The Guillotine\", with that crazy fucking solo section towards the end.\n\nYes, every song here is fast, brutal and evil as hell. The crazy guitar riffs smash your brains in, using pretty much the same style as the \"Endless Pain\" album but the overall feeling is less raw but even more heavy, and more in an early death metal vein at some points. Though surprisingly, my personal favourite song on here is the most harmless of the bunch (but still brutal as fuck) \"Command of the Blade\", cause it's just insanely catchy. He's coming to take you! Fuck yes. And then the crazy chorus. \"COMMAND OF THE BLADE!\" Over and over again, man that's some fun shit.\n\n\nThe monster riffage on here is also backed up by Ventor's tight drumwork. He has his own style, and is definitely one of the better drummers in thrash, and his work on \"Endless Pain\" and \"Pleasure to Kill\" was especially good. He comes up with some annihilating rhythm work, and absolutely crushing fills, working perfectly with the monster riffage, making this album just.. insanely fucking heavy. All thrashers need this, there's no excuse for not having it.\n",
        "\nKreator started their career right away on a very high note with \"Endless Pain\", a pretty damn brutal release for 1985. German thrash is general was raging at the time, led mainly by this band and Destruction, though the latter were more into the raw early black metal than the proto-death of Kreator, though they were really basically doing the same thing - tearing your face off with vicious, raw and aggressive thrashing riffage, and Kreator definitely standing out as the better of the two, at least around 1985, the time of Destruction's somewhat uninspired \"Infernal Overkill\" LP.\n\n\"Endless Pain\" just never stops to kick your ass, and shows an incredibly young and unexperienced but hungry and inspired trio of evil thrashers, wanting nothing more than to kick the asses of countless fans with lyrics that tell of evil, bloody and brutal subjects, and riffs enhancing that atmosphere, in a band originally started as a less-than-serious pastime.\n\nAs they were still quite young and unexperienced, there's a noticable lack of variety in between the songs, and some of it is slightly less memorable than what the bay area was doing at the time, for example, when monsters like \"Bonded By Blood\" for example were coming out. And speaking of which - the choruses of Kreator's \"Total Death\" and Exodus' \"Strike of the Beast\"... \"Try! To run! Or hide! From the death!\" VS \"Try! To run! Or fight! Off the strike! Of the beast\" With the exact same vocal melody. Who ripped off who? I don't care, cause both sound awesome.\n\nBut anyway. This slight lack of variety does little to hurt the album, cause what it lacks for in that factor it more than makes up for in plain awesome riffage. \"Tormentor\", for example, is the best fucking song on here, and that main riff is in total \"Bonded By Blood\" or \"Kill 'Em All\" style, catchy as fuck, while the rest of the song brutalizes you completely. This album does that pretty damn well, bringing out quite a few really catchy and simultaneously crushing riffs. Other examples would be \"Cry War\" and \"Son of Evil\", but it's all pretty fucking good.\n\nOther highlights are \"Storm of the Beast\", which has some wicked tempo changes, and the short but sweet \"Bonebreaker\" with a catchy, fast power chord main riff almost sounding like something out of the NWOBHM. And of course the headbanging madness of \"Flag of Hate\", probably the second greatest track on here. But really, there ain't a single weak song in the bunch, so if you like your early raw, brutal death/thrash from the infamous Germany, then you just cannot possibly go wrong with this, and the fact that their English was quite incompetent at the time (see review title - quote from \"Son of Evil\") just adds to the charm of early Kreator.\n",
        "\nKreator. A band which made hearts pound faster, especially in the eighties. The Germans, headed by \u2018scream machine\u2019 Mille Petrozza, stood at the top of the international Thrash scene with their aggressive music, together with bands like Slayer and Megadeth and continued to do so at the begin of the nineties with the release of albums like \u201cComa Of Souls\u201d and \u201cRenewal\u201d.\nUnfortunately, the band took to more melodic spheres after that. Which is their right, but as a fan, I was rather disappointed.\n\nAs a result of that, I was a bit reluctant when I took hold of this promo, but \u201cViolent Revolution\u201d certainly takes after it\u2019s title. To be very short, I deem it almost impossible that Kreator will NOT conquer and reclaim it\u2019s position at the top.\nThe band rages through the album that lasts almost an hour (!). The 12 tracks vary from a nice instrumental (\u201cThe Patriarch\u201d) via solid mid-tempo crushers (\u201cGhetto War\u201d and \u201cMind On Fire\u201d) \u2018till the furious Thrash songs that made the band big in the first place, like \u201cAll Of The Same Blood (Unite)\u201d (containing those typical Kreator riffs) and \u201cReplicas Of Life\u201d (with nice intro).\nFront man Mille reflected already that the CD would display an image of Kreator through the years, aggressive riffs combined with melody and structures songs. He couldn\u2019t get more right, the CD sounds really balanced, climaxing in a raging \u201cServant In Heaven / King In Hell\u201d\u2026 A classic!\n\nThe coming of guitarist Samli Yli-simi\u00f6 -who replaced Tommy Vetterli- is also \u2018bulls eye\u2019. His melodic, somewhat Scandinavian leads sound very modern. In this manner, Kreator can also appeal to younger people.\nAdd all the above with a very powerful production and it doesn\u2019t come as a surprise that the fans will embrace this CD as one of he better albums of this year.\n",
        "\nI clearly remember hearing \u201cBrainseed\u201d on my college radio station in early \u201993. When the DJ said that it was a track from the new Kreator CD, I was floored! This was some weird industrial metal, not the awesome riff-fests of Coma of Souls or Extreme Aggression. I ended up buying the CD anyway, and was left cold after the first spin. A couple of great riffs jump out at you near the end, like in \u201cDepression Unrest\u201d, and especially \u201cEurope After the Rain\u201d, but as a whole the CD is hard to digest. But after listening to it for about a week, it really grows on you. This CD is meant to be listened to as a whole, and the songs flow into each other and create a sense of rising tension and finally resolution with \u201cDepression Unrest\u201d, the last track. The guitar tone is thick and muddy, but gives the songs an effective low-end presence. The tone here is well suited for the newer song structures. Remember that these songs aren\u2019t supposed to sound like earlier thrash, but rather something new and heavy. Mille\u2019s vocals are also changed, and are more like a shouted, hardcore style. Again, this fits better with the songs overall. Lead guitar is used sparingly, and the tone is very dry. One of Frank\u2019s best solos can be heard at the end of \u201cDepression Unrest\u201d. The drums are definitely underplayed, mostly to give it an industrial feel. This technique is used very effectively in \u201cBrainseed\u201d, which has a syncopated, pounding intro. I think this CD is out of print, but if you find it used, pick it up and give it a few spins. Don\u2019t compare it to earlier Kreator, because this disc is in a class by itself.\n",
        "\nWhen mentioning Kreator, most people define their best work by their \u2018twin peaks\u2019: the pure death/thrash violence of Pleasure to Kill, and the totally rounded yet focused fury of Coma of Souls. And whilst these albums are definitely essential, there is also a case (and a particularly strong one) to be made for the highly underappreciated, and utterly devastating Terrible Certainty. Suffice to say that it\u2019s possibly the most unique and adventurous of the famous five. \n\nWhereas Pleasure\u2019s structure was strictly embedded in the play-as-fast-as-possible-create-the-most-evil school of thought, Terrible Certainty takes a step back in the speed department. The riffs are ever so slightly slower, but as technical as Kreator get, without losing their sense of catch and hook. The solos, on the other hand, are directly out of the hellish, unmelodic, cat-blender Reign in Blood variety (see Blind Faith), but whereas they didn\u2019t manage to fit the bigger picture in Slayer\u2019s case, they work in Kreator\u2019s by adding to the overall weirdness contained within the riffs and time changes. The production also lends itself to the approach taken, with its almost spacey and tense soundscape.\n\nThere are a couple of exceptions to the rule \u2013 Toxic Trace, when it gets going, could be a direct cut from the Pleasure sessions, and that No Escape main riff could have been lifted from Endless Pain \u2013 but overall, the beauty of Terrible Certainty is found within it\u2019s more strange moments. Best example of this (and ultimately strongest song) is Storming with Menace; probably the first in the line of Kreator songs which starts of with such a bizarre riff you wonder whether they tuned their guitars correctly and had a game plan before the producer hit \u2018record\u2019 (an idea later explored in full on the intro to People of the Lie, which I still don\u2019t \u2018get\u2019). But when you\u2019ve got your head around the slightly angular approach, you are compelled to find your nearest spike, run out of your house and start impaling as many people as you can find. Fuck me where did those riffs come from? They are terrible, they are catchy and you will certainly love them. \n\nThe title track is mid-paced, catchy, and a whole world of fun. It\u2019s a shame only this made it onto Live Kreation because with such a concentrated guitar heavy production, the riffwork of the entire album would shine through, not that it misses out here though. Oh well, there\u2019s always hope for the supposed EP with exclusive live tracks before Enemy of God is released.\n\nSpecial mention needs to be made of the drumming too. One of the main reasons why Kreator managed to eat at the table of the three thrash kings in1986 was down to the specialist skills of Ventor on Pleasure to Kill, proving he was no slouch to either the overwhelming technical genius of Gene Hoglan or the pure, unadulterated onslaught of Dave Lombardo. From the barbaric opening of the album, to the off-kilter patterns when the main riff kicks in As the World Burns, Ventor\u2019s drumming supports and embellishes the strange and yet crushing atmosphere of Terrible Certainty.\n\nBuy it. It\u2019s up there with Kreator\u2019s best work. Which is obviously first class.\n",
        "\nThis mini EP pushes three songs; two of the three being over six minutes long. That really doesn't matter though when you spin it. This EP offers pure fucking German thrash metal. Since it is pretty short, I will review each song to give the EP justice.\n\nThe song Flag of Hate is rather short, compared to the other songs on this album. It starts off super fast, like good thrash tends to do, and never slows down. The guitar riffs are stellar and the drummer does a good job of throwing in some beats that seem off, yet everyone still stays on beat. Even after the chorus's the song never looks to slow down. Add this in with some hate filled thrash vocals and a Slayerish solo towards the end and you got a damn good thrash song.\n\nTake Their Lives and Awakening of the gods never made it to a full-length album, but they have a lot to offer. Take Their Lives isn't a super fast song, but it carries a pack full of decent thrash riffs. The vocals shine on this song, as they do on this EP, and are sometimes growled like (especially towards the end of sentences). After three minutes and some, the song slows down and shows off some more good guitar playing. The song appropriately ends with a solo after six minutes of bang your head thrash.\n\nAwakening of the gods is another one of those good songs, that never cut it to the real time, but deserve to be there. Of course the guitar playing is awesome on this song, giving us a lot of good thrash riffs. But what stuck out in my mind the most on this song was the drumming. It seems to be louder on this track, then on the other two. Trying to keep a tempo for these fast songs while adding drum fills seems impossible, but this guy gets it done. The song goes through some tempo changes and turns out to be an overall great thrash song, but I think they over did it making the song seven minutes and thirty seconds long. \n\nOverall, three awesome German thrash metal songs that every metal head would enjoy. Production is kind of weak at times, unless you get the EP with the Pleasure to Kill re-release, then I would imagine the quality being better. Still though, great thrash metal for all time!!!\n",
        "\nKreator fucked up! Kreator fucked up! Let the chant go high in the air! Poor Kreator...they go wandering off in their frontmans interest in goth metal and soon find themselves at the mercy of the most judgemental music community on earth. How do they fix the problem? JUST LIKE ANY OTHER LOST THRASH ACT! THEY TRY TO RE-VITALIZE THE GLORY YEARS! Sadly, the band has put together a collection of \"ok\" tunes but they have HARDLY erased the junk previously released by stunning us with something so amazing we'll be convinced that they are \"back\".\n\nThis CD is extremely well produced, and it makes the middling material listenable to an extent it might not have been had someone else handed the recording duties. The band themselves are lyically on top of the game, sounding smarter than any thrash band has in years BUT the bottom line is that the songwriting is still somewhat tame, the overall atmosphere is somewhat tense and lacking in confidence. Songs like \"Ghetto War\" and \"Reconquering the Throne\" work well but the overall record sounds too smooth to have any real impact. The hooks aren't deep and the pandering nature just lends someone on the outside of the Kreator fanclub (being me) to go \"meh\". I adore earlier records like \"Endless Pain\" and \"Coma of Souls\" but this is the kind of simmering \"good\" music that plays it far to safe to keep me listening.\n\nThis being said, the Kreator fanboys should be highly pleased with this. They've gotten an \"almost\" return to form that keeps the longtime (and dedicated) fan happy. I know the feeling, some of my favorite bands have done the same thing and I've been pleased...so...if you LOVE Kreator I won't attempt to shoo you away from this record. If you DON'T love Kreator...this won't turn you to the cause.\n\nOverall, I'd say this did some of what the band hoped it would. Even so...it will probably end up in the \"who cares\" bin eventually as the classic records keep getting time and press that the newer attempts at kicking ass may very well lack. \n\nI say...buy it...for the few killer tracks...but don't expect me to say this ten years from now when \"Endless Pain\" is the only Kreator disc running in my player.\n",
        "\nSee that little line between the header and this line you are reading now? It says something like \u201cClassic Pick,\u201d doesn\u2019t it? That\u2019s a typo...it should read: \u201cTOTAL FUCKING THRASH ESSENTIAL \u2013 IF YOU DON\u2019T OWN THIS, DIE!\u201d\n\nYup, this is 56 minutes of some of the best thrash out there. \u201cRipping Corpse\u201d starts the chaotic flurry of riffs that is to come throughout the album. \u201cAwait the death by the blade/Run before it\u2019s too late!\u201d The last 20 seconds or so of the track are inhumanly awesome. \u201cDeath of Your Saviour\u201d and \u201cPleasure to Kill\u201d both rip past before you know what hits you. The drum sound on the title track is exceptional, and the main riff just rips. \u201cRiot of Violence,\u201d now we\u2019re talking! Awesome tune. Here\u2019s where the album starts to get really good. The riff here reminds me quite a bit of something Exodus would throw out. Less chaotic than the last three tracks, this one has lots of chugging riffs here, and slower breakdowns. \u201cThe Pestilence\u201d is probably my favourite track on the album. The intro riff and solo draw the listener into the best seven minutes of thrash on the disc. I like when thrash bands make things easy with a chorus that consists of the title repeated several times. Around the three-minute mark, we get a nice headbanging riff and bass line after a slower transition period, then back to hyperspeed Kreator thrash. The lead/bass combination around the 5 minute mark for the last verse is certain to destroy something. Has your neck had enough yet? Good, \u2018cause we\u2019re closing in on two of my other favourite tracks on the album: \u201cCommand of the Blade,\u201d and \u201cUnder the Guillotine.\u201d I\u2019m not even going to bother to break those two down; just thrash along, ok?\n\nNow we\u2019re getting into the bonus tracks, taken from the FLAG OF HATE EP. First up is \u201cFlag of Hate,\u201d a typical thrasher, followed by \u201cTake Their Lives,\u201d a rawer, and slower tune. When \u201cAwakening of the Gods\u201d hits, I\u2019m just like, \u201cHo-ly fuck!\u201d This song absolutely destroys. The opening minute is some of the most catchy thrash buildup that I have heard. The chorus is certain to whip you into a frenzy, if, for some strange reason, you\u2019re not thrashing about already. What a brilliant and appropriate closer to the album!\n\nFrom the opener, \u201cRipping Corpse\u201d (Following the intro, \u201cChoir of the Damned\u201d \u2013 even that rules) to the incredible epic \u201cAwakening of the Gods,\u201d PLEASURE TO KILL delivers more than the recommended daily allowance of thrash. \n\n(originally written by me for www.metal-rules.com, August, 2003)\n",
        "\nThis live release taken from Violent Revolution tour really shows Kreator as the intelligent band they are. It also answers the question of why good bands sound better live. Kreator after playing the set multiple times, can reassess which is their strengths and play to that. They can edit parts of songs, working in retrospect like they cannot do with studio releases. The release is taken from multiple live performances, nothing wrong with that in my mind. All songs come out as improved as a result. With 80\u2019s material benefiting from better production, and 90\u2019s from better performances.\n\nThe most represented album is Violent Revolution. Although it is not Kreator\u2019s best studio release, these songs are played with more conviction here. Particularly the title track, after a few listens you will not only anticipate the headbanging frenzy, you will be convinced that your only solution is to bow the greatness of Kreator. \n\nAs for the less thrashy 90\u2019s material, it benefits from the same conviction and energy. The melodic parts of \u201cPhobia\u201d, \u201cLost\u201d and \u201cGolden Age\u201d are definite highlights, I cannot listen to any of these without pressing repeat. Everything works here, pressing repeat becomes a natural response. \n\nOn this release Kreator play everything like they are on a mission. On a mission to wreck your neck permanently! They are taking mid-paced grinding thrashers and make them more memorable than pop. They make a point that brutality and melody can be integrated and be memorable at the same time. If you\u2019ve got a Reign in Blood worshipping friend, give this to him and watch the reaction. \n\nIf you have not heard this, then you do not know what Kreator are capable of. There is nothing much to add except that this is the best thrash release to date. \n\nGood thrash is not dead. Only the difference between what is real and what isn\u2019t has never been as obvious as it is now.\n",
        "\n\"Endless Pain\", eh? The title says it all, kids. It happened in 1985, when three German Metal lads - Mille, Ventor and Rob - had to be driven to Berlin (since they were all underage) to record their debut album. With no studio experience at all, they spent 10 days in the studio, put all their effort into it, and the album was done.\nThe recording quality isn't exactly the best, as the guitars are pretty thin and the drums and vocals often overpower the rest. At times the playing is not too solid, and seldom it gets downright sloppy. Mille and Ventor share vocal duties on the record, and while the former tries a raspy, Black Metal influenced vocal assault and the second prefers a more strightforward raucous scream, both of them are quite lacking in coherence and pronunciation.\nSo how can we describe the final result? REALLY FUCKING INTENSE.\nMost people (about 99%) go stright to \"Pleasure to Kill\" when it comes to early Kreator material, and I completely second that. Nevertheless, I strongly doubt that there could have been any \"Pleasure To Kill\" without this somewhat underrated debut. From the unlistenable quality of the clumsy Tormentor demos to being part of the German Thrash Trinity, this was a required step. And even if we forget about its historical significance, \"Endless Pain\" is solid at the very least. After all this is Kreator, which stands for intensity, energy, aggression and so on.\n\nDespite being the least known of Kreator's winning five (albums from \"Endless Pain\" to \"Coma Of Souls\", for the newly initiated), this album yelded some classics anyway, the first in line being of course \"Tormentor\", precious heritage of the band's humble beginnings. This is the shortest song of the album and represents what Kreator stands for, with its malicious riffs and ceaseless speed. It will remain a cornerstone in the band's live set for years to come, and rightfully so. \"Flag of Hate\" is another favourite... short drum intro, and here we go, blazing riff after riff all the way till the end. It's when you listen to this couple of tracks that you can see \"Pleasure To Kill\" approaching on the horizon; still, the rest of the album isn't exactly a letdown.\nFirst, I have to mention the album's amazing kick-in-the-balls opening, achieved thanks to two back-to-back Thrash jewels. \"Endless Pain\" begins without warning with the furious title track, which immediately assaults the listener with its frantic riffage and Ventor's angriest screams. This must have been on heavy rotation in the Necrodeath boys's stereos when they recorded their debut, \"Into The Macabre\".\n\"Endless Pain\" finishes with a pre-\"Reign In Blood\" Slayer worshipping riff, but there's hardly a moment of rest as \"Total Death\" is next. More riffs, more aggression, more malignant moods. By this pont you've already realized that this album takes no prisoners.\nAnd now, ladies and gentlemen... enter \"Storm Of The Beast\", the longest track of the lot. This has a slower opening, an dthen alternates fast verses with a crushing mid-tempoed chorus. Of course, all the riffs range from good to amazing. And did I mention that the choruses on this album manage to be catchy and intense at the same time?\n\nI mentioned overlooked cuts earlier, and it's time to do them justice. \"Bonebreaker\" is one of them, a song which had already appeared on the \"End Of The World\" demo, only made FASTER this time. The riffs are mindblowing, and take this song almost up there with \"Tormentor\" in my ranking (not quite at the same height but extremely close). This is also the home to my favourite solo on the album.\n\"Cry War\" is another demo era revenant, once again made faster and tighter. This one alternates between and square 4/4, Celtic Frosty midpaced riff and the usual flat out Thrash attack. Ventor screaming \"CRY WAAARR!!\" in the chorus epitomizes the rawness of this record pretty well, and who gives a shit if his attempt at a evil laugh sounds more like a cough than anything else. You can always go for \"Images And Words\" if you crave something more refined; still, the honest hard work behind this album cannot be mistaken.\n\"Living in Fear\" is another blistering little skullcrusher, the second shortest song on the record; after the second chorus it goes into a great instrumental section full of pretty melodic riffs and completed by yet another damn good solo. \"Son of Evil\" also destroys... great mid-tempoed break after the first verse, with some funny lyrics (\"Deny the father, deny the mother / Burning the sister, poison the brother\"!?), followed by more killer riffage. \"Dying Victims\" provides the grand finale, with a classy melodic overture and then frantic riffage all the way to the end.\n\nWow, this was one hell of a ride. This album definitely deserves more attention that it gets, people. It is a faithful document of the birth of a Metal legend (Kreator are essential, whether you like it or not), a promising effort brought forth by a young and extremely determined band. The reissue also features the four \"End Of The World\" demo songs as bonus tracks, so you really have no excuse for skipping it... unless you hate Thrash - and especially GOOD thrash -, but I know you don't.\nTIME!! TO RAISE!! THE FLAG!! OF HATE!!\n",
        "\nI'd heard a lot of praise about Kreator in the past but I never really got into them until I bought this album. I always thought they suffered from a pretty weak production in their earlier albums, especially the guitar tone. That's why my ears perked up when I heard Live Kreation for the first time. It's got a big, meaty, heavy guitar tone that does Kreator's songs justice, and that's what got me to purchase it. But wait, there's more!\n\nThe excellent production carries over to the other aspects of the songs as well. The drums sound great, with Ventor pulling off the same stuff he can do in the studio. The bass is fairly audible but it isn't terribly interesting. The riffs dominate the album like they dominate Kreator's music. The perfect guitar tone gives an ideal showcase for the riffing, especially on their older songs. Mille's vocals are pretty good, and they're an improvement on the mid-90s songs where he didn't sound so good in my opinion. Ventor does the vocals on Riot of Violence...how he can play the drums that fast and sing (or, um, yell) at the same time I have no idea.\n\nUnlike most live albums, this album wasn't recorded at a single concert, instead combining concerts from all over the world during the Violent Revolution tour. This means that all the songs were probably chosen because they were the best takes or had the best recording quality, which means great song quality at the expense of not appearing like a single concert. For this reason it's almost like a greatest hits album, which is good if you're a new fan to the band like myself. The song mixes are identical to the songs on the Revisioned Glory DVD, so if you have the DVD already or were planning to buy it, you'll be hearing identical songs (except for Flag of Hate and Tormentor, plus the music videos).\n\nA few songs here and there tend to lag...mainly the stuff from the mid-90s like Renewal or Leave This World Behind. But the rest of the songs, especially the songs from Violent Revolution, outshine them so brightly that you'll hardly notice. Especially when you consider that Live Kreation has twice as much music as your average live album. It passes the live album test of preserving the energy of a live setting with flying colors. It's especially useful to new fans like myself for giving an idea of Kreator's entire career, and for that reason I strongly recommend it to all metal fans, even if you're only marginally interested in Kreator. It made a fan out of me. It's extremely hard to pick the best songs, but \"Violent Revolution\", \"Terrorzone\", and \"Servant in Heaven - King in Hell\" are probably the songs I've listened to the most. Get this album now!\n",
        "\nThis is not the Kreator I know and love... I have seen Kreator before (10/25/03) and when I saw them, they were completely much more impressive than on this recording, which is from early 1990. Since the band's attitude is fundamentally similar during both of those times (this isn't Suckorama Tour we're talking about here), we're left to wonder quite what has gone wrong. First off, the recording is very tame-sounding. This especially comes across on the stuff from the first two albums. \n\nFor example... Riot of Violence is made into a fun song. Which is actually not a heinous crime, since it's a well-executed fun song, but that main blaster riff (the one under the first verse) just comes off as ordinary thrash. Then, Pleasure to Kill is just really sloppy and incoherent and I can barely hear the riffs at all. Also, Mille sounds rather out-of-breath and loses the snarl for a bit. \"Under the Guillotine\" has some really bad gang choruses, as does \"Tormentor\".\n\nThat said, the stuff from the later two albums (this is from Extreme Aggression tour) comes off pretty decent. The guitar tone is in line with Extreme Aggression, and songs like \"Betrayer\" and \"Some Pain Will Last\" work well.\n\nBut the thing is - if this had been my introduction to Riot of Violence, things would've not turned out nearly as well. Kreator are far better than this live.\n",
        "\nThe Scene\n\nAfter rising to the top of the German Thrash scene with their first four albums, Kreator were riding high, even having a video for their song Betrayer in rotation. After parting ways with lead guitarist Jorg \"Trizte\" Trzeblatowski, they recruited ex-Sodom six-stringer Frank Blackfire (a.k.a. Frank Gosdzik) to record their followup album, Coma Of Souls\n\nThe Result\n\nThe result is arguably the best thrash album of all time! Slowing the tempo down slightly compared to their more frenetic previous works (Terrible Certainty in particular) made for the albility to make even more crazy riffing thatn they had attempted previously, resulting in a fast, ripping and vicious album that will kick your arse from start to finish.\n\nThe Cast\n\nMiland \"Mille\" Petrozza (guitars, vocals) - Petrozza is in the finest form of his career, composing some of the most maniacal thrash riffs ever written, all tightly executed. His harsh growl seems a little more subdued on this release, but his screams are still as potent and bonechilling as ever.\n\nFrank Blackfire (a.k.a. Frank Gosdszik) (guitars) - Frank takes a more melodic and structured approach than his predecessor Trzeblatowski, lending a nice counterpoint to the chaotic nature of the riffing. \n\nRob Fioretti (bass) - Rob prefers to play basic root notes rather than follow the guitars, and locks in with Ventor to produce a nice tight rhythm section.\n\nJurgen \"Ventor\" Reil (drums) - Ventor slows down slightly from his previous works. This results in a tighter performance. He also becomes more proficient in his use of double-bass drums, using them more often than in previous works. \n\nThe Sound\n\nThe production job is nice and clear, with the drums sounding clear and not drowned in hi-hat, guitars full and crunchy, a nice smooth lead tone with just a hint of reverb to make it fuller, and bass at a reasonable level. \n\nChoice Cuts\n\nWhen The Sun Burns Red - Starts off with a clean guitar intro which is very rarely heard from Kreator. Then the song starts up with Mille's piercing \"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRGGGGHHHH!!!!!\" and it's on for young and old after that. Violent thrash riffing, numerous time changes and a nice melodic lead section from Blackfire leading into a dual lead section before a violent finish. A hellraising cut from start to finish.\n\nComa Of Souls - More of the same from Kreator, with fast obscenely precise picking, brilliant riffing, fast drumming and excellent melodic leads from Blackfire. \n\nPeople Of The Lie - A mid paced number with an excellent headbanging riff and some genuinely searing work from Blackfire around the middle of the song\n\nWorld Beyond - Short, vicious and efficient, Kreator waste no time beating the listener senseless with this murderous little cut. \n\nTerror Zone - Starting off with a melodic twin-guitar intro, this cut seems more subdued than the other, only to pick up halfway through with some thoroughly brutal riffing and demented leadwork, and some of Mille's most caustic vocals on the disc.\n\nAgents Of Brutality - Excellent fast paced work, but the best part is when it slows down for the chorus, which contains some nice double-bass from Ventor and one of the best riffs on the album. Also features a nice extended lead section.\n\nOff Cuts\n\nNot even one! All of the cuts on this album are violent and punishing and the album would probably be WORSE if any were removed.\n\nRaw Sewage\n\nNot on this album.\n\nPros\n\n- Dangerously precise\n- Whole band has never been more cohesive\n- A more varied and tighter performance from Ventor\n- Frank Blackfire's finest leads appear here\n\nCons\n\n- Mille's voice may be a little off-putting\n\nClosing Comments\n\nTo me, this is the be-all and end-all of thrash. Everything thrash should be. In short, BUY THIS ALBUM AND BUY IT NOW!!\n",
        "\nLive albums can be a hit or miss, especially with metal bands. In recent years, you have had some godly releases such as Alive In Athens, Live Insurrection and Live As It Gets. However, you also have some mediocre stuff such as Sonata Artica's and In Flames' Toyko Showdown (although the latter has grown on me a bit).\n\nWell, add Live Kreation to the former category because this thing just slays! First off, I like to mention I have the box set with the DVD and while it is also quite good, the cd is awesome because it has 24 thrashastic tracks. The first thing you notice is that they cover at least one song from every album. Now, I know many will not want to hear any songs from albums such as Outcast and Endorama but they actually are much better in the live setting. For example, the song \"Golden Age\" from Endorama. \n\nAlso, songs that are already quite awesome are also improved, if you can believe that. The songs from their last album - Violent Revolution - are given an extra dose of kick ass and come across brilliantly live. An example here is the song \"Servant in Heaven...\". \n\nPlus, there are the classics such as Tormentor, Flag of Hate, Terrorzone and Under the Guillotine.\n\nBottom line is there are no stinkers here. All the songs are great and the performances are top notch. This veteran band has their chops down and you can hear it. In addition, the packaging is great as well with great photos, lyrics, and an awesome cover.\n\nThis is a must buy live album!!\n",
        "\nKreator, known as \"The German Slayer\" for reasons more than the brutality of their riffs, seem to have done something with this album that thousands of metalheads wish their American counterparts could accomplish - rediscovered thrash. And pretty damn well, too. 'Violent Revolution' picks up where Kreator left off pre-Shitty Nineties Period, but interjects melodies that point to several weeks spent listening to 'Defenders of the Faith' and 'Seventh Son of A Seventh Son.' Though there are a couple weak spots, this album can rely on a solid core of metal.\n\nTwo of the best tracks on the album are the openers (not counting 50-second throwaway intro \"The Patriarch\"), \"Reconquering the Throne\" and \"Violent Revolution.\" The first song has a brutal, anthemic chorus carried by cymbal crashes, and a main riff reminiscient of recent Testament. As a matter of fact, this album is comparable to a less death-y 'The Gathering,' though not quite possessing the supreme heaviness nor the amazing drumming. The title track is of the SOUL-OWNING variety, with Jester Race-style lead riffs soaring over classic thrash riffs, giving way to a pulse-pounding singalong vocal melody, and finally yielding to the best Kreator chorus since \"People of the Lie.\"\n\n\"Violent revolution - reason for the people to destroy! TO DESTROY!!\" Really, that's just completely and utterly Kreator right there. An amazing song.\n\nAnother top spot is \"Mind On Fire,\" with a very Priest-like opening riff, good singing, and \"The eighties are over? We didn't notice!\" rhythm guitar spoiled only by the occasional synth-ish background wankery. \"Replicas of Life\" spotlights some actual SINGING (YOU FUCKING SELLOUTS!) and a general best-of-modern-thrash sound, similar to Shadows Fall's \"A Fire Burns In Babylon\" but with way more melody and riffs. \"Servant In Heaven, King In Hell\" has a mesmerizing bassline intro and keeps up a good groove throughout; the chorus is another good singalong, thought not on the level of the title track.\n\nThere are a few disappointments - \"All of the Same Blood\" has a very good main riff ruined by a second, hardcore, riff that comes into the mosh pit drunk and stomps around spinning its arms trying to hurt the other riffs for the sake of hurting them while forgetting the point of it all - Good Friendly Violent Fun. (And wow, was that a shitty metaphor or what?) Oh, and that 2:06 breakdown is atrocious. \"Ghetto War\"...I don't know what the fuck this is, but it has a stupid riff and annoying lead guitar.\n\nThe rest of the songs are solid, with a few weak spots (usually lead guitar melodies) but generally good headbanging thrash. More SINGING(!~!) near the end of \"System Decay.\" Not bad.\n\nSo, not 'Coma of Souls,' but not 'Endorama' either. The first two songs and \"Mind On Fire\" make this a good purchase, if only so you, too, can decide your only hope, your only solution is a violent revolution!\nViolent revolution!\nViolent revolution!\nReason for the people to destroy!\n\nIf nothing else, this review should communicate to you that that song is really, really, REALLY good.\n",
        "\nJust to let you know...I am reviewing the version that comes with the 2 CD and DVD...although I am just going to review the DVD right now...I haven't actually listened to the CD yet anyways.\n\nThis is Kreator's first live CD and DVD...and it is a very good DVD really, but I have one major complaint. Thrash is a raw form of Metal right?? It should sound intense..and mainlybe unpolished (or raw). Well, the footage of the live performances on this DVD are not very raw. The footage is very edited...tons of screen shots going on, tons of camera effects (black & white, negative color stuff, etc.). For me this just takes away from the live feel of the DVD...it seems more like a movie than live footage...and I don't like that. The only other complaint I have...and this tends to happen with a lot of music DVDs....is that you can just barely hear Mille's guitar...so at times it sounds quite lame...like when he is soloing or playing a solo rhythm...or is playing a riff by himself...like in Terrible Certainty. Other than this...the performance is quite fucking good...especially the new material and the last like five songs. Even the material from Renewal, Cause for Conflict, etc. are good. Actually, I'm beginning to think Cause for Conflict and Renewal are probably pretty good.\n\nThis DVD has some cool fucking features that give it a better rating for me also. First off...during the live concert footage they show clips from people around the world where they toured that includes tons of Metal band members such as Messiah Marcolin, Snake, Tobias Sammet, Eric Peterson, Marduk, Moonspell, among others. Secondly, there is a cool fucking history of the band that is pretty informative and has some awesome fucking clips of Kreator playing when they were Tormentor...some cool interview clips...it just has a bunch of cool fucking clips and information. The other great thing is that they have all the videos that Kreator has even made...of course there are some stinkers like Chosen Few...but its fucking cool to have them all on here.\n\nAll and all...this is a great thing to own for any fan of Kreator...and is a good introduction to the band even. Get the limited box set edition with the CDs and DVD if you can...its awesome. KREATOR!!!!! \\m/\n",
        "\nThis album is definitely a letdown after the incredible Pleasure to Kill, but when all is done, it's still a highlight of the thrash genre... it's just that what preceded it was so completely insanely great.\n\nWe start with the fast \"Blind Faith\", which is not at all unrelated to something that would appear on Extreme Aggression later, except it has a very nice drop-to-half-speed break in the middle, something that totally screams Coma of Souls. Then, \"Storming With Menace\" leads us into the hyper-catchy title track... and slowly your life will end! Throw in a very fast, chaotic solo, followed by the main riff again, and we have a winner. \n\nThen, \"As the World Burns\" and \"Toxic Trace\", which are the highlights of the album... one is pretty fast, and really fucking catchy. The second is a bit slower, and really fucking catchy. Total headbanging material here. \"No Escape\" and \"One of Us\" are also pretty good, and they lead into the awesome closer, \"Behind the Mirror\". Possibly the busiest, most chaotic Kreator song ever - little happy intro, then about 30 riffs of the fast, medium, and slow variety - a whole fuckload of overt thrash breaks, and a riff monster is born.\n\nSo it's not QUITE as good as \"Pleasure to Kill\" because there really isn't anything here like the overt fucking Carrion-esque \"engage brutal fucking smashing mode NOW\" type riff... but still, a very fucking good album. \n\nThe first five Kreator LPs are essential. This is the third. Do the math.\n",
        "\nLadies and gentlemen, be prepared for the RIFFS!! Now this, oddly enough, is the weakest of the first five Kreator LPs, and the fact that it still gets this high of a grade is a testament (hah, more like a Dark Fucking Angel if you ask me) to Kreator's excellent mastery of thrash metal.\n\nThe slight problem with the album is that the riffs are a bit watered down... think of how Pleasure to Kill had those really fucking brutal out-of-nowhere passages, and Terrible Certainty has almost as many - this one has a few, but not quite as many (Coma of Souls also has more, for those wondering). \n\nHighlights... \"Betrayer!!!\" - imagine the thrash break of \"Angel of Death\" taken in a more Sodom \"Nuclear Winter\" direction, and then sped up some. \"You will lose! Fall to your knees!\" Also, \"No Reason to Exist\" is very solid in a similar direction... but that's about it. The rest of the songs really exhibit only one speed, and while this is very very good, I miss my \"Riot of Violence\" or my \"Promise of a better future is a lie!!\". But again, some great riffs on here too... Stream of Consciousness kicks into high gear after the slow part, and overall, it's fucking worth having. If you like Kreator, you'll like this one.\n",
        "\nThis album certainly has its moments, and it is almost a comeback of sorts afer the awfully non-thrashy \"Renewal\". But, Coma of Souls this isn't. The riff work just isn't nearly as solid. Some of the songs on here are absolutely awesome, but the rest are just very generic and filler-sounding.\n\nThe good... \"Prevail\" is awesome. We start the album off in very, very strong form. \"Fear of the future! Hope for the past!!\" Similarly good is \"Men Without Gods\", and these two pretty much make up all that is really worth hearing on this album. \n\nThe rest... \"Lost\" kinda straddles the line, in that it has one really nifty riff that they use, but then they lose it in the chorus, sounding like badly done echoes of \"Material World Paranoia\" without the monster riffage at the end to save the album. Then, there is the complete filler that marks the rest of this album. It's certainly a lot better than the riffless wonders of Endorama and whatnot, but the songs tend to be really, really similar, with too many overloud double-bass moments to cover up the lack of riff action.\n\nThat said... \"Humans amok!!!\" Just download \"Prevail\", it is one of the best songs they have ever done.\n",
        "\nQuick clarification ... the title of this review comes from a live bootleg where a certain song is introduced as \"The most special death... is... Total Death!\"\n\nAnyway, moving along. This is a great debut from the German thrash masters Kreator. It's raw as fuck, and not quite as \"grab you by the fucking throat, spin you upside down, and make you meet your maker 245 times a minute\" as Pleasure to Kill, but it is certainly no slouch. It also has one of the most simply awesome album titles ever. \"What are you listening to?\" ENDLESS PAIN!!!! Doesn't get more Fucking Metal than that.\n\nFor the most part, this is very fast thrash with death-metal overtones (especially in the riff work, I hear a lot of old Sepultura or old Death in this), but at times it becomes an all-out raging thrasher, with the addition of monster counterpoint riffs. The best example of this is, the best song on here, \"Storm of the Beast\". Behold the chorus riff. Fear the chorus riff. All those caught not banging their heads will be shoved eyeballs-first into a fucking oven.\n\nAlso... \"Take their Lives\" has some great riffs in the verses, and \"Total Death\" is quite... special... yes. \"Dying Victims\" is just so fucking fast, and \"Cry War\" has that Artillery-esque total drop in speed, which is really well done. Textbook European thrash here. All the songs are really well done. Mille's vocals aren't quite as evil as on the next few albums, but they definitely go well with the material. \n\nOverall, this is the first in a series of incredibly good Kreator albums - they would, for a few years anyway, do absolutely no wrong.\n",
        "\nThis is a definite turning point in Kreator's history. At times this album goes along in its proto-deathish speed metal way, like Endless Pain, or perhaps the first few Death demos, and really not all that far removed from Venom. It's very good, if you like that sort of thing - and who doesn't. As I said, kinda Venomish, though a lot less sloppy and a whole lot more brutal.\n\nThen, every once in a while, for no reason, along comes a riff that pretty much picks you up by the genitalia, punches you in the face approximately 489342 times in a row, and then throws you against the wall, at which point it orders you to \"COMMENCE BANGING YOUR HEAD, YOU WORTHLESS PUSSY!!! Am I doing this for my own health?!?!?\".\n\nAnd you must obey. You have no choice. Kreator has spoken, often and repeatedly, and you WILL like what you hear. Oh yes you will. This is pretty much the album that revolutionised both thrash and death metal. (Don't believe me? Go listen to Morbid Angel... all of their good riffs are Pleasure to Kill style riffs!) That riff style where you play the same note 4 times, then a different note 4 times, etc etc, all really fast... Possessed had a lot of it, and Kreator had even more. Yep, this is not only one of the greatest thrash metal albums ever, it could be argued that it's one of the greatest death metal albums ever too.\n\nHighlights... Pleasure to Kill, The Pestilence, oh yes... Command of the blade! And of course Riot of Violence, the main verse riff is absolutely fucking brilliant - possibly the best on the entire album. Awakening of the Gods is such an amazing closing track... even that little intro, Choir of the Damned. This album will refuse to let you survive unharmed. Get it now, what are you waiting for??\n\n[edit: this review is of the 12-song re-release, with the last three being Flag of Hate tracks. There is also a 15-song version with three more kick-ass thrash tunes. See my Endless Pain review.]\n",
        "\nThis album is the culmination of five years of Kreator's development into a riff producing monster with fangs. Their first album (Endless Pain) was pretty raw death-thrash, and then Pleasure to Kill stepped it up a notch with the riffs being very memorable. And they were undeniable classics. Then they went for a slightly less brutal sound, and the riff quality suffered a bit. Then, they came storming back. This one is not Pleasure - but the riffs are even fucking better! This is their thrashiest album, and their best.\n\nThere are really only 2 or 3 moments on the album which are NOT absolutely and amazingly awesome: some of Material World Paranoia starts off a bit silly, but dear Lord does it make up for it or what with that final riff set: \"Promise of a better future is a lie!\" [insert here probably the best riff on the album - total fucking headbanging material, feel free to run into walls and break your house into a million pieces too, it's allowed.] That right there is the greatest thrash riff ever written. Trust me. I did many hours of research (man, research fucking KICKS ASS!!) and I came to this conclusion in a scientific way.\n\nOther highlights include Coma of Souls, Terror Zone (again, that final riff set... \"God I'm all alone! Oh no!\") and the absolutely incredible \"People of the Lie\". THIS right there is the thrash equivalent of \"Hell Bent for Leather\": short, sweet, and contains pretty much everything a thrash song needs to have. It's three minutes of headbanging that is sufficently furious as to cause orgasm.\n\nIn people five miles away.\n\nAnd one more thing - the lead guitar on this album is practically flawless. It's almost Tipton/Downing at work here sometimes. Best lead guitar on a thrash album, ever. Usually lead takes a backseat to rhythm in thrash (notable exception: Heathen) but here the two are integrated flawlessly into awesome songs. No wankery, just memorable riffs and memorable solos. Just check out Agents of Painkiller. I mean Brutality. \n\nTotal fucking greatness here - if you had to only get one Kreator album (why you would do such a dumb thing is beyond me, but hey, for the sake of argument), it is this one.\n"
