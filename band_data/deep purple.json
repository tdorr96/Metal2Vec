        "\nI won\u2019t say \u2018forget about the rock\u2019, because Deep Purple in Rock is as magnificent as this 50 year older titled Machine Head (if you\u2019re thinking about the groove metal band, you\u2019re doing it wrong), but this is, arguably, Deep Purple\u2019s closest venture to the still developing heavy metal genre. My belief is that, unlike Black Sabbath, Purple never really crossed over from their hard rock shores to the heavier side of metal, but I won\u2019t deny that they did contribute enormously to its evolution, in second place after Iommi and co., but probably more so than Led Zep, Uriah Heep or others. Perhaps Budgie or Sir Lord Baltimore were more (proto)metal, but they remained a little bit too underground in comparison to the seminal Hertford quintet. Visibility is influence, and Deep Purple were already a top rock music act by 1972. Their sixth studio LP, Machine Head ended up becoming their best-selling album, as the masses of rock fans worldwide were getting prepped for heavier sounds. \n\nPerhaps, no record from 1972 starts with such a groundbreaking number as \u201cHighway Star\u201d, with its highly influential, constant, driving rhythmic riffs, the basis for many future heavy/speed metal tunes. While Purple\u2019s rhythmic section was not as aggressive or groundbreaking as Sabbath\u2019s or Led Zep\u2019s, they provided with a solid foundation for the melodic instruments to shine. The magnificent solos by Lord\u2019s organ and Blackmore\u2019s guitar would also be emulated by countless Euro power metal bands from the 90s onward. This is among Deep Purple\u2019s heavier and faster songs, and they contributed more to the faster paced side of metal, as opposed to Sabbath\u2019s heavier doomy style. It is also one of their better-known songs, but there\u2019s another one from this very record which claims that title. \u201cSmoke on the Water\u201d is one of all rock music better-known songs, with an iconic set of simple but catchy riffs, the starting point for many would-be-guitarists since the day it was released. It ended up being one of the typical over-played songs in radios and bars worldwide, but still is a great tune, recalling the tribulation the band endured as they wanted to record this very album. \n\n\u201cPictures of Home\u201d, \u201cLazy\u201d and \u201cSpace Truckin\u2019\u201d are the other high-octane tracks on this quintessential release. The first one is a bluesy hard rocking number, with another dual set of tremendous guitar/organ solos, and even a short and sweet bass guitar solo by the constant Roger Glover. It\u2019s also one of Ian Gillian\u2019s most impressive performances here, and I\u2019d place it second in terms of intensity to \u201cHighway Star\u201d, even though \u201cSpace Truckin\u2019\u201d might be heavier, perhaps even heavier than the opener itself. The organ and bass intro is almost Sabbath-esque in terms of heaviness, and Gillian screams at his most deranged level on this one. The chorus section is one of the most headbangeable moments in the whole LP. Of chours this 4-minute version would be totally crushed by the 20-minute incarnation on the similarly seminal Made in Japan release, but its original form still is energic and amusing as it is. As for \u201cLazy\u201d, it is the most \u2018progressive\u2019 composition here (classic prog rock was at the height of its powers in 1972, and in fact I rank some progressive LPs of that year even higher than this Purple one), with a lengthy organ intro, that soon evolves into a boogie rock number filled with great solos. In fact, the song is almost instrumental, with Ian Gillian finally making his appearance well past half the track. But again, his presence does lift the song higher, especially near the end when he hits those high notes.\n\nThe remaining two songs, \u201cMaybe I\u2019m Leo\u201d and \u201cNever Before\u201d might not possess the golden status of the aforementioned ones, but they\u2019re great regardless. The former might be the more blues-oriented track here, comfortably residing in its mid-paced rhythm for its entire 5 minutes of duration. It\u2019s a more laid-down track, but Lord\u2019s organ and Glover\u2019s bass manage to provide an extra coat of heaviness most tracks of that day and age didn\u2019t have. The rock\u2019n\u2019roll-ish \u201cNever Before\u201d has a bad-boy swagger to it, totally transporting you to a dark 70s smoke-filled pub swarming with broken-hearted blokes, rocking their heads as the booze flows down their throats. I understand the argument of depriving Machine Head of masterpiece status due to this pair of songs, in a similar manner to \u201cTrapped Under Ice\u201d and \u201cEscape\u201d from the 12-year younger Ride the Lightning for many people, but I don\u2019t see a major decline in quality with either of those two. I can also get that 50 years later, this might sound too basic for some folks out there, when bands like Deathspell Omega or Fleshgod Apocalypse exist. But metal clearly wouldn\u2019t have come to be what it is if not for records like this one, and not that there where many like this one half a century ago. Saying that influence is overrated is ridiculous, but people do tend to forget about the origin of things and blindly declare the current state of things as the rule. In any case, Machine Head remains fun and amusing for rock and classic metal enthusiasts, and newer bands will continue to cover its songs and take cues from it as long as popular music exists.\n",
        "\nI'm glad that we honor our proto metal heritage by including bands like this one, Sir Lord Baltimore, and Bedemon/Pentagram (though I wish we had Coven on here as well). At the time, bands like these were where it was at when it came to early heavy metal (other than Sabbath of course). However, by today's standards, I would wager that most metalheads label Deep Purple's stuff as hard rock, perhaps psych rock, or maybe even prog rock. This band's MkII sound is a mishmash of different things, all coalescing quite excitingly into one of the most fun proto metal flavors available.\n\nLet's break those different things down. I think there's always been a progressive rock sort of flair pumping through Deep Purple's veins even after their first lineup disintegrated. Child In Time really showcases this aspect, with Ian Gillan's tender oohs and ahhs morphing into harrowing heavenly shrieks a la Great Gig In The Sky by Pink Floyd, as well as that infectious organ riff casting a spell over the listener. It also breaks out into an almost Iron Maiden style gallop in the bridge. There is also most certainly a psychedelic/acid rock component to their sound on here, with tracks like the aforementioned Child In Time and.. well, pretty much most of it really fitting into that late '60s early '70s Iron Butterfly/Cream sort of vibe, but of course, much heavier.\n\nThose trademark Deep Purple instrumental sections are here in droves, with Blackmore's harmonized guitars and Jon Lord's organ trading off super hot leads. Speed King, the first track, features one of these dueling sections right in the middle, quieting down and building back up again in a very satisfying way. Flight of the Rat is also a highlight for me, it really reminds me of early Black Sabbath, except it's 8 whole minutes of goodness. Like Speed King, it features many harmonized guitars and organ solos. Both Blackmore and Lord really ball out here, and even Ian Paice gets a drum solo! Shame it's never been played live. Flight of The Rat really reminds me of Light In The Black from Rainbow's Rising, and that's high praise.\n\nOne thing I love this release for is its guitar tone. I'm not sure why Ritchie Blackmore moved away from this crunchier sound, since on here, his shreddy moments are actually really impactful and good due to how abrasive it is, and the filthy blues riffs he plays establish a framework for what would come in the following decades. But then you switch to releases like Machine Head, and by comparison, it's a very dulled down, much less heavy sound. It really sounds like a single coil going through a very meager amount of distortion on his later albums. Me and my buddy have talked extensively about why he hates Smoke On The Water, and it really boils down to the fact that the guitar tone on later releases is pretty weak for no reason. I'll also tack on here that Roger Glover's bass tone is really good, as usual. I really admire that slightly distorted, trebley-but-still-heavy sound of his.\n\nThis isn't a perfect release obviously, it's a little loose and wild at times, with Gillan's vocals, Lord's organ, and Blackmore's sizzling guitar really making a lot of noise. However, I think that this aspect sort of enhances this album and makes it heavier, especially on cuts like Bloodsucker. I'm not so crazy about Living Wreck's vocal performance, but the riffs are good so I can look past it. To be frank, this album doesn't really have many flaws that aren't vindicated under the pretense of it being psychedlic proto metal. The abrasive, filthy aspects seem to just make the whole experience that much more endearing.\n\nI have a great fondness for this album, and maybe it's colored a bit by nostalgia for those times I'd drive around in my old 2001 Camry with this album in the tape deck, but I don't think I'm so wrong in praising something so revolutionary for its time. While the solos and songwriting got better on Machine Head, the trailblazing filthy riffs and attitude of Deep Purple In Rock warrant the utmost acclaim as well.\n",
        "\nThere\u2019s something to be said for longevity. Deep Purple have been kicking around since the late \u201860s and, although the lineup has changed drastically, they\u2019ve been stable since the 90s or so and are still just doing their thing. Whoosh! is more of the same that they\u2019ve been doing, with a similarly warm, robust production, Ian Gillan\u2019s charismatic vocals and the band\u2019s trademarked keyboard-heavy, rootsy rock and roll sound intact. I don\u2019t think this one is as good as the previous two, simply because everything it does can be found much better on either Now What or inFinite, and with more standout tracks.\n\nBut the band just keeps plugging on. The opening triptych of tracks is good, with some rollicking grooves and infectious moments \u2013 \u201cDrop the Weapon\u201d is a particularly fun track, and \u201cWe\u2019re All the Same in the Dark\u201d has some excellent guitars. The first real standout is \u201cNothing at All,\u201d with the band in its more reflective mood, Gillan crooning out lyrics that tend toward the existential while the music builds to cathedrals of epic sound.\n\nAll the recent Purple albums have this odd schizo mood between party rock tracks and moments of almost philosophical exultation and rumination, but this one seems like the most clear divide of them all. Maybe it\u2019s just in the more uneven quality of the songs. After that last mentioned track, the next few are serviceable but just not all that exciting \u2013 they\u2019re fun enough but I hardly think \u201cWhat the What\u201d will be anyone\u2019s new favorite Purple moment. They\u2019re just kinda filler-ish. \u201cLong Way Around\u201d belts out a good riff, though, and \u201cPower of the Moon\u201d is an interesting more drone-y experimental song, showing the band still has what it takes to be creative.\n\nBut the album\u2019s only other real sterling track is \u201cMan Alive,\u201d a breathtaking epic with wistful, fatalistic lyrics and a somber musical motif that builds up as the song goes and isn't afraid to make use of space in the songwriting to keep things tense. The mood is apocalyptic. Hearing this during 2020 - well, it hit hard at that time for sure. This is really the kind of thing that a band with Purple\u2019s experience can write \u2013 you don\u2019t get a song this weighty from guys in their early 20s. A grand statement of a track. This song is maybe worth the price of the whole album by itself actually.\n\nWhoosh! is a solid workmanlike slab of rock and roll from a legendary band. It doesn\u2019t have as many amazing tracks as their best work, or even the good shit they\u2019ve been doing in the 2010s. But if you\u2019re a Purple fan this is a no brainer.\n",
        "\nI'm pretty sure there are only 2 albums released in 1970 for which I can name all the members without checking (okay 3 actually, but both the others belong to the same band), and this is the second of those...not the first, if you catch my drift. Certainly, of the celebrated \"nearly metal\" albums being released that year, In Rock doesn't quite have the right attitude to match Black Sabbath or even Led Zeppelin II or III. As OlympicSharpshooter wrote, back in MA's year dot, the tones feel all wrong and the focus primarily backwards-looking, taking in more prog, jazz, and psych notions than anything currently known as heavy metal. All the same, it would be hard to imagine heavy metal ending up like it has without those 5 musicians who I can name. I mean, no Ian Gillan and then no Klaus Meine or Rob Halford? No Ritchie Blackmore and then no Dave Murray or Michael Schenker? No Jon Lord and then no...keyboards? Well, I suppose power metal has a lot to answer for. These guys did plenty for musical evolution in general and didn't hurt the lead solo trend of metal one bit, something that Black Sabbath weren't quite so hot on. Therefore, the influence is hard to deny, even if I'm not going to pretend this constitutes a proper metal record, and just talk about the music instead.\n\nBrief question first: am I the only one getting confused about 'Highway Star' and 'Speed King'? I know that they couldn't reuse the name 'Speed King' for the properly fast song, but 'Flight of the Rat' outpaces both on this album already. Alright, 'Speed King' has some fire to it and I remember 'Highway Star' as faster than truth, but 'Speed King' jives more than you'd think for an opening number, even shuffling round Ian Paice's jazzy beat for Lord's solo in the quietness. The build back into Blackmore's midsy guitar leads and riffing has that feel of Iron Maiden's first album, yet the pauses in the verse riff set it apart from later heavier material, while the sound just has too little punch in the chorus to be more than Top of the Pops rush. As such, technical heaviness can't be considered massively developed, although you wouldn't argue with the brunt of the main riff from 'Into the Fire' and the gruff boom of Roger Glover's bass in the verses either. Instead, we get more nuance in terms of pace and volume than most modern rock music would allow, dropping to silence during 'Child in Time' and also the end of the massively noisy intro of 'Speed King', when the organ comes into its own and does something with the atmosphere that still sounds very '70s to me. Of course, all of this sounds very '70s (even '60s on occasion), but I mean that the way Purple craft their songs relies on a freer formula than the catchiness and technicality principles in much modern music.\n\nThat intimates that it takes a while to open your ears to the quality of In Rock, though it should come through clear enough once you do. With only 7 cuts across 43 minutes, most of this has been considered pretty well, even if 'Into the Fire' sounds the most obvious throwaway among the songs and 'Living Wreck' gets by more on sass than anything ingenious, pummelling a forgiving groove with great timing. In that sense, I note with interest how Deep Purple resist finding a groove too often in their music, preferring to develop a set of ideas throughout each song and only rarely return to a proper chorus, as opposed to ending a verse with the same lyrics, which happens in several cuts here. I consider 'Hard Lovin' Man' a very telling pre-Scorpions number in this sense, because clearly songs like 'Sails of Charon' were based on this format, peeling out solos over the momentum of the riffing and attempting something challenging both structurally and technically. 'Bloodsucker' seems much more in the catchy vein, showing why the rhythm section deserve praise for In Rock too, flitting round pauses and supplying shifting angles, especially in the solo section. Blackmore setting up new verses of 'Flight of the Rat' with one repeated solo strikes me as the same mode of thinking.\n\nAs with all seminal records, a little bit of magic is required in order to satiate the ears of fans in later years. In Rock has that magic in places, but not everywhere. 'Child in Time', whether you like it or not, has that timelessness that a great song needs, and the massive mindboggle of its structure helps highlight the creativity even more. Basically just one verse, a lot of screaming, and an inspired jam, it sees Deep Purple at their most tender, most poetic, and their most visceral as well. The gorgeous hush of Lord's gentle noodling and the delicately sung parts contrast completely with the rising pain of Gillan's screams, not to mention the gradually more and more crazy instrumental middle. I watched a video of a vocal coach analyzing the song and she pointed out the genius simplicity of the bouncing drum fill just when the lyric moves to \"Wait for the ricochet,\" but obviously salivated most over the wordless denouement of rising horror, where Gillan's voice fits in as the ideal instrument. 'Flight of the Rat' does magic in moments, such as the scratching solo from Blackmore, though the body of the song seems rather off-the-cuff compared to the studied brilliance of its intersections. Perhaps that's the problem for me with In Rock: every now and then Purple seem to have arrived at the status of artists, and then they knock around a familiar rock riff or trope that might have got them laid more easily, but not exactly put them into the hall of fame. Hence why I'd say Deep Purple's fourth album pleases pretty much throughout, though can't be claimed as completely great.\n",
        "\nHardcore fans of Deep Purple\u2019s Mark II line-up are quite doubtful whether or not they should even consider \u2018Come Taste The Band\u2019 a Deep Purple album. It was the first album released after the departure of Ritchie Blackmore and most of the material has been written by newcomer Tommy Bolin and relative newcomer David Coverdale. Judged by its own merits, however, \u2018Come Taste The Band\u2019 is an excellent album full of loose, inspired playing, with Coverdale and Glenn Hughes in their finest vocal shape. It certainly sounds different from \u2018Machine Head\u2019 or even \u2018Burn\u2019, but different is not necessarily worse.\n\nA large portion of what makes \u2018Come Taste The Band\u2019 so good is the chemistry between Bolin\u2019s rhythm guitar, Hughes\u2019 bass and Ian Paice\u2019s drums. Where Deep Purple\u2019s former studio albums focused on compositions first and foremost, with most of the jamming being limited to the solo sections, all songs on \u2018Come Taste The Band\u2019 feel like they are the result of extensive jam sessions. There is more swing to the rhythms than on any Deep Purple album before or since, giving the album a slightly funky rock \u2018n\u2019 roll feel, but the guitar riffs and melodies are still highly memorable.\n\nThose who don\u2019t enjoy \u2018Come Taste The Band\u2019 often derisively call it the first Whitesnake album, but that seriously sells the album short. The only song I could see working for an early Whitesnake record is \u2018I Need Love\u2019, which coincidentally contains one of Coverdale\u2019s strongest performances on the record. Everything else sounds surprisingly American. No doubt this is influenced by Bolin being the first American to ever join the band, but it also seems to have taken away Hughes\u2019 inhibitions when it comes to bringing his fascination with soul and funk to the record. Hence the fantastic, ultra-funky \u2018Gettin\u2019 Tighter\u2019.\n\nFor all the cool, bluesy rock \u2018n\u2019 soul grooves \u2018Come Taste The Band\u2019 has, the standout tracks are actually the ones that don\u2019t quite fit that moniker. The haunting, melancholic \u2018You Keep On Moving\u2019 is one of my favorite tracks the band ever recorded. The voices of Hughes and Coverdale work together goosebumps-inducingly perfectly on the track and the surprising structure accounts for multiple climaxes. The notably uptempo opening track \u2018Comin\u2019 Home\u2019 is probably the most typical Deep Purple track on here and has a nice drive, as well as a fantastic chorus. \u2018This Time Around/Owed To \u201cG\u201d\u2018 starts out as a highly Stevie Wonder-inspired showcase for Hughes, but transforms into a fantastic instrumental jam with excellent lead guitar work for its second half.\n\nSure, there is something to be said for people not considering \u2018Come Taste The Band\u2019 a Deep Purple album. Gone are the classically inspired melodic runs and keyboardist Jon Lord largely remains in the background, but the album is chock-full of fantastic grooves and Bolin really proves that he was one of the world\u2019s finest guitarists with his playing on this record. Sadly, he passed away at the age of only 25 a year after the album was released, by which time Deep Purple had already split up for the first time. The album may require an open mind, but it\u2019s simply too good to dismiss. For what it\u2019s worth, I would take it over \u2018Who Do We Think We Are\u2019 or \u2018Fireball\u2019 any day.\n\nRecommended tracks: \u2018You Keep On Moving\u2019, \u2018Comin\u2019 Home\u2019, \u2018This Time Around/Owed To \u201cG\u201d\u2018, \u2018Gettin\u2019 Tighter\u2019\n\nOriginally written for my Kevy Metal weblog\n",
        "\n\"So sit back, relax, and enjoy the ride as In Concert takes you to California Jam.\"\n\nDeep Purple, is one of, if not the greatest hard rock groups of all time. Most people need no introduction, and you can't find a living person who doesn't know the famous 0-3-5 riff. In 1974, the Mk.II lineup performed, co headlining with Emerson, Lake and Palmer, and more notably, Black Sabbath. 8 groups performed here, from soul innovators, Earth, Wind and Fire, to doom metal as well as heavy metal founders, Black Sabbath, California Jam was one of the most important concerts in the 70's, showcasing the pioneers of music that would come in the later half of the 70's and also foreshadowing some of the evolutions 80's bands would make. Today, I'll be taking a look at Deep Purple's performance, and how it stood out and fared with the other 7 bands on the bill. Let's get started!\n\nI love how Coverdale intros, \"Are you all smilin'? You look fuckin' great from here, you really do.\" the energy for the entire performance is awesome, everyone on stage is doing a primitive form of thrashing around, you can definitely tell the guys are into it, and the crowd loves it as well. Most of the time, anyway. Sometimes the energy of the crowd feels strange, with Coverdale doing the talking and the crowd being almost entirely silent. Pretty polite people, I'd say, but this is a rock concert, it's supposed to be loud. The band counteracts the awkward energy by playing every song amazingly and some songs are even played longer, especially Space Truckin', where the amp has this minor malfunction, you know, this thing known as an explosion! Not before Blackmore practically rapes one guitar and uses another as a weapon to attack a camera viciously, and after that he destroys it. Simply put, it's pretty hilarious. Sure, it kind of makes him look like an idiot, and I'm not the biggest fan of people destroying instruments on stage, but this is too funny. God knows why he was allowed to have another guitar after that. I guess they learned their lesson, as the the dang amp connected to it catches fire, and boy does it explode, fire and flames, Ritchie plays it off, I'm laughing my head off, it's great, but they're lucky they didn't have a concert disaster akin to Great White's fire. Everything filmed is great, the band performs every song very well, but the highlights are \"Burn\", \"Lay Down, Stay Down\", \"Smoke On The Water\" and of course \"Space Truckin\" Now let's get into individual performances, and what I've seen and enjoyed and didn't enjoy from each member of the Mk.II lineup.\n\nBy far, the worst performance to me, is Coverdale's. Not that it's bad, or anything, it's just not as great as Glenn's, I mean this guy is amazing! His bass and vocals are one of my favorite parts of this entire performance. I'd like it if he sang the entire performance, I really didn't like Coverdale's voice until he was in Whitesnake. Glenn is on another level, his voice generally sounds better and his higher register stuff is great as well, not to mention his energy and skilled playing on stage. Ian Paice is having the time of his life, beating away at the drums and playing them exceptionally. Small set, big sound, and he nails the performance of every song. Jon Lord does well, as he always did, on the keys! What a joy it is to watch him, his energy is great, if his instrument was portable, he'd be all over the place for sure! Rest in peace, Jon. I left Ritchie Blackmore for last because he did something quite hilarious/dangerous given your perspective on the general value of life. His playing is great throughout, playing great solos and riffs, destroying equipment, but most importantly, entertaining and fun to watch. Unless you die by an amp explosion, he's a fun guy to watch, and he's one of the best players in 70's rock\n\nAll in all, it's an 89. Blackmore commits arson, and seeing that is worth watching the whole entire thing. More important than a man destroying musical equipment in hilarious fashion, Deep Purple puts on a great and memorable show! I'm jealous of all in attendance, and not just because something blew up, but because this is one of the best bands in rock history in their prime, while it isn't the original lineup, of course, They still put on a great show with 3/5ths of it. Not to mention Black Sabbath with Ozzy in their prime is at the show! All in all, the musical, and entertainment value is all here! I recommend watching this for any 70's rock fan, and even just heavy metal fans in general, it's a great watch.\n\n-Nolan\n",
        "\nAs one of the oldest rock bands still active, Deep Purple have already exceeded 20 albums, reaching, in fact, the 21st with \u201cWhoosh!\u201d. With a stable line-up for almost two decades, \u201cWhoosh!\u201d is an album made by a group of friends with more than 70 years old (only guitarist Steve Morse is still in his 60s) who have seen a lot and done a lot and who are, really, living their years of greatest decompression. After all, this is one of the proto-metal bands that gave us albums like \"... In Rock\" (1970) and, certainly, there would be no heavy metal without a group of names including Deep Purple, Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath.\n\nHowever, as much as this status may provide them the position to do what they want, this doesn't mean that the criticism has to be necessarily venial - even the big bands have their ups and downs. They all have their \u201cTurbo\u201d, \u201cThe X Factor\u201d and \u201cSt. Anger\u201d alongside their \u201c Painkiller \u201d, \u201cSeventh Son of a Seventh Son\u201d and \u201cMaster of Puppets\u201d.\n\n\"Whoosh!\" is a sober album, sometimes more soft-rock than heavy-rock, and it has the particularity that all songs (there are 13) have a regular line - there is not a moment of enormous prominence and, at the same time, neither it offers parts that make us say it\u2019s horrible. This can be annoying for those who analyze and ephemeral for those who listen - while the former one isn't able to explain extremes, the latter one may quickly move to another record and forget this one. However, it's mainly here that the decompression that the band is going through comes in: there is nothing more to prove, only relaxed music that feels good to play/create and will provide a good moment for those who listen.\n\nIt could be just that, another album done by a band with a long career that will stay in the rubble of dozens of releases where only three or four really stand out, but Deep Purple didn't decide just for that. As much as \u201cWhoosh!\u201d is a regular record, sometimes almost perfect for lounge music, we can find some creations that go from gospel to funk, always with hard rock as the cornerstone, and guitars that go from filling to the lead of rock n 'roll (albeit far away from Ritchie Blackmore). Along with Ian Gillan's singular and tuned voice and Ian Paice's less complex but accurate drums, Don Airey is the one who stands out the most with his keyboards, always providing a lot of atmosphere and several leads/solos that fill the shoes of the genius that was John Lord (1941-2012).\n\nIf you are looking for technicality and craziness, you have to go back a good 50 years in the catalog, but if you want to spend a relaxed few minutes to the sound of a historic name that keeps making audible music and with a pleasant interaction in a synergy between band and fans, then \"Woosh!\" is for you and for today.\n",
        "\nThese last few Deep Purple albums have sounded like music made by old men, because that\u2019s what they are. That said, it doesn\u2019t have to be a bad thing. I think ideally, artists would continue to make great art into their twilight years \u2013 in many mediums, that does happen, with actors and artists and other craftsmen remaining relevant well past their younger ages. Deep Purple is a rare case in the hard rock spectrum \u2013 usually a place where young vibrant greats burn out or die before they reach old age \u2013 where they\u2019ve got this whole discography of killer shit from the late 60s all the way through to today. Now What?!, from 2013, is another solid-ass choice from the old masters.\n\nBassist Roger Glover in a recent interview said he thought a lot of bands got songwriting wrong \u2013 that, by focusing on hooks or performance too much, they missed out on some intangible essence. He said writing a song was more than just those things. I\u2019ve kept that in mind listening to Deep Purple these last few weeks, and as my tastes evolve, that has kind of been the linchpin for me, separating good fun from true, real art. Deep Purple\u2019s songs have always felt like detailed, full tapestries; real stories with no missing parts. The bluesy grooves, the swinging rock bravado, Ian Gillan\u2019s comforting, headstrong voice and the inimitable keyboard work all come together to form something truly complete, with every part integral in ways lesser bands don\u2019t manage as they focus on certain ear-catching lone elements.\n\nThis band has always been tough to write about because of their long, storied history \u2013 you\u2019re writing about the guys who put out \u201cSmoke on the Water,\u201d for fuck\u2019s sake. And because the songs have no real gimmicks. It\u2019s just a bunch of dudes who can\u2019t stop making great music. Opener \u201cA Simple Song\u201d comes in slow, with Gillan crooning over some soft, balladic chords and great lyrics, but it erupts into a classic-styled groove. \u201cWeirdistan\u201d is a cornucopia of 70s-style swampy grooves and rigorous keyboard flourishes, \u201cHell To Pay\u201d has pomp and bombast for days, and the closing \u201cVincent Price\u201d has some fittingly campy horror music motifs and the heaviest riff the band has done in ages while Gillan intones and shrieks like a banshee. \n\nThe centerpiece of the album is the more emotional songs in the middle, though, with \u201cAbove and Beyond\u201d boasting some cathartic vocal hooks and uplifting, sonorous guitar/key interplay and \u201cUncommon Man\u201d borrowing its themes from an orchestral piece called \u201cFanfare for the Common Man.\u201d With the regal levels of pomp going on while Gillan croons \u201cIt\u2019s good to be king,\u201d it\u2019s a killer tune. Both of these were tributes to fallen keyboardist Jon Lord, which is touching. But it\u2019s \u201cBlood from a Stone\u201d that ends up the album\u2019s best song for me \u2013 a jazzy, lounge-y number that builds into a heavy crescendo and a dynamite chorus. It\u2019s just fucking breathtaking really.\n\nAs always with this band, the heaviness and the speed was never the whole point so much as just listening to these dudes play. It might not be the most popular thing to say on a heavy metal site, but as iconic as the madness of some of their early 70s work was, Purple has had a long and storied career and have remained quality even now for more reasons than just those early riffs. The fluid, colorful soundscapes they construct like alchemy have kept them relevant over the years. No matter what they\u2019re playing, the band is captivating \u2013 they put everything in its right spot and the virtuosity of each member at his instrument becomes a source of entertainment. You don\u2019t want them to cut a song short when they kick into a good jam. They are a joy to listen to.\n\nLosing Ritchie Blackmore was a blow, but with the most consistent lineup of their career now for the last two decades, I\u2019m hard pressed to say I consider these later albums to be inferior in any great way. If you don\u2019t know much about this band beyond their hit singles, I recommend you try anything of theirs, even some of these much later works. Now What?! is quality shit. Go get it.\n",
        "\nWhile this review aims towards Type O Negative's cover and not the original song by Deep Purple, I will say that the original is simply a fantastic song. You can't go more old school than with the sound of Deep Purple, and for this song to have a great vocal range of Ian Gillan and the hard rock nature of the song but with heavy metal, the elements contemplate a lot more. While the original version sounded tad repetitive, Type O Negative's wasn't.\n\nOriginally recorded in 2002 but was only available in the band's second compilation album in 2006, something that ended up being quite the controversy between the band and Roadrunner Records. This insane approach for the band to cover one of the pioneers and classic bands of heavy metal, the song is overwhelmed with distortion effects, not to mention it's as long as the original version but sounds more stretched during the chorus. Not gothic and not doom but a mere reinvention of the original, though very experimental. Taking the keyboard experimentation and the melodies to account, along with Peter singing in a lower tone and Kenny's extra vocal layers. These factors are what made me enjoy this cover.\n",
        "\nIt feels almost inherently wrong to pan an album as forward-thinking as this one. While Concerto for Group and Orchestra was not the first case of a rock band incorporating elaborate classical accompaniment, it took the concept much further than anyone who came before, paving the way for Metallica, Yngwie Malmsteen, and Therion\u2019s own attempts at collaborating with orchestras. And yet, pan this I must, because Deep Purple\u2019s groundbreaking 1969 concert with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra is not very good when judged by its own merits, falling short of my desires and even my expectations in just about every category.\n\nThere\u2019s so much you can do with a format like this. A hard rock/metal band known for its keyboard player\u2019s classical influences and a full-blown orchestra sharing a stage? Think of how many interesting ways these two vastly different ensembles could play off each other. Unfortunately, whoever wrote this (I think Deep Purple\u2019s keyboard player Jon Lord bears most of the blame) was not able to uncover many of those possibilities. The writing is so painfully dull that the concert was doomed to be an utter borefest no matter how good the performances were.\n\nFirst off, this isn\u2019t a balanced collaboration at all. Much of the album is basically a classical concert that occasionally incorporates a guitar solo, an electric keyboard flourish, and snippets of low-energy rock songs. There are lengthy sections of this performance that are just the orchestra. And if you were hoping for some dramatic, melodically appealing excess that would make Beethoven\u2019s ghost nod in approval, you\u2019ll be disappointed. What the orchestra plays here is mostly just the kind of slow, boring stuff that\u2019s usually confined to the 2nd movement of symphonies. And this shit often goes on for minutes and minutes at a time. It takes nearly eight minutes for some rock music to actually enter the picture. There was a point in the middle of listening to this damn thing that I looked up the album cover again to make sure it wasn\u2019t a Royal Philharmonic Orchestra concert with special guests Deep Purple. It wasn\u2019t. The band gets first billing on the cover of the fucking album and their name is in a much larger font. Why do they hardly ever do anything? \n\nAnd when Deep Purple finally joins in, they aren\u2019t providing much of value. While the flourishes and the solo from Blackmore start out strong in the 1st movement, they quickly give way to improvised, aimless wanking that goes on for a good four minutes or so. While there are some points where Deep Purple puts on a good show, like one moment later in the 1st movement where Blackmore provides a satisfying rhythm to serve as a foundation for Lord\u2019s keyboard indulgence, there\u2019s also more than enough insufferable bullshit, like Ian Paice\u2019s five-minute solo (yes, that\u2019s really how long it is) in the 3rd movement. Even when Deep Purple sticks closest to what they would have considered business as usual at the time, it\u2019s lame as hell. About five minutes into the second movement, the band starts playing a song with some light airy classical accompaniment. Really, though, it\u2019s like one verse of a soft rock song that fits well with what the orchestra\u2019s doing but just isn\u2019t interesting. Another slower rock song pops up later, with some truly emotive violin sawing in the background at one point but isn\u2019t all that lively or grandiose either. \n\nFor something called Concerto for Group and Orchestra, the group and the orchestra don\u2019t directly work together all that much. When Ritchie Blackmore finally kicks in with some rockin\u2019 solos that soar above Paice\u2019s marvelous drumming in the 1st movement, no classical instruments can be heard at all. I remember listening to that part for the first time and thinking What, are they just gonna take turns the whole time? Classical and hard rock styles don\u2019t even meaningfully blend until nearly 12 and a half minutes into the first movement and rarely ever do again throughout the entire runtime. Most of the album, as has been previously said, is just long streams of dry classical stuff that sounds more like a film score you didn\u2019t even notice than the sort of thing Mozart or Dvo\u0159\u00e1k once wowed their contemporaries with. Because this is a live album, there may be issues with the audio levels that makes it hard to tell when certain instruments are or are not being played (the bass is utterly lost in the mix), but it sure as hell sounds like the performance is mostly the orchestra playing without the band or the band playing without the orchestra. The only point where Lord\u2019s vision is truly realized is in the first six minutes of the 3rd movement, which consist of some engaging, danceable tunes that seem to be from the Celtic folk tradition, spiced up at times with a solo from Blackmore, accompaniment from Lord, an admirable backbeat from Paice, or all three at once. \n\nHas anyone reading this seen the Brooklyn Nine-Nine episode where Andy Samberg\u2019s character goes to a place that serves \u2018dark milk\u2019, a concoction in which the bitterness of the chocolate brings out the sourness in the milk? This album similarly combines the least desirable qualities of its two core ingredients. From the classical side of the equation, it\u2019s tedious, slow, and incredibly long passages and from Deep Purple\u2019s side, it\u2019s a tendency toward surprisingly subdued rock songcraft or instrumental excess that is both aimless and exhausting. And doing more damage than either of those shortcomings is the fact that the two ensembles rarely join forces in any true sense. The first known instance of an orchestra and rock band playing a concert together didn\u2019t set the bar very high at all and the applause you hear from the audience a few times through this album is probably insincere.\n",
        "\nDeep Purple is undoubtedly one of the very best, most influential and most referenced rock bands in the history of music. However, the group has released so many different studio records that it's tough to find a place to start. This is why the release of this three-disc greatest hits compilation featuring forty songs and a running time of over three hours and twenty minutes is a welcome occasion to discover the band's greatest hits, forgotten pearls and fan favorites all at once. This release covers the group's first forty-five years of existence, starting with the dynamic, eerie and heavy Billie Joe Royal cover ''Hush'' released back in 1968 and concluding with the old-fashioned but powerful, playful and entertaining ''Hell to Pay'' taken from the band's acclaimed 2013 studio record Now What?!, the band's nineteenth studio album despite an eight-year long hiatus and numerous lineup changes.\n\nThe release progresses in anti-chronological order, starting with songs like the eerie ''Vincent Price'' with its great keyboard work, the quite dynamic and rhythmic ''Wrong Man'' or the calm, intellectual and progressive ''Sometimes I Feel Like Screaming'' on the first disc. \n\nThe second disc covers the middle years, including highlights like the sad ballad ''Soldier of Fortune'', the highly diversified hard rock milestone ''Mistreated'' or the heavy ''Soace Truckin''' that had an important influence on early heavy metal bands. \n\nThe third disc focuses on the timeless classics from the early years such as the atmospheric, epic and playful ''Child in Time'' that never gets boring despite an incredible length beyond ten minutes, the concise ''Black Night'' that is heavy yet progressive, simple yet complex, aggressive yet danceable and the wonderfully playful and often overlooked instrumental ''Wring that Neck (aka \"Hard Road\")'' that is much more interesting than most rock songs with vocals I know. \n\nSome fans might obviously argue that some choices for the set list of this record are debatable but A Fire in the Sky undoubtedly represents everything legendary rock band Deep Purple has stood for, still stands for and will always stand for.\n\nIf you are a rock or metal enthusiast who only owns a few or even no Deep Purple records so far, A Fire in the Sky is an excellent addition to your collection. It offers value for money with nearly three hours and a half of gripping entertainment and an extensive booklet. A Fire in the Sky is an epic testament to Deep Purple's timeless status as rock legends.\n",
        "\nLandmark would be a mandatory adjective for purposes of describing how great is this album from every possible angle. But still, it is non-sufficient. Purple's sixth release would become an unskippable release for every single band pretending to play the music that invaded an entire planet for almost a couple of decades: heavy f'n metal. It also became a valuable reference for all those making their careers as shredders. In other words, it was a starting point for almost everything in metal.\n\nA very solid line-up and a well-established songwriting style marked the band's trajectory, and their concept represented a step forward from what other similar bands created. In general, Purple's developed a heavier sound that resulted more dynamic and energetic. And if you put Blackmore's hyperactive neoclassical guitar playing in the formula, then the final product ends up being a mind-blowing thing. All these features make up the opening track, the legendary \"Highway Star\", which is the first speed metal number ever played (even \"Paranoid\" wasn't that fast), as well as the first metal song including a guitar-keyboard duel. Further, the riff played throughout the same is majestic.\n\n\"Smoke on the Water\" is also a highlight of bestial proportions. The song is not as fast as the opening number, but it is still heavier than hell while its guitar riffs are killers of high respectability. Its lyrics relate to an accident that took place in a Frank Zappa concert in Montreux, Switzerland, in which Montreux Casino was burnt to the ground. Is further description needed for this song? Not at all. Then, intensely closing the album, the thrashy \"Space Truckin'\" provides a speed metal discharge that is not as memorable as in the opening song.\n\nThe rest of the album is not different from what they have written in previous albums. Perhaps, the energetic \"Pictures of Home\" would be the most remarkable and distinctive number from that section. Having said that, \"Machine Head has stood the test of time, and remained as a quintessential release along with Black Sabbath's sophomore effort. This is the kind of album that as a metalhead you should proudly own in whatever format you can find.\n\nYou can also read this review in the Antichrist Magazine \nhttp://antichristmagazine.com/review-deep-purple-machine-head-1972/\n",
        "\nMore late Sixties psychedelic and flower pop sound from what was soon to become England's grittiest heavy rock band. But I tell you, NO WAY there is you could guess that their next album after this one would be In Rock. Here, Ritchie turns his guitar sound down, down and down again: the days of emulating Hendrix are long gone by. Mostly because the good Blackmore has now become a guitar god. Not that the album is organ-oriented, either: Jon Lord treats his colleagues with respect, and the band, at this point, is still a democratic unit.\n\nNevertheless, they progress. For one, there's only one cover on the album - and it's good: the gorgeous ballad Lalena, authored by Donovan himself. Its chorus might seem repetitive - 'that's your lot in life Lalena' (a line that I'd always misinterpreted as 'bet your rotten life Lalena'. Funny, eh?) crops up after every two lines, after all, but Evans sings everything with such a beautiful, sad, highly emotional intonation that you can't but understand - yup, at this point the guy managed to evolve into a really impressive vocalist. I still do not regret their decision to sack him - he was no match for Gillan - but, unfortunately, this decision led to his artistic downfall. What a bummer.\n\nLet's get back to the album, though. Like I said, all the other songs are self-penned, mostly collectively, and, while some are still rather obvious blues rip-offs, others start to display serious hints of creativity. The opening number, Chasing Shadows, built around the story of some old Jon Lord nightmares, is, well, not exactly creepy or spooky, but somewhat haunting: Ian Paice gets in a great percussion groove (maybe his best performance in Mark I), and all the lyrics dealing with 'hiding in the shadows', accompanied by gloomy organ passages, hit the mark right smack in the middle. Blind is a rather forgettable ballad, possibly the only truly weak cut on the record, but the stuff that follows it and Lalena has some of the most awesome blues-rock of the Sixties. The Painter, Why Didn't Rosemary and Bird Has Flown are all outstanding, with the band, especially Ritchie, in top form, as usual. Dammit, what is this tune about? 'Why didn't Rosemary ever take the pill...' ...isn't this about incidental pregnancy? Whatever, it's a top-notch rocker, that shows Blackmore maturing further and further as a guitarist and Lord maturing further and further as an organ-annihilator (although he wouldn't truly start to massacre his instrument until In Rock). And then, there's Bird Has Flown, with its moody wah-wah guitar and a surprisingly menacing sound for a song about broken love.\n\nBut... the album's centerpiece is definitely none of the above. This honour falls to April, the thirteen-minute suite that closes the album and serves as a logical precursor to the infamous Concerto For Group And Orchestra, that is, presents Deep Purple as an ambitious, ballsy 'art-rock' ensemble. And note that, however 'dated' or 'naive' their artsy excourses might seem now, in 1969 they were pretty daring. Yes, believe it or not, but for a short while Deep Purple had a bifurcation before them - the choice was between 'art' and 'metal'. They probably made the right choice in the end. But that does not mean that April ain't impressive; on the contrary, the suite must hold its own ground as one of the most successful art-rock creations of the year. It consists of three parts - an instrumental part played by the band, an instrumental part played by the orchestra and the 'song' itself, with pessimistic, quasi-pastoral lyrics sung by Evans in his very best epic 'tone. Note that nobody had yet done that - except for the Moody Blues on Days Of Future Passed, so Deep Purple were really pioneers in the matter. Not that the composition is utterly brilliant. I mean, the first section is really, really good, with nice acoustic guitar and organ, and over it, some subtle, autumnal (damn the title, they're autumnal) electric lines of huge expressivity. The orchestral passage, however, is a bit trite - and yet, far from the banal, bland MGM orchestration used by the Moody Blues. The big difference, I guess, stems from the fact that the Moody Blues did not write the orchestral arrangements, while Deep Purple, namely, Jon Lord, produced the score himself, and, being the smart dude that he was, he just couldn't fall into banality. So it's good, but not great. And then the third part comes in, and we're suddenly beginning to rock! Rod Evans pleads and screams, Lord upholds him on organ, and Ritchie Blackmore plays up a thunderstorm! Still a bit 'soft', perhaps, but everything cooks...\n\nQuite an interesting band they were, these Deep Purple Mark I. Still much too inexperienced - still much too derivative but showing signs of greatness. God knows what they could have evolved into had Evans and Simper not been replaced by metalheads Gillan and Glover. Hey, I'm not complaining - I'm just curious! Buy this album! It has a Bosch painting on the cover! And did I ever tell you, and if I didn't, this is the most perfect place to do it, that Bosch is my favourite painter in the world? Buy this album now - while the world hasn't forgotten it! Actually the world probably has forgotten it. For the stupidity of modern pop music. Truly pathetic.\n",
        "\nAnytime a new front-man enters the picture, there's bound to be drastic change and/or heavily different opinions thrown around. Deep Purple In Rock is what I know and love as one of the first metal records, right along-side Paranoid and Led Zeppelin II. Blah blah Ian Gillan, blah blah the start of MKII, no history lesson is needed. Unlike Fireball, this record sticks to one main formula instead of offering a huge variety of ideas; raw and heavy.\n\nThe production on this record is pretty rough around the edges, and it couldn't be more fitting. Seeing that the songs are heavier and have a darker subject matter, it's very complimenting. Some of them take a faster and chuggier approach, like the classic \"Speed King\" or \"Flight Of The Rat\", which is a pretty good idea of what will be known as speed metal. Others such as \"Into The Fire\" take a more Sabbathy approach and would help shape what we know as doom metal. The whole album is about 50/50 on which is used, but that's about as plain and simple as it gets. Raw production, and heavy songs. Blackmore and co. abandoned all senses of psychedelic underlying that were present before this record, and the higher pitched outbursts and aggressive vocal style are in full throttle.\n\nLarge usage of bass is implemented all over this record, and it needs to be mentioned. Very rare does something like that take the forefront as much as it does here, but damned if Roger Glover doesn't deliver! From start to finish this adds an entire extra layer of heaviness, playing as a great background when the guitar and keyboard solos start showering down. The only real out liar that strays from the main formula a little bit is \"Child In Time\". This one does pick up speed in some sections, but it's primarily composed of slow build-ups, vocal outbursts, and some licks thrown in to fill in the cracks. As one of their better known tracks, I actually don't dig this one as much as other people do; still a great song though. The only reason why this record falls behind Shades and Fireball is because they offer more variety, and have overall tighter songwriting. But this is still an essential, deserving of a listen by every set of ears.\n",
        "\nWithout getting too off on a tangent right off the bat, the easiest way to describe this record is that it's like taking a chunk of every aspect that makes the first four Led Zeppelin records unique and great, but enhanced. For those that don't know what that means, it's basically a giant mash-up of blues rock, heavy metal, folk rock, and just stripped down rock 'n roll. Like being new to craft beer, Fireball is something that may take some time to acquire a taste for, and for those that haven't reached that point, I genuinely feel sorry for you.\n\nBefore even taking a glance at how groove infused and passionate, yet somewhat catchy the songs are, the songwriting is what stands out the most on here. I'm talking structure, lyrics, arrangement, and playing. There isn't a single track on here where the lyrics don't blow me away. \"Now I have become a fool, because I listened to the mule\" (The Mule). \"They talk about creating, but all they do is kill\" (No No No). \"But man this dumb and scraggy is your daughter's baby's daddy\" (Anyone's Daughter). They just have a ring to them, run together well, and mostly, have a deeper meaning that you have to think to get, excluding the last of those three. But the delivery is what really drives this home. Ian Gillan shows clear passion in whatever he's belting out here, and of course, the notes that the man hits is pretty stellar. Not too many can deliver such intense vocals while keeping it as clean as he does.\n\nRitchie Blackmore and Jon Lord were one of the most genius duos in heavy music, with this record being the perfect way to showcase it. \"The Mule\" is a great example of how the two work together to create something of a build-up, following through with a speed driven lead melody. Of course, \"No No No\" busts out the solos on both parts and sticks to a heavier formula. The title track crunches everything together a lot tighter, making for one of the heaviest numbers on the record, and the fastest at that. Depending on which version you get, either \"Demon's Eye\" (UK) or \"Strange Kind Of Woman\" (US), it either buckles down on the heaviness or the groove. \"Demon's Eye\" is a very bass heavy track that Roger Glover teams with Ian Paice to create a killer rhythmic track, or you get \"Strange Kind Of Woman\", the groove driven rock song that I'd probably consider my favorite Purple track. So one way or another, there's a lot of variety here, and it's executed in an advanced way that not all can swallow.\n\nOne thing that needs its own mentioning is \"Anyone's Daughter\". This is where the \"folk rock\" element comes into play. While the few other reviewers seem to hate it, I guess some just don't see the musical intricacy. Not a metal song by any means, and it's a bit silly, but that's where the fun aspect of this record comes into play. Plus, the piano solo in that tops any other solo that Lord does. Not to mention, the vocal harmony and bluesy rhythms backing the solos between verses are pretty advanced, so it's anything but bad. The absolute only complaint about this album is that \"Fools\" fails to hold up to the brilliance of the other tracks, just dragging a bit. \"No One Came\" is the perfect exit for this masterpiece. Fireball is an essential. It's right up there with Machine Head. If you haven't heard it, hear it.\n",
        "\nHalf credit for talent, effort, and great moments, half off for not producing anything memorable.\n\nNo but seriously, that's about as plain and simple as this gets. While the record following Now What?! was something of a surprise for how much I could really get into, this one is just sort of there. For starters, if the record length was cut in half, it would probably be a bit easier to get through, seeing that it's about an hour long, but doesn't have enough great material to make it amazing (I like to call this ReLoad syndrome). A lot of the songs lack much feeling, and sound alright, but also feel like they could just be background music. Calling them dull may be a stretch, there's definitely skillful musicianship here. Songs like \"Out Of Hand\" will be plenty packed with complex solos of the guitar and the keys alike, but rather carrying much substance, they sound forced instead. Also, like Infinite, there's a tad much autotune for my taste (which is very little). It would be impossible to expect Gillan to match how he was back in the heyday, but a lot of this is somewhat tired.\n\nOn a brighter note, it isn't all bad. After all, it's exactly half good. \"Hell To Pay\" has some great licks in it and carries one of the best rhythms on the record. \"Weirdistan\" is another track to get behind, as it brings on the full blown power and groove that made the '70s Deep Purple records as stellar as they are. Hell, even \"Above And Beyond\" has some moments that stick out. This is something of a more ballady track, but like many of the others, it's just too damn long and would be better if they just cut some shit out. Tighter songwriting, shorter length, and better production choices would have made this substantially better. It's worth a listen though. Not atrocious, but far from great.\n",
        "\nFirst and foremost, it's absolutely insane that Gillan & co. can still pump out tight songs this far into their career, and at their age, without just flat out running out of ideas. Not that old bands can't write good music, I mean just look at Judas Priest's Firepower. The difference is, though, that Deep Purple haven't really surfaced an album that was greatly talked about in decades. I enjoy it all, but seldom do you find many people who dig anything after the late '80s. Infinite is hardly a metal album, but a bluesy and jazz influenced rock and roll album for sure.\n\nWhile there aren't really any tracks that jump out and grab you, every song still has a magical vibe that makes you want to move to it. Don Airey floods this entire record with catchy keyboard licks that can definitely hold up to Jon Lord's abilities. But what's really important here is the fact that the songwriting is still there. There's vocal harmony and plenty of rhythmic guitar melody to keep the flame alive. I'll admit, there's a pretty gross amount of auto-tune here, but rather making up for poor vocal delivery (because it doesn't need to), it just aims to crystallize the production, which I can't say I'm a fan of. If they would can that, I can assure that the production would be better off. There is a little bit of variety here; with some tracks aiming for a radio-rock approach such as \"All I Got Is You\", while others like \"The Surprising\" try to throwback a little more and appeal to the longtime fans that crave a bit more musical depth.\n\nWhen it's all said and done, there isn't much more I can say about this, because not much else really jumps out. Should Purple make more records after this? I always embrace bands to keep on going no matter what, but I would be fine with this being the last one. Nothing they do is flat out terrible. Seeing that I got this when it came out a year ago, my opinion hasn't changed, and it didn't have a \"new album\" shock to it. This certainly isn't anything to praise, but for sure worth picking up, or at least the 45 minutes of your time.\n",
        "\nAt this point, three records deep into the Purple career, there still was no completely established sound, which doesn't make me lean one way or another, so long the output is more than alright. That's what we barely have here, Deep Purple is barely above average, and certainly doesn't live up to the two preceding records, but there are definitely some good moments.\n\nOf course, this also still brings some new ideas to the table yet again. For one, the usage of a harpsichord in place of the organs is dropped into one of the tracks, \"Blind\". Unfortunately, stuff like this is leaned on, and that's really the only real redeeming quality within that track, and really, the whole first side is pretty dull at that. The psychedelic detailing is clearly brought on even harder than before on this record, but it's executed in a way that is of little interest and fails to live up to what they're capable of doing. Boring, repetitive rhythms are what really kill it, and there's a slight lack of enthusiasm that I pick up in the vocal delivery. \"The Painter\" is really the only song of the first five tracks that stands out as a great track, the rest just seem a bit phoned in. Plus, the short instrumental \"Fault Line\" is about as useful as \"FX\" off of Black Sabbath Vol. 4. \n\nSide B manages to save it a bit, as \"Why Didn't Rosemary?\" and \"Bird Has Flown\" are far better than anything the first half has to offer. Bluesy tunes and guitar work replaces the weird witchery that took place for the majority of the previous tracks, and Rod Evans does a better job. He sounds a lot more into it and there's definitely more feel there. Hell, even Nick Semper breaks through a little more with the groovy bass-lines to help it all out. What we're left with is a twelve minute finale that is partially composed of classic style composition with an orchestra (perhaps I got the time period wrong, maybe baroque? Correct me if I'm wrong). But it finishes off with strong instrumentation. Certainly this gets old at some point, but I guess it's alright. A new idea though, nonetheless. This is by no means a bad record, it's still one that I revisit now and again, but I mostly got it for completion reasons a few years back. Surprisingly, it isn't too hard to come by on vinyl. Worth a listen for sure, but unless if you're as big into Purple as I am, not really an essential purchase.\n",
        "\nI have never heard the first Deep Purple album before. I knew their style was commercial at the beginning, and that it was not particularly good, but I didn't expect this mediocrity. The first thing that came to my mind that this is the kind of flower rock which clearly inspired one particular segment of the Spinal Tap movie.\n\nThe album starts mildly interesting, the intro tune is all instrumental, it has a car commercial feel, but the tone is bearable: a boogie rhythm decorated with solo sections. Then it starts with the first cover, Hush which is probably the highlight of the album: a very lively bass leads the song supported by well-articulated drums, and the singer and the organ sits smoothly on the top of this. Covers were common for new bands in the 1960s and Deep Purple was no exception to that. Their covers are more miss than a hit though, as the other covers on this album are barely listenable. There were bands who were able to revitalize songs in the 60s (The Rolling Stones for example), but this does not work out well for Deep Purple. Part of it is probably the perspective, the late 60s cheesiness is too much for my modern stomach and on the other hand their sound is either overtly derivative or just wrecks the feeling of the original song totally.\n\nThe band tries to explore all genre of the 60s, from the ballads through instrumental rock to psychedelia. There were bands who did similar thing at the time, but it is hard to fine one that did this well within one album. Deep Purple fails in this regard, mainly because their songs sound more like second rate copies of the originals: the parallels with The Beatles, The Ventures or The Yardbirds are obvious.\n\nI think the main reason for this overall sub par quality is the warmup exercise nature of the album, it is like some lighthearted jam to get the band, which just freshly assembled at the time, together. It is clear that Blackmore was far from his eclectic star form, he is put into the background most of the time. There is some experimentation, sometimes it is even interesting, but the band cannot decide if they want to do pop or prog rock. Something that was apparent in the first few years of their career.\n\nThere is a little present from Jon Lord's signature sound already, and the musicianship is OK for the rest of the team. Interestingly, the remastered version has very good sound quality. Definitely 60s sounding, but at least all instruments are audible, which is not a standard quality for an album even today.\n\nBut this can not alleviate the root problem, therefore I would call the album a failure. It is heavily derivative, and it lacks direction. There were many young lads in the 1960s whom nailed down their first album much better than the Purple.\n\nHighlights: Hush\n",
        "\nFollowing up Shades very quickly in the same year, Deep Purple would put out something of a similar record to their debut, but a rendition with some slight changes. The typical sixties idea of pumping out covers is still present, the psychedelic drive is all there, Jon Lord still takes the forefront of many tracks, and it's still geared in a bluesy direction. As great as The Book Of Taliesyn is, it doesn't hold up to the mind blowing grooves and amazing structure of the first.\n\nFirst thing that jumps out at me is that this record isn't very warm sounding, and it backs off the \"feel good\" energy a little bit, filling that in with a more chilling hint in the music. This certainly isn't dark by any means, but minor keys are fairly present here and there, and there are no signs of any \"surf\" influence. More serious lyrics are brought to the table as well, some of it talking about things like struggles, but mostly sticking to medieval stories. \"Shield\" and \"Anthem\" are both great examples of all of this, probably my two favorite tracks. \"Anthem\" takes things a step further and utilizes violins and other string instruments, and this really authenticates the atmosphere. \n\nLord and Blackmore smear this with calm lead sections, giving it a more laid back feeling, with fewer complex or fast solos. Though this isn't completely absent, it's less prevalent. No complaints there, because it really matches everything that the band were clearly trying to go for on this record. What this will bring, however, is less catchy licks as well as fewer hooks to really bring me into it.\n\nPurple's rendition of \"Kentucky Woman\" is incredible, quite possibly even better than Neil Diamonds. The only thing that confuses me with this, is that it really doesn't fit the theme or atmosphere of this record, and is just kinda stuck in the middle there. The mood is certainly changed when going from \"Hard Road\" to this, which doesn't flow very nicely. So great cover, odd placement. This disc also contains their second Beatles cover \"We Can Work It Out\", a pretty good one as well, and is a solid ending for the first side, especially with the little intro they threw in known as \"Exposition\". Perhaps this \"book\" is a step towards musical maturity; it's a great album, another essential one in my vinyl collection, and overall carries a cool atmosphere. It doesn't drop all the rhythm grooves and bluesy expertise, just takes it back a notch, and although I don't think it lives up to its predecessor, it's absolutely worth buying and hearing.\n",
        "\nIt absolutely baffles me that so many people act surprised over the fact that half of this record is littered with covers. This wasn't uncommon in the '60s (or even '50s)! Look at all of the early Beatles records. Please Please Me, With The Beatles, etc. This was reminiscent of live shows, showcasing some original material, yet playing many covers to keep outsiders interested. One of Elvis's biggest hits is a cover! So let's not allow this to bring the beauty of this down, seeing it's probably in the top five greatest Deep Purple records. Yeah yeah, this is before Gillian and Glover joined the band, Rod Evans was the singer, it was trippy compared to most Deep Purple, it's not really metal, blah blah blah, let's skip the stuff that everyone else has touched on, as well as being irrelevant to what makes an album great.\n\nWell for starters, the atmosphere on this record is vital to the overall experience, especially if you own it on vinyl to just help add to the overall effect. Groovy bass-lines and wild drum beats are what really lay the foundation for all of this, allowing it to stand apart from most of their discography, even other early records. But what really drives it the whole way home is Jon Lord's superior keyboard licks, drilling deep within every single track, acting as the lead role. Most of the time, it's promoted to the front over Blackmore's guitar work, as he takes control in the rhythm areas most of the time. \"And The Address\", the opening instrumental is one example where this isn't the case, and you can catch early hints of what a guitar God he is soon to become. But others, \"Mandrake Roots\", \"One More Rainy Day\" and \"Love Help Me\", he drives the rhythms along with steady but considerably harder riffs. Not to say he never breaks away with a solo, but the keyboards are absolutely crucial. Speaking of which, these also display a great deal of surf rock influence, especially with \"Love Help Me\". Rod Evans couldn't have done a better job with delivering fun and energetic vocals to go with this.\n\nIf songs such as \"Help!\" and \"Hey Joe\" weren't such big hits, you'd think it's original material. Why? Because they make the songs their own, coming off very different. \"Help!\" and \"I'm So Glad\" both proceed with intros that were not in the originals, as well as altering both to fit the theme and overall vibe of this record some more. And of course, the classic \"Hush\" can't be missed either, and falls right into place after the opening instrumental piece. Whether it be slowing them down (that being the case with the Beatles), or just adding a surf/bluesy touch to them, these are phenomenal versions of these tracks.\n\nThe ultimate achievement here is the way that it utilizes melody the whole way through, maintaining the same sound and idea without getting boring at any parts of this. Fancy keyboard work adds spice to it, creative guitar licks and rhythms follow every track from start to finish, and backing vocals also bestow this beast. \"Love Help Me\" is probably the greatest track on here, hitting the surf-rock aspect the hardest, taking the backing vocals to great lengths, and including just about everything that makes Shades Of Deep Purple great, compiled into just one track. Maybe some lyrics are rather cheesy, maybe it's half covers, and maybe it isn't what the typical Deep Purple fan looks for. One way or the other, this is a criminally overlooked album, and I recommend it to anyone reading this.\n",
        "\nTo those in search of an '80s metal record that does a solid job at reviving the classic '70s grooves while blending in the '80s fun glamour, this is your record. With the perfect distribution of powerful capability, solo highlights, and melody, no Deep Purple fan should pass this up. While it certainly isn't the same as Machine Head or Fireball, it deserves a spot right up in there with those records. Most importantly, any band that can combine accessibility with a stern level of technicality needs some recognition.\n\nThere's not a moment on Perfect Strangers that lacks a lot of complexion. Hard guitar riffs backed by keyboards are all over the place, and Ritchie Blackmore and Jon Lord take turns showcasing their capabilities. While \"Mean Streak\" gives Blackmore the spotlight with a crushing solo, \"Nobody's Home\" gives Lord the torch, containing a ferocious keyboard solo that would make the track nothing without it. Of course, the heaviness is presented everywhere, and the two together create a very thick atmosphere where its heavy enough, but isn't too intimidating. When one is in charge of driving the song, the other never fails to back it up with superb rhythm. Plus, this much keyboard work would help it fit right in with what was going on in the music scene of 1984.\n\nEvery song has a lot of strength in melody, focusing on the instrumentation or not. Ian Gillan's vocals are as strong as ever, with melodic and clean outbursts from cover to cover. \"Knocking At Your Backdoor\" and the title track are the two most obvious examples of this, showing his ability to be raucous without needing to scream or use harsh vocals. This fits perfectly with one of my favorites, \"Under The Gun\". It's played in a minor key, giving it an angrier aura, as well as a deep distortion. Gillans smooth vocals fit right in with that, altogether making this one of the speedier tracks on the record.\n\nMost of the tracks are catchy to some degree, making it accessible to many different music lovers. But the closer, \"Hungry Daze\" definitely holds the title for catchiest. Ian Paice's drumming and Roger Glover's bass playing are what keep this one heavy, to side with the catchier, more poppy sounding keyboard that takes charge of the rhythm part here. If you can put out a record that is catchy, complex, and heavy in equal doses, then there's almost no doubt that it will be spectacular. How some fans turn this down or won't give it a chance? I'll never know. Their loss.\n",
        "\nLet\u2019s face it, Deep Purple are a bit like going back to an ex-partner. After a while of not thinking about it, something reminds you of a different time, you get that warm glow of nostalgia and familiarity before remembering why you stopped in the first place. In the last 25 years, Deep Purple have adapted their sound due to various circumstances. Firstly, guitar legend; Ritchie Blackmore left in 1993 creating huge shoes for his successor in the shape of Steve Morse. Secondly was the retirement of the late Jon Lord from the band in 2002, Lord\u2019s position filled by the one and only Don Airey and lastly was the march of time and strain on Ian Gillan\u2019s voice.\n\nInterestingly enough, most of the older bands that were written off by the media in the 90\u2019s as dinosaur acts, that were bloated and had expired have been writing the albums of their careers, most of which are back and stronger than ever. Deep Purple are actually no different, they have been experiencing, well, how else do you put it? A purple patch. This began with 2013\u2019s 'Now What?!' album which was met with hugely positive reviews and this rolls over into Deep Purple\u2019s most recent release; 'Infinite'.\n\nJust like the previous Deep Purple album, 'Infinite' has once more been produced by esteemed legendary producer Bob Ezrin. It would seem that Ezrin has brought the best out of Deep Purple as 'Infinite' has attained a sound that is classic Purple with a slight modern twist, this sound manages to hark back to the days when Deep Purple ruled the world, yet humbly shows everything which Purple have been forced to endure over the years.\n\n'InFinite' begins with the first single from the album; 'Time for Bedlam', which starts with a spoken word introduction as Gillan\u2019s soliloquy is phased through a mechanical/computer effect \u2013 a bit odd, but it works, before launching into the classic Deep Purple sound, a distinct Hammond Organ hammering along with a distorted guitar that instantly likeable as Deep Purple grind along to a song that brings back memories of 'Pictures of Home'. In fact, 'Time for Bedlam' wouldn\u2019t actually be out of place on 'Machine Head' and that alone shows the strength of 'Infinite'. 'Time for Bedlam' isn\u2019t the only track that has this vibe, 'Get Me Outta Here' and 'All I Got Is You' have all the classic Purple swagger, the latter having a rising arpeggio into a crescendo before Airey delivers a cracking synth solo that would appeal to any fans of 'Burn'. 'One Night In Vegas' could easily be the spiritual successful to 'Strange Kind of Woman', however, the track would also fit in perfectly on 'Purpendicular', the only downside is that it is saddled with a pre-chorus that sounds a little too much like 'Junkyard Blues' from 2005\u2019s 'Rapture of the Deep'.\n\nThe main reason why 'Infinite' works is that it sounds like it was recorded in 1972 \u2013 a testament to not only the band, but to Ezrin too as both Morse and Airey sound as if they are using both Lord and Blackmore\u2019s gear giving a sound that every Purple fan has been requesting for a very long time. However, there are a few downsides to 'Infinite', Gillan\u2019s voice is nowhere near as powerful as his heyday and his lyrical worth has always been sub-par, but this is secondary to the music as it has always been with Deep Purple. As well as this, 'Infinite' does tail off towards the end, 'Birds of Prey' is not memorable in the slightest and having 'Roadhouse Blues' finish the album is a ludicrous way to finish an otherwise decent album. Sadly, time is against Deep Purple with all the members in their late 60\u2019s or early 70\u2019s barring Steve Morse, it begs the question, never mind infinite, Deep Purple are now on finite time and if 'Infinite' is to be their final album, then it is a good way to bow out.\n",
        "\nDeep Purple's Limitless is a nice compilation given out with an issue of Classic Rock Magazine. It consists of four studio tracks and four live cuts. The material consists of recent singles and rare b-sides as well as songs recorded during concerts in Europe and Asia during the last four years. Limitless represents the sound and form of contemporary Deep Purple very well. It can be seen both as a nice collector's item and an appropriate introduction to the band's current sound. To me, it was the latter and it made me discover more of the band's recent recordings.\n\nAmong the studio tracks, the futuristic and moody progressive rock opener ''Time for Bedlam'' convinces with great guitar harmonies, powerful organ sounds and intellectually appealing lyrics. It's impressive how sharp the band sounds after having been around for almost five decades and this song proves that the group is still going strong. Among the live cuts, the compilation closer ''Black Night'', that was first published on this record and later included on a special edition of the new studio album, convinces the most because the band sounds very playful and the audience is audible and sounds very enthusiastic.\n\nIn the end, Deep Purple's Limitless can be seen as a greatest hits compilation of what the band has accomplished in the past four years. The eight songs are all extraordinary progressive rock tracks performed with energy, inspiration and skills. They all remind of the classic Deep Purple sound based upon vivid rhythm sections, outstanding guitar melodies, melodic vocal lines and majestic organ sounds. Despite this traditional sound, the band sounds as fresh, hungry and strong as newcomers which makes the listening experience even greater. Let's hope this band carries on and continues to prove its status as one of the world's best rock bands.\n",
        "\nDeep Purple is now over 45 years into their career and they've put out a new album, inFinite, that proves why they're one of the greats. I won't claim that this is as good as their classic run like Machine Head and Burn, without their youthful energy or innovative vigor, but I will say I haven't been able to pry it from my car's CD player or my headphones since I got it the day it came out.\n\nThese guys are just good at making music. They have it down pat \u2013 every note on here is bright and expressive and put exactly where it needs to be. These are songs with no fat or excess, with every piece put together expertly to be as entertaining as possible. The songs are snappy and well-written, full of the groovy riffs, celeritous keys and headstrong vocal work that we've come to love from this band over the years. True \u2013 Ritchie Blackmore is long gone and Jon Lord has passed on, but their replacements for the last several years, Steve Morse and Don Airey, sound on-point and tight in their roles. I like that they've maintained their identity and don't just sound like some cover band on here.\n\nThe band has referred to this as \u201ctheir jazz album,\u201d and I can see it \u2013 it's a mellow, lighthearted exercise at its core, focused on dizzying instrumentation and quirky showboating in the context of these tight, hooky rock tunes. These are short songs and they don't go on any long jam sessions or anything, but each one is imbued with something special and different from the others, whether it's the proggy, storming riff-and-keys combo of \u201cTime For Bedlam,\u201d the jovial, almost dancey melodies of \u201cOne Night In Vegas,\u201d the swinging, low-end groove of \u201cGet Me Out Of Here\u201d or the slow dirge \u201cBirds Of Prey\u201d - the band has served up a varied, colorful listen. On \u201cThe Surprising,\u201d you get slow, smoky 70s-style balladic chords that open up into a mystical prog rock epic with atmosphere bleeding from every note and the awestruck, poetic lyricism alike.\n\nLyrically they do a lot of good stuff on this \u2013 the aforementioned \u201cThe Surprising\u201d and \u201cBirds Of Prey\u201d are the more serious and ambitious, meditating on life and death in the former and the human condition and propensity for war in the latter. Elsewhere, they spin humorous, quirky tales of bad romance, the perils of aging in a changing world and drunken escapades, among other fables \u2013 check out \u201cOn Top Of The World\u201d for a particularly clever one, as the last half of the song dips into a keyboard-backed narration segment that turns a drunken escapade Ian Gillan experienced years back into something fantastical and bizarre, with a real sense of wonder. This is all written with humor and levity, and the band really has a voice that carries over from the lyrics to the music alike. You can tell they liked writing this, enjoyed every second of it, and that kind of enjoyment is infectious to the listener.\n\nEverything on here is basically just perfect. The songs are all written to be super catchy and entertaining, and Ian Gillan \u2013 goddamn, what a talent. What fucking great charisma. Check out the verses of the sarcastic, biting second single \u201cAll I Got Is You \u2013 have you ever heard a 70+ year old man with as much attitude and style as this guy? It's just awesome.\n\nThe fact that they close this album with a cover of The Doors' \u201cRoadhouse Blues\u201d is pretty telling \u2013 the whole thing has the air of contemplating the band's own mortality and impending, inevitable end, but this song really hits it on the nose:\n\nThe future's uncertain, and the end is always near\nLet it roll, baby, roll\n\nI don't know how much more we'll get from Deep Purple this late in their careers \u2013 and hell, it'd be awfully selfish to demand much more than they've given us over the years. But if this is the end for them, I'm glad inFinite is an irresistably strong, wonderful album.\n",
        "\nIt probably took me a couple years before I really appreciated what was being fed to me with this record; before I knew what it took to make a great live record. Deep Purple's Made In Japan has an X factor that even my favorite record, Unleashed In The East didn't touch too much on, and that is the embellishment. \n\nOnly a group that contains Ritchie Blackmore, the greatest guitarist to ever live, and Jon Lord, the greatest keyboard/pianist to ever live could bust out such a beast in such an early year for heavy metal. Seeing that it clocks in nearly an hour and twenty minutes, yet only contains seven tracks is some kind of magic that few could pull off, and this all lies in the ability to stretch out songs to the longest extent, yet not go dry. For starters, I couldn't have picked a better setlist for this, unless there was room to add more; and the performance is spectacular! Take my favorite song by them, \"Strange Kind Of Woman\", and make that thirty second solo that's tacked onto the end and add three minutes to it. Pretty impressive right? Hell, at this point you may as well add three MORE minutes to it by testing Ian Gillan's vocal range by stacking up Ritchie's guitar screams with it. Absolutely incredible. You know that popular song, \"Highway Star\", with one of the greatest electric organ solos ever? Yeah, let's add even more complexity and shake the venue with the amount of power invested in this track on the live version. Or perhaps the way that they over-amplify the keyboards on \"Lazy\", and shred out even more solos between the two Gods, just taking turns busting out melodic yet crazy solos? That, my friends, is how you perform a song live, double its length, and not let it go stale. The whole experience makes you feel like you're right there with them in 1972, and feeling the same thing everyone in that venue got back then. Though Roger Glover and Ian Paice don't take the front as much as the rest, their contributions are very necessary, and put the icing on the cake. They do a great job of filling in the cracks by shining with their talents up on the stage with seldom but great solo work.\n\nNow, why did I have to be the asshole to ruin the \"100%\" streak that this record had? Well, it loses two points because they bite off more than they can chew with \"Space Truckin'\". This is my second favorite Deep Purple song, and the performance is great, and even the extra add ons here are pretty sweet... for the first four or five minutes of it. Had it stopped there like with the other tracks, it'd be perfect. But they drag it out for twenty minutes, and it starts to sound like they're just screwing around with said instruments at this point. That ten minute chunk could have been used for another track or two (probably only one, seeing the formula here). I would have loved to hear \"Speed King\", \"Black Night\", or the soft ballad \"Anyone's Daughter\". But other than the overkilled drag-out of this song, the record is flawless. The Blackmore-Lord duo is basically unstoppable when together, and Gillan's amazing rage is like a bonus to your paycheck. It's a shame that this lineup didn't workout much longer.\n",
        "\nSo I'm sitting here separated from this album by 45 motherfucking years and considering comparing it to whiskey or cheese or wine, since age has not dimmed this a great deal, but distilled much of its quality and made it more potent to taste. The ravages of time have not ravaged Machine Head in the same way as they have ravaged Judas Priest's British Steel, which I recently reviewed and found a bit dated. I am prepared to admit (ashamedly, it must be said) that I don't know which version of this album I have, but I would hazard a guess that I have the original mixes, which sound clean and studio-recorded rather than immediate and live-recorded, as most people seem to say about the Roger Glover re-release. In any case, the songwriting, musicianship, and ingenuity displayed on this here disc is enough to recommend it to all but the most fleeting of rock fans.\n\nNote that it's the word rock and definitely not the word metal that defines the environs of Machine Head in music's amphitheatre, nor is it simply a case of faster, louder, heavier that steers it away from the subject of this website. The beats that Ian Paice lays down certainly never approach the urgency of latter, purer, bands such as Judas Priest and Iron Maiden, while the choices made in the studio and on Ritchie Blackmore's amp sound starkly different from the \"scooped\" sound that would later rise to prominence, nor is the guitar emphasized or distorted as much as Tony Iommi's from Black Sabbath's early days. All this results in a fairly relaxed listen by early heavy metal standards, only 'Highway Star' and 'Pictures of Home' injecting some pace into proceedings, while the blues influences of 'Maybe I'm a Leo' and 'Lazy' can appear busy though never heavy. That's no complaint, of course, since the more spacious feel of such an album gives precedence to the individual chops of each member, of which Machine Head boasts some of the very best.\n\nIn the first place, this isn't particularly a guitar album, although Blackmore does bust a few great riffs and has plenty of time soloing, settling into familiar rhythmic holding posts at other moments to allow the other instrumentalists to shine through. Blackmore's work on 'Highway Star' is the most innovative here, not only in terms of the main riff, which is a \"speed metal\" staple (not that fast and not really metal, but the intent is there), but also a lot of the other work, such as the neat chugging riff he pops in at 1:58 to lead into the solo section, which has a gritty tone and an awesome double-speed note that proves what a steady picking hand he's got. Then the spiralling melodies are simply dazzling and were taken up later by a great deal of trad and power metal outfits, plus the solos later in the song make use of some unusual note patterns that prove far more memorable than the normal rock scale noodling. His comrades Roger Glover and Jon Lord take prominence in many of the other songs, Glover's bass occasionally dominating and taking the lead position from the others. Despite the rather obvious solo in 'Pictures of Home', the bass work stands out in 'Lazy', swooping and reverberating in multiple patterns while the song goes along at low ebb and then settling into more stable rhythms as the band takes off in a more specific direction. Most of Glover's work is stellar and Lord - though with fewer opportunities - manages to remind us why his passing was such a sad moment for the music world, combining with Blackmore in dizzying feats of duelling solos. As for Paice's drumming, I have already mentioned a tendency to play rock beats, though his ability to shape the softer and slower songs is remarkable, opting for a jazzy flexibility over a simple pounding of the skins. His contribution can be witnessed to greatest effect in the rise and fall of 'Lazy'.\n\nIan Gillan gets a separate mention because I'm sure he must have felt bored at times when Purple performed these songs, since his time in the limelight is comparatively short, barely visible for half the album. Most of the songs include lengthy jam sections, at which time he could probably have left the stage for a piss, or a smoke, or even walk down the pub and order a drink. His performance suits the record though, coping well with the variation of softer and slower textures, draping 'Never Before' and 'Pictures of Home' with charisma rather than the famous shrieking power for which he is known. The one song that he fails to bring credit to is the point on which I have remained quiet - 'Smoke on the Water'. Here, Gillan attempts to add excitement to the steady beat of the track, narrating the classic story of the fire near the recording studio, yet there isn't the sufficient punch either from his voicebox or the combined efforts of the rest of the band. Thus, it seems that the song containing the most famous riff in rock music is probably the weak point of the album, containing neither gripping instrumental passages nor a strong enough focal point until too late in the running time: the attempted nostalgia of Blackmore's solo comes to the end and Gillan finally gets a verse out with an ounce of conviction. The riff too - is that really the best we've got?\n\nHappily, there aren't many problems with the other songs and they tend to also have more detailing from each band member to leave treasures to unearth for several listens. The cocky strut of 'Maybe I'm a Leo' is an immediate factor, as is the memorable theme to 'Pictures of You', while the bonehead rush of 'Space Truckin'' also presents more from the first experience than later visits. Perhaps the most rewarding song in which to indulge multiple times would be 'Pictures of You', since it seems to cover all bases, yet 'Highway Star' narrowly comes off as strongest from a fairly consistent set. What all this means for Machine Head as a whole is that it's reputation can be slightly misleading, particularly due to the unfair weight of opinion towards 'Smoke in the Water', whereas in fact the greater rewards lie just below the waterline in the sidelined album tracks. General consensus indicates that the original mix is an impediment to fully enjoying the music, though that's not to say that you won't have a good time and be fascinated whatever version you hear.\n",
        "\n'Shades of Deep Purple' is Deep Purple's debut album, released in 1968. The original line-up featured Nick Simper on bass and backing vocals and Rod Evans handling lead vocals, alongside the \"core members\" that of Ritchie Blackmore, Jon Lord and Ian Paice. This is a line-up often overlooked, since Mk II with Ian Gillan on vocals and Roger Glover on bass, as well as Mk III with Dave Coverdale on vocals and Glenn Hughes handling the bass and backing vocals duties, are vastly more successful, and for good reason.\n\nThe reason for this, apart from Deep Purple MK I being a very new, thus green band, is that they seemed to be big fans of covering music written by others - something that would decrease with time - but alas, on 'Shades of Deep Purple', the band has covered four songs out of a total of nine; with two songs by the band themselves being entirely instrumental. Album opener \"And the Address\" is one such instrumental track, but is actually a very enjoyable one, as it shows that the guitar wizardry of Blackmore was present from the earliest days of Deep Purple. It's quickly followed by \"Hush\", originally by Billy Joe Royal, which is one of the highlights of this album. It's a fun and instantly recognisable tune with an infectious \"na na na na\" a la \"Hey Jude\" by the Beatles - a band whose music is also covered on 'Shades of Deep Purple - namely, \"Help\". This is another highlight, since Deep Purple went away from the poppy and very accessible nature of the original and turned it into a slow, soulful psychedelic rock song.\n\n\"Mandrake Root\", a song by Deep Purple themselves, is perhaps the ultimate highlight; not only for that reason, but also because it's very typical Deep Purple. It's obviously rooted (no pun intended) in blues, with a healthy dose of sleazy rock 'n' roll akin to the Rolling Stones, and it proves that the band could absolutely craft an excellent song themselves. What becomes even clearer is the exceptional talent possessed by the members of the band, especially Blackmore and Lord, who share a long solo-section that has a snake charming quality to it.\n\nAll in all, 'Shades of Deep Purple' is a fine late 60s hard rock album. It has no truly spectacular moments, and while it pales in comparison to the band's later work - particularly 'Deep Purple in Rock', 'Machine Head', 'Burn' and 'Perfect Strangers', it hasn't really got any bad moments either. A middle-of-the-pack album.\n",
        "\nThis album marks Deep Purple's third time they've tried their luck with their classic Mark 2 lineup. Both times before they hit pay dirt with classics like In Rock and Perfect Strangers. In this case, they got singer Ian Gillan back in the band as it was thought that firing him in 1989 had been a mistake. This brought Deep Purple Mark 2 together for the third and final time.\n\nThe cliche tells us that \"third time's a charm\", however in this instance, that cliche must be ignored. The Battle Rages On is an album that, by and large is padded with unemotional and (occasionally) confused songs that don't have a reason to exist. There are some standout tracks which will be discussed later in the review, but mostly it's just filler. \"Time to Kill\" is the prime example of the confused song on this record. The music itself is upbeat and positive but the lyrics talk of war and death. There are bands that can pull this off as ironic, but Deep Purple isn't one of them. It just comes off as confused and disoriented. Then there are songs which are simply unemotional. \"A Twist in the Tale\" is, while being faster than the other songs on this record, bland and makes no impact. It does have moments when it sounds like things will pick up but then it settles back into an uninspired song that doesn't evoke anything from the listener.\n\nHowever, that being said, there are standout moments on this album. The title track opens the album with a very angry and aggressive riff (for Deep Purple anyway). It immediately hooks the listener in and makes them want to hear the rest of the album. \"Nasty piece of work\" is also a very different song from what we've come to expect from the band. It sees the band taking a groovy style song and, like the title track, they pull it off with ease. It's a song that makes you sway and tap your foot. However, the best song on here is the one that sticks closest to the band's roots: \"Anya\". This song's intro gives hints as to what guitarist Ritchie Blackmore would go onto do beyond Deep Purple with it's medieval/renaissance sound. Then the song opens like a classic Deep Purple song with the keyboard and guitar sharing riffs to create a that unmistakable Purple sound. Definitely an underrated classic of the band. \n\nAll in all, The Battle Rages On is a harmless album. It has it's fair share of problems but the good moments manage to make this album salvageable. If you're a Deep Purple fan and you want to complete your collection with this album then get this album, it doesn't do any harm. Otherwise, don't bother. This album isn't worth your time and money, it can be safely skipped.\n",
        "\nWhile no song on this album can stand up to the title song on Burn (probably the greatest metal song from the 70s by any band), I probably like this album as much as Burn, just for different reasons. Whether Blackmore and Lord are running the show with the new guys just following along (Burn), or the new guys are taking the reigns and influencing Blackmore's near future decision to quit The Purple (Stormbringer), this band just simply makes interesting, varied music that needs to be heard and enjoyed by any fan of 70s heavy metal and hard rock.\n\nThis album has it all: aggressive songs (Stormbringer, Lady Double Dealer), introspective, soulful, melodic pieces (Love Don't Mean a Thing, Holy Man, Hold On), funky shit (You Can't Do It Right), and a soft ballad to close things off nicely (Soldier of Fortune). Hughes and Coverdale just have excellent voices on this album, often harmonizing for these amazing choruses (Hold On). It really just makes you want to sing along, even if you can't sing worth a damn. It must be admitted that Lord and Paice have a smaller presence on here than on Purple albums before, with Paice's drumming simply keeping time in many of the songs, and Lord really only shining on the title track, and particularly on High Ball Shooter, in the sense of having one of his amazing Hammond solos (think back to the end of Might Just Take Your Life on Burn, or the middle section of Flight of the Rat on In Rock). Otherwise, he blends into the background, often to the point of being hard to even particularly pick out. In the end it's just a tradeoff, and trust me, you'll enjoy a vocally-led, blues/soul/funk influenced, melodic, \"soft\" Purple just as much as the metal-pioneering Purple of albums before.\n\nI listened to Come Taste the Band once, and it seemed as though Purple had moved too far away from what they were good at, and I recall an album filled with rather boring, plain rock songs. That is NOT the case on Stormbringer. Outside influences are used to perfectly compliment a somewhat \"restrained\" Purple sound, and it's just a fact that it produces nine amazing songs, all of which can be enjoyed, and all of which are worthy candidates to fit somewhere on a carrer-wide highlight reel for the band. It's a shame that Ritchie's loss of creative control on this album made him feel up to quitting the band, but this album shows that Purple had other amazing songwriters and contributors.\n\nCheck out Stormbringer right away. You'll love the title track if you love Burn, with it's aggressive lyrics, metal attitude, and slightly \"cheesier\" Lord textures that still sound badass. Then give yourself a little bit of time to let the rest of the album sink in. It may take a few listens, but this may very well end up as one of your favorite Purple albums. Check out the lyrics on the album too: equally introspective, soulful, and telling some interesting stories and ideas which, while not traditionally \"metal\", are still awesome.\n\n\"Stormbringer coming... TIME TO DIE!\"\n",
        "\nThis is one of those albums, that even people who aren't Deep Purple fans can listen to and enjoy. This is one of the first albums to take the complexity and intellectual aspects of progressive rock, and merge them with the sheer power of metal. The result is arguably the first progressive metal album (High Tide didn't release their debut until a month later). The result is a truly great album.\n\nSpeaking of their mix of metal and progressive rock, no song better exemplifies this than \"Bird Has Flown\". On top of having this awesome mix, Rob Evans vocal performance here is among the best in all of progressive rock (not that he had much competition, prog rock isn't known for its vocals). The song is clearly very heavy, I'd argue heavy enough to truly be considered true metal, and obviously influenced Black Sabbath later on.\n\nIf you're not already a fan of Deep Purple, which if you need to look at this review I'll assume you're not, you may be surprised at how predominate Jon Lord's organ is. This is a trademark of Deep Purple's sound, and it's present here in abundance. It provides both melody and texture. This is one thing that may keep many metalheads away from this record, so I'd listen to some other Deep Purple before buying this, to make sure the \"organ metal\" sound is something you enjoy or not. That being said, Jon Lord's organ helps Deep Purple stand out. \n\nMost songs here are about 5 minutes, bar the closer which is an astounding 12 minutes long. If you aren't okay with long compositions, this album will do you no favors. Again, listen to some of the songs and determine if you're okay with the long songs.\n\nDespite finding a good balance between metal and progressive, I'd say the album will appeal more to progressive fans than to regular metal fans. The sound is a mixture of prog and metal, but compositionally it is 100% progressive, and if you're not a fan of progressive music already, there isn't much chance this album will convene you otherwise. The album is closer to Yes than to Black Sabbath. That being said, if you enjoy both metal and progressive rock, this album is a phenomenal piece of work, with many of its songs being true classics. This is more or less just the later day Deep Purple sound being put on to progressive rock compositions.\n",
        "\nOn February the 15th 2014 I turned 30 years old. I have to say, it is an honor to have been born on the same year that saw the advent of masterpieces such as Powerslave, Defenders of the Faith or Ride the Lightning. This masterpiece here turned 40 on that very day, another honor for me. For Deep Purple, one of Britain\u2019s greatest rock bands ever, Burn signaled the debut of the III Mark line-up, and what a debut it is! The eight long play in Deep Purple\u2019s extensive discography is, in my book, their third best overall, and a monstrous hard rock statement. The major line-up change was like a breath of fresh air for the Brits, who were forced by their management to hurry up finishing their previous album, the disappointing and aptly titled Who Do We Think We Are, in order for them to hit the road ASAP. So it\u2019s not surprising that said record was kind of a flop.\n\nThe album starts with the titular track, my second favorite Deep Purple tune only behind the aesthetically similar \u201cHighway Star\u201d, which I like to think of like an older brother to this one. \u201cBurn\u201d is a propulsive, proto-speed metal six minute, err... burner, that opens the album in magnificent form, setting the quality bar real high indeed for the rest of the eight compositions. The opening riffs remind me of Priest\u2019s \u201cScreaming for Vengeance\u201d tune, but that\u2019s not surprising at all since Rob and the boys were undoubtedly influenced by Purple\u2019s works. A pyromancer witch\u2019s revenge tale, it boasts the signature and extremely impressive Blackmore/Lord soloing on their prime, that start to melt everything in their path around the 2:15 mark, as well as the lightning fast fills of master drummer Ian Paice. Lord\u2019s organs all over the place as well, and he has another incendiary spotlight moment around the 3:52 mark. This is fucking rock \u2018n\u2019 roll mates! WHAT A TUNE!\n\nThe following song cools things off a bit, and represent a significant change in style for the band, who employs some funky, sleazy sound here and gospel-like choruses. Nonetheless, \u201cMight Just Take Your Life\u201d is a good example of the combined vocal powers of newcomers bassist Glenn Hughes and future Whitesnake founder David Coverdale. The first one\u2019s higher pitched style is more reminiscent of Purple\u2019s previous frontman Ian Gillian, while Coverdale\u2019s bluesy voice is more robust and masculine. To be honest, I prefer the latter, though I have to say both are (or maybe were) great singers in their own right and I enjoy them greatly here as well as on what they\u2019d do later. The rest of the band\u2019s pretty solid on this one, and well as on the other two tracks of side A of the vinyl, but they don\u2019t really explode again \u2018til side B. \u201cLay Down, Stay Down\u201d is a more agile song which doesn\u2019t deviate too far from the \u201cMight Just Take Your Life\u201d formula, while unleashing a great Blackmore solo at the end, while the bass-heavy \u201cSail Away\u201d shows us some Rainbow-esque exotic cadence the axe master would further employ in his prolific career.\n\nIf it not were for \u201cBurn\u201d, side A wouldn\u2019t have anything to compete against side B, which is arguably superior, or maybe has its quality more evenly distributed amongst its tracks. \u201cYou Fool No One\u201d has some busy, outlandish and excellent percussion work thrown in by Paice, as well as yet another amazing Blackmore solo, and despite (or perhaps thanks to) its Beatle-esque vocal arrangements ends up catchier than the last three songs from side A. \u201cWhat\u2019s Goin\u2019 on Here\u201d sees the band return to the more familiar blues rock style, complete with a saloon-like piano solo by Lord. It maintains the sexual, hot-blooded character of the album, that only increments tenfold at the arrival of the monumental \u201cMistreated\u201d. HOLY FUCK! Again, it has Blackmore and both singer\u2019s all over the place, complete with a totally Robert Plant-ish \u201cBaby, baby, baby\u201d. The slow, sensual seven-minute tour de force that culminates in an orgasmic climax is the undisputed highlight here along with the title-track. Afterwards we\u2019re left with the four minutes of the awesome futuristic instrumental \u201c'A' 200\u201d to light up a cigarette and pick up our clothes.\n\nTheir last great record of the 70\u2019s, Burn would be followed by lesser releases until their 1984 (again, what a year!) magnificent Mark II rebirth, Perfect Strangers. The fires of Burn seemed to be extinguished too quickly for the Mark III line-up, and only some bright embers remained of it for Stormbringer to use. Nonetheless, this was and still is a success of an album, and 40 years later still burns hot for those of us who love hard rock music. In the extremely unlikely event some of you reading this have not listened to Deep Purple yet, I\u2019d recommend you to first listen to In Rock and especially Machine Head before this one. Then, grab this, crank it up and let it BURN!\n",
        "\nMuch has been written about Who Do We Think We Are! over the years and much of it is just not true. To clear those misconceptions up, let me start there before reviewing the actual album. Falsehood #1) The album was a critically lambasted commercial failure and the press crucified it. In truth, the album got some of the best reviews of Purple's career. Some rock magazines even called it their best album to date. Modern revisionists have rewritten history and painted a false narrative about the album. A little research will uncover the near unanimous praise the press had for the album upon its release. Falsehood #2) The band were out of ideas and that's why the album doesn't stand up today. The band were not out of ideas. Roger Glover told me about one jam session during the recording of the album, where Blackmore tore into a ferocious new riff and the rest of the band joined in. He abruptly stopped playing. Roger encouraged him to continue, so they could flesh out the song. Blackmore replied, \"No, I'm saving this one for a solo project.\" Roger recognized the song a few years later, when it showed up on the first Rainbow album as Sixteenth Century Greensleeves. Far from being dried up and short of ideas, the band were crippled at every turn by their moody, petulant, guitar player. He refused to work on the others ideas and only played what and when he felt like it. Yes, they were tired, but fully capable of writing top notch material. Falsehood #3) The album wasn't well received by the fans. In truth, fans bought the album by the truck load and it went gold quickly. FM radio in the US gave it a lot of airplay, with Woman from Tokyo and Rat Bat Blue being played the most, but Super Trouper, Smooth Dancer and Our Lady getting some exposure too. When you consider the unimaginable popularity of their epic Made in Japan set that was released almost simultaneously, the studio album was bound to get short changed. Another reason for the album not having the longevity of their earlier efforts was the fact the band made little or no effort to promote it. Where they'd supported Machine Head for almost a year and a half and played four of its seven tracks on a regular basis, Purple only played Mary Long from Who Do We Think We Are!. The 1973 tour lasted right at six months and was more of a Made in Japan tour than a Who Do We Think We Are! tour. Weary and burned out, the band simply continued to play what they'd been playing and couldn't be bothered to work the new songs into the set. \n\nThe fact is, the band was falling apart at the seams. Blackmore and Gillan weren't speaking to each other, and various members recorded their parts separately from the rest of the band. Considering the circumstances under which it was conceived, the album is a remarkable success. The opening track, Woman from Tokyo has rightfully become a DP classic. With an instantly recognizable Blackmore riff, the band throttles into full drive. It's not really easy to define the genre the song would fit into. It's heavy, but melodic and is played to perfection. Track two is not regarded as a top tier Purple song and most complaints concern the lyrics. In 1970's America, any song with a chorus of, \"How did you lose your virginity Mary Long?\" was bound to be met with skepticism and a degree of embarrassment. No one wanted to have to explain that to their parents or significant other. The lyrics were a complete mystery to most Americans anyway, since they dealt with a pair of English politicians unknown on this side of the Atlantic. The album takes on a more progressive note with Super Trouper , a short but interesting number. With its phased passages and twisting riffs, it shows that even in the depths of disintegration the band could push the envelope. Lyrically, Gillan shares what being in the spotlight can do to you and the price of fame. Side one closes with the most \"traditional\" Deep Purple track on the album. Smooth Dancer is often unfairly criticized as being a simple rehash of Speed King. While there are certainly similarities, the track stands on its own as an unsung Purple classic. It stands proudly among the heaviest tracks the band ever recorded and Jon Lord's solo is among his more inspired moments. Wrenching sounds out of his Hammond organ that were never intended by its makers, he truly rips on this one. Sadly, all of this is usually overlooked and any attention the song gets focuses on Gillan's lyrics. Gillan rips his heart open in a direct message to Ritchie Blackmore about their deteriorating relationship and his desire to salvage their shattered friendship. The song thunders to a close and the side ends on a musical high note. Flipping the album over (showing my age!), side two opens with a monster riff and the band inventing funk metal. With its hard hitting power and a serpentine riff, it's another unsung DP classic. Heavier than a Panzer division, the song is a sonic masterpiece. The highlights are numerous, but one simply cannot overlook the importance of Ian Paice in the Deep Purple equation. Here, all his talents are on display. He combines power drumming with jazzy fills and a funky back beat, often all at the same time. One can easily criticize the lyrics, but to do so and ignore the sheer complexity of what's going on musically is criminal. Again Jon Lord takes center stage for another epic solo. He pulls out all the stops and turns in another classic performance. The next track is where even the staunchest Purple fan usually lost hope. The longest track on the album is also the album's weakest moment. Place In Line, a blues track that takes far too long to get there and the final destination not really being worth the trip sort of takes the wind out of your sails. Blackmore and Lord both turn in fine performances, but they lack passion and seem almost phoned in. Gillan's odd vocal delivery on the verses doesn't help things much and the song ultimately becomes nothing more than a track to occupy space. If Place In Line challenged the Purple faithful, Our Lady pushes their tolerance to the limit. Rare in Deep Purple's enormous catalog as song without any solos, it's generally a love it or hate it track. It's a very atmospheric song and among their more progressive efforts, but at the end of the day the experiment doesn't quite jell.\n\nOverall, Who Do We Think We Are! stands as a testament to a dark time in the band's history and the ability of five young men managing to pull off an almost unthinkable feat. With relationships dead or dying, communication almost non-existent within the band, egos running rampant and various factions lobbying for control, they managed to produce some of the finest performances of their career and a very listenable, if inconsistent album. Sonically the best sounding Purple album of the 70's (along with Come Taste the Band), it proved that even at their worst they were capable of exploring new directions and making exciting hard rock music.\n",
        "\n\"Blackmore and Lord left. So, there is no deep nor purple anymore...\" and that's something to debate, a strong argument which has lots of points in favour and against.\n\nBut Don Airey and Steve Morse are brilliant performers. They pushed so hard in \"Bananas\" that eventually forced Gillan and Paice to return in this album to some of their older days of greatness. Even Glover, still way behind of what he used to do, tries to give some fingers for the work here and \"Rapture of the Deep\" contains several hard-rocking tunes worthy of your attention. And of more attention than what it gets.\n\nSo, is it better than \"Bananas\" to some extent? No. \"Bananas\" was solid as a whole, but here we can find some big flaws that can be accepted because of the effort made to \"try to return\" to the grand game. Money Talks, for instance, is a good opener. Of course far behind those legendary ones in the golden era, but way different and better than previous ones. Gillan gives it a try and impresses us all. Not that he melted the irons here, but hey, something is something. Of course, none of this could have been achieved without Airey and Morse. \"Wrong Man\" slows the beat, but what can we possibly do? We are, yet, far from the finest momentum and there are only \"slight returns\" here. Same with \"Girls Like That\" with its funny lyrics and beats and with some progressive licks and stuff, but nothing more.\n\nWith \"Rapture of the Deep\", the magic returns in the shape of an ancient Persian tune with Airey and Morse once again taking the lead. Paicey returns to the majestic throne and drops us some nasty drumming we weren't listening to in a long time. A nice piece which now belongs to DP's canon of live songs.\n\nWhat else can be said about the next songs? Not many and not least. They are filled with a hard-rocking edge with a mix of progressive licks thanks to Airey. Morse fills every vacuum with his talented fingers, especially in \"Don't Let Go\" and \"Kiss Tomorrow Goodbye\", good fillers with nice personality. The flaws in this record, though, are a couple of songs I just can't save even if they have some tremendous lyrics: \"Back to Back\" and \"MTV\". The former, talks about how the average men is no longer using his brain and the latter is about the music industry. Yes, they are right about the lyrics, we praise it. But the execution, I mean, the musical construction just doesn't work. Funky, greasy, and way too poppish despite whatnot fragments of heavy beating. These pieces don't belong here and my idea is that those were fully made by Gillan, Glover, and Paice, disappointed in their low sales of previous albums and without any influence of Morse and Airey, two guys enjoying their time in one of the most legendary bands of all of history.\n\nThe cover art, which has a \"deep\" idea beneath, gets some extra points no matter what you can say about it. This album is just as good as \"Bananas\" 'cause it contains great songs, especially the title track, but as well it has some big flaws like \"MTV\" and \"Back to Back\". Nevertheless, the slight return is well-appreciated here and this album deserves your attention, at least for a moment of rapture.\n",
        "\nAs I read in one review about this album, the mood in here is \"oh, we are on vacation, this album is a vacation album\" with no ambition at all. Yes, the reviewer was right about it, and most of his review, as well. But here we have three members of the band enjoying the relaxation and tranquility while the other two members were actually hard working to save the band from the definitive stagnation and eventual break-up it was poised to: Don Airey and Steve Morse.\n\nMorse was already a veteran in the war effort here. In \"Purpendicular\" he gave a gasp of life to a band still crying for Blackmore's departure and in the last brilliant moment of Jon Lord, they together built a solid release from which a couple of songs now are part of Deep Purple's canon in live shows. Remarkably, \"Sometimes I Feel Like Screaming\" can be in any \"Best Of\" because it is plain great, but after that, \"Abandon\" almost comes as a deadly blow to the band.\n\nSo Jon Lord left. He did the best thing, but he wasn't just in the mood for staying where he found no more inspiration nor ambition, and the three other guys said, \"well, we make more money with our Purple releases than in any other one\", so they hired, just for that sake, Don Airey.\n\nBut Airey, besides of a trio of guys with no ambition whatsoever for doing something else, finds a younger fella who was working very hard to get things well done. Stevie, at last, gets new blood and new visions for keep on rolling the dice. And here you got \"Bananas\", an album driven totally by Airey and Morse, while Gillan, Glover and Paice were \"on vacations\".\n\nThe record is solid as a whole. There are no stand-up songs here, but everyone of them are joyful, funny, and tasty licks of music. Here, you will not find a hard & heavy rocker song or anthem worthy of your praise, just simple bluesy and rooted tunes with easy, but effective riffs and some atmospheric keyboarding with eventual solos for filling the air.\n\n\"Sun Goes Down\" contains many ideas that would be exploited later on in Rapture of the Deep, with Airey taking the full lead here. Even Gillan gets somehow infected here and tries to remind us of the early days when he sang with \"very tight trousers\". Same thing with \"Silver Tongue\". There's some hidden heaviness waiting for development in those pieces. Laying dormant, but cute and cheeky. I'm not saying \"those songs are remarkable\" because they aren't. They just work it out. Same happens with \"I Got your Number\"; funny, driving, smart in some aspects, and a not-so-complicated guitar moment which actually finishes correctly the ambition of the product.\n\nYou can also find some ethereal gospel-like moments here, ouvre et gr\u00e1ce of Don Airey and Stevie Morse. \"Haunted\" is an example of this in a very fashioned way. Purple returns to the experimental notions they once did in the '60s. Lightly, though, but we appreciate it. New blood refreshing the thing.\n\nOverall, an average-good album. Airey and Morse are the leading forces here and without their effort, this thing could have been way much worse. The songs I mentioned above are the highlights here, though there isn't any particular track better than the others. The album itself has not a \"special moment\", it's just plain solid and works it out. Even Gillan and eventually Paice try to re-enter in the Purple realm once in awhile, so that's a good signal, a very good one.\n",
        "\nBelieve me, guys, I'm so actually certain about this. Mouth-out, the older members of the band said a million times \"oh, Blackmore, yeah, but we just don't need him...he is gone, our shows were a roaring wreck with him with only 5000 people watching us, we were losing our popularity and blahblahblah...\", but they were crying inside. They were lost and blind, with no life and no emotion.\n\nNo matter how hard Stevie Morse tried with two or three songs here like \"Watching the Sky\", \"Almost Human\", \"Evil Louie\" or even \"Any Fule Kno That\", riffing like hell with emotion and spirit. The guys behind him were just gone. They were in the mood of \"Ritchie abandoned us, so we will abandon you too, young mate\". And that's plainly the thing that happened here. I'll ramble upon this fact over and over again. There isn't just much to talk about this record. It's wrong doing, or weak doing, or bland doing, or gutless doing, that's all. Even the attempt to re-record \"Bludsucker\" is just something that proves how they were in the minds of \"we need you, Ritchie, we long those early In Rock days...\" without seeing that Stevie was able to replace, somehow, Blackmore.\n\nDespite this, I repeat this: Stevie Morse deserves an applause, our appraise and love. He was alone, here, abandoned. He did his best: soloing, riffing a couple of magic ones, pushing the envelope the most he could, but nothing can help when he is alone. Nothing at all.\n\nWatching the Sky, Almost Human and Evil Louie are the finest songs in here only because of Steve Morse. And that's it. One of the worst releases by DP ever.\n",
        "\nJust don't, friends. This album doesn't deserves a higher general rating than \"Perfect Strangers\" or \"Fireball\" to some extent. Honesty forces me to write this review, actually just for settling things rather than praising or bashing this nice effort, because, yeah, it is a nice effort considering what was happening with DP before this album.\n\nBlackmore had enough. We can all argue about who did the most for DP in the golden era, who resurrected DP in the silver era and what happened next. But Ritchie proved us two things in the last records: his mind was in other thing and he is human, after all, made of mistakes and bad decisions.\n\nBecause \"Slaves and Masters\" is a total creation of his mind. And roughly \"THOBL\" and \"TBRO\" are, as well, mostly made of Blackmore's fretting, if any fretting at all. Yeah, \"Perfect Strangers\" is a masterpiece. But what about the others? Not precisely head-crushing albums. Maybe, just maybe, \"The Battle Rages On\" equals the greatness of Mark II in some ways.\n\nBut to claim that \"Purpendicular\" is far better than \"The Battle Rages On\" or even \"Perfect Strangers\", that's a travesty!!\n\nWhat's great about \"Purpendicular\" is the fresh air. The thing that happened with \"Burn\". But hey, in \"Burn\" the times were different. The ages were different. The magic was still there. Here, the scars are visible. The scars still are hurting and despite the new inspiration which could have come with Steve Morse, the band was still taunted by the great loss that meant the departure of Blackmore. And I'll say more: they stayed taunted and haunted by that until the release of \"Now What\" and everywhere, everywhere, that could be smelled miles away.\n\nBut hey, \"Purpendicular\" has many brilliancies. Indeed, Steve Morse proves how talented he is -from behind, though- and some riffs, specially in Ted the Mechanic, Loosen my Strings and The Aviator, he comes up with technicalities never-found in Blackmore's style. And that amazes us, shocks us to the core. A new sound, not leading the whole, but doing it from behind. That was the idea of Gillan, Glover, Lord and Paice. They didn't wanted \"another Blackmore\" with Satriani. They needed something else, different and pure. There's the point here and that's why Morse's appearance works perfectly for DP's idea.\n\n\"Purpendicular\" is a nice release. Not that \"heavy\", not that \"majestic\" in terms of having a remindable song like, let's say \"Anya\" for giving names. But has a new spirit, a new way of approaching things. Unfortunately, Blackmore's spirit was still there, haunting, lurking. And they just couldn't shake themselves off that until \"Now What\" as I said before. Despite this, a couple of good songs in this album are now part of Deep Purple's canon: \"Sometimes I Feel Like Screaming\" and \"Ted the Mechanic\" are good enough to share some duties with the band's classic. And many other instrumental sections here are just as good as the previous ones in former releases.\n\nStill, in this record, Gillan is far from his heights. Just like \"The Battle Rages On\" but even weaker, because here is no inspiration. Even the fresh air lacks to impress Gillan's voice to look for something else. And that's pretty much of it. Glover is cold, distant, making no great moves, just delivers the enough ammount. Only Paicey, in some moments, and Maestro Lord are up for the duty. Specially the latter. Maestro Lord charges on his back, again, the heavy weight of the band. And from behind, god bless you, Steve, for saving the band. Here, he still lies behind the mammoth, but his interventions and riffs were the thing for moving the ship after the fire.\n\nOverall, a good release. Not brilliant, just good.\n",
        "\nSo, Now What?!\n\nYeah, this album. Many guys were talking and saying \"hey, this is Deep Purple finest release, or at least, as good as Machine Head or In Rock\" and, well, no... Not actually. It is a good album, very good. By far better than Black Sabbath's \"13\" that's for sure. But it doesn't reach the Non-Wuthering Heights of the aforementioned albums. That's just for a simple and pure reason: once upon a time, there was Ritchie Blackmore, the sorcerer of heavy rock and early metal. The guy who outplayed in every possible way Jimmy Page -of course, without even care about and without recieving enough credit for it by the press- and who could be as heavy as Tony Iommi, if he wanted to. *Iommi, god, BTW*.\n\nAnd there were some nasty episodes as well, like Who do we Think we Are or the same Stormbringer, bluesy rooted 70's rock albums made for money-making. As \"Technical Ecstasy\" existed, as well. But I'll repeat this: NO! This release is not as good as In Rock or Machine Head. Is maybe close to Fireball, Burn or Perfect Strangers, to some extent, but still inferior.\n\nThen, what's so special about \"Now What?!\" anyway, if it isn't as close as those major albums in its linage? Well, it's for this: they finally got away from the taunting Blackmore's Image. They finally decided to leave away their might and glory past and to embrace their present and giving Steve Morse the real space he deserved. Yeah, I said it. Finally, Steve Morse was set free here, to make the light beneath the dark and forgotten weaklings made in the 90's and 2000's. Certainly, Gillan, Glover, Paicey and Lord -rest in peace, Maestro- kept on saying that \"they were totally different since Blackmore left\" and so, but they craved with insistence to resurrect his soul in his succesor. Maybe in \"Purpendicular\" they achieved some slight bites of this, but then on... The total silence...\n\nThat's why \"Now What?!\" becomes major from its very beginning. This is the new Purple we all expected, with new magic tricks and a total new personality. Sadly, we must admit that the days of early metal madness are forgone. There will be no more \"In Rock\" nor \"Machine Head\". But we can get here some cookies baked here in resemblance of those monuments of heavy metal, with a renewed tone, a renewed spirit.\n\n\"A Simple Song\" works it out. It's not the embryo of speed and power metal it was \"Highway Star\" or \"Fireball\" but manages to survive, growing in punch as Morse takes the lead. Don Airey succeeds to maintain the Hammond atmosphere through all the album and sometimes, he plays John Lord with full texture and originality. That's what we can get in \"Weirdistan\", more progressive, more mixed and chromatic and sometimes, with good beats of hard rock.\n\nDid I said \"hard rock\"? Yes, I did. They are not the \"metal dinosaurs\" anymore and from a long time ago, the strict words \"heavy metal\" were distant from Deep Purple's world. The seventies are gone, Perfect Strangers was in the eighties and the last lurks of metal in DP were in \"The Battle Rages On\"... That was Blackmore's last breath and here, finally, they decided to leave Blackmore behind! I repeat it, that's why this thing finally gets something on his own way.\n\n\"Out of Hand\" and \"Hell to Pay\" are both nice pieces of classic hard rock. Specially the latter. With a bombastic beat by Ian Paice, an excellent drummer during his whole career, and some catchy rythmical moments and choruses, you can actually feel the soul of Deep Purple growing on your ears. Gillan cannot reach his legendary tone of voice anymore, but with effort and versatility makes the thing work and gets on the march. \"Bodyline\" slows the beat a little, it belongs more to the Gillan's solo era, maybe from \"One Eye to Morocco\" or something like it, at least in the atmosphere and the sound. Weaker, slightly, when comparing with the rest of the album, but solid.\n\nBetween two kinda instrumental and conceptual songs, dedicated to John Lord: \"Above and Beyond\" and \"Uncommon Man\" -both showcasting Don Airey's versatility and multichromatic taste in his Hammond abilities, with some profound (yeah, get this) lyrics written by Gillan, who sings in a nice tune in here- we get one of the highlight moments of the album. \"Blood From a Stone\" with its title sounds epic by itself. Starts atmospheric, rooted in progressive moods and a slow rythm, grows in range and power slowly, specially thanks to a solid groundwork of Glover and Morse in the bass chording. It's not metal, it's not hard rock, it's not progressive. It's a song by Deep Purple, with an unique definition, an unique body and a gorgeous sound. And above all, with a supreme feeling of freedom, independence. Doing something great without looking back and giving explanations. A rock song, breathtaking and sufficiently hard. Enough said.\n\nThen, the singles of the album comes to close the event in a multifashioned way. \"All the Time in the World\" is kinda funky, kinda bluesy, kinda easy going. It's a speech about themselves? Yeah, they do have lots of time to make it even better than this. Airey is the man here, doing the paste between the rest of the members playing this moody and mainstream-appealing song, entertaining.\n\nBut the final slice of magic belongs to \"Vincent Price\". That monster riff made by Morse, the intro and hammond-rocking by Airey, Gillan giving some of his finest moments in a long time, Glover and Paice with solid lines driving the beat all behind. It simply rocks you out of your head. Morse's solo here reflects his style just perfectly. In the other songs, we did it good, ethereal and spacey. But here he reflects purely his style. He is not constricted to forms. He goes for the multi-valence. Doing many things in one place. This solo is sexy, is gloomy and is punchy, when the time comes. So, finally, Morse, as I said before, gets the breathing space he always wanted. With a powerful scream by Gillan, this album comes to an epic finale.\n\nThe album is solid. Not metal by itself. Just a mix of a large variety of rock and roll tastes. Some hard rocking moments, some very progressive ones. Some are groovy and bluesy. But with elegance, with style. With that thing that makes DP one of the finest bands ever. The objection to this album are \"Apres Vous\" and some moments of \"Out of Hand\" and \"Bodyline\". They just feel totally out of place, maybe they were throwback-remakes of \"Rapture of the Deep\" and if you know that album, you can feel it.\n\nBlackmore is gone?! Yes! Finally, they decided to accept that. And \"Now What?!\" gets the respectful treatment, in music, as it deserves. Their finest release since \"The Battle Rages On\" or maybe more. Not close to Deep Purple's glory albums, but it is a worthy descendant. And yes, easily, superior to Black Sabbath's \"13\" -a total dissapointment, coming from Sabbath, but that's stuff for another review-.\n",
        "\nIn the shadows of the legendary In Rock, Deep Purple begins to try some new and interesting things. Experimenting with folk, country and even going back to their roots of the late '60s to add a touch of progressiveness and psychedelic feel to their music. The classic Mk II lineup is back for another go and seem to be more relaxed and bring a simple and laid back musical approach. Everything is here, including Ian Paice's amazing mixture of blues and jazz drumming, along with Ritchie Blackmore shredding on guitars, Ian Gillan's screams on vocals and Roger Glover and Jon Lord (RIP 2012) providing bass and keys. Together they bring the classic Deep Purple sound but still are able to try new things --try new colors.\n\nMasterful singer, Ian Gillian, returns on vocals for another Mk II classic. Aiming for of his silky smooth mid range vocals rather than extreme highs upper mid vocals. This is a appropriate change of style for the new influences and experimenting on this album. \"Fools\" shows greatly Gillan's voice and power that he puts into his vocals. \"No One Came\" takes a new angle by doing more of a 'rhythmic talking' type of thing much like Bob Dylan would do. This works perfectly over the funky groove in the background and makes a terrific track. The title tracks is more of a classic Deep Purple song with some great screams of Gillian and a great display of his range. When it comes to lyrics this album shows a slightly different style of writing. Most of the songs center around death or changing humanity, as seen on tracks like \"Fools\", \"No One Came\" and \"Demon's eyes\". This is a interesting turn for the band to take and are actually written rather nicely. In conclusion, Gillian is great on vocals with his mid range dominate voice. The lyrics fit well with the vocals style and are interesting and catchy to hear.\n\nDrum master Ian Paice is able to show his amazing skills behind the kits well in this new direction. The opening tracks \"Fireball\" starts with a fantastic drum intro like that of Billy Cobham (Miles Davis and Mahavishnu Orchestra). This tracks also features a double bass like feeling with a constant kick drum throughout the song that feel kind of before its time. \"No No No\" and \"No One Came\" also show a great deal of Paice's fantastic mixture of jazz and blues drumming. The drum tone is very much the same from the previous album, which is fine because it seems to be a perfect drum tone for the music they create. Paice is a legendary drummer and though this is probably his weakest drumming of the classic Mk II lineup material, Paice is still able to keep great grooves and catchy rhythms throughout this album.\n\nRitchie Blackmore is on guitars and decides to take a very minimalist approach on this album. Providing some classic rock riffs like on \"No No No\" and \"Demon's Eyes\". These riffs are very blues inspired and are extremely catchy much like the previous album. \"Fools\" shows a very simple and very heavy chord progression riff which is the epitome of rock riffs. \"Anyones Daughter\" is a radically different song from the whole Deep Purple discography. Exchanging heavy riffs and jazz drumming for clean and acoustic guitar mixed with country and folk influences. This song is pretty refreshing to hear and is actually a great song once you get past the dramatic differences from the rest of the band's material. This song is very much like early Bob Dylan in the sense of the vocals and guitar arpeggios in the background. \"No One Came\" is another Bob Dylan like song but mainly because of the vocals. The riff is mainly muted notes but somehow it is extremely catchy and makes a great groove for the organ and drums to jam on. Some solos are on this album and show a more mature and structured style to Blackmore's playing. \"No One Came\" shows a very well constructed solo that makes you think 'that was Ritchie Blackmore????'. The longer track, \"Fools\", has a very great and almost ambient middle section solo that is much like Deep Purples Mk I material. \"The Mule\" also has a great solo with a lot of effects added to it, giving the song a psychedelic feeling. Blackmore is a legend and this album shows a lot of his most mature material and his great rock tone is a great way.\n\nEveryones favorite organ player John Lord returns. Lord is actually kind of overshadowed on most of the tracks, only being dominant in \"No One Came\". His organ on this track is stellar to say the least. The two chords slamming on the muted riffs makes this song extremely catchy and funky. In most of the tracks Lord usually plays a distorted organ to emphasis to Blackmore's guitar which he does a great job at. Lord does show his skills a bit in \"Fireball\", \"No No No\" and \"Demon's Eye\" mostly in the form of a solo or two. The other tracks Lord seems to just play a few simple chord in the background to give the songs a great atmosphere and feeling. He does do a great job with that and when you really think about it he isn't really absent at all on this album, but instead he is applying his playing in a new way. Other than organ playing Lord does a neat piano part on the country inspired \"Anyones Daughter\" that is rather nice. Lord is a great organ player and though his playing is less up front than usual, he does set a great mood throughout this album.\n\nThis is the part where I talk about Roger Glover and his bass playing but I'm pretty sure he didn't even record on this album at all. The only audible bass is on \"Anyones Daughter\" which is actually pretty good, but aside from that where is Mr. Glover? Bass was never a big part of Deep Purples music so this doesn't really bother me that much but i mean come on, at least give me something! Instead if you want to actually hear some of Glover playing I recommend you hear Perfect Strangers.\n\nIn the end Fireball is one of Deep Purples most experimental and brave albums. Combining psychedelic, country, and folk influences into their music, Deep Purple makes another classic album that is usually overlook by In Rock and Machine Head. Which is a shame, because Blackmore's riffs, Gillan's voice, and Paices drumming are fantastic in this new direction. This album should be checked out by any Deep Purple fan looking for a new shade of Deep Purple.\n",
        "\nI had my own reserves and fears when I was about to get this album, five years ago. Many doubts were on my mind. Am I gonna listen to Blackmore hitting it? Or will he be just mumbling and staying on the nonsense, as he already got into his mind the Rainbow Rising with RJD?? Will Coverdale and Hughes be up to the point of Purple greatness, as we all know, DP always shattered everyone with their live performances, unique, unmatchable games of virtuosity, improvisation, versatility and madness? Even, will be Jon Lord and Ian Paice, always solid performers, standing up  enough for playing the thunder?\n\nI was really afraid. DP legendary reputation in live performances (with Ritchie Blackmore on stage) is unquestionable. 1970's concert with the London Symphony is a magic thing. Made in Japan is beyond any reach in terms of heavy metal live performing. The California Jamming shows us the band in their peak of power. Two or three more albums of the era are the confirmation of this and I wasn't ready for a great dissapointment.\n\nIn any case, my curiosity and insane Purple fan collectionist gene made me buy it. And I must say it is one of the finest hidden jewels in DP's catalogue. Here, we taste a bunch of the finest versions ever made of some of the MKIII classics and I know what I'm saying because, about Deep Purple, I know everything.\n\nWe get a slashing strike on the face with the most clean and strong version of Burn ever made. The solos are pure, specially the one by Maestro Jon Lord, who usually, never matches in live performances the power of his original solo. Here, at least once, he is up to it. (R.I.P. dear Jon, by the way, you genious!). And of course, if god himself, Mr. Blackmore, is in a good mood and hitting all the notes, we have an instant winner. But the magic trick comes, in first place, with Paicey breaking it so relentless. I wonder how his drums are up to stand a full live performance the way Ian beats them. It's insane. The second thing is the vocal duet. Hughes (a not very metal-suited bassist, that can be easily noted) and Coverdale mix their voices in the exact ammount. Speed and early power metal at its best. That's it. And the magic trick doesn't stops here, because in Stormbringer we get, as well, the finest live performance ever of this particular song. And it's all about a perfect timing between Lord and RB, they fill the atmosphere and that's why this thing will metal up your ass. Magic, magic, magic.\n\nOne of a kind moment: Gypsy. And yes, fellows. One of a kind. The vocals rules here, but Ritchie Blackmore, man, that guy in black clothes, he simply outrocks every guitarist in the world. Feel his solo here, feel it carefully. Have a taste of those simply-sounding but actually, enigmatic and tricky keys performed by those fingers and you will understand.\n\nLady Double Dealer meets his beat. Crafted for a display of rock n roll and speed metal power, this song does it well. That riff, man. That riff.\n\nAnyway, from here on, we got a couple of well known ones in MKIII history. Mistreated (with that particular moment when Ritchie, just before the entrance of Coverdale and the lyrics, misses the point) and You Fool no One. Both are heavy, solid and a pathway for proving, once more, why Ritchie Blackmore is unmatchable, why the sound achieved by Maestro Lord and his keyboards is unique and why Ian Paice is known for being one of the most gifted drummers ever. These numbers are as good as other ones which can be found in other live albums, excellent moments.\n\nThe particular vocal style featured here for Smoke and Space Truckin' is also something of a kind. Coverdale and Hughes managed to give, for these two \"very MKII\" songs an own style and they do it very well. This was hinted already in the \"Live at London 1974\" album, but here reaches its peak. If you want to listen a different version of that classic song made by that portentous riff, give it a try. The same happens with the other song.\n\nAfter the long Space Jam, we get to the weaker moments of the album. Getting Down and Highway Star. Simply because the first one is not bombastic enough for joining the lively and powerful Purple rage. And the second, because, well, even if with the prior couple of songs from Machine Head Coverdale and Hughes were able enough to make them work in their style, this classic metal piece requires more than a vocal duet with a funky touch. They lacked, even being two guys, the enough strength for matching Gillan's majestic voice. And that's it. Another thing: Blackmore steals it. In a good and bad manner. His almost-five-minutes long solo is good (not brilliant) but by doing this whimmy improvisation, he prevented us from listening what Jon Lord had to offer. Considering that he actually matched it here with Burn, maybe he could amazed us here. In any case, it's Blackmore soloing and that's more than enough.\n\nNow is about to be released a remastered version of this album with some gifts in it. Go ahead and enjoy the Sounds of Purple Silence, this album which marks the end of an era, the early metal era. This masterpiece must be in your collection.\n",
        "\nIt will dawn on anyone listening to this album that this is not a Deep Purple album. 60% of this line-up having also recorded three consecutive Whitesnake albums, which is as much stability one can expect when thinking of Whitesnake, this could easily be considered as Whitesnake's best album. Plus, two tracks have the word \"Love\" in the title, which is on par with the average Whitesnake album. \n\nA few interesting facts became known through the years and shed light on this album's composition and overall sound. \n\nThe album opens on a weak note. The opening track is more or less a filler song, entirely written and recorded after Hughes was sent to rehab. Hence the low sounding back vocals performed by Bolin (ref. Hughes' interview on excellent documentary: Gettin' Tighter The untold story of the 1975/1976 MKIV World Tour). The track in question, \"Comin' Home\", doesn't sound anything like Deep Purple and is probably the most generic song ever recorded under the Purple name, even the \"Slaves And Masters\" stuff has at least the late Rainbow sound. It lyrically evokes the great American rock and roll tradition, just like \"Speed King\" did on \"In Rock\" - but contrary to the fresh Hendrix influenced Mk II era, this music is so generic and formulaic it makes the whole thing almost sinister. It is sad to see Purple auto-referencing themselves to a previous line-up, while they were referencing American music. Why lead the album with such a song ? To state that with Bolin, an American, now in the band, they were taking a turn towards \"American\" music ?\n\nThe album is noteworthy for the greatest Hughes/Coverdale duet: \"You keep on moving\", which was written before things started falling apart, back during the \"Burn\" sessions. It tops off \"Gypsy\", of previous album.\n\nThere are a few Bolin solo songs with some input by Coverdale (lyrics) that Bolin himself probably didn't think good enough for his solo album, which was recorded only a few months before \"Come Taste the Band\". Worse, there is a song entirely written by Bolin's long time friend and ex-bandmate Jeff Cook, \"Lady Luck\". Though it got the Coverdale lyrical treatment, it doesn't sound like Deep Purple. One wonders why it didn't end up on one of Bolin's solo albums, which both contained many Jeff Cook songs. Maybe it was not deemed good enough for Bolin by Bolin himself ? Still more enjoyable than the opening track, and Coverdale would recycle the title again (though not the song) in the late 80s with Whitesnake.\n\nSide B is much better than side A. For instance, \"Drifter\" has an amazing intro, groove, guitar solo and great blues vocals by Coverdale, though relying heavily on blues clich\u00e9s as usual. \"Love Child\" has a very good groove as well (bass punches between vocal lines) and works very well live. The highlight of side A is \"Gettin' Tighter\", is the only song written entirely by Hughes and Bolin. Hearing Hughes' vocals is refreshing at this point on the album, and the lyrics optimistically document how they wished things were getting between the band (live and otherwise).\n\nLord's only credited writing contribution is on \"This Time Around\", an interesting personal number by Hughes. It evolves in an instrumental called \"Owed to 'G'\", a vehicle for solos and live improvs, as \"Mandrake Root\" and \"The Mule\" have been in the past, or \"Contact Lost\" more recently. \n\nRehearsal recordings from a few months prior to making the album (and to making Bolin's first solo album) later made available show that Coverdale had already begun working on a ballad (\"Say You Love Me\") that would end up on his second solo album, \"Northwinds\", so we know the song existed but was not considered for this album. \n\nOn the following tour, Purple added a few songs from Bolin's first solo album \"Teaser\" in the live set, released pretty much at the same time as \"Come Taste The Band\", namely \"Wild Dogs\" and \"Homeward Strut\". This makes the album even more confusing; why did some Bolin/Cook songs end up as Deep Purple and some others as Bolin solo, and why did they play so much from Bolin's solo albums and butchered Mk II live, not to mention unending improv sessions (sadly not as inspired as during the Mk II era) and revisited classics (\"Not Fade Away\", \"Going Down\", \"Georgia on my Mind\") often ruined by Hughes' screaming ? I think it was clear to anyone in the band that this album was weak, and it seems that since they had prevented Bolin from promoting his own album, they had to let him play some of it during live shows. Clearly, Lord and Paice were losing interest and have revealed in subsequent interviews that they should have left at the same time as Blackmore. It all shows on the album.\n\nMk III albums \"Burn\" and \"Stormbringer\" also lacked cohesion and/or had their weak spots; but they had something which this album lacks (well two things, one being Ritchie Blackmore): a killer opening/title track. This album begins with a generic track and only manages to work its way halfway upwards, barely recovering by the time it ends.\n\nStill, not the worst Deep Purple album to listen to, to this day. Anyone enjoying this should also seek out Bolin's solo albums, early Whitesnake and David Coverdale solo. Actually, Bolin's first solo album (\"Teaser\") should be sold together with this one, for everyone to see what Mk IV Purple could have been if Bolin had been 100% concentrated on the band.\n",
        "\nThat album cover is one of the worst I've ever seen in my entire life. And, you know, I've seen lots...\n\nI promised myself not to write a review about this album, the harassed and bullied \"Slaves and Masters\". But I couldn't resist myself and here you got me, bashing the worst release of one of my top-3 favourite bands in heavy metal. Yeah, I did say \"the worst\" and it is the worst one, forget about Bolin's tragical death after \"Come Taste the Band\", ancient hippie oriented psychedelia in the late 60's with hit singles like \"Hush\". Let go the idea that, since Purpendicular, Deep Purple released a succesion of bad records, cause that's not entirely true (Bananas and Rapture of the Deep are respectable, though distant from those magic grooves made by the MK II and some portions of Coverdale/Hughes era). This one, no other but this one, is THE VERY VERY WORST album by DP.\n\nI mean, here you can find a song with the devious and terrible title \"Love Conquers All\". Even for that australian duo Air Supply, those guys singing extremely pink and mellow cursi love songs would be embarassed to put this on a track. But, hey, DP did it, as they created heavy metal, they made the finest metal album ever and stuff. You know, Ritchie, my dear one, the only moment in my entire life when I said \"Blackmore Sucks\" was, precisely, after listening to this. Because we are all quite aware that this record was a whim of yours, and the good guys, Lord, Glover, Paice and Turner did their best, as they are very talented, to make this thing work... But, you know, Blackmore is a human after all...\n\nI've been mistreated! I've been abused!\n\nBelieve me, darling, that's exactly what happens when every fan of heavy metal or Deep Purple, most particularly, listens to this. The fan starts to scream loud \"I've been mistreated, I've been abused\" and it comes from the bottom of the heart. It actually happens, give it a try. This thing is truly painful and you got no choice but to remember better times.\n\nEven if we forget that this was made by Deep Purple and we think it was crafted by Foreigner, White Lion or even, to get even worst, Celine Dion, the content here sucks so much that it makes you believe that Dio's stomach adenocarcinoma started to grow right after he listened to this. I bet *insert ammount of money here* of dollars that you can't find some lyrics more stupid and dramatically mellow, clich\u00e9 and oriented as the ones you get in \"Fire in the Basement\". Mix that with a weak and uninspired melody and there you get an example of how bad this thing is.\n\n\"You've got it bad, you're hopelessly addicted\nYou're always searching for the cure\nLove is the crime, you stand convicted\nYou keep on coming back for more\" (\"Too Much is not Enough\" - Fragment)\n\nMein gott!! Read that?? Am I getting clear enough to explain how lame this have got?? Add to those lyrics some gutless and flat rythmical lines and melodies and you will understand. It Is not bad to talk about love, mind you. The bad thing is to do it in this pathetic way. What happened with Deep Purple, those five guys in that live album \"Made in Japan\", filled with heavy metal power?? What happened with Ritchie Blackmore, the guy who smashed cameras, exploded equipment during massive live shows without giving a fuck about anything while he was fretting his guitar like no one else in this world ever did, does or will do. That guy here is posessed by a dark spirit (the same one who owns him now in Blackmore's Night, but with a little more dignity) and perhaps is even reflected in the cover picture. No doubt that spirit has the shape of a woman.\n\nMaybe the formula is not that bad with a couple of songs, like \"Fortuneteller\" or \"King of Dreams\", pieces where the band remembers its real identity as metal (or hard rock, in this case) gods and throw us a couple of enjoyable songs ala AOR, like JLT Rainbow era (which is just slightly inferior to Dio's era of early epic power metal, in some places), with not so silly lyrics and some nice additions in the instrumentation, most of them by Maestro Lord. Link to these ones \"The Cut Runs Deep\", which contains the only riff to be remembered by Ritchie in this album (a good one, by the way) with some intrincate keyboarding lines and ballsy beats and, there you go, a good track (not excellent, good). Joe Lynn Turner does what he can but we all know he was not suitable for the job. And that's all we can say about him in this review, period.\n\nAnd then, simply, there is nothing and I mean nothing to be highlighted here in the rest of this album. It is wrongdoing at maximum of the expressions. A non-suited vocalist with a terrible art cover and pathetic lyrics with no sense of creative music and there you go: \"Slaves and Masters\", a vomit by Blackmore, cause he can puke as well as every mortal does. For some fragments of \"Fortuneteller\" and \"King of Dreams\" and the riff and keyboarding at \"The Cut Runs Deep\", I give to this album 10 points. Because it is Deep Purple, they got some 20 extra points. And one extra point for actually recording some of the most pathetic lines ever sung in the rock world (\"Love Conquers All\" et al.). That should recieve some credit too.\n\nGet away from this thing.\n",
        "\nThree reviewers, some of them very respected ones in the MA's community, already explained the gorgeousness of Perfect Strangers, as well as I did it with my own review of that album in a short way. Now, for the sake of the things, happens that after such a crusher comeback with lots of moneymaking and several praise for the \"return of the metal gods\" and stuff we must remark once more the failure committed with The House of Blue Light.\n\nWe don't know what's up with Deep Purple, sometimes. I mean, \u00bfdon't they have enough money in their accounts for dropping out AOR please-buy-me-we-are-kinda-sold-outs albums like this one? Because, well, when we compare this with the primary bad album of the band, Who do We Think We Are, there are lots of similarities with a subtle difference. They are like the same in terms of the objective pursued. Money making, easy money making without efforting. That's why, nowadays, WDWTWA gets totally bashed in between the majestic early metal trio of albums before that one and, later, the release of Made in Japan and Burn. That album, simply, does not belong.\n\nSame happens here. After the brilliant traditional metal comeback with Perfect Strangers, THOBL is a total wreck in terms of musical greatness. When we talk about sales, this probably got lots of attention from AOR audiences and made enough money to make the things ongoing. Nice charting in North America, great charting in Europe and Asia and stuff. But nothing more. And that's it. This release is a historical evidence that such a tremendous band like Deep Purple can do wrong, and do it almost twice.\n\nWhy am I saying \"almost twice\" and not simply \"twice\"? Because in \"Who do We Think We Are\" they have done moneymaking but, somehow, within the limits of integrity, trying to do American Friendly Rock with some touches of \"heaviness\" in it, and not so desperately trying to suck the tit but with some blood in the face to look themselves good enough to do mediocre albums at least once. But \"The House of Blue Light\" is not a mediocre, but a BAD album in terms of hard rock and traditional metal. \n\nThe production is superb, the musicianship, mind you, is great as well. The things that are wrong here are the songs and nothing more, nothing less. In the previous album, there were three \"hit\" songs: Knocking at your Back Door, Nobody's Home and Perfect Strangers. In those ones, the power of DP's commercial hard rock can be felt, you can taste the goods, the masterful singing by Gillan, the unique game of bass/drumming shred by Glover and Paice and, of course, Jon Lord providing delicious and guitaresque licks of his keyboards, well followed by the String Sorcerer, Ritchie Blackmore, mostly in the rythmic zone. Compare this with the singles in \"The House of Blue Light\", Call of the Wild and Bad Attitude and you will easily understand what I'm talking about.\n\nAnd let's not even enter in deep analysis of the rest of both records. In Perfect Strangers, Blackmore shreds almost everywhere, followed by Lord. Gillan sings as a metal performer, Glover and Paice beat away the irons. In The House of Blue Light, well, this is around 70 percent lower, with the attempt of doing it extremely easy to digest for non-metal ears. The result is terrible, weak, unworthy of Deep Purple's majestic legacy.\n\nThe songs here are boring, gutless, without emotion. The Spanish Archer would be the most aggressive one, with Bad Attitude, and well, you know, gets short, falls weak into a deep hollow in comparison with other masterpieces by the band. In this record, almost nothing is good enough to take, for example, and mix is alongside the millions of compilations or the powerful live albums made by the band. I mean, seriously, \"take a look to these dirty hands\" and you will figure out. Nowhere is the magic, nowhere is the evergreen riff, nowhere is the brainmelter solo. It's hollow, it's light, as the title says.\n\nSo, in case you can find this album lingering around, bypass it. Only if you already have the other ones, go ahead and buy it, just for the sake of collectionists.\n",
        "\nThe evolution of heavy metal, Black Sabbath and Deep Purple crafted most of what would later become the oficial morphemas of the mother genre. Sabbath gave birth to the first heavy metal songs, while DP made, with \"Deep Purple in Rock\", the first wholly metal album.\n\nBut, anyway, getting away from all those historic conventions, what about this album, which is like the watershed of a lively period in which Deep Purple was the most revered and powerful band in the world?\n\nThe thing is, probably and debatably, as follows: after the coincidence achieved with \"Hush\", a top 5 single in North America and respectable sales of Deep Purple's debut album, the first mark of the band, with the progressive and psychodelic sounds under the elbow, attempted to reproduce the brief sucess achieved by the band, but without reaching it. In Europe, moreover, they were well unknown. The thing was going bad and Blackmore decided to shake off everything and led the band to a different direction.\n\nA long struggle took place between the second semester of 1969 and the first semester of 1972, when DP Mk II reached its peak of popularity.\n\nGillan and Glover replaced Evans and Simper and, as well, the band left away the ancient sounds of progressive psychedelia for the pumping power of the guitars, bass and drums. The result of all this, as said before, was the birth of the first heavy metal album in the history: Deep Purple in Rock (this can be debated, certainly) and it was a huge seller in Europe and Japan, well followed by Fireball, created swiftly to maximize sells, but a great and kinda forgotten album. This two releases resurrected DP's image worldwide and with \"Machine Head\", the american market finally plunged at Deep Purple's feet. Made in Japan was the confirmation of this (and many more things). No other band was more powerful than DP.\n\nBut, what was it, then? Well, it goes like this. Gillan and Blackmore couldn't stand together anymore and the band, far from producing new and mighty metal ideas, was a constant ego battlefield. After a long tribulation, Gillan decided to leave but before that, they released this \"Who do We Think We Are\".\n\nWhat can we say about the album? Well, first of all, the monetary impulse and idea of it can be felt everywhere. With huge sellers in US, like Machine Head or Made in Japan, this one came for sucking til the last drop of milk from the tit before the thing blows off. The guys quickly made a song for matching Smoke on the Water's hitting and there you got \"Woman from Tokyo\", the only slightly remarkable track here. The rest is pure and total filler.\n\nIt's still, in any case, a total mistery to figure out how, from such a tremendous blaster forces like the albums cited above, the band could have fall into this American Friendly Rock kind of stuff?? That's a deep enigma, maybe there will be no answer ever. But the thing is that \"Who do We Think We Are\" sold millions and, at least commercially, worked out (only for its time, because now its probably the minor seller in Deep Purple's 70s catalogue). Nevertheless, there was to be a dead end for MK II. \n\nCertainly, in the hands of Foghat, Lynrd Skynrd or a band such as, this would have been a total masterpiece. But we are talking about Deep Purple, the freakin' crafters of early speed, power and melodic metal!! You know, Super Trouper, Place in Line, those are american style rock songs, AOR if you like. Robert Plant and Jimmy Page could have, probably, made of this things mainstream classics, but with Blackmore without doing wizard technicalities in the guitar, with Mr. Lord without magic and Gillan shouting like a pop singer this album can't work for DP.\n\nMary Long is NOT a blood brother of Pictures of Home. Rat Rat Blue is far away from Hard Lovin' Man. Smooth Dancer has nothing to do with Fools. And that's it. This album is made with easy light rockers which are flickers of easy beat radio station songs and not the brain eater metal monsters of the early MK II days. This tracks are a kinda return to the MK I roots, but without the psychedelia and with Mr. Lord far asleep doing ear friendly sounds with his keyboards, not the intrincate and dark solos of the late 60s.\n\nSo, for finishing, \"Who do We Think We Are\" is not a worthy descendant of the majestic productions made before by Blackmore, Gillan, Glover, Lord and Paice. It was made for profitting, for making easy money and for leaving away with a solvent bank account and not for creating new sounds, not for amazing with blaster solos, ruthless singing or solid and aggressive bass/drums lines. This thing is a forgettable moneymaker, only worthy for having the latent talent of the creators of the album and the name that carries the band. Nothing more. As an historical piece, you can totally have this. As a lover of early AOR, give it a try. But as a heavy metal definer, this album is a wreck. And that's all, folks.\n",
        "\nWhen you thought it was it for DP after MKII breaking up in 1973, the founding trio led by Blackmore, Lord and Paice recruited a couple of new and funny guys to fill the cartier. David Coverdale and Glenn Hughes, while not as great as Gillan and Glover, gave to the band a couple of vivid, powerful and remarkable shows to be forever reminded for both fans, metalheads and lovers of rock music in general.\n\nWe've got a taste of the, seemingsly infinite, power of Deep Purple back in 1972, when Made in Japan started to burst its unmatchable and everlasting light for heavy metal. More of the same was to be put on in the famous California Jam. And now, with \"Stormbringer\" recently released, DP was going further into their deep ocean of early metal.\n\nLong jams, virtuosity, shredding, shocking power, that was all about DP. Even if Blackmore was getting bored and lonesome in thoughts, overcomed by the little dudes, Coverdale and Hughes, that got too big to control, Made in Europe is clear evidence of the magical attributes, the legendary status of the band's blasting live performances. Every single minute of them, playing loud and clear over a stage was a bliss and a joy. No other band in the world could match them. And that's it, period. \n\nThis album is more of the same. More evidence proving Deep Purple's major ability to display might and magic over the scenario. Listen to Blackmore's riffing through all the record. He was on a light, firescorching every available fret. Mr. Lord (rot in pieces) never sounded so technical, vivid and full of joy (with the possible exception of MKII first comeback), he was at the zenith of his keyboarding, filling all the atmospheres. Paicey will forever be a favourite in drumming for his fast and very felt playing and with Coverdale and Hughes completely established in the band, the ancient linage of DP's major live performances was correctly continued.\n\nThe five songs here are tremendous: The blatant might of \"Burn\", an early power metal display; the moody and firey \"Mistreated\" with the bluesy touch and heavy feeling; the speedy and breathtaking \"Lady Double Dealer\"; \"You Fool no One\", an underrated song which is a pathway for long and amazing improvisations and \"Stormbringer\", a forgotten masterpiece by the band (and in this performance, simply, sounds awesome). Mind you, Ian Gillan refuses to perform any of these five majestic pieces of early metal. Such a shame, considering that they are such an important part in Deep Purple's colorful history. If you had any doubt about these songs in their original albums, here you simply love them, you taste them as an unique plate of the most relapsed delicatessen.\n\nThey sound so tight in here! This is almost as good as Made in Japan. There are, though, a couple of little failures which prevent this for having even a higher note. First, there is no interaction with the audience, or the interaction, seems to me, is very little compared with Made in Japan. I mean, in the concerts at Tokyo and Osaka, the crowd was a part of the show, they were alive, they can be felt in any second of it. Here, they sound dull and faded, perhaps because the band simply wanted to do their thing, without thinking a lot about their people. Anyway. Finally, the production, which is somehow inferior compared to MIJ. The sound is a bit duller and sounds kinda hollow. Maybe, it's something about the mix. Nevermind.\n\nSo, after this DP entered in a deep depression. Blackmore left the band and the thing never got the same (until Perfect Strangers). With a little help of Tommy Bolin, Funky Purple was to be formed and, shit happens, you know. In any case, this is a total safe music product. If you enjoy Made in Japan, you will probably enjoy this one, a little bit inferior to the shows in Osaka and Tokyo but with lots of the same power and energy. This is a total safe buy, both for fanboys and any metalhead in general. Go ahead and have this in your collection. You will have no regrets at all.\n",
        "\nThe last Deep Purple album to feature both Ian Gillan and Ritchie Blackmore is unfortunately a pedestrian affair. Former Rainbow singer and Blackmore\u2019s running mate Joe Lynn Turner came into the fold for a spell, but Gillan returned for a final go-around with Blackmore. \u201cThe Battle Rages On\u2026\u201d seems to be long forgotten and for good reason as the band sounds tired and Gillan sounds disinterested.\n\nHowever, the opener and title track leaves a false impression as the battle rages with a strong riff and background keyboards by the great Jon Lord. A melodic chorus and the typical Blackmore guitar solo start the proceedings off on the right foot.\n\nProblems begin immediately with the next track and slither in throughout the rest of the album. \u201cLick it Up\u201d is a straight-up rocker with not one of the most memorable guitar parts and is mediocre by Deep Purple standards. \u201cTalk About Love\u201d and \u201cTime to Kill\u201d suffer from the same banal attributes and the worst part is Gillan sings like he knows these songs are crap.\n\nGillan delivers the most disappointing performance on this record. He sounds like he does not want to be there. The passion and character of his voice is not there. His singing on the next Purple record is way better than his work on here. On the aforementioned \u201cTime to Kill\u201d, his voice sounds tired and the closer \u201cOne Man\u2019s Meat\u201d he is completely emotionless. He at least shows some life and character on the cowboy rocker \u201cRamshackle Man\u201d with some gun-toting vocal lines.\n\nAmidst the boring tripe emerge two Purple gems that save the record from tanking. \u201cAnya\u201d is a beautiful song with maybe some foreshadowing by Blackmore showing where he was headed with his music. The acoustic, midnight fire guitar part transforms into a great riff featuring graceful chorus lines and perfectly conjures up the image of the mystical woman in the song. The other winner is another song about a woman with \u201cSolitaire.\u201d An enchanting, escalating guitar part immediately caught my attention and Gillan sings like a drone. I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s what he was going for, but it goes well with the brooding tone.\n\nIn the end, there is not enough good songwriting and fails to capture the merits of a great band like Deep Purple. Blackmore and Lord do not even trade solos and have any moments together until the eight track \u201cNasty Piece of Work.\u201d Blackmore even rips himself off with \u201cOne Man\u2019s Meat\u201d by taking the main riff from \u201cL.A Connection\u201d and inserting it here. The only time he lets loose with furious riffing and guitar theatrics is with \u201cA Twist in Tale\u201d, which shares similarities with \u201cDead or Alive\u201d from the last Mk II album, but is not as good.\n\nI don\u2019t know if the boys decided to name \u201cThe Battle Rages On\u2026\u201d to describe how Gillan and Blackmore were working together again yet still hated each other, but no listener would win this struggle. On the band side of things, Gillan would win as Blackmore would quit mid-tour and since then he hasn\u2019t looked back. With this final Mk II installment, the title track, the wonderful \u201cAnya\u201d, \u201cSolitaire\u201d, and \u201cRamshackle Man\u201d will provide healthy listens. However, insipid rockers and a tired Gillan drag the album down as the band was clearly waiting for the battle to end.\n\nnicksmetal.blogspot.com\n",
        "\n(In Memoriam: Maestro Jon Lord. Old Uncle of Heavy Metal. Rot in Pieces).\n\nDeep Purple's Mark I is a common point of dissension among fans and rock music scholars (if such a thing exists). For some, it's the seminal line-up, the root of what would become later a major force in traditional heavy metal for some. For others it's an unshaped hybrid with undefined pathways saved by a trio of talented guys (Blackmore, Lord, Paice). It's hard, yes it is, to make a stand and having a definition about this period in such a colourful band, almost as impossible to label as everything else because, hey, we are talking about the grandfathers of heavy metal (with Black Sabbath), if you know what I mean, and so sometimes it's difficult to understand moments like this one in any major band.\n\nThe history of Deep Purple's \"Deep Purple\" is, therefore, a little bit more complicated than the music itself. We must remember that with their debut album, the band obtained quite respectable sales and acclaim, especially in North America thanks to the major hit single \"Hush\". Later, they managed to re-enter the American market with \"Kentucky Woman\", but the tides were changing at that point. Psychedelia and progressive rock felt their decay at the end of the 60's and the sound of the band started to get obsolete.\n\nYet, this album easily can enter at the top line as one of the finest creations in classic progressive rock. Of course, we are in the Metal Archives and this shouldn't matter, but despite this we must admit and recognize the quality of this album. It's filled with inventiveness, creativity, and a sight of joy. The keyboarding makes the ruling point, driving the whole vehicle, yet the rest of the pieces work it out perfectly. A special mention goes out to Rod Evans who's usually underrated. I won't say he is the ultimate heavy metal singer, not even rock singer, but he fits perfectly with the style issued here, and he would do as well in a band like Iron Butterfly? Did? Didn't? Anyway, never mind.\n\nThe only bad stuff here would be the lack of \"freshness\", if there's any term. While DP do sound innovative and creative here, from time to time you get bored, or at least you say something like \"hey, this is great, but I've heard it before\". Weird? I bet, but it actually happens and it is funny because eventually the album grows on you and you figure out that, overall, it is great. Solid, creative, vivid...maybe, it repeats itself too much, but that's a forgivable mistake and in terms of Deep Purple Mk I, this would be their finest hour.\n\nRemarkable songs among the nice average are 'Chasing Shadows', 'The Bird has Flown', 'April', and 'Why Didn't Rosemary'. And more than that, maybe they could put 'Chasing Shadows' or 'The Bird has Flown' into their nowadays-set list, cause those are very good, indeed. But you know, Gillan has strong opinions about songs he didn't write with DP (i.e. Burn or Stormbringer), but that's not our business, is it?\n",
        "\nAfter the famed Mark II lineup of Deep Purple came back together, all felt right again and they delivered an all-time classic in \u201cPerfect Strangers.\u201d Grand record sales and a successful tour ensued and they churned another album, but this time a bit uneven in \u201cThe House of Blue Light.\u201d Throughout that time, vocalist Ian Gillan and guitarist Ritchie Blackmore decided they didn\u2019t like each other again and now it was time for another incarnation of Deep Purple. Gillan was out and Blackmore turned to the guy he hired to bring his other band Rainbow commercial success, Joe Lynn Turner. Essentially, this was now a band mixed like a pack of Skittles. Bassist Roger Glover also played with Rainbow as Ian Paice and Jon Lord were the only members not to ride the spectrum.\n\nIn essence, this album is a mix of material that could be found on the last albums of Rainbow and also songs that still fight with the Deep Purple spirit. The opener \u201cKing of Dreams\u201d has thumping keyboards and mystical guitars that suit Turner\u2019s voice perfectly. In fact, Turner puts some of the strongest performances on this album.\n\nTurner receives some unfair criticism at times about his voice and while he can croon with the best of them, he knows when to insert attitude and enhance the songs. \u201cFire in the Basement\u201d has the blend of attitude and sharp singing that is also one of the stronger cuts on the album. \u201cTruth Hurts\u201d has Turner oozing emotion that is a combination of one of Purple\u2019s best songs from the David Coverdale and Glenn Hughes years in \u201cMistreated\u201d and Rainbow\u2019s \u201cCan\u2019t Let You Go.\u201d The team of Turner and the melancholic rhythm sparked by the bass and keyboard make for a great song.\n\nMusically, Blackmore shows bite with his guitar work on the closer \u201cWicked Ways\u201d with a driving rhythm and a nice touch of the violin sprinkled in to deliver a more striking gesture. \u201cThe Cut Runs Deep\u201d did not connect with me the first couple times I listened to it, mostly because of the awful sounding voice shouting \u201cthe cut runs deep.\u201d Otherwise, the guitar effects and the drumming make it a winner. \u201cFortuneteller\u201d has a brooding, mysterious atmosphere about a lady who wields the cards of the future. The bombast of the chorus and the string of keyboard notes further add to the aura and is a very memorable song. \n\nIt\u2019s unfortunate that all the songs could not be as good as \u201cBreakfast in Bed\u201d tries to sound like \u201cLazy\u201d in the beginning with the keyboard, but quickly devolves into an inoffensive, AOR that is rather underwhelming. However, when \u201cLove Conquers All\u201d hits, I found myself in a true face-palm moment. Deep Purple doing a power ballad? Say it ain\u2019t so. Deep Purple is much better than this and for them to try to hop on that train for more success is pathetic. Needless to say, the song is super cheesy and super sucks. The last bit of badness arrives in the form of the commercial, poppy \u201cToo Much is not Enough.\u201d It sounds like a Rainbow reject and I had enough after one listen. \n\n\u201cSlaves and Masters\u201d is a solid Deep Purple album and Turner provides energy to a band that lost some spark with the last effort \u201cThe House of Blue Light.\u201d I can\u2019t see Gillan singing the material on the album, let alone the power ballad, but that\u2019s a good aspect as Turner was not forced to sing something that may not have been comfortable for him. \u201cWicked Ways\u201d, \u201cFortuneteller\u201d and \u201cFire in the Basement\u201d provide incentives for repeated listens and enjoy yet another version of Deep Purple.\n\nnicksmetal.blogspot.com\n",
        "\n\u201cPerfect Strangers\u201d was a stellar comeback album for Deep Purple. The return of the famed Mark II lineup did not disappoint as Ritchie Blackmore\u2019s familiar leads and Ian Gillan\u2019s vocals were back together and it just felt \u201cright.\u201d The album would be a huge success for the band commercially and critically, but now they had the challenge of trying to match the greatness of \u201cPerfect Strangers.\u201d\n\nUltimately, the songwriting is not as strong and the songs are less memorable in the blue house. There are also a couple instances of bad moments like the lame lyrics and uninspiring chorus of \u201cThe Unwritten Law\u201d and the biggest offender in the poppy \u201cCall of the Wild.\u201d During the track, Ian Gillan sings \u201coperator, this is the call of the wild.\u201d I don\u2019t know how Gillan could manage a straight face singing that cheesy line, but I give him credit for doing so. Thankfully, those are the only painful moments lyrically.\n\nOn the musical side, there are a couple stellar tracks to be found. The opener, \u201cBad Attitude\u201d has all the ingredients of great song. The epic keyboard opening by Jon Lord, a pounding rhythm of drums and bass by Ian Paice and Roger Glover, a strong vocal performance, and of course a memorable solo by the esteemed Blackmore. The keyboard ending by Lord too is very catchy and all in all a grade A song. \u201cMad Dog\u201d is a riff driven song with a riff that will stick in your head for days and showcases some more theatrics from Lord and an awesome Blackmore solo to close it. The other two great songs are \u201cThe Spanish Archer\u201d and the closer \u201cDead or Alive.\u201d The former features an adventurous desperation in the guitar and showcases Blackmore at his finest as he just wails and bends the notes at the perfect times. The clarity in Gillan\u2019s voice almost serves as a calming presence due to the nature of the song. The latter ups the tempo with the characteristics being similar to \u201cBurn\u201d as the musicians keep going at it with the solos and do not let it up.\n\nHowever, the quality drops with some tunes that are different from what listeners expect from Deep Purple. \u201cBlack and White\u201d utilizes the harmonica and the song sounds like something you would hear in a movie during a bar brawl. I like the bass line by Glover, but overall the track does not have that purple charm one would expect. \u201cMitzi Dupree\u201d has a lounge band type feel with a strong vocal performance by Gillan to keep me interested. The song has a certain charm, but it may turn others off. A track that could have been great, but fails in a couple areas is \u201cStrangeways.\u201d The tickling of the piano creates a mysterious atmosphere, but is thrown out when the chorus comes in and breaks the mood of the song. It does not help that the song runs too long either.\n\nWhat made \u201cPerfect Strangers\u201d great is that the band was on a mission to rock and show they still got it. The songs kept coming at you and provided an experience you wanted to return to. \u201cThe House of Blue Light\u201d wavers between its sounds and it does not help when the second and third songs are stinkers in \u201cThe Unwritten Law\u201d and \u201cCall of the Wild.\u201d The guys find their legs in the best song on the album \u201cBad Attitude\u201d, \u201cMad Dog\u201d, and \u201cDead or Alive.\u201d While the stay at the house might not be the most comfortable, it certainly will not leave you feeling cold. \n\nnicksmetal.blogspot.com\n",
        "\nWhen Deep Purple lost its shade after \u201cCome Taste the Band\u201d; it was the perfect time for the band to end. The Mark IV lineup with new guitarist Tommy Bolin provided an album that didn\u2019t live up to the Deep Purple name with the simplified songs and a huge blues influence. By 1984, the stars had aligned for the famed Mark II lineup to comeback. Ian Gillan had just finished his stint with Black Sabbath and Ritchie Blackmore\u2019s Rainbow had reached the end of the spectrum. Bassist Roger Glover, master of the ivories Jon Lord, and drummer Ian Paice were all back on board to give the fans what they craved; the Mark II lineup back in action.\n\nThe boys do not disappoint either delivering a great dose of hard rocking tunes and Blackmore once again regaining his edge after some poppy Rainbow albums. Songs like \u201cKnockin\u2019 at Your Back Door\u201d and the well-known title track will stick in your head for days. Blackmore shows his knack for writing memorable riffs and to highlight a solo with the former and the title track is a great piece of songwriting with an awesome keyboard intro and a soulful vocal performance by Gillen.\n\nThere are no tricks or venturing of the purple mark on this record as any listener can tell how the guys were rejuvenated and genuinely happy being back together again. The neoclassical meanderings of \u201cHungry Daze\u201d and the up-tempo, keyboard driven \u201cGypsy\u2019s Kiss\u201d are reminders of just how good these musicians are and the music they create. My version also has \u201cNot Responsible\u201d which reminds me of \u201cA Light in the Black\u201d from the famed Rainbow \u201cRising\u201d album and that certainly is not a bad thing.\n\nThe only misstep is the ballad \u201cWasted Sunsets.\u201d While I adore Blackmore\u2019s guitar performance, the songs does not fit in with the rest of the album and breaks up the rocking, no-holds-barred pacing that was carrying on. The song is also not that good and the least memorable. Some flack is also given to \u201cMean Streak\u201d for the lame chorus, but that is more of a minor quip than anything.\n\n\u201cPerfect Strangers\u201d is the definitive example of a comeback album not being a failure. In fact, this is one of the best Purple releases. The songs are full of inspiring writing, memorable songs, and the formidable tandem of Lord and Blackmore dueling with the keyboard and guitar. \u201cKnockin\u2019 at Your Back Door\u201d and the title track will keep you coming back for more because this is how a comeback should be.\n\nnicksmetal.blogspot.com\n",
        "\n1969. 1999. Deep purple has already done twice in their career gigs with an orchestra, integrating classic music tunes in theirs shows. And even if this was well done, it was not really appealing for most hard rock lovers or DP fans, but never before did they simply try to add an orchestra to their \u00abclassic\u00bb set list. Adding this orchestra touch for this tour is what Paice and Gillan call an \u00abaugmentation\u00bb.\n\nThis sounds truly great and really refreshing. This is quite close to a new born for most of the already-heard-1000-times classic DP songs, and just for this, the DVD is recommended to all DP or hard rock fans eager to hear new versions and a sort of rebirth of DP classics.\n\nPerfect Strangers, for example, has never sounded so good in a long time. More like a movie theme than a hard rock stomper, this song gets here really interestingly. The inclusion of Hard Lovin\u2019 Man is an excellent pleasure. This is a great tune and I find here its best live rendition.\n\nThe band is in great shape and seems to really enjoy the experience. The orchestra is involved from the beginning to the end, shining throughout. Its director even gets a chance to shine himself in the last part of Lazy, answering to Morse\u2019s solo with his violin.\n\nIt all feels like a new dawn for Deep Purple. And it feels good. Likely the best DP live in ten or more years.\n",
        "\nIt is very easy to believe that this album would be a failure. Arguably, the main cog of Deep Purple, Ritchie Blackmore left because of his unhappiness towards the more funky, blues based sound the band was beginning to develop on \u201cStormbringer.\u201d The band was just about done after this happened, but vocalist David Coverdale and bassist Glenn Hughes wanted to push on and push on they did when they found guitarist Tommy Bolin to fill in Blackmore\u2019s big shoes. Bolin\u2019s style is more straightforward and has a funky edge to it than the classical leanings of Blackmore. Adding on to that, the cover art is very seventies. I\u2019m sure some people thought it looked \u201chappenin\u2019\u201d and \u201cgroovy\u201d, but seeing the band\u2019s faces plastered in a glass of wine creeps me out a bit.\n\nIt's evidently clear that Coverdale, Hughes, and Bolin had the biggest imprint on this album because it is a lot more bluesy and funky. Songs like \u201cLady Luck\u201d, \u201cI Need Love\u201d, \u201cGettin\u2019 Tighter\u201d have the funky edge and lyrics trying to court the ladies. There is no \u201cChild in Time\u201d or the emotional outreach of \u201cSoldier of Fortune\u201d found on here. In all honesty, I would have reacted better to this album if it was a Whitesnake release rather than a Deep Purple record. It makes sense too because Ian Paice and Jon Lord would join Coverdale in Whitesnake after this.\n\nAmidst all the mid-tempo rockers are some great tracks. The opener, \u201cComin\u2019 Home\u201d, has an upbeat tempo, driving keyboards and guitar, with an energetic performance by Coverdale. The true highlights occur with \u201cThis Time Around\u201d and \u201cOwed to G\u201d as Lord is allowed to show his keyboard skill with an array of notes dancing as Hughes channels his inner Stevie Wonder and busts out an awesome vocal performance. It\u2019s a perfect tune to go strolling through the city streets with. At least, that\u2019s the images that go through my head while listening to it. Another stellar tune is \u201cYou Keep on Moving\u201d with a cool bass line and another inspiring vocal performance by Hughes. The somber tone by Hughes and the keyboards work effectively and the middle part where the music picks up and Coverdale joins in makes for a memorable moment. Bolin closes with a great solo and it makes for a perfect song.\n\nIt\u2019s unfortunate the songs did not become as adventurous as this as \u201cDrifter\u201d and \u201cDealer\u201d meander in mediocrity and fail to conjure anything memorable. However, I have to give an honorable mention to \u201cLove Child.\u201d Besides the goofy title, the opening riff is very catchy and manages to hold my attention throughout the song.\n\n\u201cCome Taste the Band\u201d ends up leaving the listener with a bitter taste. If the band had concentrated their efforts on creating more songs like \u201cComin\u201d Home\u201d and \u201cThis Time Around\u201d it could have been truly special, but unfortunately it fails to live up to its potential. However, it is by no means a bad record. If you are going to purchase this, I highly recommend the 35th Anniversary Edition which features remixes by Glenn Hughes and two studio outtakes where you can hear a Bolin and Paice jam where Bolin wails on the guitar more than he did on the rest of the album and \u201cSame in LA\u201d is a neat keyboard driven rocker. You also get the story of how this lineup was formed, how the songs were put together, and what led to their breakup. Even though as a whole, the taste is sour, there are some fine sips inbetween.\n\nnicksmetal.blogspot.com\n",
        "\nDP released around a silly-on compilation albums, which is totally stupid considering that most of them are made, in the 90%, of the same songs. You can get: Hush, Kentucky Woman, Hallelujah, Black Night, Speed King, Child in Time, Fireball, Strange Kind of Woman, Smoke on the Water, Highway Star, Lazy, Woman From Tokyo, Burn, Mistreated, Stormbringer, Soldier of Fortune, You Keep on Moving and stuff.\n\nIf lucky, in the new kinda of compilation albums you can get eighties Purple and maybe a couple of songs from the nineties and nowadays. It's almost pointless for the collectors to agree with this kind of non-sensical way to waste compilation albums away.\n\nAs a whole, I would strongly recommend to the Metal Archives user to buy DP albums (specially the holy heavy metal trinity: In Rock, Fireball, Machine Head; the brilliant Burn and the masterful Perfect Strangers with a nice touch of Made in Japan) instead of the compilations BUT this one.\n\nPurple Passages is the finest compilation album ever released by DP. And it is a good one because you get all the important facts concerning the \"Roundabout\" MK I. The most important covers they've made with their best songs (not too many) composed in the 1968-1969 period. I can't add more to this, it's a total fair and safe purchase if you liike embryonary Deep Purple, if you can enjoy psychodelic progressive sixties rock and if you are a fan of Evans, as well. \n\nYou can get your \"have it or die\" stock of DP albums (the ones I cited above, maybe a couple more) and, to kill three birds in one shot, get this one for having almost the core notions of DP MK I. No more needed to be added.\n",
        "\nThe Black Sheep of the Family, Ritchie Blackmore, dissapointed of the musical direction the band took and filled with remorse because of the rejection he recieved when he wanted to record some rock classics in Stormbringer, decided to quit the band he created, starting a beautiful episode known for every metalhead as \"Rainbow\".\n\nSuch a big vacancy, maybe the biggest vacancy in the history of heavy metal, was to be filled by the newcomer Tommy Bolin. This guy fitted perfectly into the standards of the mid-talented leaders of the band at that moment, Coverdale and Hughes: he had that funky touch and sounded more conventional than neo-classical and intrincate Blackmore. Being that said and with the influence of Jon Lord and Paicey reduced to nice accesories, Come Taste the Band meets light and gives the finest NON DEEP PURPLE album ever.\n\nYeah, that is. And for the worst, well, almost every song sounds exactly the same. Starting from \"Comin Home\", we believe we are entering a totally new universe in DP. Feeling something that, in a way, sounds familiar because of the previous album but with a different touch and feeling. But at the next song we listen almost the same sound, the same idea, the same style of playing, the same funky groovy AOR oriented sound. The basic question is: \u00bfcan something good be expected from a couple of guys who never quited or never evolved from the short handed funky sounds. If you add a guitar player who does exactly the same thing you are used to do, well, you can't expect new things. Afer listening Stormbringer, all of this sounds like a cheaper and lighter version of it. One after the other, \"Lady Luck\", \"Gettin' Tighter\", \"Dealer\", \"I Need Love\", \"Drifter\", \"Love Child\" and \"This Time Around\" are, maybe faster, maybe slower, maybe funkier, maybe bluesier, the same thing in one way or the other. There are no blast beats by Paicey, there are no atmospheric keyboard soloing, the bass lines are mediocre and usual, there are no magic guitar solos nor blasting riffs (is it possible to match Ritchie's standards?). And the vocals? Well, like Burn but 75% lighter.\n\nListening to this is like to listen an album by Foghat, early Kansas or even Billy Idol to some extent. Is like a more straightforward version of Trapeze or a non-cheesy and a bit funkier style of Whitesnake. But, even more than the previous album, this is not DP. In Stormbringer there were some high points, a little bit of Purple spirit. Here, everything is as dull as the song you've heard before the next one. The only tracks which are in the palette of Deep Purple's greatness are \"You Keep on Moving\" and \"Owed to G\". The latter one is a nice instrumental, ouvre and gr\u00e0ce de Jon Lord. The first one is, maybe, the only remarkable song made by this mediocre mark. The keyboarding and the final solo (the finest ever done by Bolin) are the only salvation spots for this entire album.\n\nAfter a relative success (not so big comparing with the previous albums) of this release, the major heavy metal band of the seventies disbanded. Coverdale took Paice and Lord for Whitesnake while Hughes and Bolin went on different pathways.\n\nDavid Coverdale had a little bit of success with his girly glamish pop rock sometimes hard band, while Hughes attempted a weak passage through BLACK SABBATH (Yikes!, Iommi, what were you thinking? Ah, yeah, a solo album rotten by discographic companies). And the worst part was for Bolin. He tried to replace Blackmore in DP's guitar and he died. Destiny knows why this kind of things happens...\n\nDeep Purple, as I said above, the greatest heavy metal act in the early seventies entered in a profound comma after this album. Fortunately, the gods smiled us all and Mark II returned for bringing the goods once again in Perfect Strangers. But that's another tale.\n",
        "\nAfter delivering the goods in Burn, a couple of mid-talented guys, David Coverdale and Glenn Hughes, thought they could do it even better and started to take control of the issue. This is the point when we start to see the downfall of the finest heavy metal band of its time, alongside Black Sabbath, pioneer of the genre.\n\nIf you wonder why DP took this direction after such a great album, well, it's a mystery, but a common mystery in Purple's history. It happened with Who Do we Think we Are and The House of Blue Light most later. DP had its moments when a kind of a hybrid process took place. The thing is that here, in Stormbringer, we can't know if it is about a negligence from Blackmore, or maybe the guys gave a chance to Coverdale and Hughes to take the poll. Regardless of this, well, the influence of the newbie couple is extremely superior in this release comparing to the earlier one and this gives a different, maybe odd and original, but weak and inferior sound for this release.\n\nThe title track \"Stormbringer\" is the finest hour in the record. Here we get all the ingredients that made DP an unique force in the early heavy metal world. Blackmore's killing riffs and solos, Maestro Lord filling the atmosphere with his keyboarding, Paicey beating the hell out with his drums and, well, Coverdale and Hughes doing what they always should have done: follow the lead by the three guys cited above. The lyric here is, maybe, one of the most violent ones in DP lyrical universe: \"Ride the rainbow, crack the skies; Stormbringer coming, time to die!\" and that stuff, which sets perfectly in the metal world. But, from then on there is nothing more. We shall meet a funky bluesy groovy world beyond anything we have heard and we could have liked from DP.\n\n\"Love Don't Mean a Thing\" is the paradigma for this. Sounds kinda like today's favourite style in Classic Rock stations in America, a song that you would like to listen while driving your vehicle between arid zones and some mountains around Arizona, maybe. But that's not DP! Deep Purple was always about power, seeking and destroying. This could make me sound like a purist, a traditionalist without wishes to accept some changes. But man, if we can criticise Who do We Think We Are, why can't we do the same here, specially if we find almost the same failures?? Same thing happens with \"Holy Man\". Besides of a tender and nice guitar intro by Blackmore, there is nothing more than trying to sound groovy and cool.\n\nThen, we reach the climax with \"Hold On\". To me, the worst song here. And excuse me, because actually is not a bad song. But for DP standards, is no more than a mediocrity. It's like having the same like the previous song, but with more groovyness and wanting even more to sound like 70's rock. Every second later it feels like you are deeply returning through the paths of Who do We Think We Are without Gillan's singing and with more funky in the veins.\n\nThen, \"Lady Double Dealer\" reaches the stage and, unfortunately, fails to explode and lingers, dwells like a dwarf star. It's not as mediocre as the whole album but, in the same time, it does not reach the \"classic\" level of the finest creations by the band. It's obvious, notwithstanding, that here, is Blackmore the one who leads the beat with that powerful riff. But somehow, that's all. Nothing more than a nice riff. Jon Lord is almost vanished and Paice does nothing but to follow the line. So, well, no Purple spirit here.\n\nAgain, a magic riff by Blackmore gives us, maybe, the second nice song in the whole album. \"You Can't do it Right\". Somehow, under Blackmore's fingers in the strings, you are knocking with a smooth paice your head. This song is a personal favourite, without having the usual power and \"metalness\" by DP. If you like bluesy funky groovy rock, well, there you got a masterpiece. Quite enjoyable if you are up to heavier sounds. But, hey, this is not DP!!. Even if you might be singing the chorus all day long, well, this is not DP. The finest thing here is the return of Jon Lord doing his thing. And, well, it has the best shared-lyrical lines by Coverdale and Hughes. Then, a nice intrumental (\"High Ball Shooter\") leads us to \"Gypsy\" and its spacey sound. This one could have been a great song if the Purple spirit was there. But sounds, again, AOR, trying to look cool; sounds again like 70's rock instead of traditional heavy metal.\n\nFinally, the ballad \"Soldier of Fortune\" is a nice shot. The whole collection of ballads by Deep Purple (which is not so big) is good and this piece does not fail to enter in that realm. Not many words to say about it.\n\nSo, when Coverdale and Hughes took the lead (with a little influence, yet, of Blackmore and the rest of the founding members), well, they tried to sound exactly as how most of the popular bands sounded during those days. They tried to sound AOR, and in terms of AOR, this is a brilliant album. But in terms of DP, is no more than a mediocrity, saved only by some lick of influence provided by Blackmore, Lord and Paice. No Purple spirit.\n\nWith the departure of Ritchie Blackmore, the guitar god, and with the leadership of Jon Lord and Ian Paice reduced to something near to the definition of accesories, David Coverdale and Glenn Hughes would almost give a fatal blow to the glorious career of this pioneer band with the next record to come. But that's another tale.\n",
        "\nAfter the almost-deadly strike given by Coverdale/Hughes society in their third record \"Come Taste the Band\", the world thought that was about to be the definitive end of Deep Purple, one of the two (or maybe more) bands who pioneered heavy metal. Sadness and void were attached deeply into the fans. They felt they were forsaken.\n\nAnyway, maybe for monetary reasons and no other one, legendary Mark II was reunited. The event was legendary by itself: Blackmore, Lord and Paice with Gillan and Glover. Yeah, the crowds were going wild waiting for it and screaming loud \"the Metal Gods are Returning\". Like a magic trick, they drop out what would become one of their finest albums ever: Perfect Strangers.\n\nThe main opener alone can be considered a legend: Knocking at Your Back Door, with the unique rubato intro provided by Jon Lord, quickly merges the listener to a very Deep Purple universe. The catchy sex-themed lyrics and the nice beating combination by Paice and Glover makes this piece a forever living classic in the band's repertoire. Also, this piece gives us something different from Mark II. Usually, their opener songs were speedy and powerful, but this one enters in a \"moderato\" level. Anyway, there are no complaints, it is a masterpiece.\n\nRitchie, the String Sorcerer, Blackmore claimed once that his favourite song ever was Under the Gun. I don't remember exactly where or when he said that, but this piece is actually a blast. DP gives us pure traditional heavy metal, with the whole band breaking everything away. Blackmore's performance has some extra points here.\n\nNobody's Home has, as well, some funny lyrics with a catchy chorus. It is almost a recycled tune from \"Burn\" (Lay Down, Stay Down, exactly) and has some heavy metal power on it, besides the catchy spirit it has. The star here is Ian Paice. He is the one who keeps the fire up, who maintains the correct temperature for the thing.\n\nThe fist filler here, Mean Streak, is what we like to name a \"good straightforward rocker\". Maybe, it can sound weak alongside the bunch of powerful tunes here, but somehow manages to survive.\n\nFollowing this, we found a couple of great songs in DP's catalog: Perfect Strangers, the main theme of the album, it doesn't have a Blackmore solo, but there are some rubato-like fragments which are leitmotifs of what happened in Knocking at Your Back Door. Another hit single worldwide and a powerful hard rocking song. Then, Gypsy's Kiss returns us to the heavy metal realms, speedy and joyful. Can you believe me if I tell you that there are, actually, keyboards' riffs?? If you don't, listen to this song. Jon Lord (and Blackmore, of course) gives us a powerful and speedy riff. And the singing, well, remains a bit groovy, but it is heavy metal, it has the heavy metal riffing, beating and style. A great song.\n\nDeep Purple always gives us nice ballads. Wasted Sunsets is not an exception. Are they talking about themselves here? Maybe, maybe not. But is a dark slow piece, the darkest ballad by DP ever.\n\nFor the closing, yeah, an underrated filler by DP: Hungry Daze. Blackmore frets like hell in here, followed by Maestro Lord. But the stars here are Gillan, Glover and Lord. Those thres guys fill the atmosphere of the song, giving a total metal mood, pumping everything away. The bonus track Non Responsible also has the same feeling.\n\nBut, just for the record, the song which is beyond any reach here is Son of Alerik, the bonus track created by Ritchie Blackmore in a jamming session. It has a sublime magic power. Starts with a moody and flowing atmosphere and evolves into a slow dancing vortex, thanks to Blackmore and Lord soloing. A major piece you should enjoy as soon as possible, if you haven't done that before.\n\nYeah, this album is great. It has the heavy metal spirit and beat DP MK II always has with a touch radio friendly tunes. But, hey, we talk about Deep Purple, the guys that took early heavy metal to the grand masses. Remember Smoke on the Water? Well, that is. This band is very, very beyond that hit single, but they really know how to make metal songs with a nice additive of poppish sounds. Metal Gods, charismatic Metal Gods. That's what they are.\n",
        "\nBlackmore and Gillan. Two enourmous egos tempered with equally enourmous talents. Yeah, the break up was impossible to avoid and some victims were about to take part on this (Roger Glover, a good bassist and great producer).\n\nAround 1970-1976, Deep Purple was the greatest heavy metal act in the world. Their albums were the gold and platinum standards in terms of sales, production and most importantly, performance. Yeah, until today, the power and brilliance of \"Made in Japan\" is unreachable, the \"Mark II trio\" of heavy metal pioneering albums \"In Rock\", \"Fireball\" and \"Machine Head\" are still regarded as landmarks of the genre and Ritchie Blackmore-Jon Lord duet makes the finest virtuoso-couple ever.\n\nWhatever. Gillan left (with his heavy metal attitude and unique voice) along with Glover, so, fresh air was needed (specially because of that weak release known as \"Who do we Think we Are\"). After some auditions, the unknown David Coverdale was hired and he recommended, later, bassist Glenn Hughes to fill the final vacancy. Great! Deep Purple shall continue!\n\nAnd for the sake of many people, this album is as good as the holy trinity created in the seventies by the Mark II. Specially because it's completely driven by Ritchie Blackmore, the one and only Guitar Hero of early heavy metal. This record is a total creation of his mind (of course, the collaboration of the always-underrated Ian Paice and magic Maestro Lord are inmense) and it is completely evident when you check, song per song, that the sound of the album is almost totally driven by the guitar.\n\nThe blast opener \"Burn\" is a bliss. A speed-power metal song to the core, made to replace \"Highway Star\" in terms of brute strength. Alongside the magic soloing by Blackmore and Lord, we note a nice new feature in this always-changing band: the vocal duet by Blackmore and Hughes. Yes, of course, they have a little influence here, as well, in terms of composition. But, as I said before, Blackmore rules this record. Period.\n\n\"Might Just Take Your Life\" may be the only song in this record which has a Coverdale/Hughes influence in a major manner than Blackmore's. It's a nice groovy song, with Lord's keyboarding giving the finest note.\n\nAgain, in \"Lay Down Stay Down\", we find Blackmore showing us who is in charge. The vocal duet sounds explodes and Ian Paice beats the hell out. This is heavy, traditional heavy, but heavy and nice. To me, an underrated song by Deep Purple. Almost the same happens with \"Sail Away\", with a slower and more moody tempo, of course. The beat remains metallic and gives a nice point to refresh the album.\n\n\"You Fool No One\" is a great song, at least for me. Glenn Hughes is the star here, with backing vocals by Coverdale. Of course, the song sounds groovy and funky, we all noted it, but still has the Blackmore's heavy metal element in it. And, by the way, Ian Paice drumming excells. Take a little time to figure it out. He is a genious.\n\nThe only filler in the record \"What's Goin on Here\" remains a nice rocker, with funny lyrics and a nice co-op work by Hughes and Paice. Have I forgot to mention Maestro Lord? Well, yeah, he is brilliant in this piece as in the whole album (nothing new to tell here).\n\nFinally, two Blackmore pieces: \"Mistreated\" and \"A-200\". The latter one is an enjoyable instrumental piece with not much to say about. But \"Mistreated\" is a hell of a heavy bluesy song, a traditional formula in Deep Purple's repertoire (remember \"Lazy\" or \"Demon's Eye\" for having some examples). That riff is majestic, so powerful and magic. The whole band, driven by that riff, plays a great performance. And Coverdale gives us, maybe, his finest vocal performance ever.\n\nYeah, this album is so freakin' great. Maybe with some funky touches, but great, specially because of Ritchie Blackmore. The Coverdale/Hughes Society was still a newbie, without such a great power to take the wheel in Deep Purple's destiny. But this was about to change soon... The downfall and the \"comma\" for DP would come soon... The band had to wait until \"Perfect Strangers\" to resurrect as the metal gods they always were. But that's another episode.\n",
        "\nWhen a band loses a key member or members, it usually spells doom for the soldiers who carry on. With Deep Purple losing the wonderful talent in Ian Gillan and dropping Roger Glover, it could easily be concluded that this was just the beginning of the end for one of hottest rock bands of the 1970s. Further proof in the pudding was the choice of replacements in little-known David Coverdale and this funky bass player from Trapeze, Glenn Hughes. In fact, the \u201cBurn\u201d cover art with the members\u2019 heads as wax candles could be a symbol for their careers melting away.\n\nHowever, what we have here is the finest Deep Purple album. The songwriting is top notch and the inclusion of Coverdale and Hughes as vocalist brings a great mix of bluesy and soulful singing. Ritchie Blackmore always had an eye for talent and he didn\u2019t miss here. The title track and the opener is one the best Purple songs. From the insane drumming of Ian Paice to the back and forth solos between Blackmore and keyboardist Jon Lord; this is the definition of a perfect song. The world is also introduced to the blend of Coverdale and Hughes.\n\nThe Brits keep the music flowing with the bluesy and slow rocker in \u201cMight Just Take Your Life\u201d which transitions to the walloping guitar riffing in \u201cLay Down, Stay Down.\u201d The guitar solo is done well with a clean piano in the background to keep the beat. The back and forth between Hughes and Coverdale is also enjoyable as this is one of the standout tracks of the album.\n\nOne of the other positives is that each track is unique. \u201cSail Away\u201d brings a funky edge to the proceedings with the bass riff and the Blackmore closing solo which features many wavy guitar notes sounds similar to Blackmore\u2019s future band Rainbow\u2019s epic \u201cStargazer.\u201d Another one of the standouts is \u201cWhat\u2019s Going On Here\u201d which sounds like a barroom rocker as I can see Lord doing the piano part while Coverdale and Hughes are enjoying the devil\u2019s fuel in the background.\n\nA final masterpiece is found with \u201cMistreated.\u201d This is the only track with a single vocalist as Coverdale takes the helm and delivers his finest Purple performance next to \u201cSoldier of Fortune.\u201d His bluesy voice blends with the depressing riff provided by Blackmore perfectly and the emotional solo drives it home safely. Soothing bass and trembling drums really drive the sad mood it goes for. This is a grade A song from a grade A band.\n\n\u201cBurn\u201d shows how a band can change members and deliver great music. The new blood in Hughes and Coverdale a perfect combination of soul and blues and combined with Blackmore\u2019s trusty guitar wonders makes this an awesome album. My only quip is \u201cYou Fool No One\u201d does not fit the Purple mode of hard rock as it is way too funky and groovy. However, the title track is I daresay the best Deep Purple song ever written. Don\u2019t believe me? Just put this song on and feel the \u201cburn.\u201d\n\nnicksmetal.blogspot.com\n",
        "\nLegend says that, during the finale of Child in Time's performance, a man decided to take his own life. There are two possible interpretations for this: He felt shame while he was listening crappy music or the exact opposite, he felt that after this, nothing could reach such a level of gorgeousness. My guess is that probably it's about the second option.\n\nBut, seriously talking, the point is this: what makes this album so bright, great and landmarker of what would come next in staging?\n\nIt's a difficult question and I won't refute the possibility that perhaps there is no good answer for it. And when there is no answer for explaining an event, yes, this thing is in the supernatural territories. Likewise, Made in Japan by that monstrous band, pioneer of metal music (alongside Black Sabbath), known as Deep Purple, is a record beyond human understanding. The only thing for sure is that nothing in the newborn world of heavy metal would be the same after this. If you have any doubt about DP and his belongings in the Metal Archives, this albun alone should fade them away. Those five classic-virtuoso guys planted the seed of the genre and gave the genetic information for the future generations to come. BS and DP sounded metal/protometal in their studios, but guys from Deep Purple had a plus: they were heavy metal PERFORMERS.\n\nWhat would be heavy metal without melting away all the strings of the guitar? Pumping the keyboard til it breaks? Singing in every possible range available for the human throat? Firescorching the bass and the drums til everything burns out? A paradoxic answer would be... \u00bfhard rock?. Yeah. That's the difference between those genres (besides of the sound, riffing and beating style, of course). You cannot be a heavy metal band without being a gigantic force over the stage. While that overrated pop-rock band known as Led Zeppelin believed that they were the wise masters of the cosmic beyond and were doing stupid things in stage (that can be noted in DVD's and with the exception of John Bonham, who was a brilliant player) magnified by massive propaganda by people who knows nothing about metal, Tony Iommi started to figure out that Black Sabbath needed to improve their metal performances on stage (around 1973... \u00bfcoincidence?) and figured out, slowly, that Ozzy Osbourne was not the guy for that.\n\nBut anyway, let's talk about magic, that would be Made in Japan.\n\nThe opening is so speed/power metal. Highway Star melt the irons and bangs every head around. Gillan singing was at his best ever. Nothing was impossible for him. The String Sorcerer alongside Maestro Lord was able to drive insane every people around only by playing a single note on his instrument. Paice and Glover reached the climax in the collaborative endeavor of providing the beat and rythm. Same happens with epic/progressive number known as Child in Time. Gillan slashes, Blackmore slashes, Lord Slashes, Paice and Glover slashes. Period.\n\nThe most known version of the most known riff in the history of metal (and even rock music) is from this album and even there we can listen to Blackmore trying to improvisate something. But this version of Smoke on the Water has some extra points by the keyboarding of Lord, which goes beyond usual reach. Is brilliant.\n\nThe Mule is from the underrated studio album Fireball. And, let's say, is one of the masterpieces of DP, specially if we can get some live performances like in Made in Japan. Ian Paice evolves to the metal god level (actually, all guys from DP MK II are metal gods) with such an inspired drumming. If you like to beat the hollows, listen to this. It might change your life. Strange Kind of Woman is always a blessing. Blackmore and Gillan have an ironic guitar-vocal battle there to be forever reminded. I love that song, actually.\n\nThen Lazy and Space Truckin' to close the first part. Both are masterpieces from Machine Head (that means they are very known) and besides their known qualities, they give us a couple of beautiful and unforgettable improvisations and jams.\n\nBut when you were starting to think that nothing could be better than this, DP gives us the encores! Black Night, Speed King and a huge cover of Al Collins's Lucille. Dude, this is pure magic. Is impossible to know how they did it, what was into Blackmore, Lord, Paice, Glover and Gillan for doing such a masterpiece. There is no answer for this album. It's simply a masterpiece. Have it or die, dude.\n",
        "\nAny creation between two masterpieces like 'In Rock' and 'Machine Head' will be shadowed instantly, without doing an analysis of it's real impact (in terms of music, obviously).\n\nHappens that 'Fireball\" is not totally underrated but yet it has not the real place it should have when we tell the history of metal genre. And actually, is in this album when DP creates what would become later his most everlasting legacy: the invention of speed and power metal (with the classic metal sound) first lighted in the previous release and confirmed with the one that comes next.\n\nThe stormy drumming by the always underrated Ian Paice introduces us into a magnificent example of the evolution in metal. The opening track of the album, \"Fireball\", is speed/power metal in pure essence. Blackmore's insane riffing with the frenzy singing by Gillan are enough to explain it. Every monster riff in the history of metal was previously created or drafted by Ritchie Blackmore or Tony Iommi. So be it. What comes next is a copy.\n\nMaybe the finest filler in Deep Purple's history is \"No No No\". Raw and punchy, is a hard rocking bastard who takes it all away. Gillan is the star here, but the whole band do what it takes to make this song great. Roger Glover deserves a special credit for the nice bass line in this track.\n\nAnother shadowed masterpiece, which would later became a prototype in some heavy bluesy songs by Purple is \"Demon's Eye\". Blackmore's riff, once again, breakes it. The virtuoso exchange of the guitar sorcerer and Maestro Jon Lord foretells what would later be the stage staple \"Lazy\" or even the MK III wonder \"Mistreated\" (with a slower beat, of course). To me, one of the greatest songs by DP.\n\nThe major flaw in this record, \"Anyone's Daughter\", has no salvation. If legendary bands can make mistakes, this was one, no doubt about it. Nonetheless, the lyrics are amusing, somehow.\n\nIf you have heard before about a live album named 'Made in Japan' (really, I mean, you DO HAVE that live album, metalhead, do you?), you know this black jewel entitled \"The Mule\". Yes, believe it or not, it is from this record, 'Fireball'. Heavy Metal virtuosity meets light here. Every single member of DP shows us what's about doing a metal performance. Forget about eternally overrated pop-rock band known as Led Zeppelin. Deep Purple is far beyond their reach and thanks to songs like \"The Mule\" they can prove it. Ian Paice's soloing (with Blackmore-Glover-Lord solid lines to support it) are gorgeous, brilliant, superb. Pure purple magic.\n\nAfter this, everything would sound hollow and tiny. But the fillers which are coming next, 'Fools' and 'No One Came' are very good enough to keep the things rolling. Straightforward and honest rock, with some progressive licks, probably by Maestro Lord. Because of this, these pieces have a fresh and unique air. Nothing else to be said here.\n\nAnd of course, we can't forget the hit single of this record, which reached the Top positions in UK and many countries in Europe and helped to re-establish DP reputation in the US: 'Strange Kind of Woman' (this song can be found in the Anniversary Edition, with some other nice oddities). A stage staple by own merits, the track always reminds us the great times when DP and BS started to rule the heavy metal world, even with its pop-ish sound. The life performances of this song, with a huge universe of improvisations (and some ironic battles by Blackmore and Gillan) are always a blessing.\n\nThis huge masterpiece is straight between the eyes for you to rediscover and love it the way it deserves. Be not affraid and embrace the Fireball, you won't regret it.\n",
        "\nIn the long history of rock music, there were many pinnacle moments when everyone knew something was going on and a shift was unavoidable. It happened with Little Richard and Chuck Berry, Dylan and Presley, the Beatles and the Stones and moreover around.\n\nThe same thing was happening in the beginning of the seventies. Two bands (followed by some other ones) were starting something they've never thought it would became massive. Black Sabbath, with two brilliant LP's and Deep Purple, with this milestone album, which sets the foundation of what would later reached the world with the name \"metal\".\n\nThough, there are some radical differences between doomy heavy Sabbath and speedy power Purple. Iommi's band was yet flirting with bluesy tunes, while Blackmore's (including new singer Ian Gillan and bassist Roger Glover) gave a different approach to the genre. It was the playing style as a whole, dynamic, full of virtuosity, shocking and powerful where blasting beats by Ian Paice and Glover danced alongside the filling atmosphere provided by Maestro Jon Lord with his Hammond and Ritchie's magnanimous lines, drawn in the middle of Gillan's metal-creator singing. Sabbath sounded heavy, but Purple was heavy, totally.\n\nWon't enter in a long-song-per-song critique here. I'll go straight to the point, starting with the four fillers that can be found in this record: \"Flight of the Rat\", \"Into the Fire\", \"Living Wreck\" and \"Hard Lovin Man\". These pieces are totally enjoyable, niceties that makes an album a little bit lighter, but they are good enough to keep you in touch and with total atention. A great album needs great fillers, and these four songs are into that category. Hard rocking pieces to the core, classic metal songs. Period.\n\nWhat makes this record a masterpiece are the following tracks, starting with the powerful opener \"Speed King\". Tremendous and breathtaking, is the finest example of rock evolution to metal. Speed and Power are recieving first lights with this song. Gillan singing slashes you to the bone, Glover and Paice beating keeps the frenzy up to the line while Lord and Blackmore soloing brings you a parallel virtuoso universe.\n\n\"Bloodsucker\" slows down the paice and yet is heavy and rocking. Gillan steals the looks here, with his gnawling singing. Supported by a powerful and catchy riff by the String Sorcerer, there is nothing else to be said.\n\nThe reputation of \"Child in Time\" is legendary. By far, Deep Purple's creative masterpiece. The atmosphere of the song, provided by maestro Lord, with the rythmic patterns by Glover and Paice, alongside The Banshee singing and lyrics mixed with Blackmore's power strings, leaves every metal listener in love. No band created something more epic, astonishing and brightful than this. A total metal classic on its own.\n\nAnd of course, we can't forget the hit single of the album, \"Black Night\", with the wide known Blackmore-Glover-Paice beat and bluesy structure. A show by Deep Purple without Black Night is like a show of Sabbath without Iron Man.\n\nFrom the top to the bottom, this album is filled with metal DNA, it is from the purest linage of the genre. So, be not afraid, metal erudite, and fill your collection with the first sculpture made in behalf of metal, those five heads in Mount Rushmore, doing their thing and doing it well.\n",
        "\nThe dark age of rock music, from 1985 to 1995 (and maybe beyond) was taking toll and there were many casualties. Old School metal bands fought hardly to survive the harsh winter that came: MTV, disco-pop, grunge and funky rock, you name it. Maybe, the hardest stroke was for Deep Purple. After a brightstar comeback with the excellent and essential \"Perfect Strangers\", they weren't able to produce what they do best, let's say classic vintage metal.\n\n\"House of Blue Light\" was like a dwarf star. Not bad at all, but nothing nice to be remembered there. And let's not talk about \"Slaves and Masters\", arguably the worst creation in Deep Purple's glorious career.\n\nSomething was missing, something was needed. A return to the roots. A return to traditional though inventive metal sound. Against wizard Blackmore's desire, the rest of the crew supported by the producers required the presence of Ian \"lazy-you-just-stay-in-bed-says-ritchie\" Gillan. After an addition in Blackmore's bank account and other struggles, the banshee returned and delivered the goods.\n\nI'm not saying Gillan is the mastermind in Purple's metal approach or any of it. But with him, back on the track, the classic metal sound of the band returned almost automatically. And something else: they've learnt from their mistakes and they went straight to their core, no comercial approach, no pop flirting sound.\n\nInstantly, with the opening song \"The Battle Rages On\" we find out that the Fireball is back and thirsty for more. Ritchie (maybe inspired by the return of Gillan and trying to overcome him) licks out one of his most aggresive riffs. The heavy atmosphere is supported by always enlighted Maestro Lord, with Paice and Glover punching everything away. Notwithstanding, Gillan is the star here, with those bright lyrics and powerful singing.\n\n\"Lick it Up\" is not a masterpiece, but works perfectly to make the environment lighter for what was about to come. Catchy chorus, funny lyrics, nothing else needed here.\n\nThe magic moment arrives when the sound of a distant renaissance guitar introduces us into a parallel but very Deep universe. \"Anya\" is a purple jewel, the everlasting creation of a genious. Ritchie Blackmore, the man in black, the string sorcerer, did it again. He twisted our emotions, played with our hearts and took us onto a rollercoaster of mystical metal power. With Jon Lord's virtuoso and imaginative lines in the keyboard, this piece is probably the finest track ever created by Deep Purple (with the exception of Child in Time and maybe one or two others). You will fall in love with it, instantly, as lovers of cars got excited when they see a classic vintage vehicle, like a Rolls Royce, an Aston Martin or a Bentley. Black-more-magic.\n\n\"Talk About Love\" and \"Time to Kill\" are very enjoyable hard rocking fillers. Not much thing to say about them, but they won't dissapoint you at all. Classic Purple fingerprints are there.\n\nAnother stand out moment is \"Ramshackle Man\". Heavy bluesy, like Machine Head's classic \"Lazy\", but with a more traditional approach. Once again, Ritchie is the star here. His soloing will melt your brains away. Oh, poor twisted mind, if you haven't heard about the String Sorcerer, you are dead meat. Arrogant and insufferable, but a total genious.\n\nSomehow speed/power metal \"A Twist in the Tale\" is a fine effort and will have a long and placid existence. The best from Rainbow in the eighties was taken and used for this song. With Gillan's charisma and Lord's symphonic metal-ish additions, you get a nice and rocking piece. Then, the weak spot of the record \"Nasty Piece of Work\" slows down the paice a little bit, or maybe a lot. Is the totally forgettable track in here.\n\nWe get a wonderful surprise with \"Solitaire\". Deep Purple, as usual, experiencing with different methods and doing great stuff. Gillan's vocal games, the beating sound and heyboard solos are excellent.\n\nFinally \"One Man's Meat\" has again that hilarious lyrical style by Gillan/Glover and a punchy paice. Maybe not such a good closer, but works it out.\n\nThe only great problem with this album (and most of Purple's albums after Perfect Strangers) is the silly art it has. But musically speaking, and that's what matters here, it's maybe the finest work created by Deep Purple since Perfect Strangers, a worthy descendant of In Rock, Fireball or Machine Head.\n\nUnfortunately, there are no good live versions of the songs in this album and those available are not the band's finest. But the people who knows about classic metal will inmediately recognize the power of this release, like a mechanic recognizes the sound of a vintage Ferrari or a driver enjoys the comfort and elegance of a Rolls Royce while he is driving it. A Purple Rolls Royce.\n",
        "\nThis record is what you want it to be. For many people, it's the first metal album ever (in terms of performing, sound, and production). For others, it's a simple hybrid attempt of trying to look different. Nonetheless, the influence of this album in the development of metal music is gigantic. I'll do a review, song per song, but won't stop too long in details for irrelevancies. I'll go straight to the point.\n\nThe fillers (I consider them \"fillers\" because, even if they are pretty good songs, their influence is not quite as remarkable as the ones I'll review carefully): Maybe I'm a Leo, When a Blind Man Cries, and Never Before do their duty in every sense. The first one is a straightforward rocker that's punchy, heavily passed and a beater. It does no more than that and it works well. The second one is a traditional ballad like many bands have done before and keep on doing. The third one tries to be a groovy song and somehow manages to survive correctly between several masterpieces on this record.\n\nNow, Deep Purple's everlasting legacy (on this album) begins with the opener, Highway Star, and say no more. Speed and power metal are meeting right between the power chords and soloing, blasting rhythms, and virtuoso singing. Dude, don't lie to me, headbanging is a must with this piece, so be it, and remains to this day Deep Purple's most powerful song.\n\nAfter Maybe I'm a Leo, you will find an underrated song. Nonetheless, it's a personal favourite and another metal-developer piece: Pictures of Home. The drumming intro plus the guitar tune plus the symphonic arrangements added by the keyboard plus the lyrical theme takes this song to the higher positions in Purple's repertoire.\n\nMany things were said about Smoke on the Water: overplayed, way too simple, way too light sounding, whatever, but every rocker in the world played this thing at least once on a guitar. Nuclear warfare shall come and after our extinction, roaches will learn to play the guitar, and guess which song will be the first one they will cover? Yeah, you are correct! Go ahead, try to create a catchier and, at the same time, heavier riff than the one created by Ritchie. You can't, can you? So please, a little bit of respect here.\n\nAnd now we find two stage staples by MKII: Lazy and Space Truckin. Both are very different songs and at the same time are the field for long jamming and improvisation. The first song, if this is possible, is a \"heavy blues\" attempt. Blackmore's guitar struggles against Lord's keyboards while Gillan tries to make way with his harmonica. With Glover and Paice giving a great background, you should enjoy this song a lot and you will never get bored of it. Every life performance by Deep Purple is a little surprise with this piece. The second song is another spillover of light metal development; a powerful riff, powerful singing, powerful beating, everything is very powerful. Power, dude!\n\nMachine Head gives you everything: catchy songs between powerful tunes. A total machine, able to do whatever you expect from it. It's so metal and so traditional at the same time. A necessary masterpiece in your collection, no doubt about it. This Machine REALLY works.\n",
        "\nFireball simply isn't as good as In Rock - the majority of the band admit this is the case, fan consensus is likewise. That said, there's plenty of saving graces to the album. The second half is actually, by my reckoning, a bit stronger than the first half, featuring as it does powerful numbers like The Mule, Fools, and No One Came.\n\nIt's on the first side that most of the problems lie. No No No and Demon's Eye rely on slow, plodding rhythms that, to my ears at least, lack verve and energy, rendering the songs in question dull and repetitive. The instrumental soloing this time around is generally weaker and more forgettable than, for example, the incredible guitar solos on Speed King or Child In Time on the last album.\n\nAnd then there's the elephant in the room, Farmer's Daughter, which even Ian Gillian admits was a mistake to release as part of the album. Coming right in the middle, this is a weak and unimaginative folk-rock number that comes across as a novelty song, sabotaging any momentum the album had built up to that point. The disc is pretty much saved by the last few tracks clawing things back, but it's still a blot on the running order which would be better off removed from the album entirely.\n",
        "\nThe year 1969 could be said to be when the band Deep Purple finally hit their stride. Cutting down on their covers of other artists material and developing their sound into the bluesy behemoth that would pioneer heavy metal, Deep Purple's self-titled third album shows the band somewhat moving out of their cage and doing some pretty adventurous things. Not to mention that they had a symphony and concerto in the works by this point, Deep Purple was meeting their artistic mark, and this record does tend to indicate this. However, as is evident from the numerous throwback tracks here, Deep Purple had not completely moved out into the open yet.\n\n'Deep Purple' is essentially a mix between straightforward bluesy tracks, and more left-of- center art rock. Naturally, the artistic side of Deep Purple shines a little more brightly than does the blues, but overall, the band has a fairly tight grasp on both sides of their side. 'Chasing Shadows' has some very nice psychedelic undertones to it over a blanket of hard rock, and 'Shadows' gives a baroque classical vibe. Keyboardist Jon Lord's contributions really shine here, including an incredible orchestral arrangement in the middle of the largely instrumental final track 'April'. Apart from that, he really douses the songs with some great classical charm, made quite evident by his use of arpeggios and rich organs.\n\nWhile pieces like the indomitable 'April' really show the band breaking free of rock convention (with parts that sound like they are paying homage to composer Ennio Morricone), there are still moments on this album where the rock is kept straightforward and energetic. While Deep Purple is still as rocking here as they are with their more complex moments, the musicianship doesn't feel quite as good and organic as it was on earlier albums. However, taken into consideration that the self-titled shows Deep Purple trying out new things, this can be excused. Ron Evan's voice is here instead of Ian Gillian who would join shortly after, but while this may not be the Purple's vocalist that we consider to be part of the canonical lineup, he does a good job here, hitting his mark and achieving a warm tone to his voice during the more mellowed moments.\n\nDeep Purple's self-titled is a very good album, and a step forward for rock music at the time, although I would say that the band gets even better with their subsequent 'classic' records. A great piece of proto-metal and art rock.\n",
        "\nThe debut album from this massive hard rock band, Deep Purple's 'Shades Of Deep Purple' is met with some ambivalence. Setting aside the fact that this is an album without the band's best singer Ian Gillian, 'Shades Of Deep Purple' is often overlooked for the fact that it is composed greatly of cover songs rather than original material, although there are still a few songs here that the band wrote themselves. Taken for what it is, this debut is actually quite good, and really sets the stage for more successful music in the future.Surprisingly enough, the cover songs are the real draw to this album, but as the inventive rockers that they are, the covers are really made their own, taking 'Shades' from the forgettable album that many deem it to be, to a fairly interesting place in rock history.\n\nWhile the bluesy 'Mandrake Root' will attract the most attention from Deep Purple fans (due to the fact that it has met a great deal of performances in live settings), I find myself most attracted to the covers that the band has done here. 'Hush' is a fairly well known single that got the band out there, and Deep Purple does it well; a memorable track with a catchy hook or two. The cover of the Beatles song 'Help!' is likely my favourite pick from the album though; it really shows what I mean about Deep Purple making these songs their own. While the original track was fairly upbeat and catchy, Deep Purple turns the song into a drawn out psychedelic experience. This is very refreshing to hear, especially from an album that is almost half a century old by this point.\n\nThe band was certainly heavier than most at the time, but they still have ample loads of British pop in their sound, especially when it comes to the vocals. Although not as good as Gillian, Rod Evans does a good job of fronting the band.\n\n'Shades Of Deep Purple' is a nice start for this band, and while the abundance of covers is certainly controversial, I really think that Deep PUrple goes beyond reprising the hits of the day and makes these classic tracks into something new oand original, sometimes almost to the point where they could be considered originals unto themselves. There is nothing particularly excellent here and Deep Purple would certainly go on to much better things, but this should be an interesting experience for anyone wanting a nice piece of hard rock from the late 60's.\n",
        "\nThe second album from Deep Purple is also one of their most underrated albums. Like 'Shades Of Deep Purple', fans look back on this record and dismiss it, in no small part due to the fact that it features more cover tracks. Although there is a greater wealth of original material here, it is hoped that a band would have started focusing solely on their own material by this point, but in any case, 'The Book Of Taliesyn' is a small step in the right direction for this archetypal hard rock ensemble. Another psychedelic-tinged, organ driven slice of hard rock, Deep Purple's music may still not have been golden at this point, but contrary to the disdain that the album has received, there is some great stuff to behold here.\n\nAll things considered, the album is fairly diverse for its time. 'Listen, Learn, Read On' has a few psychedelic effects on the vocals to make things sound a little spacier, and the lyrical themes revolve around medieval, fantasy based topics that really add to the charm of the band. 'Wring That Neck' is an instrumental that shows the heaviness of the band, as well as the great talent of their keyboardist (and brightest shining star at this point) Jon Lord. Richie Blackmore has some nice solos on this album finally, but it would be a while before he started really coming onto his own as the guitar hero he is considered today. 'Shield' and 'Anthem' are two strong tracks that aptly describe the band's sound at the time, even bringing sounds of classical music into the mix; something that was not heard much at the time. Deep Purple even bring their own unique sound to the Beatles cover 'We Can Work It Out', adding a long proggy instrumental introduction that really makes the track their own.\n\nA problem that 'The Book Of Taliesyn' really does struggle with is the production, which often feels a little too ambitious given the technology at the time. While Deep Purple can't be put down for wanting to incorporate alot of sounds into their album, 'Taliesyn' does tend to get a little muddy and too distorted at times, especially with the dense organ sounds. Deep Purple's sophomore is a very good album, but this is a problem that does tend to take away from the ferocity of the performance, and there were parts where the production really felt as if it got in the way of enjoyment. Deep Purple would keep getting better from here, taking this potential and running with it a little more on their self-titled follow-up to this album. 'The Book Of Taliesyn' is a good album on its own merit though, and while it is not excellent or particularly engaging, Deep Purple does deserve more credit for this album than what they get.\n",
        "\n\u201c\u2026vibrant flashes in my mind remind me of a foregone time\u2026\u201d\n\nMost members of the Metal Archives are about two decades removed from the sixties - twenty years of proposed retrospect that, in the eyes of metal\u2019s hardened beast, only sporadically enjoy reconsideration. A time of bell bottoms, drug culture, and 15\" color TVs, so what does this epoch offer a musical style that barely existed even in the seventies, right up to its far-off cusp of the '80s? Punk never fails to realize its \u201860s roots, embracing even the most minuscule and transitional of influence like victory, bruised chin held high, from The Who and The Kinks to Les Goths, Deviants, The Ugly Ducklings, The Breakers, Richard & The Young Lions, and many more that strafed the bottom layer of radar. Sometimes it truly amazes me that metal apparently doesn\u2019t want anything to do with the decade that sprouted the universe\u2019s most celebrated concert, fired the first shots in the revolution of sexuality, and saw us take the Moon as our own. \n\nCommonly a victim of youthful repression nowadays, the \u201860s was a significant one-way, multi-dimensional cycle in music\u2019s lifetime. Music\u2019s lifetime - one-way in its surge forward that often looks back over forty five years yet has never returned and multi-dimensional in its groundbreaking musical contraption that stumbled bravely across rock\u2019s primary colors of beat, r&b, psychedelia, and progressivism. \n\nTime, unavoidably steadfast in its livelihood, shows no mercy. Change folds and draws another unsympathetic hand. \n\nSoon beat and psych dwindle as r&b and progressive flourish. Elementary rock hardens, becoming jagged and more unforgiving. And eventually dark. Alas, it\u2019s unfortunate some musical styles are often judged not by what motivates them intrinsically, but what the lyrics are about. \u201cAll they ever sing about is love and tulips, man\u201d. Yep, and teddy bears and picnics and \u201966 Corvettes. Well, shortly certain attitudes toward rock will transmute, evolve with a bitter edge, and travel to more dangerous, foreboding places the endless summer of The Beach Boys would never have admitted existed, let alone tread. But this is still in the future, and I\u2019m getting ahead of myself. Come \u201968, very few bands were shroud in darkness. Hard rock itself barely eked out an existence, still crimson with the blood of new life that was, in fact, always present, conscious in a diluted state of oppression, shackled by the chart-born chains of \u2018pop\u2019 fleetingly rattled by the style\u2019s brutish underbreath. But instead of concerning ourselves with how dark or ominous a style is, let\u2019s just worry about the style\u2019s base self. \n\nOh, and early \u201880s metal isn\u2019t winning any awards with its lyrical gravity, either. \n\nShades of\u2026 is the band at their most simplistic and expected, the line-up (now known as the Mk 1 line-up) coalescing from less-than-haughty sources, the most prominent being Nick Simper and Jon Lord coming off a \u201967 hit single with The Flower Pot Men while Ritchie Blackmore backed Screaming Lord Sutch for a short time. Recorded in a single weekend in May \u201968, this hurried album fuses rock\u2019s four corners to the same foundation, offering minimal leadership to new styles and is steeped in cover tunes. Ordinarily a description such as this would be an album\u2019s death knell or at least the average and forgettable arrival of one, but somewhere within these grooves stirred a questionable chemistry that somehow got off the ground, ignored the abusive number of non-originals that was common for bands looking for a quick hit and/or were insecure in their own songwriting wares, and managed to survive until the vaunted Mk 2 membership. I\u2019m not going to sit here and tell you there are ocean voyages of cognition swirling throughout Shades of\u2026, but at a time when innovation wasn\u2019t the day\u2019s top order to record companies, a few catchy hooks ornamenting an original work or found premeditated in a cover could aid a group\u2019s chart ascension (as \u201cHush\u201d, the invention of Joe South, already had). Songwriting may have only been as good as the ears that heard it. \n\nShades of\u2026 is testimony to the cover song's widespread acceptance, adorned with no less than four, some more daring than others, the most prevalent being the near chart-topping (#4 in the US) \u201cHush\u201d, a more keyboard-laden rendition I\u2019m sure everyone has heard at one time or another. The cover of Skip James\u2019 \u201cI\u2019m So Glad\u201d glides smoothly over the verses and chorus, but during the instrumental phase extrapolates an already tempestuous song (for \u201931), meanwhile \u201cHey Joe\u201d, already recorded to the hilt by other artists that would become a freak hit for a new-on-the-solo-scene Hendrix, is redirected at times with bolero-style keys and a Holst-like march, but much of the time travels parallel to Jimi\u2019s blues-wrought arrangement. The best would come with the Beatles\u2019 \u201cHelp\u201d, depressing the original\u2019s eager pop appeal with Rod Evans\u2019 melancholic drawl, blurs of wicked keyboard, a more cerebral ideal more suited toward the lyrics, and is mindful of Vanilla Fudge\u2018s dreary, mood-enervating rendition of The Supremes\u2019 \u201cYou Keep Me Hanging On\u201d of the previous year. Word has it the band received a praising call from Paul McCartney shortly afterward, a thrill for them no doubt.\n\nDespite some recollections, with the dreamily plush \u201cOne More Rainy Day\u201d and up-grooved \u201cLove Help Me\u201d the only full-blown original pop tunes on the disk, Shades of\u2026 isn\u2019t the sugar snack it\u2019s sometimes regarded as. But even these songs are well constructed if not mainstream-ly so, sounding like any one of the hundred or so songs populating a Nuggets box set. \n\n\u201cMandrake Root\u201d and \u201cPrelude: Happiness\u201d are more epic in their holographic daze as sure-handed Jon Lord, perhaps the most toweringly-executed player on this thing, lays down the songs\u2019 progressivism with his mazy Hammond as Ian Paice backs him up with chaotic tribal percussion while Ritchie Blackmore, not yet the renown string sorcerer, throws some fuzzy garage chops into the fray. It\u2019s within this pair of tunes that this lp\u2019s weight of hard rock is hatched through a creation of keyboards and drums that oddly succeed over guitars with heaviness still cognitively blind and writhing like most newborns, somewhat realized previously by the likes of Blue Cheer, The Jeff Beck Group, and some unwittingly valiant effortless efforts from Hendrix, and great monolithic side-starter \u201cMandrake Root\u201d holds the only fleeting, pre-patented \u201cSmoke on the Water\u201d-ish sneer on the platter. Opening instrumental \u201cAnd the Address\u201d allows Lord and Blackmore to share equal ground, spotlighting a guitar-driven element that isn\u2019t as invasive on the lp as one would have expected nowadays, hindsight withstanding. \n\nFor what this album is, it\u2019s quite good. For what this album isn\u2019t...well, what can you expect from five guys that, prior to this, had only been playing with each other as a whole for about five months, rushed by two London businessmen to record not only a debut single, but a debut full-lengther (that would peak at #24 in the US, mind you). Only briefly with keyboard-urged zaniness does Shades of\u2026 scrape itself on hard rock let alone metal, but the brain stem for it all is here, and I don\u2019t mind looking upon this era as not only a metal victory, but in magical retrospect that I can only consume within the confines of stories told by those who were there.\n\n\u201c\u2026it looks like the world\u2019s been born\u2026\u201d\n",
        "\nThis record (in CD form) was my very first experience of hard rock gods Deep Purple, and I must say that to this day, more than 10 years alter I first listened to it, it\u2019s a pretty recommendable and more than decent compilation of their work. It contains some of it finest repertoire, and though some choices might be disputable, most of the tracks here are utterly essential and I can\u2019t imagine a single metalhead who hasn\u2019t already listened and memorized most of them and sing them even in a coma state. For the influence and impact these helluva songs had and still have on the metal world are humongous. Sure, Sabbath was the very first heavy metal band, but Purple\u2019s offerings are the very cornerstone of the sound of zillions of bands that emerged later playing, mainly but not only, speed, power, progressive and melodic metal.\n\nNow, this compilation does have some \u201cflaws\u201d. One could say that the first songs are not in their best version. Both \u201cBlack Night\u201d and \u201cSpeed King\u201d on Deepest Purple are the single versions, and though almost as good as their original forms they are edited and omit good parts (\u201cBlack Night\u201d lasting almost 5 minutes in the un-edited version which showcases all of the boys musical abilities during its last minute while \u201cSpeed King\u201d has an abrasive guitar introduction courtesy of master Blackmore himself in it\u2019s album version). This fact only accentuates that the reason of this compilation was to capitalize on Deep Purple\u2019s well-deserved status as one of rock\u2019s greats. But perhaps some at EMI, or even drummer Ian Paice himself, who was responsible for the chosen songs, could have thought of the potential of giving something extra to the Purple-craving masses, a plus to this compilation, just as in Ozzy\u2019s Ozzman Cometh which opens with two previously unreleased (at that time) versions of Black Sabbath songs while he was in the band. Truth is they lacked that vision, but fortunately for us fans those complete, and for me, ultimate, versions came to us as bonus tracks in the 90\u2019s re-releases of their classic albums.\n\nSo besides that little, almost unimportant complain, one could argue about the obvious suggestions for this compilation: \u201cPictures of Home\u201d, the pop rock-infused yet classic \u201cHush\u201d, \u201cThe Mule\u201d, and a personal favorite of their Mark III years, \u201cSoldier of Fortune\u201d, amongst a few others. But that really depends on subjective taste, and as stated before, their all-time classics are contained here. From the hard rock staple, mighty and kinda overplayed \u201cSmoke on the Water\u201d, whose guitar riff has been recently voted the best in rock by a british university or magazine (I can\u2019t recall precisely), to the proto-speed metal Fireball and the progressive, towering Child in Time with it\u2019s magnificent, timeless, vocal/guitar duel by Gillian/Blackmore respectively, to the glorious \u201cHighway Star\u201d, my favorite Purple song containing some of the best soloing in existence, both in guitar and organ, and the underrated \u201cBurn\u201d which itself is like the MKIII answer to \u201cHighway Star\u201d and comes close in terms of awesomeness, this is a must have for anyone venturing into Deep Purple\u2019s legacy for their first time. It worked perfect for me, a stranger to their music at the time, to the point that even now that I\u2019ve listened to almost all of their material, whenever I suggest a Deep Purple compilation for a friend, the play-list on said compilation won\u2019t be much different to Deepest Purple.\n\nSo we have the ultimate classics of Mark II (and if you don\u2019t know what that means, it refers to the deepest purple age of DP, consisted by Ian Gillian on vocals, Ritchie Blackmore on guitar, Roger Glover on bass, mighty Jon Lord on keyboards and lightning-fast Ian Paice on drums) and a fair deal of material by the less-classic MKIII (David Coverdale on vocals, Glenn Hughes on bass and also vocals, with Blackmore, Paice and Lord). By the time of this review\u2019s creation, several tons of other Deep Purple compilations now exist, some more complete perhaps, while others are completely unnecessary, but in this reviewer\u2019s eyes and especially, ears, this one remains THE DEEPEST.\n",
        "\nDeep Purple is one of the bands with the most interesting and turbulent histories in the annals of hard rock. The legendary Mark II was a magnificent piece of rock history, and as an influence on the development of the fabulous metal genre itself, it has earned them a place in the spotlight from many different and largely segregated audiences: there are the new fans, trying to find out the historical artefacts in the foundations of metal, there are the old geezers with their pensions, bald spots, walkers and memories of the early 70s gigs, and those of us who found the band after the 80s reunion of the said Mark II. Because, hell, the return of the Mark II with the suberb Perfect Strangers is one of the finest comebacks ever. That particular album is a damn fine piece of work, and worthy of much more attention than it currently gets.\n\nOn the downside, the band has turned to a money printing machine for a release industry intent on cashing out the niche until it bleeds. Deep Purple's post-1995 discography has the live releases based on old tapes outnumbering the new albums at least 3-to-1, and that's not counting the compilations. The lackluster \"best-of\" compilations are generally piss-poor and completely redundant, since they usually contain a bunch of 8 to 12 worthy and ever-repeating tracks in various studio or live versions, and add a couple of \"rarities\" with no value whatsoever, except for completionists who have their Deep Purple collections in argon-filled vaults and include any bootleg bobble-head dolls of Blackmore, Gillan beef jerky, and every other item they can get their hands on. \n\nAnother interesting facet of the Deep Purple history is the family tree of the band. One of the best second-hand record stores in Helsinki is The Music Hunter, and despite the generally outrageous prices on certain items, it's worth a visit if you're a Deep Purple fan: the store has a special \"Deep Purple and the family tree\" section, with the bands with a Deep Purple number of 2 or lower (in imitation of the Kevin Bacon number in the film industry, or the Erd\u0151s number of mathematicians). The collection includes obscure bands, and certainly provokes thought if nothing else. The band is, indeed, a powerhouse, a hard rock academy with various faculties named Rainbow, Whitesnake and others, and the DP#2 layer of the family tree probably contains hundreds of musicians from dozens of styles.\n\nBut The House of Blue Light is somehow a misstep. Many people who know more say that such albums as Bananas, with its stupid cover art, and the relatively recent Rapture of the Deep are actually good albums. But The House of Blue Light does not work very well, and even if there are ideas worthy of the Mark II reputation, the execution kills the album's replay value. \n\nRitchie Blackmore only stayed in the band for two more full-lengths after this album, and while the very good quality Nobody's Perfect live album was released after The House of Blue Light, with Blackmore's guitar contributing its excellence for perhaps the last time, the two new works never get mentioned as anything special. It perhaps took the departure of Blackmore, and more specifically, the injection of new blood in the shape of Morse, before Deep Purple could regain the bearings and produce something of value again.\n\nThe House of Blue Light shares the same basic blueprints as Perfect Strangers, but falls short of the kind of heavy-hitting hard rocking it held inside. Yes, there are innovative and successfully derivative ideas: the intersting spidery keyboard thingy in \"Strangeways\", \"Bad Attitude\" and \"Unwritten Law\" with their reminiscence of \"Knocking on Your Backdoor\" and \"Perfect Strangers\", respectively, from the masterpiece three years earlier... and... well, that's pretty much it. The rest is mostly almost poppy hard-rock-by-the-numbers that lags its feet behind, has a tempo too low to keep the songs interesting, and none of the sparking virtuoso performances of the 70s Mark II works. These are songs that could have turned into something nice, but failed, and the whole album reeks more or less of waiting for the hard-earned pension.\n\n\"Call of the Wild\" is a prime example of what is wrong with the songs. It's toothless, almost neutered, and despite the basically OK chorus and melody, it's perfectly happy just being there, slipping almost all the way to the boredom level of AOR, and tries hard not to invoke any emotions. Gone are the days of frantic \"Strange Kind of Woman\" live perfomances, the almost surreal \"Child in Time\" magnificience, the jamming stretching of \"Space Truckin'\", that never turned boring despite reaching lengths way over 20 minutes, or the ruthless drive of \"Speed King\", \"Fireball\" and \"Highway Star\". This is an ambition-free piece of work by a tired band, with some leftover ideas that could have been developed so much further. But they settled for less, and ended up with a cheap Taiwanese copy of Perfect Strangers. It's worth wondering how the hell they managed to recharge their enthusiasm after this album, and record the virtually flawless Nobody's Perfect on the album tour.\n\nYup, this piece of work is not what Deep Purple is all about. Surprisingly, Perfect Strangers is. Get that one, and enjoy the old-school originality still to be found on it. Skip The House of Blue Light, and go for the old Mark II works instead. Get In Rock, Machine Head and even Burn from the other worthy Mark number and, especially, Made in Japan if you want to know where many of heavy metal's conventions are originally from. But forget this let-down of a decade.\n",
        "\nNote: I have based this review on the CD remaster of this album, which has slightly shorter track lengths than the original release.\n\nSometimes, an album just grabs you. You don't really know why-- if you try to analyse it, it doesn't seem like it should be that great. Yet despite this there's just something that appeals to you on some fundamental level. Other times, the opposite holds: an album ticks all the boxes, there's nothing all that wrong with it, and yet you just can't quite bring yourself to truly enjoy it. For me, The House of Blue Light is definitely an example of the latter. This, technically Deep Purple's twelfth studio album, is really only the sixth from the Mark II lineup of Blackmore, Gillan, Glover, Lord, and Paice: the same line-up who brought us timeless classics like In Rock, Machine Head, and the underrated Fireball. This fact is, in many ways, the primary cause of my dissatisfaction with the release.\n\nOn the surface of it, there's really nothing wrong here. The album has a strongly eighties sound and it's kind of cheesy at times, but these pretty much go with the territory. There's nothing wrong with the production, and the songs are reasonably catchy and pleasant-sounding. All of the members of the band are very talented and they all pull their weight. The problem is, all of this contributes to a very safe and thus mundane sound. The band sounds like a group of (very competent) musicians going through the motions, painting by numbers. Nobody seems to be willing to paint outside the lines, though, to put themselves out there and take a risk. This isn't necessarily a bad thing in a general sense, but this is Deep Purple! \n\nTo me, Deep Purple is a band who are at their best when they really cut loose. Classic tracks like Child in Time, with its insanely over-the-top vocal and solos, the intense speed metal assault of tracks like Fireball and Speed King, and the bludgeoning riffing and high energy of Space Truckin'-- these are all the creations of band who didn't know how much was too much, and frankly didn't give a shit. There's an unreserved, unrestrained, joyous energy to the first three Mk II albums. They're exciting, they're dramatic, and although the band made their fair share of mistakes, they're far outweighed by all the incredible material on offer. Unfortunately, the lineup's next effort was the far less inspired Who Do We Think We Are?, which is far less exuberant. Whether it was due to the oft-mentioned internal tensions experienced by the band at the time, or simply because of a lack of good ideas, we were presented with an album that just didn't quite cut the mustard, despite some containing some very cool tracks. It was safe, and restrained, and hence not nearly as thrilling as the previous material. As a result, 1984's reunion album Perfect Strangers was a breath of fresh air. Although more reserved than the 70's albums, the reformed line-up seemed to have recovered a great deal of their passion and enthusiasm, and pumped out another excellent addition to their catalogue. Which leads us to the next pre-breakup album, The House of Blue Light, a relatively timid and safe hard rocker.\n\nDespite its relative lack of impact compared to their older material, let's be clear-- this is still decent. It's very much within the bounds of hard rock, but with a rather light and poppy feel for the most part. An interesting characteristic of the album is that there's no filler at all-- in fact, every single song sounds like it was intended to be a single. This manifests in catchy, sing-along choruses, as well as a fairly consistent lean towards your typical verse-chorus radio rock structuring. In short, it's unchallenging, but it's actually a great deal of fun. The thing is, the band themselves don't seem to have been having an awful lot of fun playing it. Where are the dramatic and ear-splitting wails? Gillan has an incredible set of pipes, but if this release was the only Purple I'd heard I might not realise it. It makes it fairly easy to sing along with, but also less interesting to listen to! Where are the over-the-top guitar solos? There are a few nice enough ones here and there, but nothing that's going to make the kids want to pick up a guitar and attempt to impress girls. The rest of the band similarly fail to shine. It doesn't really feel like they are a rock band, jamming and improvising and just generally doing whatever the hell they want. It feels more like a group of session musicians, playing the sheet music as written. It's technically very good, but there's no emotional involvement, no passion.\n\nThe other big problem with the album is that most of the songs, although they don't actually sound the same, don't really manage to differentiate themselves. They're all fine at the time when you listen to them, but when the album stops spinning there's nothing that you will find yourself humming to yourself until you next spin it, nothing that really makes you sit up and say \"wow\". That said, there are a couple of tracks that do make themselves known. Mitzi Dupree is probably the most notable-- I'm not actually a huge fan of it myself, but its oddly slinky, bluesy riffs and humorous/sleazy lyrics make it arguably the most memorable thing on here. Another more interesting track is Hard Lovin' Woman, which isn't a patch on its masculine counterpart from In Rock, but still manages to work rather well with its relatively high tempo and some unexpected horn sounds and a really cool riff at the start. There are also less memorable songs which contain great moments-- for instance, the synth/guitar solo exchange on Dead or Alive is very cool, as is the chorus of Black and White, which really reminds me of Queen. However, none of these highlights would be particularly good if they were placed on an album of the calibre of In Rock or Machine Head-- they are only exciting relative to the fairly homogenous morass that is The House of Blue Light. They just don't have the riffs or the vocal lines to really stand up to the band's back catalogue. They never really build up enough momentum to make the listener sit up from their torpor and pay attention-- Mad Dog does threaten to do this a few times, but it's really only teasing, and seems to slump back into mediocrity after each attempt.\n\nThis is an album that could have been quite good, but ultimately fails due to an utter lack of effort at doing anything truly exciting. I would probably be more forgiving if it was another band, but as I know that the Deep Purple Mk II line-up is capable of so much more, the release feels almost castrated, and is ultimately quite disappointing. It's too safe, too moderate, too uninspired, and it tries too hard to fit into the template of what was popular at the time to let the band really show off what they can do. It's a fun little hard rocker, but that's all it is.\n",
        "\nDeep Purple has always been a band that was not afraid to try something different. Before this album they had released some fine Hendrix toned work along with a hit \"Hush.\" Of course, we all know how Purple ended up after this. This release is very hard to find, but it is however a great album. I wouldn't necessarily call this album a \"metal\" album at all, it fits more in the progressive rock vein. This album to me marks the beginning of what Rod Evans would do with Captain Beyond 3 years later. \n\n\n\nThis album is definitely an odd blend of tracks, but it works. Songs like \"Chasing Shadows\" and \"Blind\" have a great progressive influence here. These two tracks are definitely in the King Crimson. Captain Beyond, Jethro Tull vein of songs. Then we have the ballad, \"Lalena.\" It's a very slow and soft song from Purple, much like \"When a Blind Man Cries\" in their later years. \"Fault Line\" is definitely a filler, consisting of what sounds like a backmasked jam. This track leads into the Chuck Berry influenced, \"The Painter.\" This song is a very lively track, and one of the best off of the album. \"Why Didn't Rosemary\" has a very similar beat to \"Demon's Eye\" off of the \"Fireball\" album. It is a great little blues themed number. \"Bird Has Flown\" sounds like a track that it is the same vein as the first two tracks. This track happens to be one of the catchiest songs on the album though, and is definitely a highlight. The last track, \"April,\" is definitely interesting. This track last for 12 minutes starting with an organ intro leading into a classical guitar/piano interlude. This of course leads into a classic Deep Purple guitar/organ solo trade-off. About 5 minutes into this track comes an orchestral piece that lasts for about 4 mintues before trading off to Rod Evans singing over a classic Deep Purple sound. This song of course ends with one of Ritchie Blackmore's epic sweeping guitar solos, and then fades off into nothingness.\n\nOverall, this is a great buy for a long time Deep Purple fan. This album may seem unusual for some fans, but is indeed a great album. Mixing psychedelic sounds with progressive and classical elements is what makes this album what it is. This unfortunately is the last album produced by the Mark I line-up, but of course \"In Rock\" isn't bad at all. \n\nHighlights: Chasing Shadows, The Painter, Bird Has Flown, April\n",
        "\nEarly heavy metal albums are awesome! When I mean early, I'm talking about a couple of choice psychedelic rock records by that precede 1970; the year the Black Sabbath and In Rock albums came out to kick off true heavy metal. Of course the band that authored the latter album is the same one who did the one of topic for this review so it stands to reason that it can be one of the very few to be deemed a \"retro-active\" heavy metal albums. \n\nDeep Purple was one of my gateway bands to getting into heavy metal. Growing up as a kid, I loved psychedelic rock and so it made perfect sense that I should start with an album like this. I remember seeing a television commercial for this band when I was nine years old and thought they were very \"old school\" heavy. It wasn't until I was around twenty that I started superficially checking them out by flipping through their albums in a giant record store in Hong Kong. If you're wondering why then I only looked and not listened, well you have to remember this was before the age of widespread use of the internet or mp3s and so I couldn't exactly afford blind purchases( very few shops allowed you to sample anything either). Anyway from what I took away looking through all those albums they put out was that they looked to be like a poor man's Led Zeppelin but heavier. I didn't get around to buying anything from them until a couple years later only to find out I was half right. Yes, they were heavier than Zeppelin (though not in this late 60's era) yet not heavier nor darker than Black Sabbath's music. What I (and still many others today) didn't realize was that for a time of about, oh, 1970 to 1972, Deep Purple was actually a much bigger concert draw and therefore bigger band than Led Zeppelin. Hell, Purple had use of and their name written on The Starship private jet before Zeppelin did. So my assumption that they were a \"poor man's\" version of Jimmy Page's band was not entirely accurate. One band lasted longer in their prime and had more success in the United States is all. \n\nShades of Deep Purple is pretty small time, however. It's a bluesy, sometimes gloomy psychedelic rock debut released on Bill Cosby's record label Tetragrammaton in 1968. Hush is a noted single that has gotten much play on the classic rock air waves as well as a long time staple in their concerts. Rod Evans is a strong singer for this early period of the band that would become better known when one Ian Gillan joined. For you more modern minded metal fans, I guess Evans could be said to be Deep Purple's equivalent to Paul Di'Anno from Iron Maiden past fame. Although I doubt there is any sizeable base of fans with an affinity for Evans over Gillan or even Glenn Hughes, David Coverdale or Joe Lynne Turner for that matter. Shades is a damn good early album with it's own merits nonetheless. It doesn't sound a thing like their later era albums of course. But the album for me at least is a great showcase for the early styles of writing and playing by Ritchie Blackmore. Like Jimmy Page, he started out as a studio session player for other artists in the sixties. His solos on here have that fuzz drive typical of late psychedelic rock as heard from bands like Iron Butterfly but more proficient. Ian Paice has drumming near identical to Ginger Baker's style from Cream. But probably the one defining aspect of the band to distinguish Deep Purple from their hard rock/heavy metal contemporaries of the time is of course Jon Lord's organ work. If you've heard Machine Head and all the other classic albums, you can pretty much tell it was a useful holdover from the very heady days of 60's psychedelia as found here. It's as much a musical trademark with the band as the flute was with Jethro Tull. \n\nAnd The Address has that very thing when that organ rumble revs up. It's an instrumental that contains some groovy rhythms peppered with colorful electric riffs from Ritchie. Then comes on the extremely catchy Joe South cover Hush. I've always considered this track to be the prototype of Smoke on the Water because both songs are set up almost exactly the same; length, simplicity, breaks, chorus and solo placement and of course Jon Lord's organ playing to move it along at an electrified pace. I myself like Hush better than that song's studio version however. It's faster and the bass lines are woven in better to give it a livelier spirit. Plus I like how the build up tops out. \n\nOne More Rainy Day might seem like a very poppy track with that chorus but I really like this song and it still sounds consistent with the rest of the album. Nick Simper's bass again is very loud and it gives a slight atmosphere of gloom to offset the superficial happy sound of the vocals. I also enjoy Ritchie's licks on it as they have a rich ringing out on the later part of the track. The next track is labeled as a suite but basically it's little more than an extended intro tagged with another simple pop-oriented song. There's an almost stern transition by Ritchie that sounds like something I heard from a song I liked from The Guess Who. There are really only several different lyrics with the bulk of it being 'I'm so glad' over and over. This is another good song overall mostly because of Blackmore's guitar work especially in that solo. Mandrake Root has a beginning that sounds alot like something from Cream with it's classic rockish blues electric feel but it whirls into an orgy of solos much like The Mule from the later Fireball record. \n\nThere's not many Beatles songs that I can say had covers that were anything close to good as the originals. However, DP's cover of Help is the one song that actually trumps the Lennon/McCartney one. The lyrics for the original were way too upbeat and I agree that Deep Purple's version gives them a better appropriateness with a slowed down and cloudy tone. Evans enunciates the lines with a catchy aura of longing. I was quite taken with that wistful organ passage at the end. Another \"help\" song follows called Love Help Me and this other song sounds more in line with the Beatles than the Help cover. Aside from that, Love Help Me sounds more in particular like Strawberry Alarm Clock. It's very upbeat and has those same type of cheerful backing wails like Incense and Peppermints had along with those buzzy guitar fills. Lyrics like 'hoping someday for good news waiting for that girl choose' sounds like something Brian Wilson would write but again, this is still a great early Purple song that I enjoy for what it is and when it came out. \n\nI will come out and say it right now that Shades of Deep Purple is essential to have among In Rock, Fireball and Machine Head. Ritchie Blackmore is a great guitarist and his writing was something amazing even back in the band's start up days. As you can tell, this was not one of those bands that fizzled out after a catchy psychedelic album. This may only be a prelude of heavy metal to come from these guys but it should be valued for the loudness and instrumental gifts that the band had to display.\n",
        "\nI remember I used to buy Bananas in the store because I thought the front cover was funny. The cover is a perfect definition of the album itself: it\u2019s a funny record. I doubt Deep Purple were in a serious mood when they wrote these songs (with the exception of some). There\u2019s an overall relaxing atmosphere and songs with an uplifting mood. Especially when you take a look in the booklet and see Ian Gillan having to restrain himself from bursting out in laughs, Steve Morse looking very funny in the camera and the whole band having dressed themselves as tourists in a warm land, you can see the light atmosphere on the album reflecting in the bands attitude.\n\nWhere Abandon was a record that had an uninspiring balance between hard rockers and blues rockers or ballads, Bananas is one record full of the bluesy stuff. Though the riffs are not the most original and vocals are not what they used to be, the songs sound very spontaneous and relaxing. There is no \u201cChild in Time\u201d or \u201cHush\u201d on here to make this album become a masterpiece, but this release does not aim to become the next masterpiece, and I think Deep Purple have chosen this more relaxing style on purpose on their journey to retirement. They no longer try to surpass albums like Machine Head, Perfect Strangers or Stormbringer. This is a vacation CD, recorded by a band that likes going on vacation. There are songs that make you believe you\u2019re walking on an island full of banana trees like \u201cHouse of Pain\u201d and \u201cRazzle Dazzle\u201d, there are very inspiring ballads with at times even gospel influences like \u201cHaunted\u201d and \u201cNever a Word\u201d and there are songs with a more serious approach like \u201cSun Goes Down\u201d and \u201cSilver Tongue\u201d. Overall, I don\u2019t think there are abominations on this album are anything like a weak song. This album is built with all the songs as necessary bricks. Let\u2019s go a bit more into details.\n\nThe album opens with the light \u201cHouse of Pain\u201d. The relaxing riff we hear is not the most original one, but gets us in the perfect Banana-mood. We also have Ian Gillan give a high scream at the beginning, giving us a false idea about his voice still being good. On the rest of the album he does not pretend to sing high, like on Abandon, but stays within his safe range where he sounds good. The rest of the opening song is quite funny actually, hearing the backing vocals echo Gillans \u2018back to the house of pain\u2019. \u201cSun Goes Down\u201d begins slightly more serious, with a great Hammond intro by Don Airey, and then results into a more serious riff. Highlight of this song is the verse just after the interplay when only Gillan and drummer Ian Paice are playing. Gillans vocals really shine there. Next we have a beautiful ballad with gospel-esque backing vocals in the shape of \u201cHaunted\u201d. It\u2019s really something new for Deep Purple to have a song like this, but the theme is beautiful and Gillan performs well. One of my favorite songs from this album is \u201cRazzle Dazzle\u201d. Despite the somewhat odd title it does contain a great relaxing blues rock tune, making you feel surrounded by bananas. Also this riff is not very original, but I really like the outcome of it. We continue on a more serious note on the rhythmic \u201cSilver Tongue\u201d and on the slow bluesy \u201cWalk On\u201d. When the guitar intro to \u201cPicture of Innocence\u201d begins we are back to the relaxing part of the album. This guitar intro solo is really great and the song that follows after it also has this laid back feel to it. Especially the chorus is notable with its raving vocals and lyrics.\n\nAs we hear the somewhat troublesome intro to \u201cI Got Your Number\u201d we are surprised to hear a riff that heavily reminds me of the music in the old pc game Blake Stone. Probably and hopefully just coincidence though. The chorus of this song is of the same level of the intro and somewhat hard to grasp, but the bridge and the solos totally makes up for it. The gentle ballad \u201cNever a Word\u201d takes the level of seriousness slightly upwards with a very relaxingly gentle instrumental first half. The second half of the song features Gillans falsetto voice and he does a great job there. Then there\u2019s the title track \u201cBananas\u201d. By the time you\u2019ve reached this song you\u2019ll be totally convinced that Deep Purple have actually gone bananas. The main riff is happy, just like on \u201cRazzle Dazzle\u201d and \u201cHouse of Pain\u201d, and the verses feature some rock \u2018n roll influences and a harmonica playing fills. They implemented an odd time signature though and that\u2019s probably what attracts your attention first. As far as I understood the lyrics are about nothing. Then there\u2019s highlight \u201cDoing It Tonight\u201d. I think most will discard this song as being \u2018unoriginal\u2019 or \u2018not Deep Purple\u2019. The riff is indeed not the most original riff ever created, but the outcome of the song is delicious. The verses, the solo and the main theme... I love it. All seriousness has faded from this album and one more glimpse at Ian Gillans picture in the booklet will make us realize what Bananas really is: a record by a band that is making music solely for fun. The album is nicely closed by instrumental \u201cContact Lost\u201d, featuring a beautiful gentle guitar solo by Steve Morse.\n\nSo this album is relaxing, fun and light. It\u2019s a great album to just play while you\u2019re doing something. It creates such a light atmosphere that you just get totally happy after listening to it. For the full experience a legal copy of the CD is recommended, since you\u2019ll have the pictures and the funny front cover. If you can accept all that I said in this review, then I\u2019ll recommend this album to you.\n\nStrongest songs: \u201cHaunted\u201d, \u201cRazzle Dazzle\u201d and \u201cDoing It Tonight\u201d.\n\nhttp://thecryreviews.blogspot.com/\n",
        "\nAfter a lot of drama and the departure of original guitarist Ritchie Blackmore, Deep Purple managed to deliver a quite successful album in 1996 known as Purpendicular with their new guitarist Steve Morse. Whether its follow-up is a good album is hard to say. Abandon is a bit of a transition record, with still elements of hard rock to be found here, but with the laid back blues rock gaining the upper hand a little. I say a little here because it\u2019s not as dominant as on 2003\u2019s Bananas yet. This makes Abandon a good record, but quite far from memorable.\n\nThe whole band does seem to be in shape. Ian Paice\u2019s drums sound very clear and powerful, Jon Lords Hammond sounds very clear, Roger Glovers bass sounds very solid and Steve Morse\u2019s sound is really cool and his solos do impress me. It is Ian Gillan however who sometimes is to blame for a song to fail. Ever since the reunion of Deep Purple in 1984 his voice has been declining. Although at times he sounds clear and cool, on songs like \u201cAlmost Human\u201d he really sounds hoarse and tired. His high notes are also not what they used to be and that really should encourage the man not to try and hit them anymore, like he does on Bananas. His vocal performance however is not so terrible that it ruins the entire album. The album starts with a very strong vocal performance, which decreases its strength halfway through though. \u201cAny Fule Kno That\u201d is a really cool opener with a powerful guitar riff and a powerful rap by our beloved Gillan, which he does quite cool. There are solos by both Lord and Morse and they really fit the song. This is a great and unique way to open the album. The fine line is continued for the next five songs. \u201cAlmost Human\u201d will be noticed for its catchy chorus and \u201cDon\u2019t Make Me Happy\u201d begins as a clich\u00e9 blues song that reminds slightly of 70s Deep Purple, mainly due to Gillans vocals in the verses. In the chorus things will get back to the 90s and the whole results in some quality bluesy power ballad. This song is a very good one and definitely stands out, especially the solo. Then there is \u201cSeventh Heaven\u201d with its heavy riff featuring a pinch harmonic which is very unlike Deep Purple. This is one of the more rocking songs on this release but doesn\u2019t really stand out, except for the solo which is being played on a very bluesy interpretation of the hard rock riff.\n\nThen we are suddenly welcomed into \u201cWatching the Sky\u201d with a doomy Dio-esque intro, soon resolving into another bluesy hard rock riff. The verses are being reduced to a gentle ballad-ish part where Gillan uses his falsetto voice a little, and then they explode to the riff again to form the chorus. It doesn\u2019t really stand out, just like \u201cSeventh Heaven\u201d, but it has got its moments, such as the \u201cfury and madness\u201d-part. Last of the enjoyable tracks on a row is \u201cFingers to the Bone\u201d with a great guitar theme throughout combined with one of Gillans better performances on the album. This song almost has an epic feel to it; the themes on the verses and the chorus are so cool, and the piano solo adds the finishing touch. Now we\u2019re at the end of the row we have a row of three songs before us that just radiate pure boredom with all of them being unoriginal, uninspiring and downright boring. They all have a laid back rhythm throughout, terrible vocals and such lameness. Those songs probably would\u2019ve fit better on Bananas but I\u2019m glad they\u2019re not on there either since Bananas\u2019 songs are still better than this. This is clich\u00e9 blues to the bone without effort being put into them. It seems they needed some filler material; else this album would\u2019ve been quite good. The titles are also so very uninspiring: \u201cJack Ruby\u201d, \u201cShe Was\u201d and \u201cWhatsername\u201d. Especially the last mentioned title seems really uninspired. I guess it\u2019s songs like these that restrain newer Deep Purple albums from getting high rates nowadays. I mean, if you really want to create music like this then just do it right at once and create an entire album like this, like 2003\u2019s Bananas.\n\nThe album ends quite stylish actually. \u201c\u201969\u201d is a fast-paced hard rocker with really good drumming and a powerful driving force throughout the song. It also has a really inventive solo part. Gillans voice is not too good on here, but at least not disturbing. Then there's \u201cEvil Louie\u201d. This song evidently fits with the three uninspired ones in style, but hey, this one actually has beauty! It starts off in the laid back rhythm like \u201cJack Ruby\u201d, but somehow this one sounds much better. A good but simple riff, and just before the chorus we have a beautiful instrumental part with the guitar playing beautiful arpeggios. Then the chorus turns out much more powerful than something like \u201cWhatsername\u201d. It seems Deep Purple CAN still do it, but just don\u2019t always have the inspiration. As a last treat Purple decided to re-record the classic song \u201cBloodsucker\u201d, now entitled \u201cBludsucker\u201d. This version sounds good and fits well on the album, but the original is a lot better for two reasons. The first is the most obvious: Gillans voice. He takes good care of the lower register part, but the \u201cOh no no no!\u201d sounds just... not good. I must admit that he does still sound powerful here on his lower register though. The last verse is a bit spoiled, since he tried to imitate the original version where he goes sky high. The second reason is Steve Morse. I think it is very good that he plays his own solo and does not copy Blackmore\u2019s solo, but in the end people want to compare. Where Morse is mostly showing his technical abilities here, shredding like hell, Blackmore used to rely more on his feel in the music rather than his technical abilities. Of course, it also differs on the type of guitarist, but my preference goes to Blackmore\u2019s solo.\n\nAfter this detailed look upon the album, I conclude that Abandon is a good album, but definitely not good enough. There are some nice songs, some songs sound even great, but there\u2019s nothing truly magnificent. Nothing of the quality they used to have. There is also a disturbing amount of fillers on this album that drastically reduces my rating for Abandon, and makes me abandon this release. Overall, this album is good, but definitely not memorable, and perhaps even forgettable. I recommend this to Deep Purple fans, but if you are new with the band you should check out their Mark II stuff first.\n\nStrongest tracks: \u201cDon\u2019t Make Me Happy\u201d, \u201cFingers to the Bone\u201d and \u201cEvil Louie\u201d.\nWeakest tracks: \u201cJack Ruby\u201d and \u201cShe Was\u201d.\n\nhttp://thecryreviews.blogspot.com/\n",
        "\nStormbringer is no doubt the most interesting Deep Purple album ever put out, it has a weird mixture of funk, soul, and blues. Stormbringer has got to be the most unique Deep Purple album. It's unique because of the combination of the different genres, and because if somebody heard this album, but didn't know what band it was, Deep Purple would most likely be the last band they would think of when quizzed about it.\n\nWhen people think of Deep Purple, this is definitely the last album they would imagine to be apart of the Purple discography. Every band has that one album where it sounds nothing like something the band would normally produce. Stormbringer is definitely that album for Purple. It's a shame that most people, when a band experiments with a new style/sound, automatically disown it and refuse to acknowledge it as an album from whatever band. Albums like Stormbringer, obscure part of Purple's discography, deserved to be acknowledged and listened to, because it shows a different side of Purple that really shows that Blackmore is a versatile guitarist.\n\nThe first time I heard this album, I was immediately turned off by the intro keyboards on the title track. It was just too weird and funky for me to appreciate. After listening to the album several times after that, I realized it's a great album with some masterful song writing that perfectly combines the elements of funk, soul, blues, and rock.\n\nThe title track, is the strongest song on the album. It has a catchy riff, great melodies and great song structure. The solo is melodic and it really fits with the song wonderfully.\n\nI wouldn't really say that there's a really weak track on this album. Every track is different as it jumps around with different elements of the genres already mentioned in this interview, being the forefront for each different track. The track 'Hold On' sounds like it would be something from some old school motown band. 'You Can't Do It Right' is definitely the funkiest song on the album, the bass really stands in the forefront and has a real funk bass lines. 'Soldier Of Fortune' is definitely one of the best ballads ever and it's a great way to close the album. Most bands put ballads in the middle of an album, which sort of ruin the flow of it if the rest of the album isn't ballad-like, but ending the album with a ballad, is a good way to close an album.\n\nStormbringer is a very interesting, unique, and truly underrated masterpiece from a line-up that doesn't seem to get enough love like it deserves. Both Burn and Stormbringer are amazing albums.\n\nThis album definitely is for a more established Purple fan, rather than someone just getting into it, because they could very easily be turned off by it. It doesn't have the heaviness that traditional Purple albums have. Stormbringer is a great album to just relax and get stoned while listening. Stormbringer is the perfect stoner album.\n",
        "\nDeep Purple is one of the best examples of a band who transformed from the very pinnacle of excellence (i.e. their early work) to the blackest, deepest pit of suck when they decided to start writing mainstream rock in the 80s. Stormbringer was pretty much the cutoff for me, and I try to envision a world in which the band ceased to exist after that. Conversely, I feel the band has been criminally underrated during its first decade, aside from \"Smoke on the Water\" and maybe \"Highway Star\", there are a lot of empty stares and blank check faces when it comes to this band. An unbearable travesty, seeing that they released an impressive list of albums in the 70s. The Book of Taliesyn is their second, named for the Welsh poet.\n\nOne of the fascinating things about this album was that a large chunk of it consists of covers. Neil Diamond's \"Kentucky Woman\" is given a groovy rocking spin with some nice organ solos. Ike & Tina Turners' \"River Deep Mountain High\" is recreated with love, in fact I'd consider this the de facto version, Rod Evans' vocals do it a dirty psychedelic justice. The other cover here is the Beatles' \"We Can Work It Out\" which comes in after the original \"Exposition\". This is likewise given the Purple treatment with a soulful but harder rocking style, full of 'freak out'.\n\nAs for the originals, each is a memorable slice of psychedelic rock with a dash DP's prototypical heavy metal leanings. \"Listen, Learn, Read On\" has some fuzzy, deep guitar grooves as it meanders between funk soul and searing rock & roll. Not far from The Doors, really, a vibe that persists throughout the album. Instrumental \"Wring That Neck\" steps in with a dual organ/guitar blues over a stepping bassline, it proceeds to burn through some solos and has a very live, raw feeling to it. \"Exposition\" is another instrumental, with more of an epic, shuffling soundtrack vibe. Killer organs and driving percussion define its thundering scope. \"Shield\" is one of my favorites, a mellow song with some percussive guitar picking simmered in pianos and moody vocal lines, lifting up slightly for its chorus. The final original track \"Anthem\" is highly bluesy and atmospheric, but possessing a majestic chorus. Sounds like the Doors and Beatles jamming with a really cool keyboard and violin bridge. Ritchie Blackmore and Jon Lord are all over this album.\n\nAnd that's really the gist of it. If you fancy 60s-70s psychedelic rock which would help lay the foundation for the harder and heavier styles to come, you will find it worthwhile to track down just about anything Deep Purple previous to 1980. The Book of Taliesyn succeeds despite a rather large percentage of cover material, which was fairy common practice for an album in those days. It does share some similarities to other popular rock bands of its era: The Who, The Doors, The Beatles, Led Zeppelin. If you have a natural attraction to this style, but missed Purple (they were never quite as popular), you should seriously think about tracking this down, as well as Shades of Deep Purple, In Rock, Fireball, Machine Head and the amazing Concerto for Group and Orchestra. Despite their age, they all sound great to this day.\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nI was amazed to see that this fine album only had one review...one! Here's the thing: if you like Deep Purple, and you've never heard this album, you need to get it now. Really, right now. Put away the famous Machine Head; it will still be waiting for you when you're done. Okay, have you listened to it? Wasn't that well worth it?\n\nIt is sad that so many people who enjoy heavy metal (or any hard rock, for that matter) judge Deep Purple by one song. And we all know what that song is. We've all learned to play it on the guitar. Forget that song, though. Fireball shows many more sides of Deep Purple, and demonstrates more completely how this band has managed to survive over so many years and so many lineup changes. From the opening air-conditioner sound of \"Fireball,\" to the last notes of \"No One Came,\" this album shows what these heavy metal pioneers could do when they were on their game, before the egos began to run amok. Sure, In Rock may be a more crucial album for the beginning of the heavy metal sound, but Fireball is certainly more diverse.\n\nFor one thing, Gillan has rarely sounded better than he does on this album. The aforementioned \"Fireball\" is a tour de force of classic hard rock singing. But his voice is capable of great subtlety as well, and you get to hear this (and the famous Ian Gillan sense of humor) on the admittedly non-metal track \"Anyone's Daughter.\" A tale of a young lad's sexual escapades in a small town, \"Anyone's Daughter\" will crack you up, if you listen to the lyrics. \n\nJon Lord and Ritchie Blackmore are absolute equals on this record, and the organ and guitar trade licks back and forth, and demonstrate how well-deserved the reputations of these two musicians are. (Fireball was clearly recorded before Blackmore's ego got so incredibly out of control, as it later would.) Meanwhile, the powerful, solid bass playing of Roger Glover and the tight drumming of Ian Paice are a solid foundation upon which the other musicians rest. The title track \"Fireball\" is perhaps the best example of how all five musicians combined to create what would later become the sound we know today as heavy metal. Gillan's screaming vocals, the driving rhythms, the guitar riffs--\"Fireball\" was obviously the inspiration for later metal bands (I've heard Lars Ulrich cite the album as one of his favorites in several interviews).\n\nSo yes, In Rock may have been more seminal, and Machine Head may have been more famous, but Fireball is Deep Purple at their classic best. Give it a listen. You will be happy you did.\n",
        "\nSure, this may not be \"heavy metal\" in the purest sense, but let me tell you confidently, this album rocks harder than 99% of the other stuff being released as hard rock today. As fathers of the heavy metal genre, Purple deserve a certain amount of respect, and I respect them even more for not resting on their reputation, and continuing to produce a high level of hard rock. (Not to mention, very few bands composed of much younger musicians can sustain the amount of touring that DP still do every year.)\n\nMy first thought before hearing Rapture of the Deep (I had not heard their previous album, Bananas) was \"I can't believe Jon Lord left the band; will this even sound like Deep Purple?\" Well, I heard the opening organ riffs of the album, and Don Airey immediately won me over. He is an exceptional organist, who can play with almost as much technique and power as the great Jon Lord. But I would be doing the band a grave disservice, if I reduced the work of the band down to one member's input. After all, some Deep Purple fans STILL complain about Richie Blackmore's absence. C'mon folks, it's time to accept the truth: Richie's gone, he ain't coming back, and Steve Morse is a guitarist who has \"earned his stripes,\" so to speak. Morse has been more of an asset to Deep Purple's sound in his many years in Purple, and has probably contributed more to the continuing success of the band than Blackmore ever did. Don't get me wrong, Richie Blackmore is a talented guitarist, and I will always treasure his work with Deep Purple. But if we were to give him a report card for his work with DP, it would probably have to say \"does not work well with others\" somewhere on it. So, let me say categorically, Steve Morse and Don Airey are true Deep Purple members, and together, they know how to make the sparks fly. \n\nThen, of course, there is the mighty Ian Paice. This is a drummer who has always known how to lay it down...solidly. Rapture of the Deep is no exception. Once again, from the very opening of the album, Paice's work is a solid rhythmic foundation upon which the rest of the band can build their majestic house of rock. Roger Glover, as always, is there for beautiful bass work, which leads me to what has always been my favorite thing about Purple...Ian Gillan. The voice! This is a man who is about the same age as my father, and he is sounding better than he has in years! The screams, the edge, the sense of humor...it's all there on this record. Many rock 'n' roll fans will wax rhapsodic about Robert Plant, but for my money's worth, Gillan has always been the hard rock vocalist who has set the bar. And he's continuing to set it...HIGH...on Rapture of the Deep.\n\nI don't think there's a weak track on this album. Some of my favorites: Money Talks (a tremendous opener, sets the tone for the whole record); the title track (sweet, sweet, SWEET organ and guitar); MTV (funny, funky, and true--a wry observation on the foibles of classic rock radio). I'm telling you, if you've fallen into the trap of dismissing Deep Purple as dinosaurs, or as simply \"the guys who did Smoke on the Water in the 70s,\" go get this album, and have your eyes opened. Deep Purple is rocking and rolling in a way that very few bands (many of them composed of much younger musicians) are doing in this pop-loving age.\n",
        "\nSo here it is; a compilation from the band with about one thousand compilations. Not to worry, it\u2019s the only one I have, in the shape of an old Bulgarian-made LP from 1978 which is, shall we say, well past its prime in terms of physical state, although the sound itself is pretty decent. The Singles A's and B's is only the sixth compilation out of the band\u2019s present total of 42 (!), containing, as its name would imply, a bunch of singles from the first ten years of Deep Purple\u2019s career.\n\nWith no real previous knowledge of Deep Purple, I immediately picked up on some of these songs when listening to the compilation. Tracks like Hush and Hallelujah aren\u2019t original Deep Purple compositions although the band nevertheless did a good job of turning these songs into good, catchy singles of their own. The music here consists of a mixture of classic rock and of the band\u2019s first manifestations of heavy metal, although the latter influence is only present on certain songs, certainly not on the covers. This is especially the case on the fourth track, Wring That Neck, which is actually an instrumental and features a considerable heavy metal influence throughout. Don\u2019t ask me what an instrumental song is doing on a best singles compilation, I don\u2019t know. Other considerably more metal than rock songs are the Deep Purple classics, Speed King and Fireball, with the latter having a great, if somewhat short, solo to top it all off. \n\nMany of the songs, especially those more oriented towards to rock side of things, feature very catchy choruses and even verses since they are, after all, singles destined to catch the easily swayed public\u2019s attention. This doesn\u2019t make said tracks anywhere near bad, they\u2019re actually quite enjoyable and, in a way, highlights on the album, especially if the listener doesn\u2019t necessarily seek out too much heavy metal. Such highlights include the two covers, Hush and Hallelujah, as well as Emmaretta and One More Rainy Day, incidentally all on the A side of the LP. One thing that\u2019s common for every single song on this compilation is that 1970\u2019s and sometimes late 1960\u2019s feel they have to them. Obviously I wasn\u2019t around back then to be able to reminisce about the period but the sound here truly does evoke those decades. \n\nIn the end, The Singles A's and B's is an enjoyable concentration of the band\u2019s first singles. It\u2019s also an interesting perspective into the early years of Deep Purple, although not all the songs are perfect. While they\u2019re actually quite variable in terms of quality, don\u2019t let either this simple fact nor the existence of 42 distinct compilations by this band deter you from obtaining this cool piece of music. The compilation\u2019s cover is also pretty cool, adding an interesting if ultimately unimportant element its overall quality.\n",
        "\nIf one were to expect an album simliar to \"Burn\" then that person is going to be thrown in for a loop. The remarkable thing is that both \"Burn\" and the album being reviewed, \"Stormbringer\", were released the same year yet both have significantly different sound and style to them. It may have something to do with the amount of drugs being taken by Glenn Hughes and David Coverdale, but that is a discussion for another day. The one aspect that is evident is the amount of blues and soul infused into the songs and it is understandable why master axe man Ritchie Blackmore would be upset.\n\nThe songs that shine on here are the ones Ritchie goes full force with his famous Fender Stratocaster and when his riff playing is the main component featured. His catchy, intricate up-tempo riffing is the main highlight found here. This also brings out the brilliance of Jon Lord because the double team of his keyboards and Ritchie's guitar playing is unmatched by any other band.\n\nThe dueling vocals of David Coverdale and Glenn Hughes return and again they are very impressive to hear. Hughes shows his soulful vocal chords on \"Holy Man\" and \"Hold On\" and Coverdale's screeching, bluesy voice complements it perfectly. The way they play off each other is impressive and unique to this version of Deep Purple.\n\nHowever, where \"Burn\" succeeded is where \"Stormbringer\" failed. For one, the drumming of Ian Paice is severely toned down, mostly doing a simple, blues type of beat and is not the wild, frantic kind we all know and love from him. The guy is a great musician, but you would not know it from this album. Another is the prevalence of the funky bass playing by Glenn Hughes. It just sounds annoying and is not enjoyable. \"Love Don't Mean a Thing\", and \"Hold On\" just drag the album down with no awesome riffing and having an overload of blues in them. Then \"You Can't Do It Right\" is a pure funk song and it is embarrassingly bad especially with the trippy chorus.\n\nWhile a listener of this album maybe frustrated on what is going on, the last song will cure a lot of it. \"Soldier of Fortune\" is an acoustic track song sung by Coverdale and it is very melodic and beautifully done and might bring on a few tears. It is very melancholic and the inclusion of the violin in the background furthur adds to it and is one of the best Deep Purple songs.\n\n\"Stormbringer\" is an album that will frustrate listeners as it is rather hit-and-miss. There are some very enjoyable moments found on here though and is worth the purchase. Some may like the bigger inclusion of blues and funk, but it just does not fit Deep Purple. With that being said, this still gets a good score and is still a good Purple record. This would be Ritchie's swansong as he would go on to form Rainbow because he did not like the direction of the band. Don't let that fact deter you from buying this though as it is certainly something to listen to.\n",
        "\nLegends, keyboards, icons, road-pavers\u2026what else can be said about Deep Purple? The status-quo enjoys ranting about \u201cMachine Head\u201d or other timeless releases, yet items created after the pay-day bonanza are left in the dark, forever lonely. Shame on those that willingly ignored everything conceived past \u201cPurpendicular.\u201d The dawn looks on 2005, when the elderly faction produced a mega-fast follow up after 2003\u2019s \u201cBananas\u201d with \u201cRapture of the Deep,\u201d another conception attributing the MK-pi lineup of Ian Gillian, Steve Morse on guitar, Ian Paice still drumming, Roger Glover, and the unknown Don Airey that replaced John Lord after his sudden departure. Perhaps this explains why Deep Purple hath experienced modern-day banishment. However, \u201cRapture of the Deep\u201d is fantastic: epic, cruising, catchy, and one of their best. Quite a gutsy claim, yet the group progresses beyond their usual formula without flaw; again, they show us why Deep Purple has become Deep Purple. They might not have the strength to lift a stack of papers because of old age, but if you can still rock better than your competition, forget those papers! Pick up those instruments, and make me deaf, damn it! \n\nBlackmore and Lord are not present here due to unrelated departures, but do not fear potential dissatisfactions! \u201cRapture of the Deep\u201d flows in an experimental light when being compared to previous offerings Deep Purple conjured, but only bright glows can be found in the chameleon\u2019s change. Steve Morse has been often viewed like a black sheep, mainly because of his former work as a progressive rock guru; however, his touches from the other side are magical. Morse\u2019s dazzling powers create complicated riffs and insane solos alongside the usual rock side (which rules, I might add) without leading things astray. The riff on the title track, for instance, spells Arabic-folk influences rather than thumping hard rock; although different, it is ultimately the record\u2019s highlight. \n\nDon Airey also fills big shoes like it was his lifelong test, only to match John Lord\u2019s finger-plucking effortlessly. Dripping organs as a waterfall does mist, his atmospheric additions and nutty leads are completely motivating upon this identity. What\u2019s there to say about Ian Paice and Roger Grover? They continue testing themselves: Grover improves his finger-madness to dangerous levels, while Paice tames the percussion with iron sticks and hands quick as sound itself. Now connect them together, and the door opens: progressive-influenced hard rock preaching mighty dynamism. Lyrically, Deep Purple seems a little pissed off, particularly on \u201cMTV\u201d in which the television station receives a verbal haymaker for praising trendy artists instead of well-developed bands; kindly impolite, that\u2019s how you assault with words. Organs, ripping solos, groovy bass, spastic percussion\u2026I\u2019ve reached my rapture! \n\nAh Ian Gillian, are you just a wonder singer, or the second coming of Christ? We may never know. Regardless, this great vocalist delivers his finest performance in years, or possibly since he joined (or rejoined, or re-rejoined) Deep Purple before time was created. Although in his sixties at the recording, Gillian still nails high-pitched notes with ease, dabbles in bluesy tones, and generally does what we\u2019ve always expected. Throughout certain passages, the original Jesus Christ Superstar adds corky tints unto his shining vocals, like the humorous questioning placed towards the conclusion on \u201cMoney Talks.\u201d Again, Gillian\u2019s voice could survive on its own, yet that kind of stuff just rules. Can he ever fall? \u201cNo,\u201d said the judge.\n\nDeep Purple is far from dead, folks! As an insurrection of their age, \u201cRapture of the Deep\u201d is groundbreaking upon this liberation for a new day; they could have relied on basic norms, but newness was applied instead. Quite so, I find our presented record alike a paroxysm, slamming and bashing the listener with everything these gentlemen have, but while staying loyal towards what this respectful tribe always achieves: clumps of consistency, always bouncy and entertaining. \u201cRapture of the Deep\u201d is the eighteenth record Deep Purple has created within multiple decades of staying louder than everything else, and I can only give you one warning: your shit will be rocked!\n\nThis review was written for: www.leviatan-magazine.com\n",
        "\nI've been a Deep Purple fan for a long time, but only recently got hold of this album. I suspect my situation is a similar one for many other Purple fans, who are no doubt familiar with the band's 70s material, Perfect Strangers, but have only come across one or two songs they've done since. As it happens, they've released a string of solid albums since Richie Blackmore's departure, of which this is arguably the best.\n\nSure, you can really hear that Richie is no longer in the band, but Steve Morse really does do a phenomenal job of working with the rest of the classic MKII lineup. This album has everything. Ted The Mechanic, A Castle Full of Rascals, Hey Cisco and others have that typical organ-laden heavy Deep Purple sound, whilst other songs are a little more of a departure, in a good way. Sometimes I Feel Like Screaming is a true epic, and one of the best songs the band have ever done, Rosa's Cantina is surpisingly bluesy, and there's some folkish touches, particularly on the amazingly pretty The Aviator. \n\nIt's not the heaviest album in the band's career, but it's possibly their most beautiful. It's almost as essential as Fireball, In Rock, Machine Head and Burn, and miles better than Perfect Strangers even if it lacks the obvious hits.\n",
        "\nI know a lot of people find Stormbringer too mellow, but without proving those people wrong I would say this is probably Deep Purple\u2019s most underrated album.\n\nOK, most tracks are less heavy than the ones on Burn and a lot less heavy than the ones on In Rock or Fireball. But the fact of the matter is that Stormbringer provides us with very strong songwriting. The bulk of the album was written by vocalists Hughes and Coverdale with only a minor role for guitarist - and enfant terrible - Blackmore. This results in a more varied set of songs bearing influences from soul, funk and (especially) blues. Keeping that in mind there is still enough fire in this with heavier songs like Stormbringer and Highball Shooter, who both have killer riffs. The mellow side of the album is probably best represented by the saddest song ever written by Deep Purple: Holy Man. However the very best song is saved for last: Soldier of Fortune, \u201cthe best ballad ever written\u201d (in the words of Opeth\u2019s Mikael \u00c5kerfeldt that is). Although Stormbringer is slightly mellow, die hard fans of Blackmore and Lords still get enough inventive guitar riffs and keyboards solo parts.\n\nSo if people would just give this album a chance, they would find themselves listening to a great record.\n",
        "\nYes indeed, not many people think this is essential DP but dammit all, I LOVE it! After all this contains the first ever speed metal song. And you though \"Highway Star\" was the first, shame on you! Besides that song there is of course \"Strange Kind of Woman,\" \"Demon's Eye,\" the trippy \"No No No\" and \"The Mule.\" That's as classic as they come, at least to me they are!\n\nAlright, let's start with the first speed metal song ever, \"Fireball!\" Why this and not \"Highway Star?\" Well for starters it's faster and it's got a really nice riff. Also it has Ian Paice on DOUBLE BASS! It doesn't get more speed metal than that! Gillan's singing here is magnificent, not to mention Glover's bass solo. About the only thing this song lacks is a guitar solo, that is present and accounted for in the instrumental version. I actually prefer the instrumental version more than the album version because it sounds better and it doesn't fade out.\n\nSo after this masterwork, they decide they can't beat it and play different styles. You know what? It works! Sure, \"No No No\" or \"Strange Kind of Woman\" aren't exactly metal numbers, but for DP this actually works. They hearken back to the old trippy, psychedelic MK I songs that most people seem keen to sweep under the rug. There IS a reason why that line-up was successful in America (let's forget about the disgraceful incident in the 80s with Evans, shall we?).\n\nProductionwise, this album is slightly more polished than In Rock. Now that could either be a curse or a blessing depending on your point of view, but I like it. The drums are just right, not too loud, not too soft. The guitar tone rules for '71, and Ritchie's playing is top-notch, as always. Gillan's voice doesn't sound to distorted here and he seems to be more comfortable with singing. Glover's bass is also very clear, a trait most metal bands don't have. Jon Lord's organs are slightly buried, but when it's solo time he comes shining through.\n\nSo, should you get it? Why, yes! Be sure to get the 25th anniversary release, its got lots of bonus tracks and really detailed liner notes.\n",
        "\nDeep Purple had an impressive run of four albums in the early 70's: First, the incredible In Rock. Fireball, the album that has always felt like it was shorter than it really is. Machine Head, with its sm\u00f6rgasbord of classics. And finally, to top it all off, the irrefutable proof that the band was not just a studio phenomenon, Made in Japan, one of the best five live albums ever, no matter what the genre or year. Who Do We Think We Are was to be the swansong of the legendary Deep Purple Mark II, until the reunion with the superb Perfect Strangers more than a decade later brought them back together.\n\nBut was it a worthy swansong? Well, it's a swansong, and by definition, a swansong usually means that the band is in trouble, something does not work, and the creative well is getting too dry to pump. The line-up changes before Burn resulted in a much better album, even if Glenn Hughes lacked the self-criticism necessary to keep his mouth shut. The loss of ruthless quality since Made in Japan, released just two months earlier, is incredible, and the album can only be seen as too mellow a piece of work.\n\nIf Machine Head contained such classics as Highway Star, Smoke on the Water and Space Truckin', the only claim to fame Who Do We Think We Are has is the low-testosterone, sheepishly lame, and completely aggressionless Woman from Tokyo. 24 Carat Purple, the first compilation worth mentioning after the album, serves as a proof of the softness of Who Do We Think We Are: Woman from Tokyo is the only track - perhaps, debatably, together with the sub-par Never Before - that feels out of place among such monsters as Speed King and Child in Time. Not worthy; does not belong. Who Do We Think We Are is definitely not among the important Deep Purple albums that had a profound effect on the early metal scene, constituted a lasting body of works that still finds itself on people's turntables, and served as their ticket to the Metal Archives. No, it essentially is a 70's rock album, and should be judged as such.\n\n70's rock, of course, is a broad definition, but the album is just that. There are a few softer tunes, the bluesy Place in Line, Mary Long with silly lyrics and a few twists in the melody, and generally a softish distortion on the guitar. And, of course, the Hammond; to be honest, Jon Lord's Hammond sound didn't seem out of place or ancient on the House of Blue Light tour in 1987, but nowadays the aged instrument can only be found on albums that work really, really hard to have that retro feeling. \n\nWell, is it worthy as a rock album, then? Well, it depends. It's not bad. But it's not magnificient, either. The sound is very 70's, the songs are very 70's and even the cover art is very 70's. The production effects used on Super Trouper, for example, are so very, very 70's. The whole reeks of the 70's in every possible respect, and since then, the wheel of time has turned and crushed many things from the 70's without remorse. Who Do We Think We Are can be found among the powdered victims, but the surprising thing here is the fact that the four albums before it stood under the crushing weight of three and a half decades, and suffered only tiny cracks on their production values and a few scattered songs among the powerful masterpieces. In any case, if looked upon without the bias that the band name forces on it, the album is mediocre, but not forgettable piece of the early 70's. It's the 70's condensed, let's rate it at 70%. And that's about it. Thank you.\n\nBut since a lot of people either love or hate reviews that run off on a random tangent, it's time to do exactly that, just for the sake of entertainment and random irritation; if you have a feeling you'll be irritated by the following speculation, please stop reading here. You see, Deep Purple's career has some intriguing parallels with that of Black Sabbath, but nobody seems to notice them. It's time to put the cat on the table, as the finnish figure of speech goes, and take a good look at it.\n\nBlack Sabbath is the band that created, in the opinion of a lot of people, the whole musical concept of heavy metal. This can be debated, of course, and there are a lot of opposing opinions. But if we, for the sake of this useless argument, assume that that is true, we must take a look at later developments. Sabbath continued their career, and according to some, gave birth to doom and stoner metal, too, as if it wasn't enough to create the great mother genre itself.\n\nWhat, you may ask, does this have to do with Deep Purple? Well, it's simple, actually. If you look at the works of Deep Purple, especially the Four Great Albums mentioned above, it would be trivially easy to claim other genres as inventions of Gillan, Blackmore, Paice, Lord and Glover. Speed King, Fireball and Highway Star? Obvious proto-speed metal, partly before the birth of heavy metal itself. Speed King, at least, would definitely work as a pure speed metal song, if covered by a suitably oriented band. The Mule? Whoa, we have a pretty epic proto-doom metal song from 1971 in our hands! Child in Time? An obvious predecessor of the Opethian branch of progressive metal, of course.\n\nBut Who Do We Think We Are? It's got nothing in the way of genre-defining epicness, no thrash or death metal on it (because, hey, we've already exhausted the rest of the potential genres here)? Well, listen to Rat Bat Blue. A rock song, you say? Yes, yes it is. But hold your horses and wait until the keyboard solo, listen carefully, and you'll surely hear it, the thing that would spawn the finnish branch of power metal thirty years later: roughly thirty seconds of neo-classically tinted keyboard soloing, with an irritating synthetic cembalo/harpsichord sound, played at high tempo, rather detached from the rest of the song. Yes, it took almost three decades before Stratovarius & al. realized it's a good idea, but Purple did power metal before anyone else...\n\nNah, just kidding, of course; the same song has \"Woo-hoo!\"s that were faithfully copied by Michael Jackson in the mid 80's, but hopefully nobody will claim Deep Purple invented the music Mr. (Ms.?) Jackson performs today. It's just a coincidence, but still, it's a coincidence that shows that there's rarely anything that hasn't been done before, by someone, somewhere.\n\nYup, this a mediocre and half-boring piece of early 70's rock, and contains no genre-spawning great ideas. It's not a bad album, but should you stand in front of the CD shelf at a store wondering how to invest your precious allowance, get the four earlier ones before this one.\n",
        "\nA classic! That's what this album is, a classic in every sense of the word. The influence this piece had in other bands is also enormous, many of today's speed and heavy metal acts wouldn't play if this record hadn't came out. Yes, it's that influential.\n\nFirst of all, the ability and skills of the musicians are unquestionable.\nIan Gillan is one of my favourite singers ever and is a major influence to so many vocalists \u2013 ask Bruce Dickinson, for example, about his influences and you will see. The guy can hit almost any note he wants to; a pretty good example is the pre-chorus of Highway Star, where he screams like he is going to die. Albeit the fantastic performance, I still prefer the one on In Rock. In fact, I'm having a hard time deciding the percentage that I will give to this piece - I mean, I love this record, but I also love In Rock, so it's hard for me to decide which album I will give the best rating. Meh.\n\nAbout the guitar playing... I think everyone here knows who is Ritchie Blackmore, the guy is an idol to thousands and thousands of guitarists, his solos are pretty damn impressive and about the riffs... Well, he is one of the best \u201criff-makers\u201d, if you ask me - just hear the unforgettable first one on Smoke and Water... Priceless. Many times, the guitar solos are accompanied by some keyboard ones, very much a la Dream Theater, courtesy of Lord, another legend.\nThe bass playing is very good too and audible, that's the most important thing, as I can't hear the bass guitar on the majority of the records I know.\n\nAnd now, another legend and one of my favourite musicians ever... Ian Paice. Yes, I play the drums so I can tell you that that guy influences me a LOT. He isn't playing anything ultra-complex on the record, but his playing has \u201cfeel\u201d, you know, he doesn't sound like a robot trying to play hard things (like the majority of the skilled drummers of today). Each line he plays adds something more to the song, from the fast fills of Space Truckin' to the drum solo sections of Pictures of Home. He is also very PRECISE - yes, precise is another word that perfectly fits his style. I'm also having a hard time choosing his best performance: if it is on Machine Head or on In Rock... I think I'll decide for the latter, where he adopts a more progressive approach to the tracks in spite of the more straight-forward one (but good, nevertheless) on this piece. I still don't know which one is the best, Machine Head or In Rock.\n\nAnd what about the songwriting? Well with In Rock the band composed more progressive songs, with lengthy solo sections, lots of tempo changes and such. With Machine Head, the tunes are simpler and catchier, but awesome too. The songs are divided into two categories: the mid paced ones, comprising tracks like Never Before and Smoke on the Water, and the faster ones, like Space Truckin'.\nThe first one, Highway Star also falls in the latter category; this is one of the most well known songs of Purple's catalog and for a damn GOOD reason. It begins with a crescendo and then Ian Paice begins to play a simple beat. After that, Gillan screams like a madman and begins to sing in a very raw, aggressive way. What a versatile singer, indeed. After the infectious chorus, we reach the highlight of the track: Lord's keyboard solo, the be-all end-all of the keyboard solos, in my opinion. After a guitar solo, the song ends. Well, and is this tune an early speed metal classic? Hm, I think so!\n\nMaybe I'm a Leo is a bit different and weaker, in fact it is the weakest song of the record - very forgettable, really. However, after the drum solo that marks the beginning of Pictures of Home, you know the band will not disappoint you further; indeed, the track has a main riff that is catchy and amazing (I'm not sure, but I think that I prefer it to the riff of Smoke on the Water). The chorus will remain in your head for weeks. There is a bass solo (bass solo, whoahh *jumps with happiness*) during the middle section and then the song fades away... But wait, Ian Paice begins to hit the snare again, and a few seconds later the song returns with a bluesy guitar solo, which is the perfect ending for one of my favourite Deep Purple tunes.\n\nNever Before is a pop-ish track, but not a filler, though. It is a competent tune that leads us into the classic Smoke on the Water. Well, this song is far from being the masterpiece that many claim it is, but it is still a good tune, with one of the catchier guitar riffs ever; it's also pretty mid paced.\nAnd then, another excellent track begins, the fantastic Lazy, a song that bears resemblances with In Rock. It has a very progressive structure with some intricate soloing. It begins very well, with some keyboard sounds that lead us into a very bluesy instrumental that clocks at around two minutes; despite the length, it never gets boring. Around the two minutes mark, Ian Gillan begins to sing about... a lazy man. Ok, it's not the best subject ever to write lyrics about, but hey, the chorus is actually pretty funny.\n\n\u201cYou're lazy, you just stay in bed, \nYou're lazy, you just stay in bed, \nYou don't want no money, \nYou don't want no bread\u201d\n\nAfter the chorus, there is a fantastic... harmonica solo. Yes, very in the vein of Sabbath's The Wizard, but a bit better in my opinion. After the obligatory repetition of the chorus, the song ends.\n\nSpace Truckin' works greatly, closing the album and being a speed metal (or, at least, \u201cspeed rock\u201d, if that genre exists) take. The chorus is anthemic, showing Ian Gillan's more aggressive voice, so aggressive that is even comparable to his vocal performance on In Rock's opener, the all-mighty Speed King... Wow, and I made yet another comparison between this record and In Rock... Great.\n\nAnyways, the production is decent: you got to bear in mind that Machine Head was released in 1972! The sound of the drums isn't the best ever too, a bit low in the mix sometimes, but, again, it's 1972, we can't expect any better.\n\nSo, after all the comparisons between Machine Head and In Rock, what do I conclude? Hm, I conclude that I CAN'T CHOOSE between them. Damn. I think I'll have to give the same ratings to both albums. One is more progressive and the other more straight-forward, but both are amazing pieces in their own way. \n\n87 points - Classic...\n",
        "\nLong before the days when Ritchie Blackmore resided in a castle somewhere in Germany playing lute and calculating new and devious ways to piss off his fan base as well as spoon his wife, he was actually responsible in part for some of the finest rock music ever. From \u2018In Rock\u2019 through to the end of Mk III era Deep Purple were a sensational rock band with all the vitriol, fevered egos, bad tempers and seriously good songs you could ever ask for. \u2018Machine Head\u2019 is a total no brainer for rock fans everywhere simply because it\u2019s all fucking fantastic. \n\nDeep Purple simply were the finest musicians around in the early 70s (well in rock music\u2026and does anything else really matter?). The bands stable line up for this whole period revolves around three of the biggest muso\u2019s ever namely; Ian Paice, Jon Lord and of course everyone\u2019s favourite Quaker Ritchie \u2018I hate Gillan\u2019 Blackmore. These guys could simply out play anyone around at the time. In a era of straight ahead \u201cmummy daddy mummy daddy\u201d double bass playing Ian Paice is a breath of fresh air even today, a technically astounding drummer with a tone to die for and yet still he never overplays. Jon Lord actually made the organ a force to be reckoned with in the hard rock world, seriously listen to the ballsy intro riff on \u2018Space Truckin\u2019\u2019 and not only is he \u2018eavy he\u2019s \u2018umble too Jon can play the most intricate and bizarre stuff on his organ; classically trained but with a rock attitude. Ritchie Blackmore actually is Satan; he\u2019s a guitar genius and a true wizard with the fastest rock licks going in the early 70s. Jimmy Page thought he woz all \u201cmaster of the occult\u201d and whatnot but he may of bought all of Crowley\u2019s used tissues and such but Blackmore was truly evil\u2026no man has brought such incredible joy to his fans and at the same time been an absolute cunting cunt. Roger Glover, although one of the bands more modest members (i.e. somewhere between the comparative fire and ice of Blackmore and Gillan) was a fantastic bassist who has some truly memorable moments on this album, including a bass solo that doesn\u2019t actually piss me off. Ian Gillan is frankly the most fun you\u2019ll ever have with rock vocals, everything is delivered with a \u201cI\u2019ve just given you crabs\u201d grin and a such gusto. His range is phenomenal, no one screams like Gillan, not even Halford has a better howl than are favourite Ritchie winder upper did in the early 70s. \n\nSo I like DP, you like DP, your sister likes DP and your mum prefers DT, but what about the songs? Well, the original \u2018Machine Head\u2019 album has seven tracks but the band actually wrote eight classics for the album\u2026so erm I can\u2019t really complain. \u2018Highway Star\u2019 is one of those songs you simply must write your car off too, do it drunk too! Honestly, the police will understand just tell them that you were listening to \u2018Highway Star\u2019. It\u2019s one of the all time great rock tracks and if I\u2019m in \u201cwhere does this relate to metal?\u201d retard mode I could say it\u2019s a huge evolutionary step forward in speed metal. And those lyrics? A work of literary genius! Is it a car? Is it a girl? Either way you know Ian would. The guitar and organ solos are a something to behold, silly and most enjoyable, oh Ritchie marry me! Other stand outs in this album of standouts include \u2018Pictures of Home\u2019 which is notable for an absolutely mental drum intro, silly 4th guitar harmonies and Gillan wailing about being stuck on a Swiss mountain\u2026and why not, farmer\u2019s daughters won\u2019t really fit this. \u2018Smoke on the Water\u2019 ah yes, now remember kids if you go into a guitar shop, turn the distortion on full and play this on the bottom E string the shop owners are legally obliged to give you a free guitar\u2026Wow! Anyway, overplayed it is but still a great song I mean its got to be just for being that memorable and its like Deep Purple and Switzerland\u2019s national anthem (\u2018Cherry Orchids\u2019 or \u2018Cherry Pie\u2019 by Celtic Frost just missed out). \u2018Lazy\u2019 is a bluesy jam and just so wonderful, I\u2019ve had those guitar licks stuck in my head for years. A fine ode to inertia and a all time Purple classic. \u2018Space Truckin\u2019 is a riff monster, the beginning distorted organ sound is sonic bliss and the guitar takes a backseat for the most part but when it comes back its simply a joy to behold. Paice\u2019s drums fucking groove on this one and he\u2019s got a great solo. The lyrics? \u2018C\u2019mon, c\u2019mon lets go space truckin\u2019 Oscar Wilde (Zakk\u2019s nerdy older brother) would of spent years trying to top that. Blackmore hates funk, but this is really funky hard rock (funk needn\u2019t be overpowering and crap like, erm say the Red Hot Chilli Peppers) so once again the man in black is full of contradictions. Ritchie you enigma! Why can\u2019t you be mine!\n\nEven the albums more lowly tracks are still masterful, \u2018Never Before\u2019 is the most poppy and all the better for it. \u2018When A Blind Man Cries\u2019 is a wonderful bluesy piece of melancholy (but wasn\u2019t it a bit cruel to get Jeff Healey to play this? Hey, why don\u2019t we get Stephen Hawking to play \u2018When a Cripple Fails at the Decathlon\u2019? ). \n\u2018Machine Head\u2019 is a completely solid piece of work, I\u2019ve listened to this hundreds of time and its energy, class and consistency are always impressive. So as such I\u2019ll give this a perfect rating, because it deserves it\u2026and every other fucker gives 100s out to Viking metal demos they found quite pleasant or derivative shite thrash albums. \n\nSo if you like me are madly in love with the hallowed grooves of \u2018Machine Head\u2019 feel free to do any of the following;\n1. Ask Ritchie Blackmore how to play \u2018Smoke on the Water\u2019 *don\u2019t ask Steve Morse he can\u2019t actually play it, but he tries, bless him*\n2. Ask Ian Gillan the story behind \u2018Smoke on the Water\u2019 he hasn\u2019t told anyone in a while, no one asks him that question.\n3. Shout \u201coh my god Elton John!\u201d at Ian Paice. \n4. Tell David Coverdale \u2018Smoke\u2026\u2019 is your favourite of his songs\n5. Ask Glenn Hughes how Tommy Bolin is these days.\n6. Shout \u2018Freebird\u2019 at any Deep Purple or Blackmore\u2019s Night concert.\n",
        "\nThis record was the one that made me follow the paths to the metal world. Before I heard this, I was listening to Elton John, Madonna, whatever was on the radio. I had never heard anything like it, and it made me step away from mainstream radio music, and instead I went to the metal world.\n\nThis is a top notch album in every single way. The production is first class. Every instrument is clear, and is given its chance to shine. The great vocals from Ian Gillian is strong, clear and powerful. He does a fantastic job here, giving all he\u2019s got on every fuckin track, and the man has got some freakin balls aswell. Ritchie Blackmore is a legend, and he\u2019s shredding it all up in every freakin song! The solo in Child In Time is unforgettable, so is the riffing in Speed King. I really enjoy the bass here aswell, I think it\u2019s perfectly mixed, and Roger Glover really shows you what a bass can add to the music. This album is filled with huge basslines.\n\nNow, I\u2019m usually not the one for keyboards, but when you have a musician of Jon Lords class in your lines, you can\u2019t really fail. He does a great job all the time, if it is building a powerful as fuck wall behind the music with the bass, or playing along with Gillians screaming. Ian Paice plays along with powerful drumming, a fast beat when needed, or playing only on the cymbals to make an epic sound, like in Child In Time.\n\nThe songs, well here we have an album filled with classics. This really is a great album.\n\nThe album kicks off with Speed King, and already from the first shredding solo from Ritchie, you can tell that this album is gonna be a killer. The intro sounds to me like Hit The Lights of Metallica, all the instruments pretty much playing along to a kickass solo, before the song goes into a misleading, church-sounding keyboard part, before the guys start kicking ass again. The song builds up to the godlike chorus. \u201cIM A SPEEEED KING!\u201d Gillian does an extremely good performance here, and Ritchie pulls out a crazy riff that kicks ass. Also check out the groovy basslines by Roger. Great stuff. The song goes on with more of this badass chorus, before fading out. A classic.\n\nNext up is Bloodsucker. This is more straight-forward but still kicks a maximum amount of ass. The riff is catchy as hell, Gillian screams as powerful as ever, and the rest of the band stays TIGHT. A slower solo here, but still, it owns.\n\nChild In Time. Now this is epic. The intro is nothing less then beautiful, and the song builds slowly up, and it explodes when Mr. Ritchie Blackmore kicks off with a solo that may very well is the best he has ever made. Listening to Ritchie just fucking nail this godlike solo, over the galloping bass and drums, is nothing less then great. This song is long, clocks at over 10 minutes, but every second is memorable. Every instrument gets room to shine here, and trust me, they do. This is a true masterpiece, nothing less.\n\nThe typical way to follow a song like Child In Time, is with a straight-rocking filler. Flight Of The Rat though, is a pretty complex song, featuring some great riffs, very strong drums, and, as always, an intense performance by Ian Gillian. He really is an amazing singer. After the 4:45 mark, we get some really interesting riffage, just showing you the class of guitar player Ritchie is. The song ends with a nice drum solo.\n\nInto The Fire is the must underrated on here. This is some heavy stuff. The intro riff is a real ballbreaker, and the chorus gets right in your face from nowhere, \u201cINTO THE FIIIRE!\u201d followed by more of the badass riff. Here we also get some interesting drum fills. Really an underrated song.\n\nThis is catchy as shit! Living Wreck starts in an awesome way with a groovy bassline before an equally groovy guitar and bass line kicks in. This is the weakest song on the album, but it\u2019s still a gooc song! I love the build up before the chorus, and Ian voice here sounds stunning. I don\u2019t like the solo very much though, I think that is the only part on the album where Ritchie overuse the effects, but anyway a solid performance.\n\nThe closer is *GASP*, a classic. Some very solid riffing here, and the band stays tight through the whole song. Here we get solos from pretty much the whole band, but this song ain\u2019t a mess in any way. The guitar solo is huge as always, and here we get some keyboard solos aswell, which sounds decent, but I much prefer it in the background. The outro is maybe the highlight of the album, Ritchie shredding it all into pieces, he really did the performance of his life on this album.\n\nSo there you go, this is a classic album from the godlike band named Deep Purple. Get it at all costs.\n",
        "\nWhen I think of this album, I always think of Deep Purple as a school teacher in a classroom. As Purple outlines a lesson in how to change your style of music without compromising your integrity, Rush (a nerdy kid with thick glasses) takes notes. Judas Priest is the dumb kid who doesn\u2019t get it and asks stupid questions like \u201cbut isn\u2019t it okay if a band needs money?\u201d Meanwhile, Metallica, Megadeth and Dream Theater are fast asleep in the back of the classroom, their notebooks open but blank. As the teacher takes attendance, he discovers that Def Leppard, In Flames, and Slayer are absent\u2026\n\nDeep Purple considered many famous musicians for the vacated bassist and singer spots, including Paul Rodgers of Bad Company (and Queen), and Phil Lynott of Thin Lizzy. So why settle on two little-known singers, Glenn Hughes (who also played bass) and David Coverdale? For one thing, it gave the band a dual-vocal attack that few others could match. There are only a few bands with two singers who could both sing everything on their own. It\u2019s precisely this fact that made Deep Purple MkIII such a force in the studio and onstage. (Watch Burn on California Jam if you want to see what I mean.) \n\nAs a whole, this album is also a marked shift away from the pre-metal sound that Deep Purple polished on In Rock through Machine Head. Much of this album is rooted in R&B, blues, and funk. Even \u201cLay Down, Stay Down\u201d\u2018s metal riff is done in an R&B context, with barroom piano and tambourine playing. None of this matters because the album, as music, as art, and as good fun, just plain works.\n\nOf course, this album\u2019s fire-breathing metal scorcher is its title track. Its riff is a speed metal version of \u201cSmoke on the Water\u201d, and its vocals are screamed in a manner that reminds me more of Bruce Dickinson than of Whitesnake. And you gotta remember, Bruce Bruce himself was 16 and in boarding school at the time. Top everything off with ten-second screams of \u201cBuuuuuuuuuurn!\u201d from both vocalists, Jon Lord and Ritchie Blackmore playing beautiful solos, and Coverdale raising the mic-stand in the air like a wizard\u2019s staff when performing it live, and you\u2019ve got an undisputed metal classic.\n\nNow is where things get tricky. Because the next song you hear is the organ-driven boogie-ish. number \u201cMight Just Take Your Life\u201d. It\u2019s good mid-paced rock, reminiscent (very reminiscent) of something Paul Rodgers might sing. And it took on new stomping life when played live. All in all, a good song, yet a vast stylistic shift from the title track. You find yourself wondering if the same band produced these two songs. Most bands wouldn\u2019t be able to pull this off, but Deep Purple isn\u2019t most bands. Deep Purple are the inventors, not just of traditional metal, but also of power and speed metal. Deep Purple are the band whose In Rock album Bruce Dickinson still worships today. Deep Purple can do this and have it work splendidly.\n\nThe album continues with the very odd track \u201cLay Down, Stay Down\u201d. Glenn Hughes called it a \u201cfunky rock\u2019n\u2019roller\u201d on the Live in California \u201874 DVD, but then again, Hughes was probably drunk enough to call it anything. \u201cLay Down, Stay Down\u201d is basically, as mentioned before, a metal riff and song dressed in R&B/boogie clothes. Both vocalists howl out their lines, drums pound, Blackmore drives the song with his somewhat intricate riff, and well, it just sounds like Purple had a damn good time recording it.\n\nThis stretch of three songs reaches its climax with the mournful funk shuffle \u201cSail Away\u201d. Coverdale\u2019s low voice is the defining thing about the song, and it lifts the song\u2019s somewhat nonsensical lyric and makes it seem heartfelt and beautiful. Ritchie again adds another layer with his elegant soloing.\n\nUnfortunately, the only unworthy track on here, \u201cYou Fool No One\u201d was also one that they decided to play live and even release as a B-side. It has some nice vocals, and fast drumming from Ian Paice, BUT it\u2019s simply too fast, too quick and panicky for its own good. Normally in metal, a fast song is a good thing, but somehow it just doesn\u2019t work.\n\nBut then the album gets right back on track with the seedy drinking song, \u201cWhat\u2019s Going On Here\u201d. Lines such as \u201cRoll me over slowly, I've been drinkin' all night,\u201d and \u201cWhen they closed up the bar, you know, they left me for dead,\u201d give it an authenticity that makes you sure that Coverdale and Hughes have been there. And again Blackmore makes the song work with his guitar line on the chorus.\n\nAnd then it comes to the album\u2019s blues masterpiece, \u201cMistreated\u201d. I don\u2019t know what Coverdale was so upset about when he sang the song \u2013 after all, hadn\u2019t he just been hired by one of the best bands of all time? \u2013 but his performance kicks the entire genre of emo on its ass. This is real depression, something that whinecore bands sadly lack, real emotion that is so raw that you can\u2019t help crying as you sing along. It\u2019s a slow plodding, mournful electric blues song that has a vibe so unique you can\u2019t help but wonder what would have happened if they had made more songs like it. Near the end of the song, it goes into double time, Blackmore soloing away over both vocalists\u2019 crying ooohs and aaahs. And then\u2026it stops, gives way to a final moan, sob, and shaky deep breath.\n\nReally, after \u201cMistreated\u201d, there is nothing for Coverdale to say, so he doesn\u2019t, the rest of the band finishing things up with the strange, lurching instrumental \u201c\u2018A\u2019-200\u201d. I find it slightly boring but good enough background music for playing chess. Yeah. Seriously, the song suffers for the lack of vocals, even if vocals wouldn\u2019t have fit the music. And if you have the remaster, like I do, you\u2019ll also get the funky instrumental \u201cCoronarias Redig\u201d, which has some very cool soloing.\n\n\u201cSo, modern metal bands, take heart, because it is possible to pull off a style change without selling out. Hellooo\u2026Metallica?\u201d (shakes Metallica, who\u2019s been dozing off in the back of the classroom, awake.) \u201cWha?\u201d \u201cSince you\u2019ve been paying so much attention, I want you to tell me the things that allow a band to change their music without selling out.\u201d \u201cWho gives a shit, man? Once you\u2019re famous, you can do whatever the hell you want.\u201d (sighs)\n",
        "\nThis album is pretty much shelved by the masses as being a final effort before the original Deep Purple line-up fell apart for the 2nd and final time. The circumstances surrounding Ritchie Blackmore\u2019s exodus from the band obviously showcase the fact that when you put together 5 incredibly large egos together for 10 years on the road or in the studio, there is sure to be plenty of fire works. If nothing else, this album showcases the very different musical direction that Ritchie was going as opposed to the other 4 members of the band.\n\nOne of the reasons Blackmore gave for his not liking this release was the assertion that Ian Gillian was unable to sing in tune. Although during several instances in some of the songs (particularly the more progressive sounding Anya) the vocals do tend to slide a bit flat on the longer notes, the overall voice performance is not as horrible as he alleges. We are treated to the occasional high end shriek by Ian on more rocking tracks like \u201cNasty Piece of Work\u201d and \u201cLick it Up\u201d, but it becomes apparent that their lack of frequency is due to his inability to do it as often or as strongly as he used to. When I saw them in Pittsburg back in 2002 he didn\u2019t even bother trying to hit the high G at the beginning of Highway Star.\n\nThe music on here is quite an interesting mish mash of rock and early metal influences, most of the strongest material occurring at the beginning and the end of the album. \u201cLick it Up\u201d and \u201cNasty Piece of Work\u201d are my picks for the best rock songs on here both for vocal performance and for solid low end guitar riffing. \u201cOne man\u2019s meat\u201d rides close behind with a more down tempo groove and some rather interesting guitar effects on the riffs. The title track is more oriented towards an epic metal approach that is less crunchy, but otherwise quite similar to Black Sabbath\u2019s late 80s work with Tony Martin. \u201cA twist in the tale\u201d is a solid effort at emulating early speed metal like Judas Priest\u2019s Exciter, although with a more blues driven set of ideas.\n\nOur two best songs on here are the most unconventional for the band, and ironically quite similar to some of the work Ritchie Blackmore ended up submitting during his brief resurrection of Rainbow\u2019s career. \u201cSolitaire\u201d has a slow and gloomy atmosphere to it, in addition to a rather unusual 2 voice harmony with some chorus effects on it. The overall feel of the song is quite similar to \u201cInsatiable (Hunting Humans\u201d off Stranger in Us All, minus the superior organ solo work courtesy of Jon Lord. Likewise, the classically influenced \u201cAnya\u201d has a principle riff which is paraphrased in Rainbow\u2019s \u201cBlack Masquerade\u201d, as well as the same basic instrumentation. This song is probably the most similar to Ritchie Blackmore\u2019s current work with his more Folk/Acoustic project Blackmore\u2019s Night.\n\nThis album was purchased by me about 12 years ago at a bargain bin in a Kmart, which in my opinion is a clear indication that the album was shunned due to having too many pre-Grunge influences in it. This album is as much a victim of the year it was released in as it was in being associated with the break up of the band. It comes recommended to fans of Classic Rock and early 70s metal, but fans of post-Ozzy Sabbath are also encouraged to check this one out. Don\u2019t let the lack of interest fool you, there is some quality material on here.\n",
        "\nThis is my favourite Purple \u201cthing\u201d of all \u2013 the making of \u201cMachine Head\u201d from the \u201cClassic Albums\u201d series. I\u2019ve watched it many times and never tire of it. If you\u2019ve seen it on the telly buy the DVD for the extras. And while you\u2019re at it get the anniversary double CD version of \u201cMachine Head\u201d, featuring the whole album twice \u2013 one disc containing a beautiful remaster and the other an even better remix, featuring the entire recorded length of each song with discarded Blackmore solos spliced in. With DVD in one hand and the CD in the other, tell me that life is not good.\n\nI won\u2019t bore you with endless details from the DVD but it really does take you there, to that draughty Montreux hotel in those halcyon days when the greatest rock band of the age (sorry Zep fans) went through hell \u2013 almost literally \u2013 to record their greatest album. The ridiculous lengths the band went to to record and monitor takes are described with great humour and fondness. You\u2019ve really gotta love these guys. It\u2019s such an engagingly personal journey that my wife \u2013 not a Purple or even rock music fan \u2013 enjoys this DVD.\n\nRoger Glover, the solid self-effacing bass player, has clearly emerged from the amp stacks to become the archivist of Purple\u2019s heritage. He is the front man here, guiding the viewer through the fascinating details of the recording process. Glover is also responsible for the remix/remaster of \u201cMachine Head\u201d. We are all in his debt.\n\nThe \u201cClassic Albums\u201d series typically features extensive sessions in the studio with the producer soloing various tracks to highlight bits and pieces. Well, just imagine the great \u201cMachine Head\u201d being examined in this way by Glover and engineer Martin Birch. It\u2019s glorious, intimate, surprising, uplifting \u2026 just bloody marvelous! You\u2019re truly there at the creation!\n\nThe most pleasant surprise is the inclusion of Blackmore in the interviews. He\u2019s very upfront and revealing about the recording and even speaks fondly about his former band mates. A gem is his demonstration on acoustic guitar of the classic \u201cSmoke on the Water\u201d lick. It\u2019s founded on a double stop, he reminds billions of wannabe guitar gods, not a single note. Just to remind you who wrote the lick he adds a sweet trill at the end. Eat that!\n\n\u2019Nuff said. It\u2019s easy to find the Classic Albums series discounted. So just go buy it. It\u2019s cheap at twice the price.\n",
        "\nWhen someone says Deep Purple, what is the first thing that comes to mind? \u201cSmoke on the Water\u201d for most, which is quite sad, simply because Deep Purple is so much better than that single hit. \n\nAfter toiling around with various musical adventures, Deep Purple finally put all the pieces together on \u201cMachine Head\u201d. Quite Simply \u201cMachine Head\u201d delivers the goods.\n\nTwo main things that stick out are Ian Gillan and Ritchie Blackmore. Ian Gillan cements his spot among the best rock singers of his era with his performance on songs like the hit \u201cSmoke on the Water\u201d, \u201cHighway Star\u201d and \u201cSpace Truckin\u2019\u201d. And guitarist Ritchie Blackmore provides guitar work far beyond his era, with some neoclassical solos and heavy bluesy riffs. \n\nOf the 7 songs, there are really no duds, but \u201cHighway Star\u201d, \u201cSmoke on the Water\u201d, and \u201cSpace Truckin\u2019\u201d are the best by far. Also, for those lucky enough to get the 25th Anniversary Edition, you will find the Roger Glover remixes disc very interesting. \u201cSmoke on the Water\u201d defines the album, but without supporting songs such as \u201cMaybe I\u2019m a Leo\u201d and \u201cSpace Truckin\u201d this wouldn\u2019t be as good of an album.\n\nOverall, \u201cMachine Head\u201d, is a really good album which was essential in the formation of early heavy metal, albeit this is much more of a hard rock album. While this album won\u2019t blow you away, it is a classic in its own right.\n",
        "\nThis is my all time favorite Deep Purple album. With the departure of Gillan and Glover, Deep Purple came back with their strongest album. Since hearing this album, I have never compared anyone to Blackmore and Lord. Because the solos are SO GOOD. To top it off, Paice is a great drummer. Sure some drummers are faster but none sound as enjoyable. The combination of Coverdale and Hughes is fantastic. They both have very distinct voices. The title track is AMAZING!!!! Songs like that make you appreciate music so much more. The next two tracks Might Just Take Your Life and Lay Down, Stay Down are great songs, but not Burn great. Next is Sail Away, which I might actually enjoy more than Burn. Everything about that song is wonderful. Coverdale's voice is just filled with so much emotion! Then there is You Fool No One. That song is all about Paice. The drums overshadow everything else on the song. What's Goin' On Here is another solid song. Mistreated is along with Burn and Sail Away. Mistreated might not be enjoyed by everyone because it is at a slower pace than most Metal fans are used to. If that bothers you than you suck. Blackmore shines on this song. \"A\" 200 is a very interesting instrumental.This is a great album, and you will enjoy it, unless you do not consider anything but the mark II lineup as Deep Purple. It is sad, but yes I know a few people who believe that. If you do not own this album then you do not like Deep Purple. And if you do not like Deep Purple then you are beyond repair!\n",
        "\nWell, as the topic tells, this is a really great Live album from DP.\nThe performance from especially Ian, well, you just gotta love it.\nThe tracklist covers those \"most wanted good old classics\": 'Fireball', 'Black Night', 'Pictures of Home' (SHUT UP, That's a ass-kicking great song!), 'Highway Star', and of course 'Smoke on the Water', but also some \"newer\" tracks, from after the mark 2-reunion, and their, at the time, latest album, 'Perfect Strangers', 'Ted the mechanic' and so on..\nAnd I would have to say that the tracks from the \"Purpendicular\"-album (which I think is their best album since \"Machine Head\" in -72) are really awesome on this Live-album.\nAltogether, the performance is great, it doesn't sound all that \"bootleggy\", if you know what I mean, the sound is as good on any other Live-album, and the album covers the best of the best, \"Child in Time\" is the only track that I miss on this album, and for once, they didn't play \"Space Truckin'\" which regullary last for about 20-35 minutes when DP plays it live, and that tend to be kind of boring, but this album is never boring, it is just plain fucking awesome Deep Purple.\nThis is the album that I would recommend any becomming DP-fan to buy, and anyone else that likes Deep Purple (at least the mark II-fans, even though it's Steve Morse on the guitar).\nThis isn't just the best Live-album, it's also the best \"best of\", in my opinion.\n",
        "\nWell, I really love Deep Purple, but, this is getting annoying..\nThe tracks on this album, well, they are all great, as usually when we're talking Deep Purple.\nBut, we've all heard them before.\nThese last 10 albums from DP, there have been like three albums where \"Smoke on the Water\" is not present.\nAnd in my total DP-collection almost 50% of the albums has that song (Smoke..) on them.\nBut, yeah, if your new to DP, sure thing, this album might be just the thing for you, it covers about the most of the best of DP, and I'm especially happy to see that \"Sometimes I feel like screaming\" finally made it to one of all these Best of's, although, I would rather recommend a potentiall new DP-fan, to buy the \"Live at the Olympia '96\"-live album instead of this one.\nAnd I got to admit that it's getting redicolous, about 10 years, totally about 20 albums, of which 2 are full lenght-regular albums, the rest Best of's or Live-albums, and most of these best of's covers about the same tracks, so I wouldn't recommend this album to anyone else than those who have never heard DP before, and those of us that just want to have all of the DP-albums there is.\n\nThe one thing that makes this best of-album better than the rest, is that it features \"Sometime I Feel Like Screaming\" (which also Live at the Olympia does, buy that one instead of this ;))\n",
        "\nDeep Purple were one of the most influential metal and rock bands of all time. Their influence can be found far and wide the metal community. Most notably, Yngwie J. Malmsteen. Ritchie Blackmore pioneered a guitar playing style that was foreign to the listener. Ritchie, along with the other members of Deep Purple have influenced a generation of musicians. \n\nEverything changed when the Mark II lineup (Ritchie Blackmore, Ian Gillan, Roger Glover, Ian Paice and Jon Lord ) broke up after the release of the album \"Who do We think We Are!\" in 1973. A couple of solid albums followed with David Coverdale on vocals and Glenn Hughes on bass. Albums like \"Burn\" and \"Stormbringer\" which are brilliant were soon released with this new lineup. Once again, there were line up changes. Ritchie Blackmore left the group to pursue a solo career. \"Come Taste The Band\" was released in 1975 to much appreciation by the fans. This album would be last with the Deep Purple name on it for almost ten years.\n\nThe year was 1984, it was a great year for metal. Judas Priest's \"Defenders Of The Faith\", Iron Maiden's \"Powerslave\" and Metallica's \"Ride The Lightning\" were all released. There was another brilliant album that came out that year. It was the first Deep Purple album in almost ten years and the first from the Mark II lineup in over ten years. Would \"Perfect Strangers\" live up tp the hype or would it fizzle under the pressure? \n\nThe opener is an instant classic. \"Knocking At Your Backdoor\", one of the longest Deep Purple studio songs and it kicks this album off with a bang. This song is an instant and joins others at that level like \"Mistreated\", \"Highway Star\" and \"Demon's Eye\". This classic starts off with a great keyboard and guitar intro. When the action finally begins, Ian Gillan proves that he hadn't lost anything. He belts out some great lyrics and hits the high notes (\"It's not the kill, It's the thrill of the c-h-aaaaaaaaaa-s-e\"). This song has one hell of a catchy chorus. Ritchie Blackmore provides a Godly solo that starts a little after the 3:40 mark. \"Knocking At Your Backdoor\" might be a seven minute epic but when it's finally over the listener will be asking themselves where did the time go because this solid tune doesn't feel long. The last ninety seconds or so is an instrumental jam to conclude this phenomenal journey.\n\nNext up, we have \"Under The Gun\". This song isn't as classic as the opening track but it is still mighty fine. \"Under The Gun\" starts off with an aggressive introduction then kicks into high gear with Ian Gillan coming in and providing some beautiful vocals. Again, like the first song and for many others Ritchie Blackmore is a God on the guitar and kicks the listeners asses by giving a solo like no other. \n\n\"Nobody's Home\" is next on deck and this track doesn't let anyone down. Jon Lord provides a spacey keyboard intro. This reminds us all of the glory days of Deep Purple with the splendid keyboard work by the master, Mr. Lord. This intro lasts for about fifteen seconds then all hell breaks loose. \"Nobody's Home\", like \"Knocking At Your Backdoor\" has a very catchy chorus and will stay in your head for days. This is not a bad thing. Ritchie plays well but John Lord steals the show with a superb keyboard solo two minutes in. \n\n\"Mean Streak\" is next. This tune is right to the point. No keyboard, drum or guitar intro. This is a good thing because a few songs have intros and you don't want repetition. \"Mean Streak\" slows the pace down a little after the non stop action from the previous songs. Ritchie shows that he didn't lose anything while in Rainbow and gives us some good guitar work. \"Mean Streak\" finishes with a little keyboard outro.\n\n\"Perfect Strangers\". What can I say about this song that hasn't already been said? Along with \"Knocking At Your Backdoor\", \"Perfect Strangers\" is an instant classic and fan favourite. In twenty years, when people are thinking about the songs that defined Deep Purple's career, there will be songs like \"Hush\", \"Smoke on the Water\", \"Pictures of Home\" and \"Woman From Tokyo\" but \"Perfect Strangers\" and \"Knocking At Your Backdoor\" will get the same recognition. John Lord provides a great keyboard intro to get this song started. This song has a good feel to it and Ian Paice does a tremendous job on the drums. Ritchie Blackmore teases your ear with a killer riff that just won't quit. Ian Gillan does some great vocal work on this track. At the four minute mark this song truly explodes into greatness with a simple but elegant jam to finish this classic.\n\n\"A Gypsy's Kiss\" follows the title track and continues the trend of greatness. This track starts off with a full head of steam. The presence of John Lord and Ritchie Blackmore is exquisite with a brilliantly simple but mesmerizing drum beat from the main man on the kit, Ian Paice. At one point, this songs plays like it was written by a regular power metal band. After listening to this, trying to explain that Deep Purple didn't have much of an influence is futile. This is one of the best songs off of this album. A must for all fans and for people researching the roots of metal. The guitar and keyboard work could not be better and if it was it would be illegal. \n\n\"Wasted Sunsets\" is next and is the obligatory ballad. I'm not complaining because Deep Purple know how to do ballads. Ian Gillan sings with emotion and it comes out beautifully. Not much to say about this song except that is some great lyrics and a fine guitar solo. \n\n\"Hungry Daze\", wow! This tune came from nowhere. Like the other reviewer said, this song has the feel of \"(We Are) The Road Crew\" and other songs of that nature. The lyrics are enjoyable as it is a retrospective of a holy career. Ian Paice starts things off with a blistering drum beat. Then the song turns into some sort of neo classical piece. This is for sure the dark horse of the album. Again, a great guitar solo which makes a good song even better. \n\nNow depending on the version of \"Perfect Strangers\" that you have or are planing to buy, there are the possibility of two bonus tracks. \"Not Responsible\" and \"Son of Alerik\". The first of the two is typical 1970s Deep Purple song. There is nothing outstanding about this song but it only solidifies this album. \"Son of Alerik\" is an epic for the ages. This ten minute instrumental is definitely not for the weak of heart. This song brings us back to the epic days \"Child in Time\" and other great songs. This instrumental jam brings out the best in everyone. It's a shame that not everyone might have access to this track.\n\nIn conclusion, \"Perfect Strangers\" is one of the best reunion albums on the market. Deep Purple lived up to all the hype and expectations. The Mark II lineup shows us its dominance and leaves us wanting more. This album is filled with great tracks but especially the two classics, one being the title track and the other the opening song. This album is recommended not only to the die hards who were dying of joy when the reunion took place in'84 but for all casual fans and metal/hard rock fans in general. Depending on the version of the album that is available, some might miss out on two tracks. If this happens, download these songs so you can experience this album in its entirety.\n",
        "\nBy the spring of 1975, our heroes the Purple Ones had weathered three separate sets of personnel turnovers, the latest reshuffling resulting in the acquisition of David Coverdale (future mousse haired Kommandant of Whitesnake's glam rock Hindenburg) and Glenn Hughes (evil forbear of WOOO!!! RIc Flair took his cue from this lad). The denoument was a turn away from the metallic uber-over-kill of the Gillan/Glover era, toward a very arena-friendly blooze rawking swagger. In other words, the Seventies Syndrome bit and bit hard. \n\nThe ever prescient and paranoid Ritchie Blackmore quite legitimately sensed his cue to exit stage Dio, and get on with plans for his namesake act, and so it was that the recordings we have before us proved to be the last of his work with the 70's edition of Purple.\n\nAs such, Blackmore is unquestionably the star of the show. By turns manic, melodic, abrasive, restrained, and sloppy as John Holmes' Lovelace-era seconds, he puts on a flawless vaudeville of Stratocaster deviltry--even if his heart and mind were (arguably) thousands of miles away from his fingers at this point. When even a phoned in performance is this solid, it only proves that Blackmore's arrogance and misanthropy are well, well indulged and earned. \n\nBy contrast, Lord and Paice are anything but flies on the slaughterhouse wall. Paice remains the octopoidal protoplasm responsible for welding together even the most improbable of meter and tempo conceits. And in this area of increasingly funky and r&b derived material, these rhythmic skills come even further to the forefront (albeit in a manner that had antagonized RB to the point of angry departure in the first place). Consider , for instance,his flawless cue-ins at the beginning of the \"Lazy\" jam affixed to \"Mistreated\", as well as \"Space Truckin'\" (passim).\n\nLord is equally solid, sometimes surprising; his mastery of the Hammond giving way only in unfortunate patches to a somewhat less than visionary tweedly-wee turn on the (then highly unstable) Moog synthesizer. \n\nAt the vocal end, Coverdale's hoarse, faux-blooze, Paul Rodgers affectations can only be described as understated next to Hughe's bloodcurdling falsetto geisha shrieks. Clearly, this was not the dual-vocal powerhouse that Purple had promised us in the late fall of 1973.\n\nDisc 1 kicks off with the customary MK 111 set opener, \"Burn\". It's treated pretty faithfully as per the album version, with RB's stun-guitar intro leading into the verses, capped off with the DC/Hughes, Dalek-delivery of the song's ultimate hook...\"BUUUURRRRNNN!!!!\" This sets up the famous lightning speed Bach-derived solos from RB and Lord (and indeed, this track really is a rewrite of the original Bach-derived Purple monster \"Highway Star\", with superior hooks, lyrics, and indeed, solo). \n\n\"Strombringer\" is next, a mid paced groover complete with more threatening weather imagery (are these guys glued to the Weather Channel in their spare time?). Chugging along to a satisfying crunch, it gives place to a somewhat moodier and darker piece.\n\n\"Gypsy\" is a rather nicely repetitive riff, some random ruminations on crystal balls and such that would be infinitely better handled by RJD in years to come, and some decent dual-throated warbling from the codpieced ones forever battling at the mic, terminate in a seething, neurotic solo from RB. Some damned tasty melodic energy entrapped within the grooves here.\n\n\"Lady Double Dealer\" is next, and is formulaic (but finely crafted) sped up Bad Co. cockrock swagger that wouldn't make the cut on \"Bomber\" but would fit nicely onto \"Appetite for Destruction\".\n\n\"Mistreated\" kicks in, and right away, unintentionally conjures up more premonitions of Dio. DC's version has long been outclassed by subsequent RJD deliveries, beginning with Rainbow's \"On Stage\" and continuing, inexplicably, to this day. DC's rendition is decent enough but simply unconvincing --technical but not probable-- and the main riff, no doubt derived from Free's \"Heartbreaker\" (another masterpiece of minimal inspiration) sets the stage for some introspective, consciously \"bluesy\" soloing from RB that here and there threatens to dissolve into atonal noodling. Indeed, Paice's sudden staccato drum roll seems to serve as a wake up call, and it's telling how quickly the solo is concluded, leading back to the final verse and requisite shriek-a-thon. \n\nA bit of audience-winding follows, courtesy of a hyper-driven delivery of the initial riff of \"Lazy\", and then we have a curiously funked-up version of \"Smoke on the Water\" to contend with. Taken at this tempo, and with Paice's incessant hi-hat punctuation trebled by way of compensation, this reviewer is put rather painfully in mind of ....Sammy Hagar's \"I Can't Drive 55\"!!! \n\nThey soldier on into the funk-laden mire, and it's actually not so bad. It's an apt and honest touch to have DC sing \"They all came down to Montreeaux\", since this is, after all, the doings of Mark II being immortalized here. DC and Hughes trade off the first few verses, then after a rather lackluster solo from RB (no doubt deathly sick of this mandatory crowd-pleaser), they sing the first verse in uinson. I guess the original last verse was too full of second-person pronouns? \n\nOh, and it stops in mid-finale to allow Hughes to indulge in some GOD awful impersonation of \"soul emotiveness\". He literally stops the song, swaggers and swoons his way thru some nondescript Al Green castoff, and only when he's finished does the band wipe the sour sneer of contempt off our faces with a crashing finish to the \"newly improved\" opus. If anyone at this juncture needs a reason for RB's departure, I'd wager that the 1001st delivery of an already well-clapped-out arena rock standard, freshly belaboured with the 2000lb anvil of Hughes' bruthaman fiasco, should leave them in no doubt. It all points to curtains!!! \n\nLast but definitely not least, at the end of Disc I we come to \"You Fool No One\". If Hughes' nauseous Ray Charles hysterics had you reaching for the Rolaids, you'll be well pleased to greet the overdriven strains of Jon Lord's Hammond-and-Moog intro. Lord takes a much-deserved turn at center stage, grinding out a hodge-podge of \"Toccata and Fugue\", \"Le Marseillaise\", and even some Mariachi gibberish, effortlessly alternating between the piquant and the merely piqued. He spices it up with a breather of clavinet-ish disco synth, before melting it down in a feedback-driven vacuum of white-noisy backwash, cueing in Ian Paice's frenetic Maiden-influencing gallop. \n\nThe intro riff takes hold, and before long, DC and Hughesey are oh-so-sweetly harmonizing in a manner reminiscent of Cream's \"I Feel Free\". The verses give way, in turn, to the contractually obligated Blackmore solo, which is a ferocious ripper, soon intensifying aas the band drops out, leaving him, axe in hand, hacking furiously away in a truly technical ecstacy. The band cues back in for a bar room bluesy 30 seconds, then he waves them off, finishing in a masturbatory seizure. He recovers his composure, several rather awkward seconds of silence ensue, and back he plummets into the main riff. Then come the last verse and chorus, and -wait for it!- Ian Paice's drum solo! The requisite furious pounding, stop/start, slow/faster/faster/ fastest, flam, paradiddle, cymbal crash, etc, 4 1/2 minutes worth. He then cues the band, completely incongruosuly, into the closing section of \"The Mule\", at which point the number finally ends. \n\nNow, this sort of 17 minute auto-erotic chops-fest is of course exhibit A as to why so many believe that punk rock was \"fated\" to occur. And you know what? FUCK punk rock! Give me quality musicianship and Limey attitude over politically correct, ska-influenced, solo-less, emo-screamy bullshit any hour of the day! I'll keep my place as the Last In Line, thank you!\n\nWell, there you have it, 62 minutes, 7 tracks, of alternately clever, banal, riveting, and just plain cheesy '75 vintage Purple, and you've probably had quite enough. Not so fast! This is 70's British arena rock we're covering here--of course there's more! \n\nDisc 2 begins with the perenial set closer, hoary old Mk II choke-slammer \"Space Truckin'\". And indeed Lord and Paice get things off to a cracking hi-hat and Hammond build-up. Lord delivers bits of Holst and \"Thus Spoke Zarathustra\", DC and Hughes improvising incoherently all the while (and Blackmore nowhere to be found). This intro gets extended to a Ritalin-craving 5 damn minutes, before finally breaking into the familiar opening riff (Blackmore tardily materializing, like the Cheshire Cat, just in the nick of time).It goes thru the verses and chorus as usual, then something upsetting occurs. \n\nMk II devotees are at one in agreeing that the number is supposed to be played the whole way through, as on the album, and then it must give way to a 15-20 minute \"Blue Rondo A La Turk\" derived rhythm, replete with solos and various freakouts. This fails to happen. Instead, the percussion-heavy middle section is extended by 15 minutes! As this bizarre development proceeds, Blackmore very audibly loses interest, his accompaniment gradually becoming sparser until he finally drops out altogether. \n\nAnd so for 10 of these 15 minutes, the band is basically reduced to a trio. Hughes' bass takes the lead role in the proceedings. He lays on some funk wah-wah, and zips up and down the scales as he and Coverdale trade rock-star catch phrases (\"Outta sight! Ooh baby ooh!\"). Paice and Lord bash dependably away in the background, but it's definitely not the furious show-stopping maelstrom of 1972. What the listener confronts here is a spastic kaleidoscope of tautly woven blooze-rock bits, some obviously contrived, others improvised on the spot. It works astonishingly well, but for no easily definable reason.\n\nGranted, by this point, \"Space Truckin'\" was merely one of the trio of \"Machine Head' cliches being trotted out by the DC/Hughes lineup in a spirit of sheepish obligation. This version ought to suck, and miserably at that--yet does not. Instead of raging flat out, this \"Space Truckin' \" ebbs and flows with half-songs, connect-the-dot improvs, and various detritus flow swiftly past your amused (and occasionally outraged) ears. I hated it the first time around, and so will you, but give it a third and fourth spin, and you'll see! It grows on you!\n\nThus we arrive at long, too long, last at the encore: a howlingly ill-matched medley (!) of \"Goin' Down\" (Jeff Beck) and \"Highway Star\". In an attempt to freshen up another ancient (time moved at warp speed in those days) clapped-out Mk II oldie, \"Goin' Down\" gets surgically welded to the front end and flops and bleats around like a disembowelled goat before being mercifully dispatched at the middle 8 (cut off at the knees!). \n\n\"Highway Star\" then gets a simultaneously perfunctory, yet willfully extended, run-through, RB bullying aside Lord's organ solo in favor of a double-time take on his most famous solo; the baroque arpeggios and triplets being hammered on and pulled off in a loveless passion. We listen in dismay as he raves, mystifies, and drools, untill reaching the inevitable amp-humping climax that always looks so cool on DVD and always sounds so blurry and dull on disc. The Big Finish arrives, Lord's Moog backfires and sputters in a pre-set squall of curtain call feedback, and...it's finally at an end...\n\nIn the months to come, Blackmore would toss his Dio Dwarf into his empty pot of gold, and off they'd go to catch the Rainbow. The remaining 4/5 of DP would recruit jazzy maestro (and desperate junkie) Tommy Bolin and proceeed to grind themselves to a howling death in the pre-punk wasteland spring of '76. \n\nThe epitaph? Forget it. You got some finely wrought ear candy here--and some ill-savoring merde. And with the (temporary) death of Purple, and the simultaneous mental diaspora of Sabbath, Zep, and Heep, there ended the first Golden Age of proto-metal.\n",
        "\n\"...the line that's drawn between the good and the bad...\" \n\nBlack Sabbath. Deep Purple. Uriah Heep. Led Zeppelin. Arguably the big four of hard rock (and I will throw Sir Lord Baltimore in there as an unaccredited fifth). Two started the decade with debuts while the others were already charting with at least two records. 1970 \u2013 perhaps the pivotal year in early heavy music. Gardens of \u201860s love lie trampled in its wake. The \u2018feel good\u2019 nausea of bubblegum begins to loose its flavor. Zeppelin has its moments, churning out some heavy notes that could overthrow bulldozers. Sabbath and Heep just now rise from the sea with thunderous steps. With their compatriots, Deep Purple, the eldest of the four, start their deafening toll of metal\u2019s pubescent birth \u2013 flower power-kicking lyrics, nail-hard riffs, seething solos, hostile disposition, and in some cases angry mazes of organ. Future guitar gods take their thrones and future legendary bands firmly plant their feet in the cement of ages. \n\nThe sound of these bands is indeed hard rock, but one didn\u2019t start out that way. The first three Purple lps dictate few nods to the heavy (or hard), drawing from folk, psych, blues, and even classical influences, but then did they all. I find it astounding when metal fans scoff at these bands for actually borrowing from their influences, as if they were going to glean inspiration from somewhere else. Too much blues\u2026 what\u2019s with all this crappy weird psychy stuff? Scalawags! Why couldn\u2019t they wake up one morning and just play metal? The fact is that the pinnacle albums for these bands take all that - the despairing blues, the panoramic psych, the lighthearted folk - and blacken them, distort their vision, and smother them with the mass of anvils. The hard rock sound has just been epitomized. \n\nIn Rock rings the departure of vocalist Rod Evans and bassist Nick Simper, but blares the vocals of Ian Gillan and deep thump bass of Roger Glover. This is why when then-current fans of the band threw the album on their turntables it practically detonated. With the membership changing from DP\u2019s self-titled third lp, most were prepared for a discrepancy in sound, but the shock had to have been electric at least. In addition to the band loading tonnage onto its rhythmic ledges, their new raven-haired lungblaster who also laid pipes to the part of Jesus in the same-year Jesus Christ Superstar rock opera was more untamed than Ozzy, less mystical than Plant, and pound for pound could face off with Byron, the closest semblance to him of the three. \n\nThe original North American version of \u201cSpeed King\u201d has no intro \u2013 it launches at you like a brute that's just come unhinged, an ode to Little Richard (who was over the top for his time) with an ornery breaking riff and an untamed barrage of lyrics that are the first feral utterances of Gillan. Captivating \u201cBloodsucker\u201d chugs along on a nearly endless stream of vocals as Blackmore and organist Lord trade solo quests. The lengthy \u201cChild in Time\u201d is DP\u2019s \u201cStairway to Heaven\u201d with an alternative structure and churchy organs replacing the acoustics. Elegant and unhurried is the gait that slightly gains momentum to showcase not only the jackhammer rhythm that Diamond Head would sponge inspiration from (think \u201cAm I Evil?\u201d), but also some of the most prevalent, numbing screams anyone of the time had ever unleashed. A maddened solo rambles to the brink, then recalls the grace of the song\u2019s start. Deranged organ leads the unbridled salvo that ends side one with the tenderness of a collapsing coalmine. \n\nSwift and deadly is \u201cFlight of the Rat\u201d with guitar and drum solos fiery enough to ignite the next tune, \u201cInto the Fire\u201d, possessor of a fairly droning doomy riff surrounding a half-baked and rather boring blues rhythm laced with basic rock influence. Slow, methodical and bluesy \u201cLiving Wreck\u201d lives off its likable chorus while more organ work shrills through like jagged beams of light. Another track that doesn\u2019t end easily is \u201cHard Lovin\u2019 Man\u201d - reverberating, squealing ivories overlap a durable galloping step that barrels into a maelstrom of discordance and rage to end a dozen albums. \n\nI\u2019m not much of a blues fan, folk is something I can easily stomach, and if there\u2019s psych to be had, let it be margarine lite or at least conveyed with some purpose beyond an acidic kaleidoscope, but I know their role in the creation of hard rock is vast. Judas Priest, AC/DC, The Ramones, Kiss and others that would follow wouldn\u2019t be the same without them, nor would Maiden, and we all know what follows. It wouldn\u2019t be easy to foretell the long-gone future of metal without In Rock and its allies. \n\nOn a side note, taking part in the creation of that time\u2019s underground scene were mysteriously ambiguous names, bands that were synonymous with the aggressive big four resonance\u2026the US's Sir Lord Baltimore, the UK's Warhorse, Necromandus, and High Tide, Germany's Lucifer\u2019s Friend, Scotland's Writing on the Wall, Australia's Buffalo\u2026yet are nearly faceless among their more popular peers. Pick your reason \u2013 microscopic record label, impoverished advertising/production budget, roaming membership, zero airplay, family obligations, drugs, jail, bankruptcy, death\u2026not so different from our own metal underground and an unhealthy list of why many great bands never achieved their rightful place among the Big Kahunas of yesteryear. If you enjoy the four records mentioned here, then looking these bands up isn't your worst idea.\n",
        "\nWho would guess that such a good live album could come out so late in their career..\n\nThe album starts pretty balladic and easy, but it's great, with guest vocals, including DIO !! And boy is DIO good here. Dio also performs 2 of his own songs but with Deep Purple playing in the back, meaning Morse riffing like crazy, and Lord killing the keys. Especially on Rainbow in the Dark which comes out as a 100 percent better song than on studio. Oh yeah, the orchestra in the back is also great and blend really good. One barelly believes this is live, I mean the quality is really superb.\n\nGillian first appears with Fools, and it's great. Just like Dio, he proves he still sings godly. On this track the orchestra is not really present so we get a simply great live song, but what follows is simply BRILLIANT !!!\n\nWhen a blind man cries - song from Gillians solo album, it was always a great song but here it's simply amazing. Morse proves his skills together with the veteran Lord, simply killer stuff including Orchestra which makes this song truly epic and powerfull. And Morse's solos blending with the orchestra.... Have to hear it to believe it.... \n\nTed the mechanic also blows you away just like on Purpendicular but here we also have some female backing vocals which blend great. So including the guests and some instrumentals that's basically the brilliant disc one..\n\nAnd now the superbly brilliant disc 2 comes at you like damn thunder. This is killer stuff all the way. It's hard for me to spell the sheer brilliance that you can hear on this.. it's top notch in every aspect, no low point in all the almost over 49 mins of disc 2. Pictures of Home makes me wanna kiss Morse, that SOLO !!! Sometimes I Feel Like Screaming is nothing less good, maybe even better (but what is bad here ? nope, nothing), Perfect Strangers is really way better than the studio version with saxophones killing away... great stuff. Hmmmm... what's next? Smoke on the water... oh yeah... it's good... it's better... it has DIO as guest vocals!!!!! Black Night and Highway Star are the last two... and well... they are... GREAT great great...\n\nI mean people what are you waiting for? If you like music, rock or metal, or anything, this is a must. Maybe the best LIVE of any group I own (and I do listen to a lot of genre's including a lot of power metal). Believe me... it is good... so good in every aspect that it's really sometimes disturbing.\n",
        "\nWhen people talk about the roots of metal, they usually speak about Black Sabbath being the founders of it all, but all they had was the heavy riffs. Deep Purple had the hardness, speed, monstersolos, aggressive high pitched vocals and wildness that is commonly known as heavy metal these days. \n\"In Rock\" was totally spectacular when it came out. The way the band used their gear in such a combination, was unheard of.\nThe album starts out with a breath taking frenzy, of wild grinding guitars and swirling organs. Even in these days people hold their ears and beg you to turn the noise of, so I can only imagine what people must have thought in those days. \nThis song, with the wild intro is called \"Speed King\". After the wild intro, it slows down and fades into a calm organ part, which sounds almost church like. This calmness however, suddenly bursts out in a orgie of heavy, hard riffs and screaming vocals. The song is still one of the best songs in rock history and is still, which goes for the whole album, vital, fresh and energetic.\nThe second track \"Blood Sucker\" (Also to be found re-recorded on the album Abandon, 1998), is a slower, darker song, with lyrics about a \"nasty sort of creature\" as the band themselves put it. Nice solos and a very strong ending that build up and becomes very intense.\nTrack three is one of the great rock classics of all time, \"Child in Time\". It's beautiful organ intro is amazing. The sound and the feel of the organ on this track has been copied by numerous band later on, but none have succeeded. Jon Lord demonstrates here, that not only is he a monster rock player, but he also has great feeling, and is one of the best rock organists, especially when it comes to improvising. The vocals on the track are totally stunning. Ian Gillan gives one of his best performances ever here, with great dynamics and angel like feel. The part where he screams is so damn good you feel that no one could have done it better. Ritchie Blackmore's guitar solo on this track is also legendary. I have become a bit bored of his style through the years, but as soon as I listen to this solo I forget all that. It really is amazing.\nIf you haven't heard \"Child in Time\", you haven't heard rock at all.\n\"Flight of the Rat\" is the fourth track and is a faster more straight song with quite typical hard rock/metal riffs and furious organ. There's also a fun wha wha guitar part, which makes it different. Very typical early seventees wha wha sound, which I like a lot. It ends quite differently as well, with a drum solo. Ian Paice is by the way, one of the few rock drummers that really has a unique style and feel. You can always here when Paice is on the drums. Might I add, that he his extremely technical, fast and was one of the first to ever use double bass drums for fast beats (listen to \"Fireball\"), which is a trademark of all modern metal.\nAfter this fast track, we move on to a slow, heavy monster track by the name of \"Into the Fire\". It has a sort of Hendrix feel to it, Blackmore at this time largely influenced by Jimi, and has some nice bass and drum work by Paice and Roger Glover. Very cool, bluesy solos from both Lord and Blackmore. \"It's my favourite track on the album. It was so heavy!\", Roger Glover once said. Glover by the way, wrote a lot of the material on this album, hence there are many \"bass like\" riffs.\n\"Living Wreck\" is a kind of heavy funk song, with lots of distortion on the organ. Ritchie is more of a background caracter on this track, which is quite unusual. Although the albums weakest track, \"Living Wreck\" is still anormously good. There is no such thing as bad track on this album. Everything is so well written and played in such an amazing way that all of the tracks become immortal. \nThe last song on the album \"Hard Lovin' Man\" is built on a kind of galloping Maiden-type riff (I have a feeling Mr Harris has listened a lot to this album). The organ dominates the first half of the track though, with wild solos and sound effects that only God and Jon Lord (Forget God, Lord is the true Lord), know how to produce. The overall sound of the track has got a slightly distorted sound, which works very well. Ritchie's solo is great, as usual. Fast and with a great overdubbed harmony. There is a brake quite far in to the song in which Ritchie fools around producing strange sliding noises on the guitar. He also ends the song with these sounds. It leaves you with a kind of breathless feeling, especially if you haven't heared the album before. Totally stunning.\n\"In Rock\" is truly a one of a kind album. There never has, nor will there ever be anything like this. Every hard rock and metal fan should own a copy of this record. It's our history.\n",
        "\nWhat can be said about this fantastic album? \n\nWell, first you have a four octave vocal assult, given by no other than the legendary Ian Gillan, also known as Jesus Christ (Superstar, of course.) His amazing banshee wails have been known to Disturb the Priest, every now and then. I can't emphasize how great Ian Gillan is, you have to hear this album to truly understand. Combine Ian Gillan's mastery at hard rock vocals with Ritchie Blackmore, and you have a winning team. Ritchie Blackmore is a truly great guitar player. He gives us fantastic riff after riff, and his solos are even more amazing. He is deeply rooted in classical music, and it gives a fresh perspective compared to the blues style many bands played at the time. (and hey, I love Jimmy Page, Jeff Beck, Eric Clapton, ect. but variety is good) Add Tony Iommi into the mix with these four greats, and you have my five favorite guitarists. We cannot forget Jon Lord, the organ player. \"Organ player!?\" some might exclaim. But believe me, he is fantastic. He really knows what he is doing. Without him, Ritchie's guitar riffs wouldn't sound half the same. What a lot of people don't realize is that when Jon Lord is riffing with his Hammond Organ, it sounds similar to a guitar. This in turn creates a huge massive sound, which would become a trademark of the band. (well, sometimes Jon played piano and stuff, but that wasn't particularly often) I would compare Jon to some other organ players, but I cannot think of one from a band I listen to that is on the same level of this genius.\n\nWe cannot forget the rhythm section, however. They are very impressive themselves. The two of them are Ian Paice (drums) and Roger Glover (bass). I'll start with Little Ian first (Gillan was called Big Ian, and Paice wasn't really small or anything, but Gillan was pretty big). Ian Paice, in short, just has the groove. His drum beats are great. He can play speedy beats with ease, bashing his drum set, but at the same time keeping his \"groove.\" He plays amazingly throughout the album, and is often underrated when people talk about drummers. Granted, I prefer John Bonham (Led Zeppelin) over him, but he beats out his other competitors at the time such as Bill Ward(Black Sabbath). Then again there is Keith Moon, who is fantastic, but I would still put Ian Paice on the same level as him. I just mentioned these drummers because they were all in Hard Rock bands that had overflowing influence on the genres of Hard Rock and Heavy Metal.\n\nNow on to Roger Glover, who is very important in the history of Deep Purple, despite getting the job in Deep Purple by coming along with Ian Gillan when he was about to join Purple. Roger Glover is a great bassist, and was the co-writer of the lyrics along with Ian Gillan. You can hear his thundering bass amidst all the guitar and organ action from Ritchie and Jon. Admittedly, his bass was not as loud as Geezer Butler, but it is still loud and great. He works great alongside of Ian Paice, which is very important for the rhythm section. Someone has to keep the rhythm while Jon and Ritchie are trading off solos! (which happens frequently) We cannot forget the fact that he does the remixing and a lot of the work on the Anniversary Editions of the Mark II(which is this line-up) albums. Before I go on, I should also mention that I will be reviewing the 25th Anniversary Edition of In Rock. The normal version is great too, but the extra songs you get are great, and the intro to Speed King isn't cut off.. Plus, the 25th version is remastered, which is very noticeable. I have both versions, and the sound quality is vastly improved on the remastered version. Into the Fire is barely listenable on the non remastered version! The remastered version IS an import though, but it is only about five dollars more if you order it.\n\nAnyway, on to the songs themselves, which is what the album is about. I will review each song in detail, and give them a letter grade. (A+ being highest, of course, and F- being lowest (but that grade won't be used at all))\n\n\nSpeed King\n\"Just a few roots, replanted.\"\n\nOverview - That intro is astounding. What a strange way to start a song, but it all works. Ritchie really shows his skill here. Anyway, the song contains a pretty heavy riff for the time, and is relatively fast. It would be strange to have a slow song called Speed King, wouldn't it? There is a neat little instrumental in the middle, but Ian Gillan comes back with a furious scream-laugh, and proceeds to finish the song along with the rest of the band. It is a great song, with a great chorus. However, the normal American version of this song has that great intro cut off, which turns this almost-six-minute song into a mind-numb 4 minute rocker. Without that great intro, the song loses a lot of its power and unique-ness. \n\nStand Out Performances - Ian Gillan, Ritchie Blackmore\nGrade - A+\n\nBloodsucker\n\"A particularly nasty sort of fellow, there are lots of us.\"\n\nOverview - Aaah, No, No, No!! From the first few seconds, you can tell this is gonna be a great hard rock song. Ian Gillan's performance in this song is outstanding! He dominates the song, easily. He gets three vocal parts right in a row, and shines in all of them. Then we hear some classic Organ-Guitar solo trade offs, which are great. The last part of the song is perhaps the most interesting. OlympicSharpshooter explained the effect already, so I will not go more into it, except to say that it is great. All throughout the song, Roger Glover plays a crunching bassline, and Ian Paice's performance is great. However, despite the great instrumental prowess in this song, Ian Gillan clearly outshines the others with his great performance.\n\nStand Out Performances - Ian Gillan\nGrade - A+\n\n\nChild In Time\n\"The story of a loser - it could be you.\"\n\nOverview - The most fantastic song on the album, and is truly awesome. After the first time I heard this amazing epic, I was in awe. If Deep Purple could only be remembered by one song, this would be it. Forget your Smoke on the Waters and Woman from Tokyos, this song absolutely destroys those songs, and to be quite honest, the rest of the Deep Purple catalog. This song is emotional, calm, wild, intrigueing, amazing, and many more things. \n\nThe song is essentially about victims of war, and is lyrically very short. It begins with a calm and beautiful organ intro, which is borrowed from It's A Beautiful Day's Bombay Calling. Roger and Ian Paice give us a great rhythm, which fits the song perfectly. Then there is Ian Gillan who starts singing. He does an excellent, no...more than excellent, job singing. He sings the verses passionately and powerfully. Then we enter the trademark \"Aaaaaah\"s, which you really have to hear to understand them. They start out soft, and progressively get louder and more aggressive. Aggressive really isn't the word to use, but I cannot find a better way to describe this amazing work of vocal art. After Ian Gillan finishes his amazing stunt, it is time for Ritchie to enter the scene. Oh, and enter he shall. He gives us a guitar solo like no other. It starts off slow, and then gets more fast paced as time goes on. It is played and written amazingly. Ritchie has done many amazing solos, but in my opinion, he has never topped this one. Maybe it is just because of the song the solo is in, but either way, the solo is amazing. The rhythm section is great as always throughout the guitar assault. Jon comes in near the end of Ritchie's solo and gives a great solo. It gets faster and faster, until suddenly it stops, and we get that calm organ again, except now Jon is playing an amazing clam organ solo. Ian Gillan sings passionately again, and enters his \"Aaaaah\"s again. It starts out calmly like the first time, but when he changes this time, it is much more drastic. As he goes on, he gives an even better performance than before, and leaves you wondering how he can possibly do it. The song ends with chaos, featuring Ian Gillan screaming over the top of speedy instruments, but I would have the song end no other way. The song is over ten minutes, but every second is amazing. This is the best song on the album, the best song Deep Purple ever did, and in my book, the best song ever recorded. \n\nStand Out Performances - Ian Gillan, Ritchie Blackmore, Jon Lord, Roger Glover, Ian Paice\nGrade - A+\n\n\nFlight of the Rat\n\"Just to remind you there are other ways of turning on.\"\n\nOverview - After the full out assault of awesomeness that is Child In Time, Deep Purple had to give us something damn good afterwards, and they do not let us down. After I gave this song a few listens, it instantly became one of my favorites. The song just rocks, there is no other way of putting it. Ian Gillan gives a good performance, but refrains from screaming. Roger Glover gives us some great bass, and Jon Lord throws those solos at us like no other. The real stars of this song are Ritchie Blackmore and Ian Paice, though. Ritchie's guitar riff for this song is excellent, and his solos are miles beyond his riff. The man can really play guitar, and does not get the respect he deserves. Ian Paice gives us a great performance himself. His drums are rockin' throughout the song, and his drum solo at the end of the song is great. The song is really all over the place after the first three or so minutes, but that is what makes this song so great. \n\nStand Out Performances - Ritchie Blackmore, Ian Paice\nGrade - A+\n\n\nInto the Fire \n\"Out of the frying pan...\"\n\nOverview - This song is pretty heavy for its time, and is pretty aggressive. However, the song isn't amazing like the others, but just a very good song. Ian Gillan gives us some furious vocals, which are probably the highlight of the song. Other than that, the song really doesn't stick out too much, other than being heavy. Jon and Ritchie do not dissapoint with their solos and riffing, and Roger and Ian Paice are great as always. \n\nStand Out Performances - Ian Gillan\nGrade - B\n\n\nLiving Wreck \n\"It takes all sorts - support your local groupie.\"\n\nOverview - Another great song. It is definitely a step up from Into the Fire. The song isn't really super heavy or in your face, it is just a great song. Jon Lord plays great during the song, his \"swoosh\" organ sound giving the song a lot of character. Ian Gillan also doesn't scream during the song, which is the only other time other than Flight of the Rat where he doesn't. It does not make the song any less great; in fact, his vocals are great on this one. The lyrics are a bit strange, though. You know that \"groove\" thing I was saying Ian Paice had? He displays it in full glory in this song. Great performance by the Little Ian. Roger gives us some great bass on this song, another of the song's highlights. Ritchie plays well, but he has better moments on the album.\n\nStand Out Performances - Jon Lord, Roger Glover, Ian Paice, Ian Gillan\nGrade - A\n\n\nHard Lovin' Man\n\"For Martin Birch - catalyst.\"\n\nOverview - Wow, another amazing song. This album really cranks them out. Listen to the guitar riff, it is great. The intro is also killer, as well. The whole band really shines on this track, they play very well. Jon's solos at first were a bit strange to me, but after a few listens I started enjoying them a lot. Ian Gillan gives us a wild performance. He certainly makes sure we know what kind of man he is! Ritchie solos like a madman on this one, and along with Gillan is the highlight of this song. However, every band member gives a great performance on this one, as I have said before, but I cannot understate their achievements. This ends the original album with a bang, but if you take my advice and get the remastered import, you will have other goodies waiting for you.\n\nStand Out Performances - Ian Gillan, Ritchie Blackmore, Jon Lord, Roger Glover, Ian Paice\nGrade - A+\n\nSo, on the remastered import we have some more tracks. There are two Black Nights, one is the original single version, and the other is the \"Unedited Roger Glover Remix\". The single version stops midway through Ritchie Blackmore's final guitar solo, and we miss out on some great stuff. But the full version is there for us. It sounds a lot better as well. We also have remixes of Speed King and Flight of the Rat, which are pretty useless if you ask me. There is a piano version of Speed King, which is a pretty good listen. There is a great instrumental called Jam Stew, and a great unreleased (at least during the Mark II days) song called Cry Free. There are also various \"Studio Chats\" which are pretty useless again, but some are interesting. I won't review these tracks, but I will tell you that Cry Free is great and is worthy of an A grade. The Unedited Black Night is also a fantastic song, and is worthy of the might A+.\n\nSo, there you have it. If you took the time to read this review, you either already have this amazing work of art or highly interested in the album, and therefore should go purchase it.\n\nCheers!\n",
        "\nThere are few bands that can match the amazingly high standards of Deep Purple. Even Deep Purple themselves have had trouble keeping up to their own standard, but with \"Purpendicular\", they really demonstrated that they still are the true monsters of rock. The album really is one of their strongest ever, and Steve Morse injects an amazing amount of good ideas and a fierce energy that the band hadn't had since the early seventies. One can really hear what a great time the band had playing theser songs. \nThe album opens with a heavy, pounding song called \"Ted the Mechanic\". This song would have been enough to save even the lousiest record. It's simply amazing. The riffs are great, the chord proggressions are well structured, the vocals are powerfull, and Steve's solo is as always amazing. This feel holds on throughout the entire album and there are moments here and there that are better than anything they wrote in the old days.\nThe second song \"Loosen my strings\", is a great power ballad, with breathtaking dynamics, and again beautiful melodies, with great structures. The chorus is very uplifting and it stays in your mind.\n\"Soon forgotten\" is another example of a great, wild and fun side of Purple that one rarely sees. The organ work on this track is stunning and you are reminded why Jon Lord is regarded as one of the greatest keyboard players of all time. \nThe album can feel more heavy and metallic than older records, but Steve's sound blends so well with the rest of the guys, you almost wish that he'd joined the band earlier.\nOne of the greatest moments of the album is the guitar/organ solo in \"I'm not your lover\". It really stuns you. It's all just straight arpeggios, but it so good you can't believe it.\n\"Rosa's cantina\" is a groovy and very cool track, which starts out with bass and organ. It's got a nice funky feel about it and it's different in a fun way, not just the normal formula.\nThe last three tracks however are the best. Just when you think that the album can't get any better, it does. \"Hey Cisco\" is a fast, heavy song. It has great solos and nice lyrics. Ian Gillan truly is a master of humorous lyrics. He can make any boring subject into something laughable, something he clearely demonstrates here. \"Somebody stole my guitar\" has the coolest riff on the hole album. Heavy, bluesy and groovy. The furious drumming from Ian Paice lifts the entire track and Roger Glovers bass has great tone.\n\"The Purpendicular Waltz\" is pure blues, with the Purple touch. Great lyrics, great guitars and great drumming. It's a good closing track and leaves you with a nice overall feeling of the album.\n\"Purpendicular\" is a breathtaking album, which crushes all doubts about no more Purple after Blackmore. All the songs are well-written and have got all the riffs and melodies you could ever wish for. Suddenly Purple weren't this bunch of old, bored guys. They were Deep Purple. The true masters of all heavy rock. This album is essential for all hard rock and metal fans who like Purple.\n",
        "\nMany things had changed since the heydays of \u201cIn rock\u201d and \u201cMachine head\u201d. Ian Gillan with his distinctive screaming voice had left the group, the legendary pioneer bassist, songwriter and producer Roger Glover had gone and Ritchie Blackmore was the last victim of changes, leaving Deep Purple disappointed by the band\u2019s new music direction and his little involment in the previous album \u201cStormbringer\u201d. Bluesy David Coverdale was the new main vocalist and funky Glenn Hughes was the new bassist, sharing also the vocals with David. Tommy Bolin was also the new guitarist of the group (and a new great vocalist too!) revitalising the band.\n\nThe differences between MK IV and the previous incarnations of Deep Purple are apparent. David, Glenn and Tommy were not so dynamic and they could not scream as well as I. Gillan, but few groups had the privilege of three top-class gifted singers sharing the vocals (the quality of these guys has also been proved by other projects such as \u201cTrapeze\u201d, \u201cWhitesnake\u201d, \u201cTommy Bolin band\u201d etc.). They were softer, but that does not mean that they were worse than Gillan (some people also believe that they were better!!). Additionally, the new guitarist was not so inventive, progressive, capable riff maker and aggressive as Ritchie, but he was more virtouoso, vivid, spontaneous and fresh than his predecessor. Ritchie seemed to use his guitar as a powerful gun, while Tommy made love with it! Nobody was better than the other, they were just different. The group had also been freed by the rival between Ritchie and the \u201cnewcomers\u201d (Glenn and David), who wanted to lead the group, so they could express more easily their preferences, creating an exciting mixture of blues, funk and hard-rock. Finally, Ian Paice and Jon Lord (always precious additions) had abandoned any claim of leadership, leaving the others to show their creativity.\n\nIn fact, that\u2019s a completely different band than that of the previous years, sharing only the name and the glorious past. However, they deserved to continue as Deep Purple and they added another one legendary piece to the history of the band with \u201cCome taste the band\u201d, an ignored (for its quality) album, which is not so heavy as \u201cMachine head\u201d for example, but it\u2019s, along with \u201cStormbringer\u201d, the most melodic and emotional too.\n\n\u201cComin\u2019 home\u2019 (9/10) is a vivid, fast song, with Tommy\u2019s distinctive guitar and David\u2019s bluesy voice being the landmarks of the track. It\u2019s not so heavy as other openers of the group (\u201cHighway star\u201d, \u201cBurn\u201d etc.), but it\u2019s also impressive. \u201cLady luck\u201d (9/10) is another vivid song, catchy at its structure and another chance for David and Tommy to show their skills. \u201cGettin\u2019 tigher\u201d (8,5/10) is the most funky track of the album, with the apparent involvement of Glenn in the songwriting and performance too. \u201cDealer\u201d (8/10), \u201cI need love\u201d (8/10), \u201cDrifter\u201d (8/10) and \u201cLove child\u201d (8,5/10) are the result of David\u2019s characteristic lyrics and melodies (these songs remind me of \u201cWhitesnake\u201d sometimes) and the magnificent solo work of Tommy. \u201cThis time around/Owed to G\u201d (10/10) is a melodic track divided to two parts. In the first one, the three singers share the vocals one by one, while Jon Lord backs them perfectly playing all the instruments (!). The second part breaks the serenity, with an impressive crescendo of Tommy and Jon, full of emotion and dynamic solos. Finally, the album ends with the best closer in their entire history. \u201cYou keep on moving\u201d (10/10) is a melodic, slow song in which the long eerie vocals of the three singers, the poetic lyrics and the killing solos of Tommy really rule.\n\nCONCLUSION: Caution! I adore that album, because I am also a hard-rock fan (not only metalhead). But when I say that it\u2019s one of the best quality albums of Deep Purple, I really mean it. So, don\u2019t expect to hear a heavy metal anthem such as \u201cIn rock\u201d, but only good rock music.\n",
        "\nIt was time for changes. Mk II could no longer exist since the rival between Ritchie Blackmore and Ian Gillan had left its scars to the band. After releasing a good but not so impressive album, which lacked the power of the previous ones (\u201cWho do we think we are\u201d), Ian decided to leave and Roger Glover was also forced to go. However, the guys who replaced them proved to be equally talented and ambitious. Bluesy David Coverdale was the selected one to be the singer and funky Glenn Hughes was the man to be bass player and second singer too. Both of them were hungry for the fame and glory they deserved. \n\nBut the ruling power was even then Ritchie (plus the other two original members). Although the funky and blues elements are apparent there, they avoided the experimentations of \u201cStormbringer\u201d or \u201cCome taste the band\u201d, which disappointed so many hard-core fans of heavy music. Deep Purple Mk III wanted to cement their place to the hearts of their fans, so they decided to release another one powerful album, based on Ritchie\u2019s heavy riffs. The two singers were not so dynamic though and they had not the ability to produce the powerful screams of Ian Gillan, but they were capable of singing with emotion and soulful vocals more than their predecessor. So, the new Deep Purple were ready to rise out of the ashes of the old one.\n\nThe first track \u201cBurn\u201d (10/10) is a great opener, the song that reminds me more of the previous line-up. If it hadn\u2019t been for the two singers\u2019 sistinctive voices, we would be confused talking about another blue-print of Mk II, not Mk III period. It\u2019s as classic as \u201cSmoke on the water\u201d or \u201cSpeed king\u201d and apparently the best song there. The next three \u201cMight just take your life\u201d (8/10), \u201cLay down stay down\u201d (9/10) and \u201cSail away\u201d (9/10) are a great mixture of Ritchie\u2019s everlast heavy riffs and solos with the softer voices of David and Glenn which mark the changes in comparison to the past. These changes are still in \u201cnormal quantity\u201d, since Ritchie\u2019s still the leader, not leaving their fans imagine what would follow to the next two albums. \u201cYou fool no one\u201d (7,5/10) and \u201cWhat\u2019s goin\u2019 on here\u201d (8,5/10) are also... results of that mixture. \u201cMistreated\u201d (10/10) is the second classic track of the album, which is too slow for an avarage hard-rock fan or metal-head, but it sounds great with a David Coverdale\u2019s outburst of emotions and a Ritchie Blackmore\u2019s dramatic solo. It\u2019s more a bluesy rock ballad, than a hard rock song, but that doesn\u2019t mean that we should condemn it. It\u2019s just bloody excellent! Finally, \u201cA 200\u201d (7/10), is a quite good instrumental (it has its moments), but a bit weak as a closer.\n\nConclusion: Many people like Coverdale\u2019s Deep Purple more than Mk II. It depends on your taste. However, I don\u2019t recomend this album to hard-core heavy metal fans, who may be dissatisfied by some blues and funk melodies that appear there. But if you don\u2019t like \u201cBurn\u201d (the track), you are apparently a fan of... another music genre!\n",
        "\nDEEP PURPLE Machine Head\nApril 1972 (release) \u2013 37:25\nProduced by DEEP PURPLE\nMartin Birch, Engineer\n\nRecorded using Rolling Stones mobile studio housed in a truck, the recording spaces various rooms in an abandoned hotel in Montreaux, Switzerland. All songs are credited Blackmore/Gillan/Glover/Lord/Paice.\n\n\u2018Highway Star\u2019 features an open sounding mix, possibly due to the large open rooms used for recording. Ian Gillian\u2019s vocals soar and Blakemore\u2019s leads sear. The organ sound is distinctive and heavy, as Jon Lord plays his Hammond organ through a Marshall. Blakemore\u2019s guitar lead sits forward and is centered. The organ is placed right, bass leans left, and drums are spread in the stereo mix. There is a distinctively 1970\u2019s thump to the kick drum, captured with an AKGD-12. The song is about driving, and the song has drive \u2013 it\u2019s all about energy and freedom, the groove and roaring momentum and grunt that would lay the foundations for heavy metal. \u2018Highway Star\u2019 not only sounds like an engine going full-throttle, it gets you in the gut like an engine going full-throttle. This is kinetic music. \n\n\u2018Maybe I'm a Leo\u2019 features great shuffle drums, with great stereo placement, especially the way the rolls on the toms pan across. \u2018Pictures of Home\u2019 kicks of with a trite polka-like disappointing bass-line, like a deliberate ploy to lull the listener into a false sense of security before the solo blows them away. Vocals sound overdubbed both homophonic, and with harmonies. Great heavy drum placement, and the alternate panning of the guitar is very engaging.\n\n\u201cDurh Durh Durh \u2013 Durh Durh, Durh Durh\u201d - \u2018Smoke on the Water\u2019 is all about THAT RIFF. Blakemore\u2019s classic chromatic riff is monolithic. There\u2019s a sense of tiered dynamics, but also actual crescendos on the faders. Guitar and vocals sit centre, drums are panned stereo, and bass sits left, organ right.\n\n\u2018Lazy\u2019 is pure blues-boogie, dominated by organ effects. The placement is simple and emulates a live performance in focus. Organ opens centre, then is placed right, and guitar sits left, yet then the guitar moves to centre for a solo, then the organ re-takes the centre for another solo. When they play together they\u2019re panned guitar (L) and organ (R.)\n\n\u2018Space Truckin' features another classic riff, hinting at a convolution of Black Sabbath\u2019s \u2018Iron Man\u2019 riff, but livelier, less doomy. The sound is really fat, with bass and organ placed centre and playing in unison. There are some psychedelic head-games in the panning for this song. The higher organ voice is placed right, the \u2018rhythm\u2019 part placed left. The guitars are quite hilarious, with fret noise panned right and harmonics panned left, which really shows off Blakemore\u2019s sense of drama and humour in this heavy metal science fiction anthem.\n\n\u00a9 Talie Helene 2004.

        "\nLet us get this outta the way first. I'm reviewing the Rhino Special Edition, which means the 78 up there is the blurred average of the two discs. The originial mix is timid and really unbecoming of a band with the energy and the power of Deep Purple, an Achilles heel that undermines the claim that Machine Head is the best Purple record, that being In Rock or Perfect Strangers, let alone one of the greatest rock albums of all time. It's a mix that, I feel, takes a record stuffed with some really good songs and renders a great many of them sorta, vanilla and somewhat lacking in true rock 'n' roll fire. I give that original record a 70.\n\nHowever, those Roger Glover remixes are out of this world. A live edge, whip-crack of electricity over the jazz-metal genius of Ian Paice, the warm throbbing bass of Roger Glover, the neo-classical grace of John Lord's keyboards, the inimatable guitar alchemy of Ritchie Blackmore, and the personable yet technically adept vocal stylings of Ian Gillan. Truly, all of these men are at the top of their game, and this album is only hampered by the occasionally weak songwriting. I give this record an 86.\n\nMachine Head starts off with a formidable bang, \"Highway Star\" the last stop on Purple's speed metal express, killing previous attempts like \"Speed King\" stone dead forever. It's better than \"Fireball\", better than \"Burn\", the last word in speed metal 'til \"Tyrant\" and \"Call for the Priest\" (itself an upratchet of \"Speed King\"). Strangely, \"Highway Star\" isn't really all that fast, the song's blistering solos lending more to that impression. Miracle build-up of raceway keys, nimble bass, and tricky fast soft-touch stuff from Paice, the song rising early and reaching plateau after plateau, first being the smash introduction of the vocals, simple stupid lyrics made hallowed by brilliant melody and excellent phrasing. From there a dizzying offering of solo spots, Lord and Blackmore trading amazing runs in a series that only \"Pictures of Home\" and \"Child in Time\" can touch from the early catalogue.\n\nAlso on this record comes the birth of Rainbow, \"Pictures of Home\" trampling \"Immigrant Song\" under a cavalcade of power metal themes, the drum intro from hell (disc 2 version), and hellishly adept playing from the most virtuosic rock band in all the lands. This has a picturesque scope to it, grand IMAX vistas and churning depths of creativity wherein the wellsprings of metallic invention may be seen and perhaps tasted through the flawless lighter-than-air heavier-than-mountains lead duel.\n\n\"Never Before\" is just a ton of fun, funky and catchy, a little commercial but above all Purple. It's the universal whipping boy on this record, but it doesn't deserve that because it's got far more good qualities than droopy, boring blues-based sewage like \"Maybe I'm a Leo\". Not that there's anything wrong with a blues-base mind you.\n\nThe original version of \"Smoke on the Water\" makes me bored outta my skull, the charm of Roger Glover's bass only carrying me so far, the length and breadth of that being the intriguing intro, thick-skulled riff leading us into another of those extended introductions where we introduce each instrument to the spotlight one at a time. The rest just plods. Again though, the killer remix job on disc 2 improves it, lame-duck original solo replaced with a counter-intuitive and yes, incredible solo from Ritchie, totally strange yet perfect within the music. We get a little bass solo, a nice, straight-forward story morphed into high-drama by the newly sparkling vocal mix.... the new version is well worth a listen.\n\n\"Lazy\" is.... well, I'd call it cyborg-blues, the keyboard introducing a spacey vibe that continues into the next track, bouncy blues swallowed up by the organ like the great whale in Pinocchio. Yeah, it's bores me to tears, and the intolerably long live jams on this tune even worse, but hell, they sure can play. Also, Gillan sounds a mite-bit hystrionic here.\n\n\"Space Truckin'\" is ostensibly the last song here (on the original LP it closes the record) and the band wisely places it after the similarly organ-mad \"Lazy\", same feel but good. This is actually fairly heavy, no \"Bloodsucker\" but hell, it ain't trying to be. The lyrics make no sense, but the almost acid-rock freak out of the chorus, pin-wheeling vertigo of spiralling riffery, and the sheer bravado of the performances carries the eternal stoner classic home.\n\nBonus track, the B-Side from the \"Never Before\" single is an emotional ballad that doesn't really go anywhere, the verse of \"Child in Time\" hyper-extended and without the pay-off. Also, it really doesn't work in this position as ending an album with a ballad is a difficult proposition that requires a really extraordinary piece of carry it off (see \"Space-Dye Vest\" from Dream Theater's Awake). This song is not that piece.\n\nSo yeah, there you have it. Pretty strong with two songs that I consider amongst the best ever written. I'll say it one more time: get the remixes, they are infinitely superior. Well, about sixteen percent better anyway. Machine Head furthers Purple's initial influence factor on metal, and as Boris said, if early Priest tickles your fancy, explore one of the most obvious predecessors on here on the even better In Rock.\n\nStand-Outs: \"Highway Star\", \"Pictures of Home\", \"Never Before\"\n",
        "\nOh, wow. These are the first two words that came to mind when I first put this cd on. Technically this CD does everything right. The guitar riffs are excellent, catchy and melodic with lots of harmony woven into the songs. The bass line is catchy and full of hooks, and the drumming is dead on aim. The vocals are also very good and blends with the music like well mixed paint.\n\nUnfortunately, despite all of these perfections many of the songs on this cd fall short. The CD displays the workings of band that would have been alot better IMO if they would have taken a chance to fail.\n\nDon't get me wrong, this CD is good and the interesting songs far outweigh the boring ones. I would suggest that if you're curious about this album then go ahead and buy it used.\n\nStand Out Tracks:\n\nSmoke on the Water\nSpace Truckin'\nChild in Time\nBurn\nDemon's Eye\n",
        "\nDeep Purple headlined the California Jam festival in 1974. Although some other great bands were on the bill (including the mighty Black Sabbath, featuring Ozzy on vocals), no one could top Ritchie Blackmore's crew. They delivered what everybody expected: a great concert, fortunately recorded and released as a CD.\n\n200.000 people (estimated crowd on the festival) couldn't be wrong. This was the best band on the planet playing some of their all-time classics (Smoke on the Water was there, of course), and also the marvellous tracks from 1974's awesome Burn.\n\nWith David Coverdale and Glenn Hughes sharing the vocals, no one missed Ian Gillan's incredible voice. After his departure, the band increased their songwriting, bringing in some new elements, specially under the influence of Glenn Hugues, a former Trapeze member.\n\nThe only thing we could complain about this album is the number of tracks that it contains. There are just six songs - and we can't blame the record company, because that was the entire gig! Back then, Ritchie Blackmore used to play long guitar solos, spending some precious time, in which the band could include at least two or three songs.\n\nAnyway, this is a masterpiece. The rating: 99 - it can't be 100, because then it would be Made in Japan... but, believe me, it's almost there.\n",
        "\nDeep Purple is my favourite band of all time. Of course, I go through listening phases. At times my brain will demand heavier music and I'll suddenly love thrash or something (Megadeth), and I've always loved Iron Maiden and Judas Priest, they're my other favourites, but Deep Purple always pull me back. And the first CD I listen to when I rediscover Deep Purple (for the umpteenth time)? Yep, it's Made In Japan. Why? Because it's the best rock record, certainly the best live record, ever. And not many people dispute that (the latter statement at least)\n\nDeep Purple have always seemed to me a band that was underrated, since their most famous song (Smoke on the Water) is actually nowhere near their best song. They had great songs from all eras of the band, but the only era that gained even remote commercial recognition was the Mk2 lineup. The other lineups have been routinely shunned by the press, and some even by the fans (JLT era). Apart from the aforementioned JLT era, I'd say that every single DP era had something great to offer, but that doesn't change this being THE essential DP release. I don't mean to be predictable, but this really is that good. \n\nThe show starts off with 'Highway Star'. Now this will rock your proverbial socks off if you don't hate rock music. I don't know one Hard Rock lover who can deny the sheer power of this song, and it was the song that made me love Rock music. Great musicianship from every band member. I remember going into my dad's study and he would play me this song on his record player. My first musical experience was the band that got a guiness world record for loudest concert ever! Thank you!\n\nThe next song is the beautiful 'Child In Time'. This is a really emotive piece, the keyboards at the start are really effective, and then Gillan sings so quietly 'sweet child in time, you'll see the line...' But nothing prepared you for this vocal performance. You'll just have to listen to it to believe it. Gillan in his prime was truly incredible. Some amazing solo work by guitarist Ritchie Blackmore later on in the song. The first time on this record that Gillan's vocals reached superhuman status.\n\nUp next is our national anthem, 'Smoke on the Water'. As i said, this song is given far too much media attention from people who don't know DP, but it's still a great song. Blackmore's solo far eclipses his studio version. It's a brilliant song, done perfectly.\n\n'The Mule' follows, basically a vehicle for Ian Paice's drum solo. I don't especially love drum solos, but this one clearly shows Paicey's great sense of rhythm and technical prowess.\n\n'Strange Kind Of Woman' would be on the first side of the 2LP version, and you would miss out a second of the guitar intro to the song, but here, it leads on from the previous song, and adds to the experience without changing the classic mix of the original album. The middle section is crazy, I just love it. Ritchie plays a lick on his guitar and Gillan copies it, repeats it, then vice versa. This is the second point on the record that Gillan's vocals reached superhuman status.\n\nNext up is 'Lazy', a great jazz-y blues-y kinda song, with an amazing organ intro by the man Jon Lord. A great bluesy lick from Blackmore, and the rest of the band rock out too. Gillan's vocals come in quite late, and they are very effective. When he screams, this makes the third time that the vocals reach superhuman status.\n\nLast song on the original album is 'Space Truckin'', a rocking song with an amazing bit tagged on to the end, which lasts at least 10 minutes after the original song has finished. It is amazing, and a highlight of the album. Shame then, that some people consider it a downside to the album. The instrumental section at the end is amazing. Gillan's vocals are incredible, and at the end of the show, too. Jon Lord shows how good he is here.\n\nThe three extra songs on the album, Black Night, Speed King, and Lucille, though not great, a nice addition, but can't touch the quality of the original performance on the first disc. Well, no Purple is bad Purple!\n\nAll in all a great album for rock lovers, for heavy metal lovers (this is where heavy metal started, even though the music is not strictly speaking metal, it's blues- and classical-influenced hard rock), for guitar lovers (Ritchie is divine), for lovers of good singing (Gillan is unbelievably good), for bassists (Roger Glover's basslines are very technical and intricate). For keyboard and organ lovers, Jon Lord is the man. He really adds a texture to the songs. And lastly, the precision of Ian Paice is incredible. And you can feel he's enjoying being on stage and that his heart is really into it when he does those rolls, especially at the end of Space Truckin and during the Guitar-Vocals duel in Strange Kind of Woman. This is the best live album ever, from a time when rock music was played LOUD! Buy it and play it LOUD and tell me you don't love Deep Purple!\n",
        "\nNoted metal journalist Martin Popoff, a man who I shamelessly emulate in my reviews, believes that the foundations of metal are Black Sabbath's Paranoid, Uriah Heep's Very 'Eavy Very 'Umble(self-titled in the US), and this monumental slab of early hard rock magic, Purple's In Rock. I'm inclined to agree with him, but I don't praise this as effusively as he does, nor as my fellow reviewers do. And why is that? Well dear friends, it's because this is inflicted with that all too common curse of 70's metal records: some tracks are absolutely mind-blowing and advanced, while others wallow in the past and have no modern relevance at all. Just check out Black Sabbath's first record, or the first few Scorpions and UFO albums, the first Rainbow record even. They are straight up crippled by bluesy noodling, cheap attempts at psychedelic wanderings, and excruciatingly ancient snippets of prog-rock when they should be focused on tight riffs and aggressive performances.\n\nDeep Purple, as most of you know, started out as a typical hit and miss 60's white rhythm and blues act. You probably remember the hit (\"Hush\") and wisely forget the misses (uhhh...the rest of it). Apparently the Yardbirds and The Who shocked them into their metallic senses around 1969, because following the sickeningly pretentious Concerto for Group and Orchestra they finally got around to writing some songs that people would actually want to hear. Thus, In Rock was born. This is a truly seminal album in metal history. Sabbath was unrelentingly doomy and gloomy, but there were still founded on the blues. Enter Ritchie Blackmore, metal's first lead guitar hero (Iommi is mostly known for that ghastly rhythm play), who in conjunction with organist John Lord brought classical influence to the unstable mix and sundered metal from the warmed over blues riffs of Zeppelin and company, pointing to a land of Schenkers, Tiptons, and Downings that would cause metals evolution into the realm of choice for the musically adept, and also it's isolation from the mainstream because it refused to just give up and be catchy.\n\nThe opening song is a fairly impressive speedster for 1970, particularly that unique intro, but both Purple's own \"Black Night\" and Sabbath's \"Paranoid\" were more advanced metallically around the same time and rendered the archaic and completely 60's guitar sound hopelessly retro. Still, tons of classical and even jazzy passages to be found, with some hilarious Ian Gillan screams. Gotta love when a quintessential metal singer does a Little Richard impression. Also note the \"house of blue light\" line, words which would lend themselves to the second album in Purple's fabled 80's reunion. I'd also like to mention that the playing is much tighter than anything Zeppelin (or anyone else) put out at the time, even if as I mentioned earlier the sound is very out of date.\n\nI'd say that the primary piece of metal influence here is \"Bloodsucker\". After the rootsy sound of \"Speed King\" \"Bloodsucker\" comes across as completely modern and totally classic. That riffage should be burned into your mind, and Gillain writes a truly bravado-filled metal lyric. It's full of that hokey mysticism and machismo that traditional metal is essentially built on, and Gillain is almost frightening as he shrieks and bites off syllables, really proving how much of a predecessor he is to the scenery-chewing antics of forthcoming screamers like Rob Halford and Klaus Meine. I love the final verse the most, Martin Birch (producer) using multitracking and some nifty effects to reduce Gillan's clearly enunciated performance into a frothy, screaming babble. The band is tight as a drum throughout, particularly Ritchie's nifty solo and some of Paice's snappy drum fills.\n\nI'd be lying if I didn't say that I was blindsided by \"Child in Time\" the first time I heard it, on one of Purple's (approx.) 48 million compilation albums. The song barely registered on my shattered conscious, my mind simply rewinding again and again to ask \"How the hell did he do that?!\" To be plain, \"Child in Time\" features the most insanely focused (and just insane) vocal performance of the 70's, and probably of all time. Purple as a band was always perhaps more conscious of what they were doing than Sabbath or Zeppelin, and as a vocal TECHNICIAN Ian Gillan helped to lay the hard road forward that metal would almost always follow, perspiration over inspiration. I mean, Ozzy and Plant could never sing like that. Ozzy got over on personality, Plant on pseudo-mystic BS with the possible exception of the \"Immigrant Song\", where Plant's somewhat impressive range is dwarfed, pummelled, and in a just world ridiculed for trying to step into Ian Gillan's sonic territory.\n\nLet us not forget though, that there was a band playing behind the wailing banshee in the front, and without their magnificent performances it's likely that Gillan would just sound ridiculous doing his thing. The opening few minutes are gloriously understated, John Lord doing a sparse but nimble organ intro over essentially silence, slowly building in speed and intensity as Glover and Paice come in with some quiet rhythmic pulses in time with the keyboard riff. We finally reach Gillan's entrance, and he sings quietly yet hypnotically, a true master of phrasing and emoting. He sounds almost like a preacher, leading his congregation in prayer over their sins as the hand of fate inexorably strikes them down. Even thought it's a very short piece lyrically, it's such a great narrative and a really philosophical and thought provoking that it sticks with you as you wait for the proverbial ricochet. When was the last time most metal was thought provoking anyway? Certainly not the last few extreme metal releases that's for sure.\n\nAnyway, after the gradual build up we hear Gillan crooning like no one else can, slowly building up to a shattering Wagnerian crescendo as the keyboards soar and the guitars crunch. Ian could shatter glass singing like that! And after he finishes pummelling your ear drums, we get a fucking sweet prog-metal section, some great Glover bass work underneath what has to be Ritchie Blackmore's greatest solo. It just goes on and on before hitting a retro-active Dream Theater deja vu, guitar and organ mingling seemlessly for an impossibly agile neo-classical run over a jazzy beat before rock has such things. Hell, we even get a nasty drum breakdown before cruising back down for a reprise, repeating the devastating operatics at an even higher level and then going mad again to end the song is appropriately earthcrushing fashion. \"Child in Time\" is one of those inimitable be-all and end-all's in rock music, the best example of opera outside of \"Bohemian Rhapsody\", and with none of the kitsch factor. This is serious art, and I really wish that bands like Nightwish and Blind Guardian could be as powerful.\n\nFollowing \"Child in Time\" is another favourite of mine, a giddy diddler called \"Flight of the Rat\". This song is infectiously listenable despite its impressive length, fetchingly rock'n'rollsy yet filled with impeccable guitar. Seriously, any song featuring in excess of three Ritchie guitar solos is good in my book. This one is real close to my heart and the delivery on the lyrics exerts an influence on all manner of smiley, happy power metal to this day. So spread the word around, the rat is leaving town... see, I'm supposed to be writing a review and I can't stop singing this motherfucker!\n\nAlas, what follows that divine trio of perfect songs is not nearly so shiny, and a prime example of that crippling lack of consistency I mentioned before. \"Into the Fire\" is mediocre Aerosmithy hard rock before that existed, and the lyrics are just dumb. Not that any of the others outside of \"Child in Time\" have been MENSA level, but I think the group could do better. So far as I can tell it's about a woman getting stoned and masturbating to a Deep Purple song. That's confidence, lemme tell ya. \"Living Wreck\" on the other hand is possessed of absolutely hilarious lyrics, but isn't a particularly good listen. Gillan would get better at storytelling on songs like the (wearysome) classic \"Smoke on the Water\", but this one lacks push and drive.\n\nI have to admit, \"Hard Lovin' Man\" is both propulsive and modern, and it's very much a forerunner of the manic proto-speed of Judas Priest circa-1976, but it's also overlong, boring, and has too many solos. Too many solos?! From a reviewer who gave Images & Words a 95? Well, let me rephrase. The Blackmore solos are awesome, and the Lord solos (and he gets several) sound like he was having a seisure and rolling all over his Hammond organ. Oh, and Gillan doesn't really seem to be singing with the song precisely and his performance is histrionic and somewhat lacklustre. I do repeat though, this is a seriously cool riff that does not sound at all like anything else in 1970.\n\nIn Rock is an album that is ahead of it's time, but also hurt by the fact that it is in many ways OF it's time. If you want to assemble all of the puzzle pieces that went into the metal of today, this is a must. But if you just want a really good piece of hard rock or heavy metal, you know what? It's a must for you too.\n\nStand-Outs: \u201cChild in Time\u201d, \u201cBloodsucker\u201d, \u201cFlight of the Rat\u201d\n",
        "\nSome people have strong prejudice against mark III Deep Purple albums and especially this album. Sure it is not the classic mark II line-up anymore and yeah, this is not as heavy as Machine Head or Fireball. But still the mark III also created two remarkable albums with Burn and this one.\n\nStormbringer is the second album by mark III Deep Purple and the two new members Glenn Hughes and David Coverdale take even more charge of the band. Blackmore has retreated into the background with the songs being tight and controlled entities. There are no songs like Mule, Lazy or You Fool No One which give a lot of room for Blackmore and Lord to solo around with their instruments or the band go into, long drawn-out jams. The album has three straightforward rockers which all are top-class songs and the best ones on the album along with The Gypsy. The rockers feature great riffs and the trademark blazing Blackmore guitarwork which isn't really found on the rest of the songs. The rest of the album is much mellower than the songs I mentioned. A return to their roots of sorts, quite distinct blues and funk influences can be heard.\n\nThe vocal tradeoffs between Hughes and Coverdale does make a needed difference between the mellower songs. They tend to be a bit too samey so the different vocalist gives them at least a bit of own personality. Jon Lord's use of the keyboards is another distinct feature on this album. The different sounds he creates with his instruments are much more varied than before. As an example, one might mention the keyboard licks in the beginning of the title song. Very different from his work on the older albums yet it works well in this context. \n\nIt is not the Purple most people know and love but it isn't by any means inferior to mark II. Stormbringer delivers the goods although the goods aren't really the kind that one might expect from Deep Purple.\n",
        "\nWhen most people think of Deep purple, they think of the pounding '70s hard rock onslaught of \"Machine Head\" and other albums, so influential to Judas Priest, Mercyful Fate and others in the metal genre. Yet the band did not start out playing within that style. This, their second album, would probably come as a surprise to those expecting crunchy riffs and bluesy guitar pyrotechnics from Ritchie Blackmore, or Ian Gillan's distinctive wails. What we have here is a very solid piece of folk rock, with Jon Lord's organ taking centre stage for much of the proceedings, and Rod Evans doing a much more understated and subtle vocal performance than his successor. It all fits the music beautifully, and though noone could really call this music heavy, even for 1968, it does stand as a halmark of Deep Purple's creativity, even in their more humble beginnings. I've had this album for years, but only now seem to have discovered how wonderful it really is...in fact, I can't stop listening to the damn thing. It has a very evident magical, fantastic feel to it, like the whole thing is being performed by a group of mystical bards or something. In fact, whilst listening to this last night under the heavy influence of THC, I came up for a term for this type of music, that being \"wizard rock\" (yes, I'm rather proud of that, so shut up.). \nThe magic is really evident in the first track, which is a fast (for this album) rocking number with a heavy dose of experimental wailings and ambience, in which Rod Evans exorts us to \"listen...learn...read on\" from the great Book of Taliesyn. The production is just odd...sort of tinny, but very very clear, with a great deal of echo and reverb slathered over everything half the time. It works, somehow, and I really appreciate how full and well defined the bass sounds when you crank the volume. \"Ring That Neck\" is an instrumental showcasing Jon Lord's overwhelming keyboard talent...and if you are going to argue that this guy isn't the best keyboardist in any rock/metal band, you'll be completely wrong. This is probably the heaviest track on the album, actually, because the organ sounds pretty ballsy and dirty if you know what I mean...really loud and in your face. Next, we have one of a series of covers...this one being \"Kentucky Woman\", done by..Neil Diamond, I believe, though I could be mistaken. The covers here aren't just covers, though....they take the original melodies and chord structures, and turn the songs into huge and powerful epics that the original artists would never have dreamed of. This one isn't too adventurous, and is probably the weakest track on here, though it's still quite excellent. Rod Evans has a pretty inoffensive voice, but it sounds quite good all the same, with its deep crooning tones calling to mind, occasionally, some pop singers of the early '50s. \"Exposition/We Can Work it Out\" is, of course, a cover of the Beatles tune from a scant three years earlier, and this one is really spiced up with a host of new ideas and interwoven with some melodic and lyrical ideas of Deep Purple's own. And then we have \"Shield\"...fucking hell, this song is just awesome. The mystical vibe of the album culminates here folks, and the album is worth owning for this track alone. \"So trust in your love, and Lucy of above / And let light pass like a wheel / Don't take the chance of life's hectic dance / Kiss the strength of the shield\". Oh yess, this is definitely music of a very hippy nature, but who gives a damn. The original use of percussion, the intelligent counterpoint of organ and bass, and an utterly great harmonized vocal chorus make this song a totally forgotten classic. THe almost latin styled percussion is something that Deep Purple would experiment with again on the following album, but it's more subtle here and therefore better executed to my ears. \"Anthem\" is a wistful song with the vocals taking centre stage for the most part. It's probably the \"oldest\" sounding tune here as it has an almost rock/country sound to it, and the \"ooooo woooo wooooooooo\" backing vocals really reinforce this...but damn me if it still doesn't sound great. Finally, \"River Deep, Mountain High\", definitely a cover, though I've no idea from whence the original came, is a lengthy epic that's sort of a precursor, I guess, to the \"Concerto for Group and Orchestra\". It's quite experimental, and features some sudden and almost random sounding string flourishes which manage to sound quite out of place, yet because this album has so successfully established an atmosphere and run with it in a remarkable way, this doesn't come across as awkward as it normally would. \nSo whether this album had any sort of baring or influence on the metal scene is doubtful. I was rather mislead when I actually started my Deep Purple collection with this disc. I'm not really convinced that most fans of the '70s Purple will enjoy this, but do investigate it if you have an appreciation for some of the folkier, more experimental late '60s rock bands. Jon Lord's keyboards do of course set this apart from most of the other bands of that time, and they, if anything, are a reminder of what this band would turn into in a few years. Anyway, if you don't enjoy \"The Shield\", you're no friend of mine.\n",
        "\nOne of the most influential albums in the history of heavy metal? Yeh, I'd say so. It laid the groundwork for all those NWOBHM bands and and basically all of speed metal, and without Deep Purple, in general, but especially in this album, you wouldn't have any of that. And if you ask me, Deep Purple are the earliest form of power metal. Think about it: A guitar player who opened the doors for all those neo-classical players, an operatic singer, keyboards, and later in their career, fantasy based lyrics. Deep Purple were ALOT more important than you thought, huh?\n\n\"Highway Star\". Can you say \"the first speed metal song ever created\"? It's fast, it's aggressive, it's over the top, it has a furious main riff, and oh my god...the solos. Jon Lord may be a keyboardist, but him and Ritchie Blackmore put most dual guitar teams to shame. Some great ualing solos between them here. A MASTERPIECE.\n\nAfter the fast ride of \"Highway Star\", we got the slower, groovier, more blues-based, \"Maybe I'm A Leo\". Sure, it's not very fast and it's more rock-ish than the previous track, but hell, a good song is a good song, and it delievers. It kinda serves as a rest break for what came before it, and what's coming next...\n......Which brings us to \"Pictures Of Home\". We're greated by an insane drum intro and then slapped silly even further with a nice riff by Mr. Blackmore. Some very cool, distorted, heavy keyboards are displayed here, some very infectious melodies. Three things though, that really jumped out at me during this song is A.) the solo. Just great. Ritchie Blackmore rules. B.) Ian Gillan's inspired vocal delivery. It's melodic and it shows off his talent very well. And C.), That bass solo towards the end is really cool. Not the best i've ever heard, but it jumps out at you. It does the trick.\nAfter that, we get another break with \"Never Before\", the first single released for this album, and you can tell with the simplified melodies and riff work. But it does it's job. It doesn't dazzle you, but it amuses you, maybe the weakest song here, but it's still pretty good.\nAnd of course, Deep Purple's best known song and quite possibly one of the most recognizable riffs in the history of music: \"Smoke On The Water\". It is an awesome riff and should be remembered, and it's also the best thing in the song. The whole song is catchy and sticks with you for quite awhile, and it just screams \"hit single\", but the riff is best thing in the song.\n\"Lazy\" is, for the most part, a big instrumental exercise, with a verse or two chiming in towards the end, which prevents it from being a full-on instrumetal, but most of it is, and it kicks ass! Very cool keyboard arangements by Jon Lord, good, solid rhythm by Ian Paice, and as always, a high quality job in the guitar department by Ritchie Blackmore. \nAnd finally, perhaps the heaviest song here, and one of my favorites, \"Space Truckin'\" Some very odd lyrics, but that's not what makes this song special. Great riffs, neat keyboards, especially at the intro, solid drum beats, it all works as one cohesive unit. It all comes together as one bad ass heavy metal tune. \n\nWell, there you have it, one of the most important albums in heavy metal history by one of the most important bands in heavy metal history. If you like Priest, Accept, or any NWOBHM, or you just want to explore the roots of some of meal's best bands,you owe it to yourself to go out and buy this gem.\n",
        "\nIn 1970 something magnificent happend, Metal was created by Black Sabbath ... so everybody seems to think. But hey, haven\u00b4t we forgot something? Yes indeed, back then, wasn\u00b4t this also the birth of another legendary album? Five faces carved out of stone, a monument in rock history.\n\u201eBlack Sabbath\u201c, the self titled doomish opener of their debut definitly opened the gates for a new era. But on the other hand, no one should forget the rather raw and speedy effort of \u201eIn Rock\u201c. Except for the title track, Black Sabbath first album is much more blues orientated (which naturally doesn\u00b4t mean that it\u00b4s bad) then the concise and straightforward rockers that were created by Deep Purple.\nIt all comes together on here, a top notch shouter like Ian Gillan, the distinct raw sound of Ritchie Blackmores guitar playing, Jon Lords weird Hammond organ (sometimes taking over the rythm guitar parts), the ever rolling drums of Ian Paice and Roger Glovers fat rumbling bass. Oh, and by the way, how does Ritchie manage to let his guitar sound like some clanging steel bars?\nThe album starts off with the brutal guitar distortion attack of \u201eSpeed king\u201c. I\u00b4ve never heard any release beginning like this until today, it\u00b4s absolutely crazy. A short organ bridge leads then to a fucking rocking heavy song with an organ/guitar duelling solo part and some insane shouting from Gillan\u00b4s side. \u201eBloodsucker\u201c follows as cool midpaced rythm piece. \nWhat\u00b4s next ... so you don\u00b4t know? Maybe you\u00b4re dead as a coffin nail because you missed \u201eChild in time\u201c until today. This 10+ minute monster slowly builds up from an organ intro to one of he most memorable guitar solos and shouting in rock history, sustained by a superb rythm section. After 6 minutes an abrupt cut starts the second coming, which ends in a total freak out.\n\u201eFlight of the rat\u201c is constant roller with extensive solo parts, \u201eInto the fire\u201c features a fat guitar sound and \u201eInto the fire\u201c represents the most avarage song on here.\nUltraBoris claims the beginning of speed metal for Deep Purple\u00b4s \u201eHighway star\u201c, but in my opinion the history starts right here with the main riff and drumming of \u201eHard lovin man\u201c. This solo laden track closes the album in perfect manner.\nSo what\u00b4s left to say? This is essential, this is history, and as many wrote for other releases: if you don\u00b4t know it ... get it for your own sake!!\n",
        "\nWhat an overlooked classic this album is! Not only in the world of heavy metal, but in 70's hard rock as well. People were so busy praising all those other bands that people seem to forget that at times Deep Purple could rock just as hard as Sabbath and their technical ability at times could surpass Zeppelin. Deep Purple released many great albums in the early 70's, but none quite so tight, quite so well-written, and quite so heavy as Machine Head. And what a great album title as well.\n\nOne of the absolute highlights of the album, and one of the things that separated Purple from the other bands of the erea, was the relationship between Blackmore's guitars and Jon Lord's keyboards. Their trade-off solos are mindblowing, but the riff like sounds Lord pulls out of his keyboard are amazing as well. No band has ever utilized the keyboard as well as Deep Purple on this album. \n\nNow to the songs. The first song on the album....lets all get down on our knees and bow to the mind-blowing greatness of Highway Star. Like Boris said, this was the first speed metal song, and remains one of the greatest metal songs ever. The lyrics are rather cheesy, but the riff under the verses is crushing and Gillan proves why he is one of the greatest rock singers ever. There is solo after solo and they are played to perfection. By far the highlight of the album. Maybe I'm a Leo is a lot slower and bluesier but still a very enjoyable song. Gillan once again sounds great and the solos are once again remarkable. The third song is Pictures of Home. The drum intro is absolutely brutal and leads straight into pummeling riff after riff. This song isn't quite as heavy as Highway Star, but this song is practially perfect. Great riffs, great vocals, and perfect solos. \n\nNever Before is probably the lowlight of the album, and ironically was the first single off the album. You could tell that they tried to simplify this song a bit so it would be more appropriate as a single, because the riffs are a lot simpler. However, the vocals and solos save the song (do you see a patern forming here?). Smoke on the Water. Everyone has heard this song a million times, so I won't explain this one too much. That riff, that riff, that riff. 'Nuff said. Lazy is next and is a borderline instrumental. This song takes a few minutes to build up and then we get a little bit of singing until we get more solos. This song isn't quite as strong as some of the others. Although it has the great bluesy feel that Maybe I'm a Leo had, it is probably the most dated song on the album.\n\nThe last song on the album is Space Truckin' and seems to be overlooked. This song is, along with Highway Star, the most metal song on the album. It starts off with a heavy keyboard riff and then the keys and guitars come in and together play a heavy as fuck riff. The chorus is punishing with pummeling drums and guitar riff. Also along with Highway Star, the lyrics are cheesy as hell, \"We had a lot of luck on Venus, we always had a ball on Mars.\"\n\nWhat more can be said about this album? It contains seven classic songs, it is an extremely influential metal album, and the playing and songwriting is top-notch. If you are a metal fan, buy this fucking album.\n",
        "\n[note: I have the 1972 vinyl with 7 tracks, so I will be reviewing that]\n\nWow - this album is for the most part above average heavy metal that would've ruled had it come out in 1982. But, add to that its historical importance, including the fact that to start off the album we have none other than the first EVER speed metal song!!!\n\nYes indeed, I cannot possibly praise Highway Star sufficiently. Those riffs, those solos - nothing quite that absolutely mind-blowingly fucking FAST had ever been done. Not even Black Sabbath's \"Paranoid\" had that constant, driving riff insanity, combined with Ian Gillan's vocal track perfectly complementing the rhythm guitar work... then not one but TWO magnificent solos - both Ritchie Blackmore and Jon Lord push the envelope of heavy metal lead work in new, impressive directions here. Tipton and Downing, take notes! It's interesting how it's really a guitar vs. keyboard duel, but good God does it work effectively! The soloing in that song is just fucking incredible. Everything about that song is - think of \"Hell bent for Leather\", \"Fast as a Shark\", \"Freewheel Burning, \"Painkiller\", etc etc... none of that would've been possible without this.\n\nNow, how do you top that? Not with the rest of this album - though the rest is still very, very good. \"Maybe I'm a Leo\" is a far more bluesish rock-and-roll number but still contains three damn soloes - (anyone wanting to write an album that begins with \"Pain\" and ends with \"Killer\", TAKE NOTES!), and then we get to \"Pictures of Home\", which has some great keyboard work, and also Ian Gillan's vocals are at the top of their game. And that's NOT mentioning yet another amazing solo by Blackmore. \n\n\"Never Before\" is a bit lighter again, and probably the most forgettable song on the album, since the instrumental work is far less \"out there\" in the shredding sense, and instead just kinda meanders in a more \"uhh so what were we doing again?\" sense, like Iron Butterfly gone wrong. Then, we get to \"Smoke on the Water\". Everyone knows this song. Yes, that one damn riff kicks ass, but then the next one, the one people don't remember quite as much, is also pretty damn intense - almost a thrash metal riff going on under the verses, and then there is a really nice guitar solo to be found here. Yes, Blackmore is pretty much rewriting the books on how to do lead guitar. (People in bands whose names contain the word \"Judas\", pay close attention!)\n\nThen, we have the nearly-instrumental \"Lazy\". There's like one verse, and that's by far not the highlight of the album. The highlight has to be Lord on keyboards. Nah, it's Blackmore on guitars. No, it's Lord. No wait, it's Gillan on harmonica. Riot had a horn section once, here Deep Purple has harmonica to provide counterpoint to the shredding of Blackmore and Lord. Oh yeah, which one's better? Blackmore. Lord. Can't fucking decide! Both put in some more killer lead work, both in series and in parallel here - they're totally fucking insane, way way ahead of their time. This album doesn't nearly get as much credit as it should, it fucking shreds in every possible way! (People that wish to write songs like \"Let us Prey\", there will be a quiz later!)\n\nThe last song is \"Space Trucking\" - more straight-up heavy metal, again something that would not have looked out of place on an NWOBHM album, or even an early Accept release. The riff work is something that even Tony Iommi would be proud of. Probably the heaviest song on here. \n\nSo yeah, what to say? Other than that this is one of the five most important heavy metal albums of all time. And it's also incredibly enjoyable. Anyone that listens to a certain band known for songs like \"Ram it Down\" - GET THIS ALBUM NOW!!!\n"
