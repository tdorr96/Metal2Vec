    "Band Reviews": [
        "\nI've wanted to review this song specifically for a while. This is because I believe it to be objectively one of the absolute best metal songs of the 21st century, as well as one of my personal favourites in Gojira's back catalogue. With a very processed but beautifully mixed sound, as well as bewilderingly strong composition, Born For One Thing encapsulates the perfect modern metal sound and combines heaviness with harmony seamlessly. Firstly, the structure of the song is pretty linear, but even then there is so much ornamentation and changes in its 4 minute length, such as a layering of ambient effects over the amazing chorus, that the level of variety in the single is unbelievable. Speaking of the chorus, it exemplifies the clarity and gorgeousness of Gojira's signature guitar tone with a superb delay effect.\n\nAs an extension of this, the guitars on this song are generally very versatile, with many riff changes as well as implementations of grooves, chunkier riffs, and the screeching artificial harmonic that Gojira are famous for. What's more, is that these are all used to arrange the songwriting to be as effective as possible, with a very intense build-up into the first verse, which showcases excellent cohesion between the instruments and a significantly diverse main riff, with about 3 motifs compacted into one amazing section. \n\nHowever, it's not all completely accessible melodies and what some of the older, less hygienic users of this website would call \"bubblegum metal\", there is a notable implementation of heaviness nearing the end of the track, with two breakdowns (neither of which are overused) that signify a great ending, with extremely abrupt and abrasive chugging that acts as a climax to the way the otherwise mid-paced plodding of the rhythm builds up tension throughout the track. Regardless, everything about Born For One Thing is wonderful, and it's still a near-perfect example of a metal song that can appeal to anyone with how varied and volatile its sound is.\n",
        "\nMorbid Angel. Wait, what ? Oh, right. This album is massively inspired by the death metal band Morbid Angel. And yet, it isn't a death metal record. Which is interesting. But seriously though, they do rip off the Floridian legends on a few occasions here. So the point is this album is a mashup of all sorts of influences (maybe not reggae - thankfully), combined into one work, albeit a work that is really long. I guess the band needed over an hour to cram all those influences together. \n\nSo what's so good about this alleged astral voyage ? Oh, easy: the production. No, not exclusively the production, there are other unique qualities at play as well, but although I don't know where Sirius is, as far as I'm concerned this album may've well been made there. They've got that Peavey 5150 type sound, but for every single guitar stroke whether continuous tremolo picking or finely articulated triplet shifts, slick octave chords (often Morbid style harmonized) or mean tritones and suspended muffled chugs, there's a perfect distribution of saturation where the guitars never sound bloated but never starved for gain either. They sound perfectly balanced the whole time, despite the versatile array of sections on display. Added to the interesting (and rare) use of reverb at the back of them that helps them breathe and exude more fullness and a realistic grit, as they're reinforced by an equally balanced and lovely tone of the bass guitar, adding its own bite and aural might to the mix. The drums are ace, and the other Duplantier (the one who plays a bit of guitar and also behind the mic) delivers with an overall excellent performance of tight, forceful shouts with enough variation throughout (including several cleans) that animate and fit this style perfectly.\n\nThe album starts with the now iconic 'Ocean Planet' and its dramatic opener, the brisk breakdown ended with a raging pinch harmonic before an ocean opens up it seems in the subsequent verse section with its awe-inspiring bliss. Later on the song, the signature pick-slide over all six strings action makes a first appearance, and although it is brilliantly used in that full context here with its harpy-like shriek, it does tend to become gimmicky past a certain point on the record. So a strong argument would be made that this track is the ambassador for the album as it demonstrates all of its most poignant strengths and originality in a five minute format - not to say the rest is filler, of course. What the rest is though is an exploration of those many moods the band were keen on showing off in songs that may not for any of them be truly great songs in their own right, and instead serve as platforms to delve into that sound and the different ways they could expand on basic premises with a production that most rock/metal musicians would envy. Going through those tracks, most main sections are actually quite basic; often flat-out simplistic melodically; and the value comes more from the effort put into making them as intense and pleasing to the ear as possible. \n\nThink: if the song-writing on an album was a bit above average, but every second passing oozes with glorious guitar/bass tones over exquisite drums and an excellent vocal performance, ear-candy, peppered with a genuinely strong part here and there - the lure of that album would be difficult not to succumb to. Is it the most substantial album of 2005 though ? Certainly not. To put it simply we're given mostly pretty cool parts, but not great. For example the Morbid Angel riffs sound like randomly stuck together shapes, a homage of sorts to the latter - not really top drawer musical ideas, and far from Azagthoth's creative flair. This could almost be described as a really long, semi-organized jam, with certain guiding principles leading the four-piece until they get comfortable with a part and run it sixteen times or thirty two. \n\nParts that stand out with their heaviness or viciousness include 'Ocean Planet' breakdown riff, 'From the sky' (right in the middle), 'The heaviest matter in the universe' (that riff), and among the more emotionally climactic endings: 'Where dragons dwell' outro, 'To Sirius' outro. \n\nOne aspect, briefly touched on mentioning Morbid Angel is as much as it is positive to see bands mixing influences together, this often comes across as too comfortable with emulating those different influences where there's a feeling of outright imitation of other bands there. A quick example would be on 'World to come': the stoner rock riff with that old chromatic bass change trick and the nosy, almost sarcastic voice tone. Time and time again there's a slight feeling of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu in the sections, a tad too obvious. There's also quite frankly a cheesy feel on this with the overly fantasy-driven lyrics and song titles. Dragons and flying whales, an instrumental called 'Unicorn' or even a track simply called 'Global warming' (that's basically an 8-min tapping section, or nearly that)... all this adds up to put this a bit on the pretentious/affected side, if not precious. Here's an attempt at a song title for this: \"Dancing Mermaid\". Or \"Flight of the gryphon\". Aren't you now imagining exactly what those are sounding like in your head ?\n",
        "\nAnd finally I reached the end of my journey, I really didn't know what to expect when I decided to dive into Gojira's discography, but a part of me felt compelled to know a minimum about the music of one of the most prominently popular bands in the scene of the last years. Can I say that I enjoyed the experience? There have been low points and some high points, I haven't discovered anything that I found spectacular but nothing horrible either (with the exception of the debut album). I've already made clear the vision and general idea that the French band suggests to me, and looking at their career I think I can find several points that reinforce my argument, but now it's time to close the final chapter, to talk about the album that didn't even exist when I decided to start this series, today I talk about Gojira's last album to date, \"Fortitude\".\n\nFortitude is an album that seeks to deepen and mature the change of direction that the band made, in my opinion correctly, with \"Magma\" and for me it remains an empty and mediocre effort, it doesn't improve anything of what was previously proposed and, without going back to old habits, it recovers the boring essence that the band had in their first years. The song starts with an overproduced vocal performance that makes it sound ridiculously artificial while a lyric is recited that makes it sound like a fragment made to be used in stupid tiktoks for video game players to farm, the instrumentation comes in and repeats for almost two minutes, and then the tone changes completely and the real riff comes in, so all the previous stuff has been pure empty filler that hasn't contributed anything, and by the way that riff that comes in after almost 2 minutes of song is probably the best of the whole album, very much in the line of their famous song \"Silvera\" from the previous year. So we are in front of a song that offers the best and the worst of the album in a difference of two minutes, I think that speaks quite clear about the inconsistencies and shortcomings of this work.\n\nEverything feels like they want to have an aggressive approach and they don't know how to keep it, the album starts strong with the first minutes of \"Born for One Thing\" with a heavy riff that seems to set a very aggressive and strong mood, but halfway through the song it gets lost in extremely melodic segments that ruin the experience, and if the promising beginnings aren't drowned out by those melodic segments, they'll be drowned out by a silly and pretentious pseudo-tribal sound that tries to give depth and atmosphere when all it does is kill the mood. It saddens me to hear songs like \"New Found\" that start out powerful and get lost in a sort of extremely bland and unenergetic chorus. \n\nThe idea that Gojira presents in these 50 minutes is probably the one that was there from minute one with Magma, however the context of that album was that of a band looking for a new sound (a more commercial one yes, but it dared to explore and became better than many previous albums in its new facets) but Fortitude is the same formula simplifying it as much as possible, almost all the energy of the band's original death metal has been lost, being reduced to guitar licks from time to time to remind us that we are still listening to a band that at some point in their career was a standard of popularity for extreme metal.\n\nThis last album to date and the last of my discovery of their discography is nothing more than the total confirmation of what Gojira is as a band, an extreme metal band for teenagers who want to feel reinforced with their musical taste, it is true that I have found some really good moments from the French band, but this was more something punctual than the norm. I don't regret having made this discovery, sooner or later I had to do it, but I ended up quite disappointed as I expected something more from a band of such reputation. \n\nThe best I've got out of them? \"Toxic Garbage Island\" and not much else.\n",
        "\nGojira is easily the biggest thing in death metal right now. Writing this in hindsight after sitting with Gojira\u2019s follow up \u201cFortitude\u201d for almost a year, this album finally makes sense. \u201cMagma\u201d was a major disappointment to seasoned Gojira fans because the band seemingly went soft. Always a technical or progressive death metal band, Gojira leaned into the progressive side of their work in an unusual way. They stripped down the sound, got almost psychedelic or spacey with their melodies and most disappointingly, got significantly less heavy in the process. This is not without its benefits however, as I found the band through this album and quickly springboarded into their better work that came before and after this album and yes, \u201cFortitude\u201d is much stronger than \u201cMagma\u201d. \n\nAlbum opener \u201cThe Shooting Star\u201d is a clear and glaring example of what long time fans gripe about this album over. It is slow, moody, weird and frankly it kind of drags. Very odd choice as an opening to an album. It definitely would feel stronger around track 4. This song sat in the at or around the end of the band's live set while supporting this record and it was a lackluster ending as well. Had it been in the middle, I imagine a migration of fans to the bathroom or bar. It\u2019s not a bad song. Its just too far flung from what the fans came here for and this is a trend on this record. \n\n\"Magma\" is not without it\u2019s high points though. The next three tracks are actually pretty solid. \u201cSilvera\u201d is a classic. It's a good balance of the old school Gojira sound with the new stripped down weird sound. It is an early attempt at what the band mostly did right on their next album. \u201cStranded\u201d is a straight up banger although many hardcore Gojira fans might be a little worn out over it after hearing it so many times, it is objectively awesome. These two songs alone created a whole new generation of Gojira fans of which I am a part. \u201cThe Cell\u201d and \u201cOnly Pain\u201d feel like call backs to the band\u2019s earlier work and likely would feel more at home on \u201cThe Way of All Flesh\u201d. \u201cThe Cell\u201d is fast paced and has some of Mario Duplantier\u2019s trademarked snare rhythms. \u201cOnly Pain\u201d is a heavy hitting straight up Gojira style death metal track. No complaints with either. \n\nThe rest of the album was more of a let down. \u201cPray\u201d was decent but for a 5 minute song, it feels a lot longer. It's not even that the record is bereft of heaviness. There is plenty. There is just too little emphasis on the things we love about Gojira. The blast beats, the riffs, the grooves, the energy. The latter of which is really lacking. It comes off as too contemplative for a band who got to where it was by being the best goddamn mosh pit band on the fucking planet. Thankfully, looking in hindsight, \u201cMagma\u201d is more of a transition than it is a trend. While there is a comparable amount of raw heaviness on the band\u2019s follow up, that album has energy to spare. \n\n\u201cMagma\u201d is definitely a weak point for Gojira. While it is not the great betrayal that many like to claim it was, the album certainly was not a step forward. More of a \u201cYouthanasia\u201d than a \u201cSt. Anger\u201d this album gets a D from me.\n",
        "\nAfter 5 official albums and 6 reviews for my part, what I was asking from Gojira was a change to a new direction, the style they had been developing for years had already reached its peak and my feeling was that they couldn't get more out of it, \"L'enfant sauvage\" although it was solvent album, I couldn't help but look at it as rather generic and formulaic for what this band is all about. Luckily, at least for me, the French band decided to use new approaches on this album, although nothing too exaggerated. I say lucky for me because a part of their fan base seems quite disappointed with this album, but I don't fully understand the reasons for being so, the most noticeable changes at first instance is the increased use of clean vocals and the disappearance of long tracks, neither of these things seem like a big loss to me, Joe Duplantier's vocals were far from spectacular and unique and I've never been a fan of most of Gojira's long tracks. Otherwise there are still many of the elements that make Gojira being Gojira, the rip offs to Morbid Angel, the unconventional tempo changes and that tribal, atmospheric side, although they have toned all this down in turn to use more progressive and sludge approaches with some of their riffs.\n\nAnd speaking of riffs, I think I've already said a few times that most of the Gojira riffs seem incredibly soft to me, except in a few occasions, in this album only with \"Silvera\", \"Stranded\" and the homonymous \"Magma\" they already surpass with solvency the riffs of most of their albums and that's why I think these changes are positive, the approach to sludge has made the riffs gain in strength and heaviness, and the fact that the songs are shorter means that they don't have to worry so much about making those intense changes of rhythm to keep the song interesting and they can focus more on the small details of each song, although not all of them, each tune seem much more developed and they are well differentiated from each other, it gives the album a very good rhythm in terms of the flow of the songs.\n\nEven with all this there are problems that persist which I assume will never go away, I am aware of Gojira's need to have short instrumentals that contribute nothing, however this time they almost succeed, the only song that can be considered of this type is \"Yellow Stone\" and to my surprise it works as it develops a powerful riff and is quite out of what I would expect from Gojira, a part of me would like a song with that riff but I limit myself to be satisfied for working as a good intro and counterpoint to the homonymous song \"Magma\", which for me represents the highest point of the album, I don't know if it is inspired by the music of the french band of Zeuhl with the same name (I'm not into that music), but you can appreciate that it is a more complex song if we compare it with the rest of the album, \"Magma\" works perfectly from the initial riff to the chorus going through all those slow places close to the sludge already mentioned.\n\nFrom this point onwards the album decays, the last four songs don't seem very redeemable, \"Low Lands\" seems to please a good part of their fan base but I think it's even too soft even for the standards of the album, the build up is too long and the final result doesn't seem to me to justify it. The song that of course I can't stand is the unnecessary \"Liberation\", an acoustic instrumental with tribal percussion, it doesn't add anything and it's a horrible way to end the album. My question is why do they add something like that? How big is the band's ego and pretension? I know several Gojira fans and I've never ever heard them mention this kind of songs as something they like about the band, I'm sure that even many fans just skip them, totally pointless.\n\nI think I can say without hesitation that after \"The Way of All Flesh\" this has been the Gojira album that I have liked the most, so while to many others this change of approach seemed a step backwards for the band, I have appreciated it, we will see what is in the last album and what will be the end of my journey in their discography, it will be in the review of \"Fortitude\" where I will evaluate my experience with the band in general, as well as the album itself.\n",
        "\nMy journey through Gojira's discography is getting closer to an end, so I can say that in my eyes the quality of the band has been progressing over the years and this is not only attested by my reviews, I myself from time to time went back to those first albums to see if my view of them had changed, especially after I liked the last one quite a lot, but the fact that I liked \"The Way of All Flesh\" made me loathe the first three albums even more when I went back to them. So the doubt I had when I was about to jump on this album was: Will this be an album that I will also like and therefore Gojira will have improved as a band or will it be insipid like the rest?\n\nWell, the answer is that it's neither good like \"The Way of All Flesh\" nor mediocre like the first three. You see, Gojira is a band that is integrated by the same members since 1998 (when they were still called Godzilla) so their musical evolution is marked by themselves, no one has come from outside with a different mentality to propose new ways of approaching music, although there have been changes throughout the discography many of the core of Gojira's particular style have been the same throughout their career and I feel that all their albums try to sell you the same sound, does that make them all sound the same? Yes but no, they are the same patterns but sometimes they make them work and sometimes they don't, each album is a different creative process and that's what makes the overall result different and that's why I have varied opinions with their albums, but the root is the same and I feel it has influenced a lot in how I have perceived this fifth Gojira album.\n\nThe perception I have when listening to L'enfant sauvage is of a band in autopilot mode, there are some songs that are better and some songs that are worse but they all have one thing in common, they sound and do the same thing that all Gojira songs have been doing since their debut, and this reality makes me hate the idea of re-listening to the album even though I know it has some pretty good things that for me make it better than their first three albums. For example, it's the first time they don't have filler songs and the length of the album is normal! They didn't need to put in filler instrumentals that don't get anywhere (in fact \"The Wild Healer\" sounds good and connects well with the next song) and also for the first time too they don't end the album with a long song that becomes insufferable, I actually almost cried from excitement when I saw this, it was such an unbearable thing to do and I thought they would never stop doing it, and the worst part is that none of those long songs have ever been the high point of any album, so their exclusion feels like a victory.\n\nWhen it comes to the songs, there are quite a few that work very well, \"Explosia\", the homonymous \"L'enfant sauvage\" or \"Pain Is a Master\" are some highlights of the album because I consider that they are the songs that contain the best riffs and that is the most important thing in a style as groove influenced as Gojira's one, although none reaches the level of \"Toxic Garbage Island\" which I consider so far as the best of their career, but the eternal sensation in all the songs that include the same things: the intertlocked rhythms, the mix between groove and progressive that has been sounding the same for 10 years marked by the drums, the tribute riffs to \"Domination\" (someday we should talk about the damage that album has done to death metal) causes that when you finish the album your only feeling is that, apart from a few songs that are ok, the album hasn't brought you anything. Maybe if this is your first Gojira album it might surprise you with their unique style but in my case after listening to everything previously done by the French band, this album feels like it lacks soul. Gojira has a style, they improved it little by little until it finally started to shine on its own merits in \"TWOAF\" and suddenly here they stalled, as if they didn't know how to advance any further, as if the previous album had been the peak of their style and there was nothing better to offer except repeating that formula in an automatized way.\n\nThe idea that the improvement that was being present in each album would end here left me quite disappointed, and even more if I had in mind that I still have two more albums to listen to to to finish my journey and I was afraid of finding myself with works created in automatic mode by a band that only knows how to do one thing and can't improve or move forward. Luckily I've read many opinions about the album after this one, they mention that the approach Gojira takes is different, which I'm very excited about because at this point, it's what the band needs.\n",
        "\nGojira add, in Fortitude, to their storied history of pretentious prog metal another record of the same vein but a much greater caliber. The songs here are seldom much over five minutes, but the compositions feel stronger than anything the band has put out in years, creating a distant feel to the album that spaces its runtime out. All space is filled, though very little of it is filler. \n\nFortitude is perhaps the band's most unrelenting and meticulous listen. Part Swans and part TOOL, the band isn't exactly hiding their influences, but rather embracing them and weaving the sounds into the overarching narrative of the album. \"Another World\" sounds exactly like something you'd see off of To Be Kind by Swans, and the riffing on \"Amazonia\" is Lateralus to a T. For the soaring chants and the astral guitar work, Gojira does their part to diversify their sound and pack numerous different directions into the fifty-two minute runtime. What is most striking about this album, however, and perhaps the principal reason to return, is the evocative and creative playing from guitarists Christian Andreu and Joe Duplantier.\n\nIf the songwriting and structure of this album is purely progressive metal, the riffing takes on a much more vast range of influences and design. Traces of technical thrash bands like Coroner peer through blankets of ambient music, and time signature changes get thrown at you one after another as if a deeply-depressed Dream Theater has the wheel. The band throws in some groove metal on \"New Found,\" but unfortunately it feels more Fear Factory than Pantera with its delivery (meaning this isn't the most complex... or catchy music being played). Mario's drumming saves the day on this track, though, and his expert performances occupy every nook and cranny of this album. There isn't a wasted fill and they all add something noticeable to the music. With some of the band's earlier work, overindulgence was certainly too enticing. It's nice to see them sharper and less affected by it in 2021.\n\nThe guitar acrobatics don't relent either, as \"Sphinx\" has some laser picking that sounds absolutely killer among a pretty intricate rhythm piece. The high-flying \"Into the Storm\" has is fair share of picturesque moments, where the band paints these beautiful scenes with a colorful riff patterns and nice juxtaposition between the primordial verses and the roaring hooks. Possibly the band's most unique moment on the record, Gojira capitalizes on the tension they've built for over thirty-five minutes thus far, releasing it all in an anthemic burst. For all the preconceptions of the band's pretentious nature, this song alone proves they can live up to their image if they must.\n\nThe rest of the record fades out in a less dramatic, but equally interesting fashion. The quality of this album rarely wavers, consistently staying engaging and innovative, something that is hard to conjure up for a 2021 prog metal album. The production is cold but achieves the effect it's going for, and the instrumentation is captivating from start to finish. Some could consider this a comeback album, but I would chalk it up to the band finally realizing their potential, and hopefully a glimpse towards a promising future.\n",
        "\nI\u2019m aware that nowadays, given the current state of this band, as well as their enormous popularity in the metal community worldwide, it might be redundant to review their discography, considering that much has been said already, especially concerning their influences, their ideology and its recent style shift. Nonetheless, if there are works by them that could or should receive more attention, they\u2019d certainly be their demos and first two albums. More often than not, due to the praise that endeavors as \"From Mars to Sirius\" or \"The Way of All Flesh\" receive (and rightfully so, don\u2019t misunderstand me here), their early recordings can be easily overlooked by the audience, particularly newcomers. Which is a pity, since they\u2019re a bit of a surprise.\n\nDespite the fact that this is confessedly my favorite Gojira record due to personal preferences, I also believe it\u2019s objectively one of their best efforts. Just as in the majority of debuts, we can appreciate the version of the band that stood the closest to their roots. This is exactly what they wanted to be, it\u2019s their purest form. No pressure, no conditioning, just a bunch of young musicians and their convictions. They never managed to put out something by the likes of \"Terra Incognita\" again. Most of the releases that followed were in effect great, but still a far cry from this raw, visceral and energetic opus.\n\nIt can be somewhat difficult to place them entirely in one specific\u00a0sub-genre. I'd say they started out as pure death metal (yet with certain peculiarities, as you\u2019ll see), to later become half-death/half-progressive, to finally transition into a full progressive outfit, which in all honesty, sometimes barely qualifies as metal. Yes, they definitely exhibit groove elements, but not to the point they can be labeled entirely as groove metal.\n\nStrong influences from acts such as Morbid Angel (particularly \"Domination\" and \"Formulas Fatal to the Flesh\") or Death (in the vein of \"Human\" and \"Symbolic\") are evident. There\u2019s also a great deal of mid-paced, groovy sections that remind of Sepultura\u2019s \"Arise\" era. Albeit many comparisons with other groups can be drawn, there\u2019s indeed originality and diversity - this isn\u2019t just predictable and bastardized death metal.\n\nOne of the most notable aspects is the production, which settles a sterile and eerie ambience the band never replicated, featuring a very thick guitar tone besides a dry drum sound. The guitar work is simple but effective, ranging from fast tremolo riffs with a fair amount of tempo changes, to others that are mid-paced and played in odd time signatures (slightly reminiscent of \"Obscura\" by Gorguts), to slow, atmospheric rhythms that include calm and relatively melodic parts. The bass, despite being a little buried in the mix, has a few standout moments, for example, in \"Blow Me Away You(niverse)\", \"Space Time\" or \"Love\". On the other hand, the drumming is superb - it blends in perfectly with the riffs and the atmosphere. It\u2019s highly technical and precise, every single beat is on place. There are tracks with nearly constant double-bass (for example, \"Clone\", \"Deliverance\" and \"Love\"), ferocious blast beats (in songs such as \"Lizard Skin\" or \"Fire is Everything\") as well as many interesting fills, flowing perfectly all the way through, at all pace, whether it\u2019s fast, moderate or slow.\n\nThe vocal performance also drags the listener\u2019s attention. First and foremost, the words are clearly perceptible. Secondly, it\u2019s noticeably eclectic - not only you\u2019ll find the standard death metal deep growls (to give you an idea, fairly similar to Steve Tucker\u2019s), but also a rather unique technique that many have described as \"melodic yelling\", which would eventually become Joe Duplantier\u2019s trademark style, and even clean vocals. In contraposition with other releases, the lyrics are considerably more straight-forward and blunt. They don\u2019t focus exclusively in ecology and spirituality, as they also address introspective and social issues.\n\nSo far, so good... do I have any complaints? Yes, five to be exact! Namely: \"04\", \"5988 trillions de tonnes\", \"On the B. O. T. A.\", \"1990 quatrillions de tonnes\" and \"In the Forest\". The first four are the typical passages (mostly instrumental) that are supposed to work as transitions between songs, but add zero musicality. \"04\" does nothing for 45 seconds and then blasts into an admittedly quite good tapping bass solo. In fact, without those pointless 45 seconds, it would have functioned better as an intro of \"Blow Me Away You(niverse)\" instead of a standalone song. \"On the B. O. T. A.\" shows a similar style, for it also contains tapping, except it's guitar in lieu of bass and incorporates lyrics and drumming - but it's just as futile. \"5988 trillions de tonnes\" and \"1990 quatrillions de tonnes\" are an utter waste of time. The former is simply a display of tribal drumming (akin to what they did on subsequent recordings, like \"The Link\" or \"The Art of Dying\"), while the latter contains nonsensical screaming/screeching over a quiet guitar section - the first time I heard it reminded me of the infamous Silencer and their (thankfully) only full-length release. \"In the Forest\" is a really solid song, but it presents almost 7 minutes of silence and aleatory noisiness towards the end. The album would\u2019ve been far better structured if these clumsy moments had been taken out.\n\nBut even so, regardless of the imperfections, I can affirm with certainty that the positive aspects outweigh the negatives by a long shot. You\u2019re in for an interesting, intriguing and unorthodox approach to death metal, most entertaining to experience.\n\nFavorite tracks: \"Clone\", \"Lizard Skin\", \"Satan is a Lawyer\", \"Blow Me Away You(niverse)\", \"Deliverance\", \"Space Time\".\n",
        "\nIt turns out that when I thought I had understood Gojira's style as a band and when I thought that their style could not surprise me, I find myself for the first time in front of an album of the french band where they have surpassed all my expectations and I have found myself for the first time really enjoying an album of this band. I know I said the same about the previous album but the truth is that with \"From Mars to Sirius\" I was a bit soft because really after having listened to 4 Gojira's works I thought I was not going to find anything I really liked, now I regret some words referring to their previous album but that is still a real testimony of my experience listening to Gojira for the first time, which was the objective of this series of reviews.\n\nBut getting down to the subject, what is it about this album that makes me really like it? The truth is that several things, but I think the most immediate would be the quality of the riffs, for the first time I hear good riffs in a Gojira album, that subject that the french guys always failed in an unquestionable way. The reason is probably because in this work they embrace a facet that they already had with their more alternative music influences, making that at times their riffs sound much closer to something you would hear from Slipknot and that' s something that favors them completely when it gets combined with their soft death metal style, it makes them produce simple but effective riffs, there are still attempts to build progressive leaning songs but thankfully, like the Morbid Angel riffs, they are not as frequent and are more of a series of shadows that blur a largely solid piece of work.\n\nThere is still that need to show themselves more complex than they are with the way certain compositions take, trying to be unintuitive and surprising, I think this facet is still immature but this is the occasion in which they are closer to work and that is mainly thanks to the efforts of Mario Duplantier who really gives not only a step if not dozens of them forward in this work, being a fast and creative machine on drums and it is really thanks to that creativity that an album that has a few filler songs becomes more dynamic than the three previous works of the band despite being the longest one. \n\nI can't deny that there are still things that drive me out of my mind in this album that have been present so far in all the discography of the band, the need to make short instrumentals that contribute nothing, lengthening songs by creating segments that contribute nothing but do it for having a less conventional style, the classic fucking final song with an unnecessarily long duration and this time accompanied by a very long silence that in the end sounds some insipid notes that the only thing they do is to end the album in one of the worst possible ways...\n\nBut the album has many high points, the beginning without going any further, it's not only that \"Oroborus\" is a direct start with a great riff that evolves in a song of simplistic structure that works well thanks to the good interpretations of the musicians (and even allows itself to have an outro with an experimental touch) but after that start we have two other great songs such as \"Toxic Garbage Island\" with a nu metal influenced main riff that contains an energy and strength that is not reached again in the whole album and then \"A sight to behold\" is allowed to start with keyboards and have them in some parts of the composition and work perfectly showing the best progressive side that Gojira has ever given, the beginning is so good that the first time I listened to it I couldn't believe I was listening to something from Gojira after finding in only three songs better manterial than in the rest of their discography. After this beginning the album has ups and downs but another great moment to highlight would be \"The Art of Dying\" and \"Esoteric Surgery\" the first one seems to be one of the fan's favorites, I don't particularly see it among the best of the album, but the way in which it ends and opens the way to the mentioned \"Esoteric Surgery\" is one of my favorite moments of the album and shows one of the best sides on songwritting facet from the french band.\n\n\"From Mars to Sirius\" worked to a certain extent as an album in general but it loses if we dissect it in individual terms, \"The Way of All Flesh\" works both as an album and for its unique aspects, demonstrating his superiority as a work that even with its flaws shows for the first time, in my eyes, a group with real musical talent, it was about time too, I tell you. Without a doubt I have been able to appreciate an evolutionary improvement in the band's discography, I don't think that in an artistic process like music this can be maintained for a long time but who knows if Gojira will surprise me again or if I have really enjoyed the peak.\n\nI will know soon.\n",
        "\nI think I can safely say that this is the first official Gojira album that I overall liked, the first listen was quite satisfying (although it was a bit long) and the following ones have had a quite comfortable tone that has not caused me any kind of rejection. \n\nIn fact, I could even say that I liked most of the elements of the album, the quality of the songs in terms of structure has improved, they are not very intuitive which makes them intriguing and keeps you interested in the music, and although the groove elements are still present they are not so prominent and those that are there come to fit naturally with the rest of the elements so they don't become obnoxious. The music itself feels cohesive, both in the way it interacts moving between the heavier and more melodic parts and how it fits in with the atmosphere and aesthetics of the album, even the instrumental doesn't feel like a filler as it used to be, but rather a component of the message that prevails in this album. With all of the above, I think it is worth mentioning a great production and a superb performance on drums and vocals by the Duplantier brothers.\n\nSo if almost all the elements of this album are good or improved over their previous releases, why am I giving them a grade, which without being bad, is rather discreet? Because the main problem I have with this album, and with most of Gojira's songbook, is the horrendous quality of the riffs, in a few words I find it incredible that in a one hour album I have been unable to find a single riff that was worth the mention. Well that' s a lie, there are some riffs that are ok and those are all the ones that emulate the classic Morbid Angel riff from the Domination/Formulas era, which are so blatant that they can only be described as \"tribute\" rather than something of their own making. \n\nI think this album is the one that has made me understand Gojira the best, not in vain is the one that has always been recommended to me by the Gojira fans I've met, it represents an easy way to consume death metal giving a sense of technique and complexity that will surprise your high school friends who would laugh at you if you showed them Cannibal Corpse instaed. I think it's thanks to this sound that pretends to be more than what it really is that has made Gojira a really popular band, so I can say that the sound that has made them become famous is one that will never fit me because of the way I see death metal. Still, I won't do as many do when they face a work that intentionally pretends to be easy to listen to for a more casual audience, I can appreciate many qualities of this album and I really see this kind of albums even necessary as they will serve for many people as a first contact to a great musical genre, as a counterpart we have to deal with uneducated unconditional fans of the French who will clamor without any sense about the technical and artistic quality of the band that they do lack, but you know, not everything can be perfect and this album is also far from it.\n\nI don't want to end this in a too negative tone because so far it has been the first album of these guys that I have liked, so let's just enjoy this album, I doubt that there will be again the progression that there has been so far because given what they have shown to me I think this is the pinnacle of the style they have been working on since the horrifying \"Terra Incognita\" but who knows? Maybe in part V I will be surprised.\n",
        "\nNo matter how you put it, expectations are high for a new album from one of the bigger names in metal. It\u2019s been some five years since Magma, and basically everyone was already feeling that new material was long overdue. Now, Gojira bring Fortitude to the table, just for us. Upon giving it one single listen, I feel like all the criticism aimed at Magma is misguided and disproportionate \u2013 not that I felt otherwise before, it\u2019s just that now I can back that with something.\n\nFor the more keen observers, this qualitative downward slope in their music probably became apparent around the time of L\u2019Enfant Sauvage, but right then, it felt more like unfounded skepticism rather than legitimate concern. Magma only further fueled these feelings, and now Fortitude comes along and nails them firmly into place with huge neon signs around for good measure. To be perfectly honest, I very much enjoyed exactly half of Magma; it was solid Gojira, albeit at half the song lengths. There\u2019s nothing to say about that other half which wasn\u2019t already spun into at least a thousand ways.\n\nI\u2019m honestly at something of a loss here \u2013 I don\u2019t even know where to begin, since there\u2019s literally that much to unpack, rather ironically, given how little there actually is on the album. Ok, first of all, let me say this \u2013 if you think Magma was watered-down and made with only half a heart, you can just close this tab and skip on this album altogether. There\u2019s almost nothing redeeming about it as a bona fide Gojira album.\n\nListening to this from top to bottom was cumbersome. When I was somewhere through the fifth track, in my head I thought that I\u2019m probably near the end by now. As I realized that I have another six tracks to go, I honestly felt daunted. Powering through several spins wasn\u2019t rewarding in any particular way either. Moving on, I think a systematic approach would be the best way to tackle this beast. Let\u2019s take our opener, \u201cBorn For One Thing\u201d, which feels like an unreleased song from Magma. I mean that as a compliment; it makes me think that it\u2019s like a variation on \u201cSilvera\u201d to an extent. It features all the classic Gojira hallmarks and the established stylistic approach of late with a more digestible packaging.\n\nI actually had to listen to \u201cAmazonia\u201d several times to make sure that I\u2019m hearing it right. The riffing and the rhythm guitars just don\u2019t overlap right with the world/ethnic instrumentation that\u2019s present, which makes it feel like a haphazard way of dealing with this type of blend, musically speaking. The song comes across like a ragged pickup truck that\u2019s stuck in a mudbank: it wants to power up and show it still has some kick left under the hood, but it just can\u2019t pull through.\n\n\u201cAnother World\u201d was the first single that was released from this album. After going through it at the time, I was thinking that while it may have this radio friendly demeanor and structure, there may be some hope left for the rest of the album. I was hopelessly optimistic, as I\u2019m sure many of you were as well, and really, we can\u2019t be blamed for this \u2013 hope dies last. There\u2019s also a nice riff/phrase that\u2019s quite catchy and heavy going on in \u201cHold On\u201d, but that\u2019s about it around here.\n\nIf you think the Magma comparisons are over, you\u2019re dead wrong. \u201cNew Found\u201d holds a similar aesthetic to \u201cBorn For One Thing\u201d, albeit with a much more atmospheric delivery than before. I\u2019m not particularly fond of how this song is put together, but it does feel a bit more solid than some of the rest. Bridging it and \u201cThe Chant\u201d, title track \u201cFortitude\u201d acts as an idle interlude. There\u2019s nothing to write home about this part \u2013 it is what it is.\n\nTaking its motif and using it as something vaguely resembling a chorus, \u201cThe Chant\u201d simply meanders without any significant developments. It borders more on AOR or old school rock than anything you would associate with Gojira. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I wouldn\u2019t mind the band shifting their sound in a fashion that hearkens back to Opeth\u2018s shift, although you would have to commit entirely to a shift for it to count in any way. Sitting with a whole foot in the past and with the other indecisively in the future will ultimately amount to nothing.\n\nAggressive pick slides, intense chugs, and dissonant chords approaching; what could it possibly be? Well, it\u2019s \u201cSphinx\u201d, and while it definitely feels more refreshing than its predecessors, it just lacks a certain something. It just feels like a rehashed/recycled idea placed in a different package. I\u2019d say it\u2019s fairly derivative, all things considered. With this, though, we finally arrive to the best part of the record. While \u201cInto The Storm\u201d recycles (effectively might I add) the main riff from \u201cPray\u201d, it has a nigh-on fresh attitude and feels legitimately energizing/revitalizing. If there\u2019s a takeaway from this album, it\u2019s this song right here.\n\nI\u2019m not exactly sure what\u2019s up with \u201cThe Trails\u201d. It feels like it wants to go somewhere, but ends up going nowhere, really. Since I\u2019m here, I also want to underline that for most of the record (here as well), the guitar tones feel like they\u2019re lacking a certain kind of weight and/or grit. I can\u2019t really put my finger on it to be honest. Anyway, our closer shares some qualities with the aforementioned \u201cInto The Storm\u201d, sort of continuing the vibe, both in delivery and in atmosphere. I would also like to point out that the intro to \u201cGrind\u201d feels a lot like a spin on the break from (around the one minute mark into) \u201cPain Is A Master\u201d.\n\nTo anyone who was eagerly expecting this \u2013 make sure to curb your enthusiasm before Fortitude does it for you the hard way. There\u2019s no sugarcoating this or putting it mildly: Fortitude should\u2019ve been at least on the same quality level as Magma, and somehow it ended far below. I really wanted to end up liking whatever this album became and having only praise to shower on its path, but it just wasn\u2019t meant to be. To everyone who echoes my feelings \u2013 we still have the first four records to listen to, ad nauseam even.\n\noriginally published at: https://everythingisnoise.net/reviews/gojira-fortitude/\n",
        "\nLet me start by saying that I know this is a controversial title, but I\u2019ll explain what I mean. First, let\u2019s talk about the band. This is going to be quick, because I feel like everybody knows Gojira. They have the same line up since 1996, back when they were called Godzilla, consisting of the Duplantier brothers (Jo on guitar and vocals and Mario on drums), Jean-Michel on bass and Christian on guitar. Their sound has always been quite unique, mixing progressive metal, death and groove metal. But trying to describe their sound only using genres is kind of impossible. Basically, when you hear Gojira, you know it\u2019s them!\nFortitude is their 7th studio album and probably the best of their career. Everything is flawless, from the music itself, the song writing, the musicianship and add to that the lyrics, the production and the cover art. Even the music videos are incredible! That said, it\u2019s still not my personal favorite: nothing will beat L\u2019enfant Sauvage and From Mars to Sirius. These albums are more than perfect to me.\n\nSo, let\u2019s get into it. Gojira has always evolved but managed to keep a core sound consistent. On Magma, the previous album, they went even further with experimentation, almost abandoning death metal completely, introducing a lot fewer heavy sounds with more clean vocals, less double bass drum, shorter songs, more focus on atmosphere and simpler grooves. On Fortitude, they continue to venture in their more accessible sounding side but at the same, they revisit their heavy roots quite often. That\u2019s the beauty of Fortitude: it\u2019s a lot of ideas, mixing both the heavy and accessible but in such a cohesive way. I would compare this to Opeth; not that it sounds like Opeth, but the way they mix the super heavy and the quiet, more melodic parts all done seamlessly in the same song. \n\nThe album opener, Born for one thing, has a really great drum roll build up which gives even more weight to the first riffs and vocals. Then the super heavy riff hits and you\u2019re like: \u201cWait, is this From Mars to Sirius?\u201d On the chorus, they take their foot of the heavy pedal a bit and give something much more atmospheric and melodic, but the end is a breakdown mixed with pinched harmonics on the background, which is just genius! Other heavy standouts are Sphinx, Grind and Into the storm. The vocals on Sphinx stand out: Jo does some deep, low growls. If you\u2019re a fan of death metal Gojira, you\u2019ll be happy to hear that. Accompanying these vocals is a heavy bouncing riff. It was made for headbanging! I can just imagine this song in a live setting, the crowd would go wild. Actually, I think the whole album was written with live performances in mind because every single song would be perfect live, except maybe Fortitude, the quiet, mostly instrumental interlude that is basically the intro to The chant. The Chant is quite unique in Gojira\u2019s discography. The main melody is just what the name says: a chant. Jo\u2019s clean vocals really shine on the whole album. I don\u2019t know if he took signing lessons or what, but all I have to say is wow! The trails also have standout clean vocals. \n\nSo, we already established that the vocals are good and what about the instruments? Guitars are 100% Gojira, crushingly heavy, groovy riffs, pinch harmonics and, as a long-time fan, I was so happy to hear the famous Gojira slide back after not being present on Magma. We also have maybe a first for Gojira: a proper, bluesy solo on The Chant. Not going to lie, it\u2019s a bit weird for them, but you quickly get used to it and I quite like it now. The rhythmic section is also absolutely insane. You can hear Jean-Michel\u2019s bass so clearly on every track adding heaviness to every riff. And more than adding just an overall heavy sound, it adds a lot of groove and there is even some funky bass lines sometimes. Finally, the star, the one and only Mario on drums. What to say about Mario that has not been said? He is one of the best drummers on the planet right now. His playing is so unique, you could give the same drum beat to another drummer and it would not sound exactly the same. I don\u2019t know what it is, maybe the way he hits every note with such force and at the same time such finesse and precision. He does such amazingly technical fills and yet it seems so natural and easy for him. There are so much memorable drum moments. One in particular is on the track into The Storm. The beginning is a muted double pedal bass drum beat with Mario playing what I think is a cow bell. The whole thing sounds like a railway crossing. Truly unique and creative.\n\nLyrics are traditional Gojira: writing about spiritualism, nature and what humans are doing to the planet. The beautiful Born for one thing is basically talking about death and how it is one of the things that unites us all: We were born for one thing. tame the greatest fear of all. we were born for one thing. born to face the greatest fear of all, we\u2019re no one United When were gone\u201d. They are sometimes more direct like on Amazonia:\u201d There\u2019s fire in the sky; You\u2019re in the Amazon; The greatest miracle; Is burning to the ground\u201d. They always offer beautiful and thought-provoking lines:\u201d How can we be so blind?; Our light is torn; How can we be so lame?; No truth being told\u201d. More over, the album was mixed by Andy Wallace, the legend who worked with many many artists: Sepultura, Nirvana, Rush, Alice Cooper, Dream Theater and so much more. It makes for an incredibly clean and precise sounding album, where you can hear every instrument clearly in the mix. They added a lot of little things like a jaw harp, flutes and a tambourine, to name a few. Add on top of that a beautiful cover art done by Jo himself and impactful music videos that fit the music perfectly and you\u2019ve got an impressive and complete piece of art!\n\nSo how else to conclude this review than by saying it\u2019s the best album Gojira has ever made? It\u2019s only logical. More seriously, though I think this album will be more well received than Magma was. I feel that long-time fans will find more of Gojira\u2019s older, heavier more familiar sound, but at the same time they continue to expand their sound into more melodic and accessible territories, bringing in more and more of the guy\u2019s diverse musical tastes. A definite album of the year contender!\n",
        "\nWhen I started this project, I didn't think I was having doubts at this point, Gojira's first album is to this day the one I have given the worst grade and in the second part of this series, referring to their EP \"Maciste all Infierno\" it is my shortest review to date, because although the content of this last piece of music was superior to what I had found in the first album the content was too poor for me to expand on it. And now finding myself in this third part of this series and facing Gojira's second album I am facing the same problem.\n\nThe music has certainly improved, I don't know whether to say that they as musicians have progressed or if it's that groove style that I hated so much on \"Terra Incognita\" has finally grown on me. I was certainly at a dilemma because I started to question if maybe I couldn't fully understand Gojira's style without having previously listened to those who are considered their spiritual fathers, among many others, obviously I'm talking about Meshuggah, which I had never listened to before. So this has caused that I have been forced to listen to the first albums of the swedish band in order to make a contrast, which has annoyed me because I had planned to do with Meshuggah the same thing I am doing with Gojira, but without a doubt what has annoyed me the most is that after listening to Meshuggah's early discography I can say without fear that the style of the swedes is a million steps above that of Gojira. It's not just that Meshuggah is above it in terms of creativity and the use of progressive and jazzy elements, but that they make it sound good, they don't get boring, and they don't get pretentious, even though they are. At the current moment, as sad as it sounds, the best thing Gojira has brought to me is having listened to Meshuggah.\n\nBut I don't want to be overly harsh on this album either because, unlike their first work, this one didn't leave me wanting to rip my ears off after finishing listening to it, however I can't deny that with a few exceptions this album seems rather harmless to me. There are certain parts in some songs that seem to reach something, but they remain in punctual moments, almost in all the songs they have some moment where the sound begins to work, but it lasts little, it is even comical that their want to innovate and to sound more progressive end up being what drags them down.\n\nMaybe this is a basic problem, because I start to believe that they have a very concrete idea of how to make an album and instead of adapting the album to their ideas they do it the other way around, I can't understand what is the point of the three instrumentals of the album, this is the same as with \"Terra Incognita\", I think it's nonsense and that they are adding them because they think that adding short instrumentals gives \"atmosphere\" to their work, but the case is far from being like that. And I have talked about 3 meaningless instrumentals, so I also add the final track \"Dawn\" in this category even though it is not short, in fact it is the longest track, and it happens to be the final one, just like in \"Terra Incognita\" what a surprise... It's as if they believe that to make the album more complete it has to have a song of \"epic\" dimensions at the end, and I'm sorry but \"Dawn\" is a song that doesn't take advantage of its length at all, it hardly varies, and it doesn't go anywhere, until someone disproves me I will believe that it's an improvisation added at the last-minute.\n\nWith its small flashes, \"The Link\" has not impressed me, especially the final sections, \"Over the Flows\" is an atrocity and \"Wisdom Comes\" is totally forgettable, maybe if they had removed those songs and the instrumentals they would have left a decent ep with some moments of brilliance that could serve as a basis for a better musical future, although if we compare this album with the d\u00e9but there is a noticeable improvement, so there is still hope.\n",
        "\nGojira's Fortitude, the French metal band's seventh studio release. The latest in 5 years. Gojira's unique sound, intrinsic death metal compositions, interesting rhythm patterns, thoughtful lyrical topics and great vocals, made them one of the greatest contemporary metal bands of today. Gojira's more early releases such as Mars to Sirius and The Way of the Flesh are considered contemporary metal gold. Gojira's following releases after those albums took a more melodic direction especially L'Enfant Sauvage. Which is also held as a classic by fans and critics. It was also Gojira's first highly commercially successful album. Following the release of that album came Magma, which took the bands direction to more of a archetypal one. It was criticized for being a more simplistic album in its sound. However I believe Magma is a great album in my opinion. But nonetheless came with classics of its own.\n\nNow we are with Gojira's album Fortitude. This album has a lot in common with the last album. Such as it's more simple and grounded sound, guitar riffs. One thing to mention is how much more the drum rhythms are. They aren't nearly as interesting on other albums. However, I do think that these decisions fit this albums sound. The singles that came out for this album are amazing. Tracks 1-4 kick off Fortitude and rightly so because these tracks I feel are the only songs including \"Into The Storm\" that really stick out in terms of great musicianship, guitar work, catchiness, heaviness and great drumming especially in \"Born for One Thing\". I love the reverberated lead parts that come from these songs such as in Amazonia.\n\nIt's just the disappointing thing about this album is that the later half of this album feels less interesting. I feel there's more left to be desired from a so called technical death metal band with I guess has progressive metal tendencies. But all of that is mostly thrown out the door. This album serves as a more arena-death metal album like Morbid Angel's Kingdoms Disdained. Especially \"Hold on\" and \"The Chant\". I can't help to not cringe to the opening lines to \"Hold on\", \"I've been grinding and grinding O! Ocean have mercy\", What have you been grinding? Your pillow? A man's genital area? Also The Chant is a boring 5 minute rock song with the same riff playing over and over. Many of the songs in the second half of this album feel too long especially The Trails where the same guitar line goes on forever with no real payoff or conclusion. The last 30 minutes of this album is so bland and uninteresting. It just feels like the album overall feels like a decent prog metal to straight forward metal one and that's all ok. The mix seems fairly crisp and not overly produced. But the guitar tone seems thin, however, it sort of fits the sound that this album is going for.\n\nIn my thoughts, this album is just a decent metal album with about four or five great tracks that may become classics. And other ones that just feel not bad or just ok. Nothing particularly ground-breaking about this release by Gojira. But it is particularly an album a listener would skip a few tracks on including me.\n",
        "\nGojira has been one of the stalwarts of modern metal ever since they arrived on the scene at the turn of the century, and have received overwhelming critical acclaim with each project they have released. The French quartet combine the jagged rhythms and brutality of Morbid Angel-sequence death metal with a penchant for melancholy melodies, anguished vocals, and introspective/environmentally conscious lyrics. In interviews, the band\u2019s frontman Joe Duplantier cited Americana, blues, world music, and progressive rock as influences on Fortitude \u2014 but, for all of the talk about experimentation, it seems that very little has actually been done in the way of progressing forward sonically for Gojira. Magma received some criticism for having ideas that were seemingly rehashed from previous records, but I think that that critique applies much more to Fortitude than it does for their 2016 album. This is not to say that the record is bad, necessarily \u2014 in fact, I did find myself enjoying the album more with subsequent listens \u2014 but it generally feels like the band is running on autopilot and not reaching their full potential.\n\nThe production is somewhat of a mixed bag for me on this record. Jean-Michel\u2019s bass has never sounded more powerful on a Gojira album, its deep pounding serving as the foundation for which the rest of the music can be laid. Generally, Mario Duplantier\u2019s drums are solid sonically as well and cut through the mix. However, as a whole, the record does not sound as much like a grinding war machine as past records (maybe a stylistic choice due to their indulgence in 1970s/1980s rock while making this record) \u2014 the guitars sound uncharacteristically thin for the band, and sometimes are drowned out by the formidable rhythm section of Jean-Michel and Mario.\n\nMoreover, the songwriting is very strong in some facets and conversely weak in others. Joe Duplantier has always had a knack for writing badass choruses, even as far back as From Mars to Sirius in 2005, and he certainly demonstrates that here. His ability to craft an anthemic hook that is perfect for crowd singalongs has never been on larger display \u2014 see \u201cInto the Storm,\u201d \u201cNew Found,\u201d \u201cBorn for One Thing.\u201d The band sounds much more hopeful on this record than on the previous one \u2014 which makes sense given Magma was largely about the Duplantier brothers\u2019 mother\u2019s death \u2014 and that is reflected in the more upbeat lyrics, for lack of a better word. However, Joe\u2019s lyrics seem a little more contrived to me than before, lacking the charged emotional content that their other records had, even when dealing with stern environmental topics (compare songs like \u201cToxic Garbage Island\u201d and \u201cTo Sirius\u201d to the lyrics on \u201cAmazonia\u201d). \n\nWhen the band actually does delve into their different influences, it pays off well the majority of the time. \u201cAmazonia\u201d features tribal instruments and an almost Americana-inspired bridge section that works well; \u201cHold On\u201d\u2019s begins with layered vocal harmonies and has some neat rock-esque passages throughout; \u201cThe Trails\u201d is a solid softer cut that invokes thoughts of a less dark \u201cWorld to Come\u201d; \u201cGrind\u201d has a phenomenally heart-wrenching outro that feels like it\u2019s stripped from a post-metal song. The example that really stands out to me is \u201cThe Chant\u201d \u2014 a song that I actually think is one of the best on the record, which puts me in the minority. Although I could do without the \u201cFortitude\u201d interlude that leads into this song, as it is basically just an acoustic version of the song that comes after, this song was one of the few that truly stuck with me after my first listen. It almost sounds like \u201cThe Hunter\u201d-era Mastodon, Kyuss, and \u201cSongs for the Deaf\u201d-era QOTSA had a baby deep down in the bayou. While it does get a little repetitive \u2014 a problem that can plague other parts of the record, too (i.e. \u201cAnother World\u201d) \u2014 its gorgeous vocal harmonies and jammy stoner-rock riffs made an impact on me.\n\nIronically, it is when the band is writing their \u201cmeat-and-potatoes\u201d Gojira tunes that I feel they fall short of the mark. None of the riffs or songs are bad, necessarily, but as I said before, they feel like they are uninspired. \u201cBorn For One Thing\u201d sounds like a B-side that didn\u2019t make the cut from Magma, a statement that also applies to \u201cInto the Storm,\u201d which comes off as a longer and more melodic version of \u201cThe Cell.\u201d \u201cSphinx\u201d is probably the worst example of rehashing old material, as the main riff to this is almost a carbon copy of \u201cTo Sirius\u201d from their 2005 album. While songs like \u201cNew Found\u201d and \u201cGrind\u201d are very heavy and will get the crowd moving once touring resumes worldwide, I wonder how many times the band can use pick scrapes, tapping, and gallop rhythms before they themselves get bored of it? The band seems torn in two directions at the same time, opting to soften and simplify their sound in some areas for more atmospheric soundscapes, while also failing to really write anything super interesting on the heavier side of the spectrum, given that same reduction in complexity (and, frankly, intensity). In my opinion, the stripped down structures and ideas worked on Magma because the songs were all strong and substantive; on Fortitude, this concept is utilized with hit-or-miss results. It is not a bad record by any means, and I will definitely return to it a few more times, but I was really hoping for more.\n\nTAKE: \u201cAmazonia,\u201d \u201cHold On,\u201d \u201cNew Found,\u201d \u201cThe Chant,\u201d \u201cInto the Storm,\u201d \u201cGrind\u201d\nLEAVE: \u201cSphinx\u201d\n",
        "\nSomething new but highly anticipated. After the release of Magma in 2016 major Gojira fans could definitely see the change from the technicality in the favor of the atmosphere. While Magma is still a search for the right formula, Fortitude is much more cleaner, but there's still a little work to be the perfect album.\n\nRegarding the songwriting and lyrics, Gojira didn't change it's environmentalism approach about the importance of taking care about the nature, some songs like \"Amazonia\" and \"Another world\" have a really clear message about the imagery of the four Frenchmen, some songs like \"Born for one thing\" and \"The trails\" have much more subtle messages that can be interpreted in many other ways, this adding to the already existing songwriting bravura.\n\nPickscrapes, whammy pedals, pinch and natural harmonics, tremolo picking, drop tunings, breakdowns and satisfying outros this album has everything that makes Gojira, the band most of the metal community loves, and even more we can witness some melodic guitar solos during \"Hold On\" and \"The Chant\" and some innovative choruses in these two and a lot of clean vocals as well on these tracks and on \"The trails\" as well. We have the typical instrumental track that we were used to on the previous records as well, which is also the album's title \"Fortitude\" which perfectly blends as an intro to \"The Chant\". \n\nThe only thing that these guys are always arguing about when releasing a new album is the production. The hero of this album can easily be called Jean-Michel Labadie, if there's something that is perfect on this album is the bass guitar work, without a doubt. Joe's voice sounds a little bit washed out and sounds too distant on some tracks and lacks some presence, even if the vocal lines fit to the songs, surely it will sound much better on live versions. \n\nThe album ends with \"Grind\" which reminds us about the typical Gojira sound we were used to and could easily belong to From Mars to Sirius, The Way of All Flesh or L'enfant sauvage, stating that even though these guys are experimenting and constantly evolving, they are proud of their roots and they are not going to abandon their heaviness.\n\nAs a conclusion we can witness a new album that was more like a continuity or an improved version of Magma, it\u2019s definitely something else, and because taste is something so subjective a lot of die-hard fans will feel disappointed, but on the same page Gojira reached out to a larger audience as well with some softer tracks. In my opinion is a solid good album, but a little short from the three monster-albums mentioned above.\n",
        "\nTo start this review i will say, I\u2019m not the biggest Gojira fan, not anymore. This album is very good and i think it will put them high up in the metal scene, their popularity has grown a lot in the last year or so and this album will just help to boost them up even more. Like all things it has flaws but in general, i must say it\u2019s great; i think it\u2019s a great recap of all they have done over their musical career, especially their later years, the heaviness of From mars to Sirius, the more groovy stuff from L\u2019enfant Sauvage and the more laid back almost stoner vibe from magma. In general it does a great job at taking all elements but i think it misses a bit of that older heaviness that the more long time fans wish for; those who came with magma are probably disappointed to see a heavier style but i think they made the best from what they had previously done.\n\nIn my opinion it misses punch on most of the heavier songs and emotion on the slower songs but it\u2019s still great. I didn\u2019t wait for this record, as iv\u2019e said, I\u2019m not a super Gojira fan and as such, i didn\u2019t have much to expect, but it delivered. I was pleasantly surprised by most of the heavier songs, they offer a good mix of different elements which i liked from the previous albums. The lighter songs on the other hand are what lowered the note for me, otherwise it would have been a 100%. \n\nStarting with the negative, weakest songs for me are The chant, Sphinx and Into the storm; Not bad by any means but they\u2019re weighing down the album for me. The chant is a great concept but it\u2019s repetitive nature and it\u2019s length make it unpleasant to me (i prefer longer songs but it\u2019s very stretched out for no reason in my opinion). Then we have Sphinx and Into the storm, both lack the punch to be great songs and so are weaker but they\u2019re still good apart from the almost pop chorus on Into the storm.\n\nFor the middle ground, Another world and fortitude. Fortitude is an interlude, a good one but interludes are never one\u2019s favourite song on the album. Another world was very well received by the community but i didn\u2019t like it that much, it doesn't have that punch that makes me want to listen to it over and over again so it gets the middle ground for me.\n\nNow for great songs, Born for one thing, Amazonia, Hold on, New found, Grind and The trails. Born for one thing is great, it\u2019s the first one that dropped after Another world; it\u2019s heavy, groovy and satisfying, i don\u2019t have much to say about it, it\u2019s just great, and it bring back From mars to Sirius flashbacks. Amazonia quickly became on of my favourites, it\u2019s a little slower but equally as good in my opinion, more groovy and outlandish. Hold on is just a great song, one of the pillars of the album. Every album has these songs that support it they\u2019re in the middle and they\u2019re the backbone of it, this one along with New found are doing just that, both very heavy, emotional songs that just bring so much to the table for this one, they have to be in the best ones. The trails is a smoother song and i think it does a great job at being exactly that, not much else to be said. Last but not least, Grind. This is probably my favourite song along with New found. The first half is very heavy and emotional while the later half is slower and brings a nice end to this album.\n\nTo finish it off, this is definitely one of the better Gojira albums, especially in recent years. I really like the general direction that this album takes. The songs take different directions and bring different things while sticking to Gojira\u2019s signature style and still incorporating other elements at the same time. Also i think the mix is really good, Everything is clear and we can really hear the bass well compared to other Gojira albums which just makes it better, especially on songs like Grind where it takes a larger place in both the main riff and the outro. If the band continues in. This direction they will definitely continue to rise as one of the most influential metal bands out there.\n",
        "\nHeirs apparent to the current generation of festival headliners, Gojira return after five years with Fortitude. It\u2019s the bands seventh full length and arguably one of the biggest releases of 2021. As a follow up to 2016\u2019s Magma which despite its critical acclaim was still somewhat of an outlier album, expectations are sky high. Will Magma\u2019s venture into melancholy accessibility continue or do we see a true return to the groovy death metal days? \n\nGojira gives us no definitives in their answer. Instead, it\u2019s a masterclass in balance and variance that\u2019s presented here bringing together everything that makes the band such a standout performance. The band wavers between its signature groovy touching-on-industrial riffs, epic choruses, thundering hypnotic instrumental sections and melancholy brooding parts. But it does so this time with an improved feeling for avoiding a song or the album as a whole to overstay its welcome. It\u2019s also more successful in achieving just the right balance in the order of songs on the album. In that sense Fortitude is a more logical successor of L\u2019Enfant Sauvage. It finds a middle ground between the intelligence and force of that album while still bringing back the catchiness and accessibility of Magma.\n\nThe four singles released before put their best foot forward and will surely find their way to most setlists in the future. Born for One thing is quintessentially Gojira with thunderous mechanical riffs, a chorus made for wild festival masses screaming along and a climactic ending. Amazonia follows up with tribal grooviness and exotic instrumental touches inspired by Sepultura\u2019s Roots Bloody Roots creating a powerful raunchy bouncy feel. Another World follows more the approach of Magma\u2019s the Shooting Star with its meditative melancholy vibe. But the highlights are not limited to the singles alone.\n\nHold On surprises with a powerful build up towards chaotic epic intensity and New Found induces trance-like moments through its hypnotic percussive drum class. Both will equally work well live. The like of Sphinx and the roaring freight train that is Grind bring back a couple of beasties of riffs reminding of the From Mars to Sirius days. \n\nAny downsides at all? Some minor comments go out to The Chant where the repeating chants drag on a bit. But the playful leads playing over the chorus prevent it from going into snore territory. The album also feels less coherent compared to some of its predecessors; it\u2019s more of a collection of potential singles in that sense. But none of this brings down the feeling of overwhelming exhilaration after yet another spin of this beast of an album. \n\nFortitude has a very real chance of bringing Gojira into serious mainstream territory. No major concessions were made but the smart variety in songs coupled with an appropriate catchiness at times hits all the right buttons. Will this indeed become Gojira\u2019s breakthrough into the mainstream? If there ever was a chance, this is it. Next stop: any and all major venue near you for some serious sonic destruction work.\n",
        "\nAt this point, Gojira don't really need an introduction. If you are reading this, you probably either know them and their trademark style of groove-laden progressive metal for a while now, or you've been introduced to them during their massively successful previous album cycle, which lifted them into the ranks and upon the stages of such acts as Slipknot and fucking Metallica. Yes, that Metallica. That ultimate sphere of commercial metal success.\n\nBecause of this, the expectations for this album were inconceivably high, both from the gargantuan new audience they acquired during the Magma-era and from the old fans who, me included, were somewhat disappointed with how Magma turned out; it was an album that certainly had it's high points, but they were unfortunately buried in an ocean of dull riffs, monotonous song-writing and uninspired melodies, too repetitive to hold a candle to what Gojira once represented. At the same time it was a very approachable album that mesmerized a lot of people who usually don't venture forth into the more extreme parts of metal where Gojira originated, something they achieved partially due to the energetic live shows they pulled of when touring with Metallica and Slipknot. That being said: Pleasing both of these very different demographics at the same time is not an easy task, but they pulled it off graciously.\n\nThe early singles foreshadowed this greatly. \"Another World\" is a soaring, beautiful prog metal anthem with a gorgeous vocal harmony in the chorus and a strong sense of progression that explodes in the last few minutes, \"Born For One Thing\" is a groovy, varied and heavy rager with a gigantic breakdown at the end that's gonna cause some violence at shows, while \"Amazonia\" is a more experimental rock song that flows greatly and has a great cause backing it up. I hoped that the full album could hold up with these great singles, and now that they've released, I'm more than happy to say that they succeeded.\n\nEveryone in the band brings his all to this album, oppositely to what Magma sounded like. The bass is rumbling, varied and audible, the guitar work is dense, aggressive and catchy, and Mario Duplantier is just Mario Duplantier, delivering a wide array of intricate patterns, powerful fills and poly-rhythms, notably on songs like \"Into The Storm\" or \"Sphinx\", which have a strong death metal bite to them, something I really hoped they would bring back. Joe's vocals are just incredible as well, with his signature pitched-scream executed to near perfection, while at the same time more competently gliding through the clean passages than on Magma. What really makes it all come together though is the production, where they've once again bested themselves. The highs are clear, precise and nuanced, the mids thick and in-your-face, and the bass deep, pummeling and massive. All of these amalgamate in a beautiful wall of sound that crashes on you like a tsunami. Listening to this album on vinyl with some great speakers on full volume was a religious experience.\n\nUnfortunately it's not all splendid, as some of the things that weighed Magma down return here as well, namely on \"The Trails\" and \"The Chant\". They aren't bad songs by any means, but they lack the variation and impulse the rest of the songs contain, and the vocal melodies feel a bit uninspired. They will surely satisfy some of the Magma-apologists though. Apart from that, if you're accustomed to the band's sound, a lot of the really good parts on this record might sound familiar to you. There's also sometimes a dull riff to be found here or there, like the verse of \"Another World\", but they are usually still implemented effectively in the songwriting, which really is this records biggest strength, exemplified perfectly by the closure, my favorite track of the album.\n\nThe last song is called \"Grind\", and it's a climax so bombastic and emotional that it made my eyes water while first listening to it high as all fuck on my way home at night. It's contains everything you expect from post-L'Enfant Gojira, just far more mature, potent and refined, oscillating between an actually brutal verse with massive grooves, blast beats, and those iconic Gojira-riffs from their death metal beginnings, to a melancholic \"chorus\"/outro with a catchy as fuck chord progression, slowed-down drums and a perfectly fitting bass-line. That chord progression is dragged out during the outro and expanded upon, with more and more layers coming to the party until it fades to the progression being played on an acoustic guitar, becoming quieter and quieter until the album ends. It's a perfect send-off and a gorgeous tune, summarizing an album filled to the brim with highlights.\n\nListen to it completely, and take your time with it. Gojira is back, kids. And they will be here to stay.\n\nFavorite tracks: Grind, Born For One Thing, Into The Storm\nLeast favorite tracks: The Chant, The Trails\n",
        "\nThe most immediate problem with Fortitude is that it really lacks a unique identifying \u201cfeature\u201d compared to previous Gojira records. Terra Incognita had the raw death metal aggression, The Link had an experimental tribal feel, From Mars to Sirius had an ambitious conceptual feel, and so on. Somehow, Fortitude manages to sound like a synthesis of all of the band\u2019s previous albums while lacking the sense of both wonder and impact they all had. Sure, the chugs and technical drumming still come out from time to time, but they\u2019re buried beneath Gojira\u2019s insistence on playing dull one-note riffs that linger for a little too long. It\u2019s not like I\u2019m resistant to the prospect of the band experimenting - again, The Link is a nice example of that - but it\u2019s gotta be over a more interesting foundation than this.\n\nFor instance, the main riff of \u201cAnother World\u201d is pretty cool; Christian Andreu\u2019s lead guitar and Jean-Michel Labadie\u2019s bass coil around each other to give off a strangely futuristic atmosphere. But then it all falls apart in the verses, which just consist of a boring chugging riff that doesn\u2019t go anywhere interesting. It\u2019s nice to hear Joe Duplantier still bringing the energy with his screams and growls, but they don\u2019t matter much when the material itself is so lacking in heft and intensity. Meanwhile, some songs don\u2019t even sound like they came from Gojira at all. When the a cappella harmonies of \u201cHold On\u201d started, I had to look at my phone to make sure I was still listening to the same band. Indeed, Joe does perform a lot more clean vocals on Fortitude - these are most prominently heard on \u201cHold On\u201d, \u201cThe Chant\u201d, and \u201cThe Trails\u201d. And, truth be told, Duplantier has really proven himself to be a capable clean vocalist over the last five years or so. The harmonies in \u201cHold On\u201d are actually quite beautiful, despite the fact that the song eventually switches to a more typical groovy Gojira track halfway through.\n\nWhat really drags this album down more than everything else, however, is the production. It\u2019s quite strange that Duplantier is the same person who produced Way of All Flesh, as Fortitude has none of the same weight, atmosphere, or clarity in its mix. The guitars sound both muddy and unappealing in the chugging bits (the verses of \u201cAmazonia\u201d for instance), and really flavorless during the melodic sections (\u201cThe Trails\u201d in particular). It also does no favors for Mario Duplantier, especially during the more technical tracks like \u201cGrind\u201d and \u201cInto the Storm\u201d. He performs some pretty amazing parts during these songs, but all I can think of is how much better they\u2019d sound with a From Mars to Sirius-esque production job. Speaking of \u201cInto the Storm\u201d, that very song represents what kind of record Fortitude could have been; the track is a perfect mix of the band\u2019s more heavy/technical traits and their melodic tendencies. Sure, the main drum part was lifted from \u201cThe Cell\u201d off of Magma to an extent, but the riff played over it is one of the most beautifully melancholic parts I\u2019ve ever heard from this group.\n\nFortitude is a strange affair, as its oddities tend to come from Gojira\u2019s push toward a more simplistic and mainstream sound. On one hand, I suppose that makes it a logical step after the stripped-down music of Magma; on the other hand, it just doesn\u2019t feel natural for some reason. The band\u2019s willingness to step outside of their comfort zone is commendable, but if they\u2019re keen on committing to this new sound of theirs, they need to give it a little more polish and focus. As it stands, Fortitude is a decent metal record. However, it doesn\u2019t really offer anything that Gojira\u2019s prior albums haven\u2019t done better.\n",
        "\nSomething I\u2019ve always found a bit perplexing about The Link is that there\u2019s not much backstory behind it. Gojira\u2019s debut Terra Incognita has plenty of interesting tidbits to its name, such as how frontman Joe Duplantier lived in a secluded cabin for two years while coming up with inspiration for the record, or how the interlude \u201c04\u201d was intended by Joe and his brother Mario to be a birthday present for their mother. But The Link is\u2026 just The Link. Even the cover art - while indicative of the more tribal elements on the record (we\u2019ll get to that) - is very unassuming. As such, its popularity and significance are often dwarfed by the records that sandwich it. Terra Incognita is the brutal and aggressive fan-favorite debut, and From Mars to Sirius is the breakthrough album that brought them significant acclaim in the wider metal community. But that doesn\u2019t mean we should be forgetting about The Link.\n\nNot in the slightest. On top of being a necessary stepping stone for Gojira\u2019s progression, it\u2019s also quite possibly the strangest and most experimental record of theirs to date. You\u2019ll find the usual helping of groovy chugs and double bass worship, but it\u2019s all topped off with the aforementioned tribal elements as well as a more \u201cmystical\u201d overall vibe. Right from the title track, you\u2019re thrown into an otherworldly environment full of droning vocal inflections, hypnotic grooves, and wood block percussion; suddenly, the world crafted by Terra Incognita has expanded and become an even more diverse place to explore. Death metal sections are still present on The Link but they\u2019re used much more sparingly this time around to make room for an expanding palette of influences. Whether it be the beautiful ambient interlude \u201cTorii\u201d, the doom metal-inspired riffs of \u201cInward Movement\u201d, or the lengthy post-metal mini-epic that is \u201cDawn\u201d, the unpredictability of The Link\u2019s tracklist goes a long way in describing its appeal to anyone who\u2019s a bit bored with the current iteration of the band\u2019s sound.\n\nYet the surprise comes in just how well the songs flow into each other. You\u2019d think so many disparate elements being put together would cause some massive consistency issues, but such is not the case with The Link. Even at this stage, Gojira were great at knowing what transitions and dynamics to use at the right times. A perfect example would be the one-two-three punch of \u201cConnected\u201d, \u201cRemembrance\u201d, and \u201cTorii\u201d. Technically, only one of these is a full-length song; however, all three of them flow into each other so well that you\u2019d might as well treat it as one single eight-minute track. \u201cConnected\u201d opens up with some light tribal drumming that opens the gates for the death metal fury of \u201cRemembrance\u201d; in turn, the amazing breakdown of \u201cRemembrance\u201d fades out to set the stage for the lovely \u201cTorii\u201d to take place. Meanwhile, you can perceive \u201cWisdom Comes\u201d as the band letting out their final blast of death metal aggression before the expansive and slow-moving \u201cDawn\u201d moves in to bring The Link to a fitting close. While I\u2019d argue From Mars to Sirius is even more well-constructed because it uses a concrete narrative to tie the songs together, this album is no slouch either.\n\nAs one would expect from a Gojira album, the performances here are absolutely stellar. Joe and lead guitarist Chrisian Andreu have wonderful chemistry together, especially on the heavier tunes. \u201cWisdom Comes\u201d is especially noteworthy, as the duo perform dual tremolo-picked harmonies to create a sinister vibe that compliments the intense riffs nicely. Mario and bassist Jean-Michel Labadie are also perfectly locked-in on The Link, providing just the right balance of groove and technicality for those heavy songs while showing incredible restraint on the softer ones. In a 2005 interview with Hard \u2018n\u2019 Heavy Magazine, Mario said the sessions for the album represented \u201ca period during which I wanted to play fast: I was starting to master well the grind parts and the double bass pedal\u201d. This is definitely evident in fast cuts such as \u201cRemembrance\u201d and \u201cWisdom Comes\u201d, which feature the most impressive double bass work and rapid-fire blastbeats that he\u2019d ever played up to this point; the fact that the rest of the band could keep up and hold their own so well against his drumming is pretty damn impressive.\n\nAdmittedly, I\u2019m quite tired of The Link being considered the red-headed stepchild of Gojira\u2019s catalogue (well, according to the fanbase, it\u2019s either this or Magma). It has a plethora of fantastic songs, a unique atmosphere, the most experimental writing of the band\u2019s career, and some of their most technical and intricate playing to top it off. It set the stage perfectly for Gojira\u2019s heyday, and it remains an incredible record in its own right.\n",
        "\n\u201c The health of ecosystems on which we and all other species depend is deteriorating more rapidly than ever. We are eroding the very foundations of our economies, livelihoods, food security, health and quality of life worldwide. \u201d * \n\nThere are few bands in recent decades that have flown the flag for environmental awareness as the French Gojira. Ecological consciousness coupled with spiritual themes surrounding life and death has been the conceptual core through which all their music orbits. This narrative, portraying the symbiotic link between ecosystem and man, besides mirroring the band's environmental values also expresses a growing worldwide interest in sustainability and social responsibility. I'm not a fundamentalist, at least not to the point of wearing a Greta Thunberg t-shirt or blaming capitalism as the source of all evil, however, I do realize that we, as a species, have been overstepping too many red lines that may jeopardize future generations. In this sense, Gojira's message has a contemporary relevance like few others.\n\nThe most important aspect to highlight of the band's twenty-five-year career (first five of which as Godzilla), besides their stylistic evolution, is the fact that the French eco-squad never changed its line-up, something increasingly rare in the rock business. So, it is important to look at Gojira as a genuine band and not as an occasional collective. The Duplantier brothers, Jean-Michel Labadie and Christian Andreu are thus one of today's most solid metal quartets and proof that a common goal can last a quarter of a century.\n\nGojira's creative journey, as one might expect, has undergone stylistic mutations over the years, the most relevant being its gradual detachment from classic death metal signatures reminiscent of bands like Morbid Angel. Truth be told, Gojira has never been monochromatic, assuming a hybrid personality from the start, yet the deep gutturals and Azagthoth-ish riffs progressively faded in favor of a more mainstream approach with special focus on the groove. Despite these mutations, the \u201890s have always been present in the band's music, either through Sepultura influences or via the subtle nu metal layer that has invariably enveloped them. In a way, Gojira never left the nineties, they just shaped it to their own will.\n\nThis connection to the nineties not only resurfaces in Fortitude but is also one of its main creative sources, even if it goes almost unnoticed amidst the band's trademark sound. The unintentional tribute to Sepultura in 'Amazonia' or the nu metal textures on 'New Found\u2019 and 'Grind' are all examples of this \u201890s flavor. The former, besides the Sepultura-esque berimbau, also has a chorus orbiting a riff that could have been featured on Rage Against the Machine's self-titled debut album. It seems clear that the band wanted to renew their sound by looking back to the past, namely to some of their more mainstream references. The gothic-ish verse of 'The Trails' or the super catchy chorus of 'Into the Storm' are both nuances that lend Fortitude a more accessible and commercial look and feel. Make no mistake, this is the band's most mainstream album to date. Whereas Magma carried a denser aura, related to the death of Duplantier brothers' mother, Gojira's seventh release emanates a more positive and joyful vibe, almost like a cry of hope. The unexpected choruses of 'Hold On' and 'New Found', the former reminiscent of classic heavy metal, the latter recalling '80s Genesis, both epitomize this lighter, more encompassing feeling.\n\nThe easy listening approach surrounding Fortitude may not thrill hardcore fans eager for a new space trip to Sirius or L'enfant sauvage 2.0, but it should be seen as yet another cycle for the band at a stage in their career where they would have nothing to lose by playing it safe. Granted, the album is not without its generic chunks and surely has its weak links such as 'Sphinx' or 'Grind', which sounds like a forced frenzy at times, however, its highlights do not put the band's legacy to shame, on the contrary, they enrich it. 'Amazonia', 'Another World', 'Hold On' and 'Into the Storm' will certainly be among my favorite tracks of the year, with the former being Fortitude\u2019s most emblematic moment along with the title track and 'The Chant'. These two interlinked songs, which explore tribal chanting, emphasize the concept surrounding the resilience of nature and its indigenous people, thus giving voice to the album's key message.\n\nAfter a quarter of a century, eco-squad Gojira keeps fighting for a world more in touch with its natural roots. And even though their journey has now taken them into more mainstream territories, the message remains as relevant and unsettling as ever. Fortitude may not have the charisma and power of previous releases, nor does it have the ability to take us to Sirius, yet its joyful, all-encompassing spirit unveils a new creative cycle that deserves our full attention.\n\n* Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES).\n\nOriginally written for www.sputnikmusic.com\n",
        "\nBefore I start I have to make a couple of things clear, the first thing is that I don't know if this album is a total live improvisation or if it was previously written. Secondly, I have listened to this work independently and also with the movie in the background (I don't think it goes without saying that it is much better this way, but in the review I will focus only on the music).\n\nI consider important to know if it is an improvisation or not, because if it is I can say without problem that the musicians of Gojira have managed to impress me with their ability to interpret the late motivs from which it draws much of the total composition, the division of songs is much better in the film where each one refers to one or another scene, but that matters little in this review. The point I want to get to is that these Frenchmen have shown me more talent and skills in an ep almost entirely instrumental (even if they had the reinforcement of a movie to facilitate the writing of the songs) than in their insufferable debut album. All the members have some moments where they can show off, even the brief vocal interventions work adequately in the musical universe they create. And even the groovier moments become more dynamic and fit naturally with the sound they are trying to transmit. I don't know if it's that I'm getting used to this more \"technical+groove\" style but I find it much more accessible in this work, unlike the debut, I have no problem to listen to it again from time to time.\n\nI don't really have big problems with this work, even so it simply gets repetitive, I would even dare to say that it's not very charismatic and not memorable at all, that's the big problem of it being a live improvisation, it lacks dynamism and creativity, once you have listened to \"Maciste 1\" you already know what kind of music you will find for the remaining 50 minutes. We could say that its properties at the same time can turn into shortcomings, because really this piece of music does not give much more to talk about it, especially if you do not know the history of Gojira as I do (the biggest fans of Gojira will also find curiosities in the album, apparently the songs \"Maciste 8\" and \"Maciste 13\" would be later songs).\n\nMaybe it was the low expectations but I really enjoyed every listen of this work, even so I can't help but feel that the final result is somewhat simplistic but I don't regret having chosen it to make my discographical tour of the band.\n",
        "\nI've heard of Gojira on multiple occasions, but curiously our paths have never crossed, so, I decided to stop waiting for coincidences and embark on my own towards the discography of one of the best known bands of modern European metal.\n\nAnd our first meeting was... Disappointing.\n\nNormally when I decide to do a review I usually listen to the album a good number of times, that helps me to familiarize myself with the songs, it allows me to hear details that may go unnoticed in the first listens and reflect more deeply on them, Gojira's \"Terra Incognita\" has caused me not to want to listen to it again, this for myself has already been a proof that a second listen will only worsen my perception of it, since, I will do it in a bad mood. Still, I made the effort to give it at least two listens and once I think I have the album well assimilated I went inside to tear it apart.\n\nFirst, I think this album easily contains almost all the elements I hate from the metal world, at times Gojira try to be as \"groove\" as possible, as if it was pure Pantera worship, what it seems is that they didn't understand the work of Pantera, a riff no matter how heavy it sounds if it's not a good riff is worthless and on Terra Incognita you'll get tired of listening to weak riffs that have nothing memorable about them. Besides the poverty in the riffs and the crude attempt to sound heavy, I also consider it is an insult how they try to make believe they are playing complex compositions, we get it, you like \"Obscura\", but your songs are boring and a false perception of the complexity based on playing interlocking rhythms doesn`t make your songs better, if anything, it makes them more pretentious when they don't have the level to be.\n\nAnd yes, that's the last element I hate about this album, that despite being a minor work that doesn't achieve more than being a tribute to bands that did well what these French try to imitate, is that it's pretentious, with those instrumentals that go nowhere and that superficial and long ending, the album could have ended on track 12 \"Love\" but of course they needed to end with a very long song that has nothing special or memorable, and that even more is preceded by equally boring previous instrumental that fails miserably to be atmospheric because by the time this comes I have my brain fried from so many failed attempts of previous \"groove\". The album doesn\u00b4t need those last segments, but of course they are acting like \"Hey we are Gojira and besides being heavy and technical we are also progressive and atmospheric. We have it all, how cool are we\"? No, you are boring, pretentious and untalented. It's been such a long time since an album made me so angry, it's my fault for forcing myself to look for something positive and listen to the album on numerous occasions when I should have written these very words once i finished it for first time.\n\nMy journey through Gojira's discography will continue soon, surely the next of them will please me more since the expectations are low, besides my next stop will not be \"The Link\" but \"Maciste all Inferno\" which called my attention.\n\nI give it 7/100 because among all the garbage on the album I consider the song \"Blow Me Away You(niverse)\" to be decent, but I don't even see it as a song through which I can create a path that leads to a better musical outcome, it's like a song that could be played on the local hard rock station and I'd find it passable.\n\nI hope I don't regret starting this journey because a part of me is already doing it.\n",
        "\nFrom Mars To Sirius, as you may know, is the 3rd full-length release by French metal giants Gojira, and the one that catapulted them to the forefront of modern metal music, thanks to its unique sound and style, both of which to this day haven\u2019t been emulated by many, if any other bands.\n\nAlbum opener \"Ocean Planet\" starts off things in a somewhat calm manner during the first half of the track, where the heavy riffing is broken up by a more melodic passage, while the second leg kicks things up a notch with some heavy breakdowns, which help with maintaining the listener's attention, and enhance the somewhat melancholic mood of the song.\n\nThe following tracks, \"Backbone\" and \"From The Sky\", are 2 tracks that showcase Gojira's tendency to mix things up and not just groove with no end in sight. The former is one of the more aggressive tracks on the album, barely letting up throughout its entire duration, with some fast tremolo picking breaking up the grooving and chugging, along with a very nice buildup to a breakdown around the 3:26 mark. \"From The Sky\" on the other hand, while starting off with a very fast blast beat is a much more melodic affair, and makes use of pick scraping on its verse riff, along with some great double bass from Mario Duplantier, who plays some very interesting patterns between all the blast beats and breakdowns, and is without a doubt one of the album's highlights.\n\nThe album's midsection is home to some of the best songs the band has ever written, \"The Heaviest Matter of the Universe\" and \"Flying Whales\". Both tracks contrast well with each other, not only through their duration, with \"Matter\" being one of the shortest songs on the LP (discounting the interlude that is \"Unicorn\" and \"From Mars\", which I'll get to later), but also through their pacing, with the former of the two being much faster in pace and maintaining a sense of urgency during its runtime. \"Flying Whales\" on the other hand is nearly twice as long, and progressively builds up throughout its almost 8 minute runtime, with the first 2 and a half minutes of acoustic buildup that lead into the massive riff that the band hits us with, making for the greatest moment in their discography. From that point the song ebbs and flows until the end, where Joe's voice soars over the band exploding for the finale. In all honesty, I cannot imagine them ever writing a better song than this.\n\nThe album is then bookended by the couple of \"From Mars/To Sirius\"(FM/TS) (can't figure out for the life of me why they decided to have them be separate tracks) and \"Global Warming\". The first segment of FM/TS is a relaxed acoustic segment with Joe whispering and crooning over it, which then plays into \"From Sirius\", which is much heavier, with fast double bass underpinning some grooving riffs during the verses, a rather odd riff which appears around 0:40, and a nice stop-start section at 3:00, with the track fading away from 4:25 onward, setting the stage for the album's end. The final track is much more solemn in tone than the rest of the album, which can be felt through the main riff and the vocals, which for the most part are clean singing, rather than the usual throaty yell used through most of the tracks, which is mostly used to punctuate the end of each verse and lead into the more aggressive sections between verses. Another notable moment in the song is how the bass seems to be \"singing\" the final bars of the track right before Joe starts singing them, which wraps the whole experience up perfectly.\n\nThe vocals are a great positive on this album, since Joe Duplantier exhibits great variety on all the tracks here, from his usual throaty yell to his clean singing (From Mars, Global Warming), a mid-to-low range growl which he uses on some occasions, but his best moments are whenever his voice soars over the instrumentation, which is used on a lot of tracks, but not to the point where it feels like a crutch (From The Sky, Flying Whales).\n\nLyrically we have a concept album that on a surface level is about having an out of body experience and observing a planet being destroyed and reborn, but there are also some environmental undertones (if the title of the final song wasn't enough of a giveaway) and some of the lyrics can also be interpreted as someone's struggle with mental health, which can be seen on tracks such as \"Ocean Planet\" and \"Flying Whales\", which can be interpreted as allegories for depression.\n\nThe album as a whole doesn't have too many drawbacks, barring the fact that some songs like \"Where Dragons Dwell\" and \"In The Wilderness\" tend to drag on a little and would've been better off if they had a minute or so trimmed from their runtime. Another potential negative for some people might be the fact that the band tends to groove at a medium speed for the most part and doesn't play leads of any kind, although I think that the quality of said riffs and how they blend in with the drumming more than makes up for those two points.\n\nThe production is another point that might turn some people off the album because, while the instruments and vocals are nicely mixed and not struggling to be heard, barring the bass getting somewhat buried on occasion, it has a rather \"industrial\" sound to it, with the guitars specifically sounding like heavy machinery in terms of tone and weight, which might prove to be grating after a while for some people.\n\nFrom Mars To Sirius is the result of a band that strove for greatness, and put together an album which, despite how divisive it might've been among metal music fans, has cemented itself as one of the most important albums of the century so far. As a result, I feel inclined to recommend it to every metal fan who has yet to listen to it.\n\nHighlights: From The Sky, The Heaviest Matter of the Universe, Flying Whales, Global Warming\n",
        "\nOver 50.000 square kilometers of rainforest are lost every year. There is an island of 87.000 tons of plastic trash in the pacific. Many animal species have been exterminated or driven to the brink of extinction by humanity. And while half of earth\u2019s habitable land is used for food production, a third of all food worldwide is wasted. But these are all things we know. Numbers and facts contextualize the impact we have on our planet, but they lack an emotional component.\n\nEmotionally charging a topic is not something that is limited to art, but art is one of the best suited mediums for the process. And as the awareness for our impact on the environment has risen, more artists express ecological views in their work. As a counterculture, metal critical of society is as old as the genre itself. For decades, bands have put the focus on nature and environmental themes. Take for example the forest romanticism of second wave black metal or, more recently, green metal bands like Botanist.\n\nIn the 2000s, french Gojira began making their way towards becoming one of the most successful proponents of spiritual and environmental metal. And the album that elevated them to the rank of legends was the monumental From Mars to Sirius. Since their arthouse beginnings with Terra Incognita, the band had their sight turned inward, to the human spirit and our place in nature.\n\nThough their lyrical content was consistent, Gojira reinvented their sound on From Mars to Sirius. While previous albums were more experimental in some places and more Morbid Angel in others, From Mars to Sirius laid down the band\u2019s definitive sound. Along with the production quality of their music, Gojira perfected their style of huge, rhythmic, and passionate progressive metal.\n\nConceptually, From Mars to Sirius is a story of death and rebirth, war and peace. In an interview with Spirit of Metal, Joe Duplantier explains that Mars and Sirius are symbolic of war and peace. Over the course of the album, the protagonist overcomes their inner war. With the guidance of extraterrestial beings, they learn to restore peace on earth.\n\nMusically, From Mars to Sirius poses the question of where to even begin. Tracks like the invigorating Backbone and the definitive Heaviest Matter of the Universe invite to pump your fists and bang your head. Emotionally deep cuts like Where Dragons Dwell and Global Warming place the message of the album front and center. Unicorn and From Mars present softer tones and the band\u2019s willingness to experiment present on all of their albums. There is no filler or dull moments. Every song matters and every note has its place.\n\nFurther, both the mix and production are an integral part of the album\u2019s appeal. In combination with the performances, the monolithic sound of the album comes to life. Thundering drums, massive guitars and a mix that is just compact but spacious enough to convey both intensity and vastness. The work done on this album by Studio des Milans is nothing short of masterclass.\n\nAnd more than just the sound Gojira create, it is evident how invested they are in their cause. They are passionate in their appeal to both our consciousness and our spirit. The ways of humanity are frustrating. We short-sightedly destroy both ourselves and our home. In spite of that, the message of From Mars to Sirius is heartfelt and hopeful. There is a conviction that we can change and move towards a brighter future, echoed in the mantra of album closer Global Warming: We will see our children growing.\n",
        "\nThis song is almost flawless. I listened to it the day it came out, and I immediately fell in love with it. The main riff captures so much emotion as well as groove. The riff is melancholy, yet omnipotent, saddening yet empowering. This is one of the best possible choices that Gojira could've made, at a time in their career in which they face a very perilous ultimatum of whether they should continue the questionable style of Magma, or go back to their roots with some brutal and progressive music, the characteristics that made this band so unique in the early 2000's. This song chose the latter, and my God did they manage to pull it off.\n\nThe lyrics are about a group of men travelling in search of another world to escape from the state of disrepair and anarchy on Earth (I feel like this story may have been influenced by current real-life events). Whilst the actual song structure is slightly repetitive, the song is gonorrhoea-catchy and I honestly don't want it to end when I put it on. When the chorus kicks in along with the main riff, it gets me every time.\n\nJoe's vocals here are some of his best ever, as his hypnotising voice sings over the chorus in a haunting harmony. He delivers the lyrics really well, which actually fit amazingly with the main riff too, the syncopation really is top-notch. The bass tone is also great, it has the usual crunchy-punchy delivery that's found on most of Gojira's discography, and the drums are epic too. In the middle section, Mario plays some interesting fills that keep you captivated in the music. Overall, with these sonorities in place, layered over each other so well, this just has to be one of the strongest Gojira songs in a long time.\n\nTo conclude, GO AND CHECK OUT THIS SONG ALREADY!!! It isn't Gojira at their best, and it certainly isn't Gojira at their heaviest, but it undeniably is a great song.\n",
        "\n(Total rewrite, original shitty version posted on February 11th, 2008)\n\nGojira is one of the most random heavy bands to completely catch fire and take off in the mainstream metal press. On one hand I kinda get it since they sound like a conglomeration of three other huge bands in that same sphere, sounding like a mix between a slow Meshuggah, prog-era Mastodon, and Devin Townsend's heavier solo works like Terria. The problem for me is that they sound like a worse version of all three of those bands, since Meshuggah works best when they kick the tempo up, Mastodon was infinitely superior as a kinda-sludgy outfit with a fuckload of hooks, and Devin is at his best when he's leaning fully into chaotic metal or calming ambient/prog while his more blended work tends to be hit or miss. Gojira is the perfect trifecta in that regard, created in a lab to appeal to bearded metal journalists in coffee shops while maintaining an undeniable weight to their riffs.\n\nThe problem is that these riffs suck. At least on From Mars to Sirius (admittedly I haven't bothered listening to their more recent albums simply because this one is such a turnoff) they tend to stick to simplistic chugs and squealy harmonics and not much else. They tend to shy away from cliche power chords I suppose but they replace them almost exclusively with dissonant clangs and drawn out ringing chords that I think are supposed to sound ethereal but ultimately just sound confused. This hyper specific \"dumb guy gets a smart job\" style of riff writing winds up turning every song into a midpaced slog that feels like it never ends, which is only exacerbated by the hour long runtime. I don't want to harp on them too hard simply for their music not being particularly complex but holy shit really pay attention to \"Ocean Planet\". It's like five and a half minutes long and features a whopping three riffs, two of which are more or less purely made up of unchanging quarter note chugs. The closest thing to a hook they have is the verse riff, which repeats so many times that my eyes seriously glazed over when I tried giving it my full attention. That pinch harmonic gets repeated thirty fucking times throughout the song, which doesn't sound like a big deal since who cares it's only one note, but trust me when I say it's the central feature of the song, the only thing that gives it some sort of identity, and it's just one fucking squealy bend that sits in the middle of the same riff in the same place with the same lead in palm mutes every fucking time. It is absolutely agonizing. Also keep your ears open for that pick scrape/rake thing they do in this song. It shows up in like six other tracks and just sounds like when you mess up in Guitar Hero. Maybe it feels unfair to rag on a band for reusing techniques throughout an album, especially since metal as a whole is so heavily dominated by bands that never graduated beyond palm mutes and power chords, but at least those cliche bands are playing different notes with those basic techniques. This is more akin to putting the \"Master of Puppets\" riff in every single song. Not as a leitmotif, but because the song needs a thrash riff at that particular point and it happens to be the only one you know.\n\nThe rest of the album really doesn't fare much better. Their only saving grace is the absolutely undeniable heaviness they carry. \"From the Sky\" switches things up by focusing on a tremolo riff instead of a chug, and it's ultimately just as boring as the rest of the album but I'd be lying if I said it didn't feel like getting brained with a bag of hammers. \"Flying Whales\" seems to be the most iconic song on the album, and honestly I think that's pretty well deserved since it's the only one that moves forward in any capacity and switches things up as it goes, deftly weaving between Leviathan era Mastodon and soaring Townsend splendor. It's the only song that justifies its runtime and winds up being pretty good in spite of itself. That smothering weight can't save the rest of the album though, and it winds up being a brief respite in the middle of the album that showcases the correct way to make all of these elements work. Everything else is just neverending chugs and drums that somehow follow the guitars almost perfectly. I don't think it's exactly fair to blame an album simply for not being something, but the fact that this is seen as an important album in modern prog metal is absolutely baffling to me because these riffs are as simple as fucking Pantera. You can't fool me by making the actual chords jangly when the meat of what you're doing is just \"5 Minutes Alone\" but lamer. The only other exception is the closer, \"Global Warming\", but I'm not even kidding when I say it has the exact same tapping melody playing over the top for a solid seven and a half minutes without breaking. Come on guys even when you do something different you do it for way too fucking long.\n\nI don't even want to talk about this anymore. From Mars to Sirius is just boring as fuck and that's about all there is to say about it. It slogs on and on through the same handful of tricks for a torturous amount of time and genuinely gives me a headache to listen to. I can dig simple shit, I think Amon Amarth used to be absolute titans when it came to making the most basic beginner level riffs sound like the coolest shit in the world, but Gojira absolutely misses the mark.\n\n\nOriginally written for Lair of the Bastard\n",
        "\nDamn, guys. Just damn. I think you just broke my heart here.\n\nGojira has been a rising star in the metal world for quite some time, primarily due to their boundary-pushing approach to death metal in the century's early years and then their developments to groove metal and progressive metal on releases like \"The Way of All Flesh\" and \"L'Enfant Sauvage\". Although these records certainly weren't super \"brutal\", they still had a certain exciting death-metal-bite to them, which made them mosh-friendly, heavy and interesting. If you look for something that's even remotely comparable to what Gojira once stood for, don't bother with this record. You won't find it here.\n\nFirst off, let's start with the riffs, or with what little you find of those. There are exactly three riffs on this entire album that stuck with me for more than ten minutes, those being the main riff of Silvera (although the lead in the chorus is also rather catchy), the main riff of Only Pain and the short riff in the chorus-like middle of Magma. Apart from that it's all monotonous tremolos, vapid chugging and throw-away filler, sometimes carrying on for way, WAY too long. The bass also just trots along with the guitars for 90% of the album, which as this point shouldn't come as a surprise to anyone anymore.\n\nJoe's vocals also took an apparent nosedive compared to their previous record and lost a lot of punch, which really is a shame, as I always considered him to be one of if not the best vocalist in this whole \"groovy-progressive-technical\" movement of metal that's going on right now. His signature pitched-scream is still there for the most part, but juxtaposed to these rather uninspired clean vocals, which sometimes don't seem to harmonise cleanly with the underlying guitar work.\n\nMario Duplantier is still an absolute menace though, and the only member to seem like he actually gave a fuck about the end product. There are a lot of odd time signatures and poly-rhythms on display here, which might entertain you for a little while if you're a die-hard drumming nerd, but since they are opposed to these vacant guitar lines and arranged monotonously, you're probably going to have forgotten about them once the next song starts. They also seem to be more thinly produced and lack a lot of attack in comparison to their previous releases, which can be said about the production in general though,\n\nThe most adept way to describe this album though is \"boring\". Metal, no matter what subgenre we are talking about, should always contain a certain level of aggression, of anger, of sadness, of frustration, of fucking emotion, things that are nowhere to be found on this record, at least in no way, shape or form that seems genuine, sincere and authentic, which is only exacerbated by the amount of repetition this album features.\n\nSkip this. Please.\n\nFavorite tracks: Silvera, Only Pain\nLeast favorite tracks: Pray, The Shooting Star\n",
        "\nBack at a time when a monster called Gojira was rapidly taking over the world, shortly before a disappointing trend that began with L'Enfant Sauvage and continued with 2016's Magma, a little release named Of Blood and Salt surfaced. Insignificant as it may seem, this 2011 single should probably have been a much larger piece in Gojira's calculated bid to make a name for themselves as metal statesmen, since it not only marked a continuation of their environmentally themed progressive groove/death metal but also featured guests from Strapping Young Lad and Meshuggah, who have often been the closest influences this French four-piece can claim. The real \"what if\", however, comes with knowing that 'Of Blood and Salt' was the only song released from a planned EP to be called Sea Shepherd that was lost when the files were erased in a computer-related incident. Had Gojira actually produced the EP (mooted to be bolstered by the likes of Max Cavalera, Anders Friden, and Randy Blythe), they would probably have entered the recent decade towering with confidence and with an even higher profile.\n\nInstead, we got 'Of Blood and Salt' a couple of years late, limping out two and a half years after The Way of All Flesh. It's not a bad song, made slightly more remarkable by the guest appearances, yet alone doesn't achieve what the band set out to do. Uncharacteristically for Gojira, the six and a half minute cut spends most of its time at lumbering slow pace, powered along by Devin Townsend's vocals near the beginning and a characteristically crushing riff towards the end. Certain of the ideas sound like leftovers of the From Mars to Sirius sessions, and the way the song climaxes reminds me specifically of 'From the Sky' to the point where the best riff is like a brother of the slower section of that song. Initially, the chord patterns provide a different angle to Gojira's sonic attack, while Townsend's drawn-out cries sound slightly similar to those of Joe Duplantier, yet obviously recognizable. When Fredrik Thordendal drops a whirlwind jazzy solo after Duplantier's first verse and a longer effort after the second, the Meshuggah guitarist is impossible to miss, fitting in easily with a band that has never used guitar leads in their own work.\n\nAs a single, it's easy to disregard Of Blood and Salt, while wishing for the full result of Sea Shepherd is the expected result of this audio titbit. Rumour is that the band may still release it, though most of us have given up hope. On the other hand, Randy Blythe had already guested on 'Adoration for None' a couple of years before and Gojira claim that the publicity generated during the recording of the EP benefitted the charity (Sea Shepherd's goal is to conserve marine wildlife, particularly whales) almost as much as releasing it. Musically, however, it's hard to feel satisfied with one intriguing but modestly successful song.\n",
        "\nGojira is often hailed as one of the giants of modern metal, and rightfully so. They have crafted their own unique sound through their use of odd rhythms and guitar techniques, as well as Mario\u2019s unique drumming style. From Mars to Sirius is often hailed as their magnum opus, but in my opinion, they peaked at L\u2019Enfant Sauvage.\n\nThe song compositions are generally kept short, but each and every track packs a huge punch, even the atmospheric interlude track titled \u201cThe Wild Healer\u201d. The riffs are absolutely enormous and packed full of emotion, and are very diverse. There are the emotional and atmospheric riffs on songs such as \u201cThe Axe\u201d there are the heavy hitting riffs on songs such as the title track, and some just provide just the right mood for the song such as the outro riff on \u201cMouth of Kala\u201d. \n\nThe drumming on this album is phenomenal, and combined with the rhythmically intricate riffs makes every song a total rhythmic powerhouse. Every song has creative drum fills, and crazy double bass patterns. Mario is a monster behind the kit and his technical drumming is one of the most enjoyable aspects of Gojira\u2019s music.\n\nVocally, this album is stellar, with Joe\u2019s signature half growls making up a majority of the vocals. They still carry some melody with them, which is used to great benefit and makes for several catchy vocal lines on songs such as \u201cThe Gift of Guilt\u201d. Other times, he uses his full on growl when the music is especially heavy to fit with the music, which is quite enjoyable and unique sounding compared to other harsh vocals. \n\nCompositionally, this album is genius. Gojira is often labeled progressive metal, a label I somewhat disagree with, but I understand where this label comes from, for Gojira avoids the usage of conventional song structures. Each song has several great riffs accompanied by subtle melody from the guitars as well as the vocals. Every riff and drum beat has an incredible groove to it, making Gojira one of my favorite bands rhythmically. Gojira, despite being known for heaviness, uses their softer side a lot (see \u201cBorn in the Winter\u201d and \u201cThe Wild Healer\u201d) which helps bring balance and more emotion to this album. \n\nAll and all, L\u2019Enfant Sauvage is a stroke of genius for Gojira and tops anything else currently in their discography. Not one bland moment on this record, and despite being a groove metal record, a genre I associate with blandness and tough guy attitude, this album is an incredibly emotional experience.\n\nFavorite songs: \u201cL\u2019Enfaunt Sauvage\u201d, \u201cThe Gift of Guilt\u201d, \u201cMouth of Kala\u201d, \u201cBorn in Winter\u201d, \u201cThe Axe\u201d, \u201cThe Fall\u201d, \u201cThe Wild Healer\u201d\n",
        "\nOn their sixth full-length album Magma, progressive metal band Gojira experiment with influences from further afield while processing the grief that comes with the loss of a loved one. Four years on from 2012\u2019s astonishing L\u2019Enfant Sauvage, the French quartet\u2019s blend of blisteringly heavy death metal, fascinating progressive tendencies, and subtle atmospheric flourishes has lost none of its force or vitality. \n\nWhere previous albums dealt with broad, global issues \u2013 the environment, death and mortality, as well as the alienation of mankind from nature in modern industrial society \u2013 Magma is far more personal, inspired by the recent loss of the Joe (guitar/vocals) and Mario (drums) Duplantier\u2019s mother to cancer. It\u2019s also the first album completed in the recording studio the band recently built themselves in New York City, and thus a very different recording environment for the band. Magma sees them turn their gaze inwards in processing this loss as well as the change in environment, and this process of introspection has resulted in the band\u2019s most human and emotionally powerful album yet.\n\nWhere previous albums were sprawling epics of dazzling technical brilliance, Magma sees the band exploring a more streamlined and, dare I say it, accessible sound. This album marks vocalist Joe Duplantier\u2019s first foray into incorporating clean singing as a major part of his repertoir, with some songs here consisting entirely of clean voclas, though often in addition to his trademark roar. And the songs here are, for the most part, much simpler, relying on fewer \u2013 but more distinct \u2013 motifs as defining features of each song. Lyrically and musically this album is saturated with a feeling of angst and despair, and given the background to this album\u2019s completion and the experiences of the band over the last four years it is not hard to understand its source.\n\nBut much of what listeners have come to love about Gojira remains in place here. Silvera\u2019s brutal riffage and savage roars are a kick to the teeth, while its stunning melodic tapping section serves as a perfect counterweight to the heaviness. Stranded\u2019s sharp, angular riffs and anthemic chorus is instantly infectious, while The Cell\u2019s central riff could have been written by Meshuggah themselves. The atmospheric opening track The Shooting Star\u2019s central riff is a behemoth that will immediately have your head nodding along, with Joe Duplantier\u2019s clean vocals bringing to mind some of Mastodon\u2019s more recent output.\n\nThe album\u2019s title track is perhaps the most successful example of the new influences Gojira are exploring. It contrasts heavy downtuned chugging with Duplantier\u2019s melodic croon, as well as a fantastic melodic pinch harmonic motif. The haunting choruses, aggressive vocals, brutal fretwork and anthemic chorus of Pray result in a tour de force, a standout track I find myself revisiting frequently. Only Pain is, in my estimation, one of Gojira\u2019s heaviest songs to date, musically and emotionally, touching on themes of futility and suffering. The rawness of the muscular guitar riffs, with down-tuned djent rhythmic sections, driven onwards by the merciless double-bass drumming, makes this a real highlight, and probably my favourite from the whole album.\n\nThe final \u2018real\u2019 track of the album, the deeply atmospheric Low Lands is a genuinely touching, moving song. It seems to be written directly to the Duplantier brothers\u2019 recently deceased mother Patricia Rosa, asking what she sees in the afterlife \u201cwhile you drift away from all the plagues of this world\u201d. The sincerity of this song and the glimpse it provides into the grief that led to its creation make for a gripping listen.\n\nThe album is not without its flaws, however. Though Magma technically lasts 43 minutes and has ten tracks, this disguises the fact that Yellow Stone and Liberation are instrumental pieces, and it is hard to shake the feeling that they were simply intended to pad out the track listing. Yellow Stone doesn\u2019t really go anywhere. This would be less if an issue on a longer album but with an album this brief it feels like a missed opportunity. Liberation also seems like a curious choice for an album closer, seeming to have very little in common with any of the other tracks here. But it is a very pretty piece, written for their late mother \u2013 and on that level it\u2019s a very poignant note on which to end this deeply personal album.\n\nGojira\u2019s experiment with a more streamlined and introspective sound on Magma was a risky proposition given how averse to change many metal fans are, often preferring consistency over variety. But it has certainly paid off for them. A consistently astonishing album, brimming with ambition and a real sense of urgency and sincerity, Magma cements Gojira\u2019s place among the leading metal bands of their generation.\n\nOriginally written for Metal Void.\n",
        "\nWhen we think of Gojira what comes to mind ? Of course of a technical death metal band with nice lyrics about philosophy, Universe, nature, life and death. Well, in Magma you can forget about the technical death metal part BUT it is not necessarily a bad things. \n\nFirst of all, There is two things to say before starting this review : First, if you're an elitist that only listen to metal, you will only like a few tracks on this album (if you like some) because it's not really metal anymore and second, this album was written after the death of Joe and Mario Duplantier's (singer/guitarist and drummer) mother, which explains the lyrics of some songs that are clearly talking about this case, like The Shooting Star or Stranded and Magma, the eponymous song. And Liberation, the instrumental track that finish the album, is a improvisation of the Duplantier's brothers after they learned the death of their mother.\n\nSo the album starts with The Shooting Star, and clearly announces that it won't be like the previous ones. Indeed, this song is really atmospheric, with clean vocal (and some screams here and there but only a little) and a slow riff. At first I didn't really pay attention to this one, but it really grew on me with times. On the ten tracks there's other atmospheric songs like Yellow Stone which is an instrumental with post-rock influences, Magma, Low Lands and Liberation which makes a ratio of 2/5 of atmospherics songs, almost half of the album.\n\nHowever there's also more violent songs like Silvera which is my favorite track I think, with a nice riff and lyrics (even a solo, the first of all of Gojira's discography) or Pray, Only Pain and The Cell. There's even a song like Stranded which is clearly the single of the album, with a catchy riff and a catchy chorus which is for a larger public, even if there's still screams on it.\n\nTo summarize this album, I will say that I personally didn't really like it at first, but then I listened to it some times after and it really grew on me. At first I was disappointed, like a lot of fans, because it wasn't heavy, the rhythms and melodies weren't as complicated as they were before, especially the drum that is godlike on the previous albums with Mario Duplantier, my favorite drummer of all time without a doubt, and which is here WAY MORE SIMPLER and that still broke my heart deep inside, but in the end, Gojira already showed their ability to play complicated stuff. They're simpler, but we can still ear that it's Gojira's songs and they're still quality songs. The more you listen to this album, the more you understand the charms of Gojira's refined style of music. Furthermore, if you understand the pain of losing someone dear to you, which is probably the case, you will surely be touched by the lyrics, especially The Shooting Star, Stranded and Magma.\n\nFinally, I will add that there is, in my opinion, not a single bad tracks on Magma, I love them all, especially Silvera, The Shooting Star, Pray and Magma with a mesmerizing riff, a quite planing one and original. It's a different album, there is no doubt about it, with the riffs, the simpler melodies, the cleans and there's even french lyrics on Low Lands. Some fans won't like it and it's understandable because it's clearly different with what they've done before and it's not technical as it was. However I think everyone should give a chance to this record, because when you accept the changements, you will see the quality of this album and all the works behind it and that, in fact, even in a more rock-style, Gojira still rules.\n",
        "\nWhile Magma may be Gojira's most successful release to date, even earning the French Four a Grammy, I found it to be somewhat overrated. The group had previously proven themselves to be masters of technical and even groovy metal styles on albums like The Way of All Flesh and From Mars to Sirius, they slow down somewhat on this album, detracting from the aggression they once laid claim to.\n\nWhile it does possess some cool riffs, a majority of the ones on this album are either too laid-back or are just a bunch of open-string chugs. Guitarists Joe Duplantier and Christian Andreu excessively use their DigiTech Whammy pedals on songs like \"Stranded\" and \"Only Pain.\" The drummers are cool, though, masterfully pounded with great speed and technicality by Joe's brother Mario. Joe's vocals vary, sometimes aggressive like on \"Silvera\" but sometimes mellow and gloomy, such as on \"The Shooting Star.\" The whole album has an atmosphere of tragedy, with oddly melancholic effects used on the vocals and guitars.\n\nThis album is a mixed bag. There are softer and more emotional songs, and then there are the aggressive, borderline death metal songs. Songs like \"The Shooting Star,\" \"Yellow Stone\" and \"Magma\" drone on seemingly endlessly, making the listener want to fall asleep; while headbangers like \"Silvera,\" \"Stranded,\" \"The Cell,\" and \"Only Pain\" are lacking in compositional length and, for the most part, memorability.\n\nWhile many people, particularly more casual metalheads and newer fans of Gojira, seem to love this album, it is wildly overrated and somewhat boring to listen to. Some songs are aggressive yet short, and the rest are dreary and stupidly long. I had the good luck to see Gojira perform the day I bought this CD; they did a great job, playing many songs from Magma, and even the slower songs were great for moshing. Because of this experience, my opinion of Gojira has not been permanently ruined by this mediocre album. But it is with great confidence that I say that Gojira has seen better days.\n",
        "\nI might be putting my head on the chopping block here as far as some fans are concerned, but here\u2019s the thing - I firmly believe that this is Gojira\u2019s best album, hands down. Believe me, having enjoyed all their full-length releases (with the probable exception of their recent release Magma) from time to time, I do not say this lightly. Yes, in my opinion it is even better than The Way Of All Flesh. Not to say I didn't enjoy that album, but somehow I didn\u2019t end up enjoying it as much as I thought I would, finding the whole album rather inconsistent with a few killer picks along the way. No the case with this. Every goddamn song kicks your teeth all the way in, yet mystifies you with the band's unique approach to progressive death metal. The closer \u201cGlobal Warming\u201d softly fades away bit by bit with a slow numbing melodic assault (the good kind, of course) of gentle guitar hammer-ons and pull-offs.\n\nThe opener \u201cOcean Planet\u201d pulls absolutely no punches with the sound of whales leading into a furious riff storm progression that should have you in the mosh-pit in no time at all. The subtly melodic breakdown towards the end after a furious bout of guitar chugging is quite a surprise and turnaround. Now enough has been said about Mario being a demigod on the drums and suffice to say, he delivers freaking 110%. He always was an exceptionally talented drummer, but my word if you heard The Link and From Mars To Sirius, there\u2019s no way in hell you\u2019d be able to comprehend that it\u2019s that same guy who\u2019s playing. And to achieve such a feat of kicking your talent up several notches in a mere two years! Truly exemplary, to say the least. Check out prime cuts like \u201cFrom The Sky\u201d (where Joe even showcases his unique blend of a hardcore shout and clean singing making for one hell of a contrast. Check out this song if you\u2019re yet to hear the sound of this band) and \u201cBackbone\u201d and try to keep your jaw from dropping. Not gonna happen. \u201cWorld To Come\u201d starts on quite the strange psychedelic note (honestly I can\u2019t think of any other way to describe it) with some of the most melodic riffs and progressions on the album along with Joe\u2019s embittered snarling. \n\nFor those of you still wondering about the main sound of Gojira, I would say that that the twin influence of Meshuggah and Opeth (incidentally two of my favourite bands as well) are most certainly present as far as the progressive metal influence is concerned, whereas the death and groove metal aspect of the music certainly comes from the searing brutality of bands like Strapping Young Lad and Pantera. If that combo reads as fascinatingly insane to you, then rest assured that it also sounds exactly so! You will hear the death metal influence most on songs like \u201cThe Heaviest Matter Of The Universe\u201d (my personal favourite on the album with a bone-crushingly groovy breakdown kicking in at 1:50) \u201cBackbone \u201dand \u201cWhere Dragons Fall\u201d (check out the melodic brutality oozing out from that goddamn intro. Simply masterful). If you\u2019re looking for the most progressive cuts \u201cFlying Whales\u201d (an excellent example of a slow almost post-rockish build-up to an earth-shattering verse with an amazing clean picking mid-section) and \u201cInto The Wilderness\u201d (more on the brutal side with choppy riffs and grooves aplenty) will suit you just fine.\n\nThat\u2019s the thing about Gojira. Even if it\u2019s about one goddamn riff, they make sure that it sounds planet-smashingly heavy as fuck. Their scattershot breed of riffing has been put to full potential here. Sure, there were hints of it on The Link, but on this album they seem to have truly seized that potential to the fullest effect. Combine that with Mario\u2019s drumming and you\u2019ve got a hydrogen bomb of a rhythm section right there. Small wonder that this has been called their breakthrough album. What I particularly like about this album is that the band actually put interlude tracks to good use, case in point \u201cUnicorn\u201d and \u201cFrom Mars\u201d (that leads perfectly into the pounding \u201cTo Sirius\u201d) that add to the mysterious and unique atmosphere of this album, not to mention actually progressing from the tracks they\u2019re sandwiched against. A great deal of bands and albums simply use them as a space filler, adding no real depth or musicality to the music as a whole but not these guys. \n\nLet\u2019s face it - it\u2019s certainly not everyday you stumble upon a progressive death metal album that\u2019s thoroughly brutal as fuck with a subtle atmospheric tinge every now and then. Which is exactly why this is one of the few places where the term \u201cthinking man\u2019s metal\u201d can actually be used. Bold words indeed, but once you hear the album (or if you already have), you\u2019ll surely understand what I mean. If you are yet to hear this gem, kindly remedy the situation with haste. It may take some patience and repeated listens (it is quite the long album after all, but really doesn\u2019t feel as such), but it\u2019ll be more than worth it in the end. Just trust me on that one.\n",
        "\nWhat is metal actually about? There are many answers to that questions - being heavy, creating extreme music, killing posers, dragons, or just not giving a fuck in general. And there may be some degree of truth in all of those. Personally, I believe that metal needs to maintain an element of creative aggression, or, to put it simply, \u201can edge\u201d. Even at their most commercial, metal records need to have something visceral and biting about them. \n\nAnd as you probably guessed by now, this Gojira album is certainly not about this edge. On \u201cMagma\u201d, the French squadron took their drive and bite away and replaced it with\u2026 exactly nothing. Their previous effort, \u201cL\u2019Enfant Sauvage\u201d, while flawed, broke into a punishing section every once in a while and the unsettling squealing guitars did try their best to send chills down one\u2019s spine. Here, even the heavier sections in songs like \u201cThe Cell\u201d sound quite tame. And it gets worse, because the repetition that Gojira successfully avoided thanks to their crushing power manifests itself in long, repetitive, go-nowhere sections. A band focused on rhythms and riffs so much suddenly has even less to work with. Riffs... I am forcing myself to say that word as early as during the verses of \u201cThe Shooting Star\u201d.\n\n\u201cMagma\u201d resembles Coroner\u2019s \u201cGrin\u201d in that it is a very stripped-down album. The aggression is virtually gone, but unlike \u201cGrin\u201d, there is no cold aura of sterility (and certainly no pristine guitar leads) to balance it out. It might be a result of the slightly hazy production that doesn\u2019t focus on making the instruments clear and powerful. Instead, it seems that the band tried to make the overall sound compact in favor of the greater whole. If that was the case, they failed miserably, simply because there is no atmosphere that would be highlighted by such approach. Sure, the album is definitely somber and evokes a sense of slight depression - however, any emotional moment that may have been present remains buried in the mud of the mix rather than shining through.\n\nThe mother of Mario and Joe Duplantier passed away during the making of \u201cMagma\u201d. That is indeed a tragedy. Gojira, if they were to release music (to be certainly affected by this sad event), had two ways to cope. Either they could have put together a bunch of campfire songs and make \u201cLiberation\u201d the title track. It would likely be terrible, but understandable. The other option would be to take the crushing Gojira we have grown to love and turn it into something even heavier, more tortured and ultimately purifying. Needless to say, \u201cMagma\u201d doesn't even come close. \n\nDespite having two angry young men writing the music, \u201cMagma\u201d comes across as a controlled attempt to compromise the Duplantiers\u2019 tragic story with the fact that they were on the cusp of success after releasing \u201cL\u2019Enfant Sauvage\u201d. That is its main flaw. Take the single - \u201cStranded\u201d - despite having an efficient melodic hook in the chorus, musically, there is little more than a half-baked chugging riff. The song resembles their previous works just enough and you can hear some effort, but it\u2019s also devoid of any exciting moment. This sentence can also be applied to the whole record. \n\nThe redeeming moments are few and far between. \u201cThe Cell\u201d is good - combining a busy intro part with some simple downtuned riffs and a decently catchy vocal melody. Then, there is the simple-yet-awesome main riff of the fairly intense \u201cSilvera\u201d with a respectable attempt at creating a haunting melody. They also tried in the title track, and the main, eerie melody is a very unorthodox idea that could almost build up some climactic tension, but the rest of the (almost) 7-minute track is basically just chugging. Not even the stellar drum patterns of yore are present, since this album rarely picks up pace. Mario does try to add crafty rhythms and percussions, but also suffers from the production smokescreen.\n\nThere are several other songs on the record, but after a dozen spins, they may as well not. Nothing really sticks out as memorable or inspired - simple riffs repeated ad nauseam or monotonous vocals that could only work if they were fueled by anger, sorrow, or any real, piercing emotion. That, for me, is the cardinal sin that Gojira committed - they possessed the ability to write good songs they could put their hearts and souls into, but decided to do neither. The only thing they really accomplished is making that grey cover fitting.\n\nAs the acclaim this record receives grows bigger, this absolute lack of anything stimulating becomes more and more aggravating. There is so little to listen to, and hence little reason to even listen to \u201cMagma\u201d, let alone choose it over any of their previous efforts. This record doesn\u2019t really bring anything valuable in terms of musical progression, but only dumbs down Gojira\u2019s trademark technique and towering heaviness. Presumably, this compromise was done in a vain attempt to make \u201cMagma\u201d homogeneous and palatable, rather than repetitive and bland. Not mentioning completely edge-less.\n",
        "\nIf anyone could have anticipated Gojira's third full-length, they would probably have made a healthy sum at the bookmaker's and then bought themselves a whole load of Gojira concert tickets as a reward. When From Mars to Sirius crashed down onto stereos in 2005 it was with all the impact of the flying whale on the cover. In a similar story to Mastodon a year or two earlier, the critics fairly lapped it up, new fans started appearing from all over the place, and a bunch of French longhairs suddenly became the plat du jour. Quite how they transformed from The Link to the finished product in two years is quite beyond me, but this album was a great showcase for a new kind of metal that surprised a lot of people at the time and has influenced plenty of bands since.\n\nPinning down Gojira's sound is difficult, not least because this is the only album that equally combines those three elements that make up the key ingredients of their music - death, groove, and prog metal. Naturally, it seems like a strange mix at first, but if one can imagine '00s Meshuggah attacking '90s Opeth and somehow making the resulting brawl cinematic and memorable, that would be close. The brunt of death metal guitars and Joe Duplantier's howling vocals form the driving force of many of the songs, while the band are just as happy to break into a tidal wave of surging groove or a spaz of time signatures and shards of guitar noise, including that now famous \"whale cry\" from 'Ocean Planet' and several other songs. There aren't any guttural vocals, there aren't consistent blastbeats, and there aren't any guitar solos, although there are lots of riffs and a few melodies, so true death metal fans might feel rather confused, yet the formula still sounds fresh in 2016 and the mixed traits provide enough variety for a fairly long album. The band would later shift their sound around, but that trinity of styles is the basis for most of the music on From Mars to Sirius, with the exception of 'World to Come' and the calmer interludes.\n\nMaybe it's the fact that Gojira came from Bayonne in France (e.g. nowhere in metal terms), but almost all the songs seem genuinely innovative and are covered by barely a shadow from other bands. One could point fingers at Amon Amarth for some of the fat rolling tremolos or at Meshuggah for the disjointed stabs of guitar and juddering drums or even at Strapping Young Lad for the way some of the riffs take off with searing, sandblasted vocals behind them, but these songs constantly change from point to point and avoid specific association with any of those bands, though work as a single unit. The shallow rock pool that is 'From Mars' erupts into the spray and crashing percussion of 'To Sirius' near the end of the album and those two songs (or, more accurately, the title track and its intro) just about hit every corner of heavy music in eight minutes and the whole experience is one of constant progress. The tranquility of the first piece is also a perfect match for its reflective lyrics, while 'To Sirius' explodes with its own scorn and also possesses an appropriate balance considering the themes within. That kind of progress and apposite synthesis of musical and lyrical content is what pushes the album towards progressive metal, since Gojira rarely write choruses, preferring to use the catchier riffs as repeating parts; thus, nothing is too simple even though there are still hooks.\n\nThe songs cover a rather large area of different metal disciplines, but I will spare myself the trouble of enumerating everything in detail. According to popular opinion, 'Ocean Planet' is the real killer here and - while it does seem to encapsulate the album - I can't agree that its lurching heaviness is a match for the comet-trail momentum of 'To Sirius', the enormous grooves of 'Flying Whales', or the majestic climax of 'From the Sky'. Perhaps 'Ocean Planet' does a good job of showing what a hero Mario Duplantier is on the drumkit, yet 'Backbone' is unquestionably the song to go to for pure heaviness and skill, the middle section pissing on almost any death metal band that has walked the earth. 'Where Dragons Dwell' takes a slower and less direct route to heaviness, while 'World to Come' dispenses with most of the metal traits for a lope through clanging semi-clean melodies in a manner that reminds one of southern rock until the conclusion gets doomy and prophetic. The closer 'Global Warning' is also a variation from the noise of the other songs, winding hammer-on melodies propping up Joe Duplantier's clean vocals as he melds himself into the fate of the world, eventually settling for a message of caution and hope.\n\nWhat made From Mars to Sirius such a revelation in 2005 still endears it to metal fans over a decade later and ensures its place as a pivotal release in the 21st century development of the genre. The freshness of many of the ideas and the integration of disparate elements into a united whole remains its greatest feature, while the evident skill and passion of the musicians is met by their wise restraint and organic structuring. Minor problems occur with the lack of a lead instrument and relatively few hooks, both of which become slightly more serious in view of the running time that - at 67 minutes - would seem to be excessive and detrimental to the overall effect of the songs. However, this is a must listen for any fan of modern metal and a diverting album from start to finish.\n",
        "\nThis album could not have been released at a better time honestly. I have heard their entire discography up to this point, and discovered L'Enfant Sauvage about a month before this album was set to be released. Also, it was released the day of my final math test, so I got to celebrate afterwards by going out and getting it in store. Great day.\n\nStylistically, this band has been shifting away from using lots of double bass and blast beats, so some fans aren't taking well to it. This release definitely creates an even larger gap between itself and L'ES, but it does so without compromising too much. This album is probably the most ambient of them all. The vocals are drenched in reverb for almost every song and wherever there are guitar overdubs, those are drenched in reverb as well. Joe Duplantier's typical clean vocals have changed alot in the past 4 years, sounding more raspy and lower pitched. However, he's changed his technique, completely altering his sound. For the better or worse? I kinda think for the better. You can't sound the same at age 40 like you did at 20. \n\nThe production on this album is absolutely stellar. Arguably the best of them all. The Link was too cold sounding, From Mars To Sirius was too muddy, L'ES was rather over compressed and the drum sound was very synthetic and robotic. (Not Mario's usual robotic vibe when doing double bass runs or blast beats.) Here, every element of the music sounds more natural and earth-borne. The drums are compressed perfectly, and don't stamp out any important playing dynamics. One might even go as far as to say that this is THE model sound for bass drums in metal music in general. At the beginning of \"Stranded\", listen to the drums on the off beats of the guitar, and youll hear lots of very low bass flowing underneath the whole mix. Now listen to any of the louder more ambient songs, and you can hear the treble end of the bass drum. Always there, but out of everything else's way. Where it should be. The guitars on all of Gojira's albums tend not to change much, so that's to be expected. Less and less fizzy with each album as they're refining their sound.\n\nOverall, I think Gojira has done a great job being able to make an album that features less of their coveted technicality, but more ambience and emotion. (Joe and Mario's mother died during the making of the album, so the emotion aspect is far more driven this time around) Now they can say they've made an album that could be compared to their other albums as being more ambient. Every band with a balanced discography has to have an ambient album.\n\nFavorites on the album:\n\nSilvera\nStranded\nMagma\nLowlands\n",
        "\nGojira remain crushingly heavier than the vast majority of \"commercial\" metal bands today. That said, Magma lends the impression they've come closer to quiet introspection than ever before. With that, I get the mixed reaction from fans. For whatever reason, I'm reminded of the way The Mars Volta reinvented themselves in 2009 with Octahedron; they're simply taking their essential style down a more subdued path than we're used to hearing from them.\n\nThis has been the most interesting time to talk about Gojira at least since the release of The Way of All Flesh in 2008. They had fallen off my personal radar for a few years, and I haven't been enamoured as much with From Mars to Sirius and The Way of All Flesh since around the time the two came out. A polarized reception like Magma's, if anything, seemed like a sign that Gojira might be reinventing themselves in a way that could make them exciting again. A more melodic, atmospheric and airy album could not possibly have been popular with their fanbase, but that's not to say they don't do it really well.\n\nOf any of Gojira's albums, this is definitely the biggest grower-type they've yet released. Because it's not as intensely heavy and urgent as the others, the layers take more time to grow. Considering I've always considered that their sheer heaviness was one of Gojira's best, it really is refreshing to hear them without those extremes. From this, their other defining traits come through more clearly. Their massive-sounding atmosphere still makes it sound like they're recording in an underwater cavern, the progressive grooves are extremely hooky, and the melodic accents carry their weight several times over. Gojira have effectively channelled the same urgency in tighter confines. The writing isn't quite as consistent as it could have been, but there's more than enough solid material here to suggest their change of pace was a good idea.\n\nThe mellower (at least relative to past work) approach works well for Gojira's subject this time around. Although their music's almost always related to their personal convictions, Magma draws the music even closer to home. The Duplantier brothers' loss of their mother affected and moved them a ton; it would be more surprising if their next album hadn't been inspired at least in part by that experience. From this, Gojira's most powerful lyrics have inevitably stemmed; even if their clean vocals aren't quite strong enough to deserve such a prominent role on the album, the words and lyrics are powerful enough to sell it through. Even if Magma was inspired by a real-life loss, they still manage to touch upon grander ideas: the afterlife, the loss of love, and the will to carry on in spite of pain. They're not the sort of lyrics you can fully appreciate on paper alone; the music's celestial atmosphere is what gives the words their spiritual weight.\n\nThere are a few fantastic songs here. \"The Shooting Star\" is a slowburning opener that quickly impresses the fact upon the listener that they're in for a subdued Gojira. \"Silvera\" was the first song I checked out from the album, and it's still probably my favourite, with punchy dark riffs that sound like they were drawn from The Way of All Flesh. \"Stranded\" has one of the coolest-sounding riffs I've ever heard from the band, and \"Low Lands\" is a solid way to climax the album, trailed afterwards by the gently acoustic \"Liberation\". Although the album has definitely grown on me over the course of listens, I have started to feel that Magma is conspicuously frontloaded when it comes to its quality material. All of the songs here are solid, but I find a harder time in remembering great moments from the second half of the record. I support Gojira's subdued evolution, but the lack of standouts nonetheless puts this below their best work. Other than that, there are no gripes to be had with the band's softer approach. The same intensity as always is here-- it just takes a bit more digging on the part of the listener to get it.\n\nOriginally written for Heathen Harvest Periodical.\n",
        "\nIf Gojira\u2019s last effort L\u2019Enfant Sauvage presented a more streamlined sound, Magma is the next step in stripping it down. Abandoning the technical death metal sound that got them popular in the metal world might seem like a betrayal to some, but I\u2019ve always seen Gojira as more of a progressive metal band anyway. They\u2019ve often eschewed the modern tech-death tag in favor of a sound that, while brutal, is heavily textured and dripping with atmosphere all the same. Gojira\u2019s way of combining beautiful textures, chunky riffs, and impressive instrumental skills is simply infectious, especially in albums like The Way of All Flesh and The Link. But Magma is a bit of a different beast, as it opts for an alarmingly simple approach to their signature sound. The groove metal element is still retained, but there\u2019s almost a post-metal quality about the way the album is presented. We now have much more buildup and subtle dynamic shifts in many of the tunes, and this is clear right from the slow-burning opener \u201cShooting Star,\u201d a song which immediately brings a sense of minimalism to the forefront. During the verses, a single guitar/bass note is repeatedly being played at the bottom while Joe Duplantier\u2019s clear vocals take charge above it. While \u201cSilvera\u201d picks up the pace substantially with Mario Duplantier\u2019s technical drumming and swifter guitar chugs, \u201cShooting Star\u201d is a clear foreshadowing of the album\u2019s tone. Speaking of vocals, Joe\u2019s clean vocals are much more prominent. Harsh singing is still present, but it\u2019s more thrash-based in nature instead of being gravelly; basically Joe\u2019s shouted vocals are especially frequent. In any case, it\u2019s not like Gojira\u2019s technical side has been entirely erased here, as moments like the punchy-yet-melodic \u201cSilvera\u201d or the amazingly intricate polyrhythmic intro of \u201cThe Cell\u201d demonstrate. \n\nBut strange moments do pop up more than once as a result of the band\u2019s stylistic shift. The somber instrumental piece \u201cYellow Stone\u201d is certainly in character for the band, given how their melancholic guitar-driven interlude \u201cThe Silver Cord\u201d from The Way of All Flesh sounded. But it still seems completely crazy that they would place an acoustic ambient/folk song at the very end of the album, especially one that lasts for as long as it does (almost 4 minutes, in this case). But \u201cLiberation\u201d does represent this album\u2019s experimentation nicely, and the preceding track \u201cLow Lands\u201d is another odd song that emphasizes a doom-laden atmosphere and somber melodies over outright heaviness. If there are any songs here that represent Gojira\u2019s more traditional sound from past albums, they would be \u201cSilvera,\u201d \u201cStranded,\u201d and \u201cOnly Pain.\u201d Here, you get to hear all the intense double-bass drumming, heavy guitar distortion from Duplantier and Christian Andreu, and bassist Jean-Michel Labadie\u2019s monstrous grooves. This is most notably heard on the fantastic chorus of \u201cStranded\u201d which subtly slides into a 6/4-time riff while Joe Duplantier belts out some of his most intense harsh vocals yet. But I feel as though the more adventurous songs are also the most exciting ones; they may seem simplistic at first, but despite (and partially because of) their minimalism, they command the listener\u2019s full attention through their subtleties. It would also be sensible to mention the event that likely influenced much of this album\u2019s tone and style: the tragic loss of Joe and Mario Duplantier\u2019s mother, Patricia Rosa. So the somber and downbeat vibe of Magma would certainly make sense because of this as well. While I don\u2019t think this is Gojira\u2019s best record, and it definitely seems like a transitional one, it\u2019s an incredibly exciting one at the same time. It can be tonally inconsistent once in a while, but the unusual experiments and minimalist songwriting choices definitely stick out in a genre filled with technical wizardry and complexity. Magma may be from a different Gojira than we\u2019re used to, but it\u2019s still an excellent piece of work.\n\n(Originally written for Sputnikmusic)\n",
        "\nChrist - I don't think there was this much negativity when the Hindenburg crashed! Gojira have always been a divisive band on this particular website. Those who are drawn in by their unique brand of progressive groove/death metal are quite often overly fanatic - whilst on the other side of the fence, naysayers are quick to criticize the band's integrity due to their deserved popularity. I know this - yet am still shocked at the amount of hatred directed at their newest output \"Magma\". And for what exactly? Changing their style? You mean like almost every band ever does at some point in their career? And I wouldn't even call this a change of style - it's so slight! But for me, it comes at a welcome pace and the reasons behind the evolution are completely justified. Yeah - Gojira don't 'change', they evolve. The beasts they are!\n\nThe 'change' everyone's whining about is that of simplification and softening. Whereas previous effort \"L'enfant Sauvage\" was an explosive and technical delight, \"Magma\" thrives on its sombre attitude and reflective nature. The Duplantier brothers explained in several interviews that the recording of this album was affected by the death of their mother (hence the album title - \"Mama\" with the G for 'Gojira' in the midde). It's understandable that the creative process would undergo some alteration. The French quartet have always been ones for philosophy and enlightenment - but this new release takes it to new heights.\n\nThe new approach is made clear right from the off. \"The Shooting Star\" is rich in broad, ethereal melodies, containing a far more melodic vocal performance from Joe. His vocals feel worn and sad - supremely effective in this opening track, and also in the title-track. Drenched in reverb, they provide most of the atmosphere. The lead parts have also calmed significantly - providing eerie, angular melodies in just the right spot to make the listener shiver. The combination of both Joe's vocals and these queer guitar leads is particularly effective on the floating \"Low Lands\".\n\nHowever, underneath all the impressionistic, soothing mysticism - beats the heart of the Gojira we all know and love. Despite what naysayers would have you believe, \"Magma\" contains plenty of those enormous chunky riffs, dissonant guitar squeals and semi-canorous growls that Joe is known for. \"The Cell\" and \"Only Pain\" are powerhouses - making the most of their downtuning. The simple and raw chugging of \"Stranded\" is undeniably fun. And \"Silvera\" might as well be on \"The Way of All Flesh\". A highlight for me is the swelling crescendo of \"Pray\"; the ambient nature sound effects and bone-like juttering rhythms take the band right back to 2005.\n\nI must be careful not to praise this album too much, after all it is far from perfect. The overall pace of the album is crawling, and it could benefit from a dose of energy in the right place - namely towards the end. Though the end of \"Low Lands\" is dramatic, and the outro, \"Liberation\", is so incredibly sincere in all its clangy, twangy beauty - an injection of the style found at the beginning of \"The Cell\" would have been welcome. The other main problem is that the quartet are missing an 'anthem'. This release has no \"Flying Whales\" or \"Remembrance\". No outstanding moment that makes you stand back and say \"FUCK.\" It's quite unremarkable and understated - though I suppose that's exactly the tone they were aiming for. The drab artwork is perfectly indicative of this - and we have no reason to complain. Love it or hate it - \"Magma\" is certainly imperfect, but by no means a failure. They're still Gojira.\n",
        "\nIf From Mars to Sirius brought Gojira to the world's attention, then this album really cemented them as a major force in the metal sphere. Without doubt upping the complexity and increasing the heaviness of the often groove-ridden songs on the preceding album, The Way of All Flesh is a bold and striking statement that didn't sound like many other bands at the time of its release and still hasn't been fully picked clean by the wave of technically adept bands spawned by the djent scene. Arguably, Gojira has declined in creativity since this album, both L'Enfant Sauvage and Magma lacking the innovation and execution to propel the band further into the unique space they created.\n\nWhat made Gojira's breakthrough album great was its vast quantity of huge and sometimes unearthly riffs, so it's necessary to note that the riffing presence fell a notch here to make way for more rhythmic fuckery and experimentation with other sounds. There are moments of certain death metal extremity ('All the Tears' goes almost brutal death in places), moments of kooky electronic guidance ('A Sight to Behold' creeps off on its own sense of melody in the verses), plus the familiar rumble of Mario Duplantier's monstrous drumming and Jean-Michel Labadie's guttural bass, while the swooping whale noises that made 'Ocean Planet' such a memorable opener are still here, though not in the same quantities. There are very few of the huge groove riffs that kept one's neck busy in From Mars to Sirius, with more time spent on increasingly heavy Meshuggah-style workouts that involve a lot of polyrhythms and weighty crashes of guitar. However, I prefer Gojira's brand of these riffs, since they rarely seem to be just focused on rhythms or creating a sense of alienation, but also have some amount of musical attractiveness.\n\nAs a whole, that means that The Way of All Flesh is Gojira's most densely musical album and remains the most difficult to penetrate, even to this day. The longer songs especially go through a lot of development between beginning and end, rarely sticking to strict songwriting formulas unlike some of the shorter songs. There is certainly something progressive in the way that 'Oroboros' and 'The Way of All Flesh' spend their time, but it is 'The Art of Dying' that really shows what Gojira were once capable of in terms of structuring the movement of their music. The tribal build-up is kept short but generates a potent sense of expectation, while the clatter of percussion and some excellent riffs dominate the first half, surprising the listener with spontaneity and sudden twists that rarely happen in a song that stretches to 10 minutes. Some verses are repeated with variations thrown in, so there's a lot to attend to until the song breaks and a majestic riff attends the song to the calm waters of some ambient sounds, making the whole process mirror the subject (this is about the art of dying if you've forgotten) and come full circle. However, following that, 'Esoteric Surgery' crashes in with the full weight of an almighty groove death riff and you soon become lost in pure enjoyment once again.\n\nAt the other end of the scale from 'The Art of Dying', songs like 'Toxic Garbage Island' are more straightforward and satisfy more instinctively. What's impressive in this song is that Gojira are certainly not playing in a traditionally catchy style, yet the jagged pauses in the riffs as well as the screamed slogan of \"plastic bag in the sea\" really stick in the mind, as do a surprising amount of Joe Duplantier's huge vocals. However, where that song is a success, the likes of 'Adoration for None' and, to a lesser degree, 'Yama's Messengers' and 'Vacuity' don't really have enough to make them stand out and justify the inclusion of all their parts. 'Adoration for None' particularly seems generic in places, sounding like a metalcore band smashing all their chugs and beats into a compressed space, so that we get a kind of uncatchy Lamb of God style track. Randy Blythe is also a guest on the song, so the style may well have expanded to suit him, but it just doesn't work, sounding rather like another song ('Vulture' by A Life Once Lost) that Blythe had previously guested on. 'Vacuity' has some very interesting riffing once the song gets moving, though that takes a while and - like a few parts of other songs - stalls in the midst of rhythms for too long to be completely satisfying.\n\nAlthough Gojira's crowning achievement would seem to be cemented as From Mars to Sirius in the minds of most metal fans, I would say that The Way of All Flesh eclipses it in terms of creativity, songwriting, and thoughtfulness, if not on grounds of pure enjoyment. Showcasing the most mature music that the Frenchmen have ever put out, this is a success in all of its rhythmically twisted glory.\n",
        "\nEveryone who\u2019s even somewhat into metal knows all about Gojira and the music they produce, so a convoluted backstory probably isn\u2019t necessary here. Succinctly, they have been dominating the world with their particular brand of groove metal, and have made five albums of greatness in that time \u2013 each one having their own spin but still retaining that Gojira core. Their albums are all great but I have a certain leaning towards The Way of All Flesh, citing its interesting song structure and catchy riffs mixed with great production as the main reasons why. However, all of their albums are of excellent quality, at least for me.\n\nUnfortunately, their sixth output of Magma is by far the least interesting of all their albums.\n\nPrior to this album even getting a mention, the Duplantier brothers\u2019 mother died in 2015. Obviously that\u2019s devastating news for anyone and my condolences still go out to them a year on. They ended up cancelling tours, as anyone would, and I suspect some time to grieve. Now I\u2019m not suggesting that the death of their mother totally influenced the music on offer here, but I hesitate to say it had no effect. Magma is particularly lighter in its delivery; solemnity and atmosphere outweighs the groove and harshness present in previous albums. Where an opener like \u201cExplosia\u201d delivers power and punch, here we are treated, for lack of a better term, to \u201cThe Shooting Star,\u201d which is basically a heavy-ish post-rock opening track that neither warms the listener up for what\u2019s to come, nor does it elicit any excitement from them, as the track meanders along with some standard riffing and basic drumming by Gojira\u2019s standards, with some lame cleans reverberating over it. Not a good start, and it doesn\u2019t improve.\n\nTo be completely fair, though, notwithstanding the fact that \u201cThe Shooting Star\u201d is a plodding something-or-other, that is actually one of the stronger tracks here, which is a real shame because the opener is so light and feathery. The following track \u201cSilvera\u201d introduces the heaviness, but this track is actually worse because the riff doesn\u2019t really invigorate me, and the chorus is far too clean even for Gojira\u2019s standards, losing any of the lustre that was scraped up from the verses. Ultimately the song is too safe and doesn\u2019t do anything to shine or stand apart other than being \u201ca song by Gojira.\u201d\n\nThis is possibly where Magma ultimately fails \u2013 it\u2019s perception of safeness. Too many songs are safely written and don\u2019t stray into any interesting territory. Before the album was released, word got out that the songs were going to be shorter than previously, focusing on the shorter attention spans of today\u2019s music consumers. Firstly, assuming that\u2019s actually a reason why, that\u2019s quite standardised. Secondly, that was disappointing because their longer songs such as \u201cThe Art of Dying\u201d and \u201cInto the Wilderness\u201d from previous exploits showcase the evolution of songs to their bombastic conclusions, a progression that I feared would be lost here. Unfortunately, sometimes I hate being right, because some songs here could\u2019ve been fleshed out so much more to include extra riffs, a solo, or any number of infinite things that may have galvanised the album, but they played it too safe. \u201cStranded\u201d goes for a verse-chorus-bridge-chorus flow which ultimately leaves us with little encouragement to replay it. If there\u2019s no surprises around the corner, or any hook, something to grab onto, songs tend to float away in our memory aether, and that\u2019s not good when Gojira are known for hooking us in.\n\nIronically, when they do try something new, it tends to fail. The title track, for example, tries a weird riff/note pattern that actively sounds annoying, and, being the longest song here, should do something to hold me, but just like \u201cThe Shooting Star,\u201d it just tends to be there. I can\u2019t understand how a band that historically was best at writing long songs and keeping them entertaining can output such mediocrity in the source of \u201cMagma,\u201d a song that sounds like it\u2019s really trying to make you like it but you can\u2019t, no matter how much it tries to entice. And then there\u2019s a song like \u201cLow Lands\u201d that is quite possibly the most boring track here. Soft quasi-riffs over some minimalistic drumming and a swathe of clean vocals for its first four or so minutes that go absolutely nowhere. Its stagnation is so strong that when the song picks up \u2013 and that\u2019s a term I\u2019m using quite loosely \u2013 it\u2019s lost all of its charm, and then ends suddenly. A six minute song shouldn\u2019t end suddenly, and especially not a Gojira album.\n\nI\u2019m yet to mention the two worst songs here, though. \u201cYellow Stone\u201d is 79 seconds of sludge metal whatever \u2013 a filler track in every sense of the word, and one that should not be here on their shortest album. But the real atrocity comes in the form of \u201cLiberation.\u201d This instrumental closer is not what you would expect, and I don\u2019t mean that positively. What we have here is possibly a drunken acoustic jam around a campfire that the band may have accidentally recorded one day and then said, \u201chey, if we add this to the end of our next album, we don\u2019t have to actually write a tenth song!\u201d The problem here is that \u201cLow Lands\u201d was a poor penultimate choice, and what the listener wants is something commanding to end with, but instead we are left with some random outtake of them mucking about (surely!) where the weak guitar lines could not even be bothered to stay in time with the bongo drums. It\u2019s not only a poor choice, but it actually makes no sense in the context of the album. None of the three-and-a-half minutes here deserve to have the Gojira name planted on it, especially a closing track to an already inferior album, and I declare it the worst song they\u2019ve ever penned.\n\nMagma is as frustrating as it is sad. You listen to all the songs and you know that the members did not suddenly lose their ability to play, because clearly they\u2019re all still solidly adept at their respective roles. It\u2019s just the way they\u2019re used here that makes you shake your head and pine for their older ways. Mario was known as a massive drummer, delivering beats and fills with expertise that only he knows. Here he is demoted to a rock beat and the occasional flair only when necessary. For a man of his unwavering talents, it\u2019s simply not good enough. And then Joe, the older brother, has some excellent clean vocals that are used far too much here. \u201cThe Shooting Star,\u201d \u201cMagma,\u201d and especially \u201cLow Lands\u201d could\u2019ve all benefitted from some harsh vocals, but we are relegated to hearing too many of his cleans. \u201cStranded\u201d may have been a stronger song if the bridge wasn\u2019t weakened by cleans. It worked in the past, but it doesn\u2019t here, and that\u2019s a real shame. And then the guitar work is still as skilful as they\u2019ve been in the past, but the choices made here just don\u2019t work. Instead of big riffs that groove along, we are too often left with the dregs. I hate to continue picking on \u201cLow Lands,\u201d but the minimalist riffs do nothing to charge the song and we\u2019re left wondering when things are going to improve. And this is why Magma is so frustrating: the members of Gojira still have the chops but decided to abandon what they can do best in the name of progression and change. I have no problem with change but here it all just falls flat.\n\nIs there anything good about this album? Sure there is. \u201cThe Cell\u201d is by far the best song here, with its polyrhythmic opening riff that pops up again later on and gives the song \u2013 and the album, arguably \u2013 some much-needed power. Ironically, it\u2019s the shortest song here, after saying that Gojira are best with their longer songs. The following song \u201cStranded,\u201d while not as good, probably works as a logical follow-up, giving this one-two punch as easily the best part of the album. \u201cPray\u201d is not a particularly great song but after the title track it\u2019s then nice to hear something punchy, and especially the opening it gives us something to hang onto. The song is a minor highlight in an otherwise dour album, with some nice sections in it, including the bridge and the riff after it, even if it is fleeting. Furthermore, if I\u2019m reaching for straws, \u201cThe Shooting Star\u201d isn\u2019t a god-awful song when pitted against other stuff like \u201cMagma\u201d and \u201cLow Lands,\u201d but still needs loads of improvement. I also have no issues with the overall production. It\u2019s probably befitting of this type of music \u2013 not too loud, but not too soft, and all instruments and vocals are mixed with the correct settings.\n\nIt makes me sad to write a poor review for a Gojira album. I\u2019ve loved everything they\u2019ve done up to this point, and Magma just falls flat. \u201cThe Cell\u201d is an obvious highlight, and there are other bits and pieces scattered around the album that do work, but then you have songs like \u201cMagma,\u201d \u201cSilvera,\u201d \u201cOnly Pain,\u201d and \u201cLow Lands\u201d that simply don\u2019t work. Then there\u2019s \u201cYellow Stone\u201d and \u201cLiberation\u201d where the former is worthless and the latter is completely unforgivable. Perhaps the death of the Duplantiers\u2019 mother hasn\u2019t fully left them, and I still say that\u2019s okay, or perhaps their need to mix it up a little bit forced their hand. Either way, this album is sub-par, not worth the four years since L\u2019Enfant Sauvage, and I still hold out hope that they can get back to their best on their seventh album.\n",
        "\nI was first introduced to Gojira back in 2013 with the album L'Enfant Sauvage. I dug their sound from the get go but for some reason didn't explore their back catalog until recently. After hearing the first single Stranded from their new album I was curious to see what the older works had to offer. My curiosity certainly paid off as From Mars to Sirius is one hell of a record. From start to finish each track is excellently varied and never stale. You have the slow atmospheric songs, the absolute head crushers, and even a seemingly grunge inspired song. The production is crystal clear which works for such complex music. Albeit a little sterile, it works very well with the mechanized sound heard on many tracks. \n\nEvery member is in top form when it comes to their particular instrument. Mario Duplantier is a monster on the kit, churning out fantastic fills and jackhammer like double bass. He really is the driving force of this album. Joe Duplantier and Christian Andreu supply the crushingly heavy riffs that songs like Backbone are known for. Jean-Michel Labadie helps keep the rhythm in check on bass although he is slightly low in the mix. The vocals are a completely different beast altogether. Joe spews out everything from the deepest growls, highest screams, and excellent cleans. It's very interesting to see how he incorporates multiple styles into one song.\n\nI could talk about every nuance of this amazing album but instead I'm going to highlight some key tracks. Ocean Planet is a great opener that encapsulates everything you can expect from this album. Backbone hammers your brain with an unrelenting riff fest that never loses any steam, a truly intense song. From the Sky is a fast paced number perfectly utilizing the trademark squeal Gojira is known for. A slower and more atmospheric song, Where Dragons Dwell delves into mythological themes. If there is only one track you check out from this album, please let it be The Heaviest Matter of the Universe. The Morbid Angel influence is strong as chaotic drumming makes way for fantastically heavy riffs and a deluge of alternate vocal styles. Oddly enough World to Come reminds me of an early Alice in Chains song, with cleanly sung verses and slowed down guitar work. The song wouldn't feel out of place on Facelift or Dirt in my opinion. And the last highlight is Flying Whales, a nearly 7 minute epic with many great tricks up its sleeve. It starts out with gentle drumming mixed with whale sounds before turning into a groovy riff heavy tale about the majestic flying whales. \n\nReally the only flaw I can find with this album is some songs tend to drag on a little too long. But even then it's only a minor nitpick. There really is no bad track on this album, and while I like some better than others I'm never inclined to hit next. From beginning to end it remains an engaging listen absolutely worth your time. If you're a fan of death metal or extreme metal in general then give this one a shot. I guarantee you will find at least some semblance of enjoyment from this magnificent effort.\n",
        "\nGojira\u2019s latest is a bit underwhelming. Simplified, often less heavy, and less energetic, it still checks all the boxes so to speak, but it\u2019s woefully inconsistent. At times it\u2019s forcefully aggressive, and other times it channels slower, mediocre groove metal, complete with chugs and forgettable (and even annoying) riffs, Gojira\u2019s quality fluctuates with their differing levels of heaviness, and with both their experimentation and lack thereof.\n\nMagma sounds a lot like Mastodon in places, but instead of doing a fill every other measure the drummer plays off the chugging guitars, and sometimes that\u2019s the only way to really tell them apart. It\u2019s definitely in some of the riffing, but the clean vocals really create this similarity. The singing that possibly makes up a majority of the vocals doesn\u2019t have much feeling to it, even though it\u2019s performed well otherwise. Gojira\u2019s strong point doesn\u2019t seem to be the relative softness and slowness of pure groove metal, or sludginess either.\n\nA few of the songs have promisingly heavy sections, but they typically end up sputtering out. None of the main riffs are particularly strong, vicious, or memorable, and the rest end up just being chugs. I hear some polyrhythms in songs such as The Cell or Low Lands but the way they are performed makes it seem like Gojira is including them just to fulfill requirements, and they are integrated in disappointingly bland ways and without much passion. Most of the album is in 4/4 anyway. \n\nThe two instrumentals on this album take up a small percentage of Magma\u2019s runtime but they emphasize the lacking nature of this album and how Gojira doesn\u2019t seem to know exactly what they\u2019re going for. Neither of them are the sort of wanky prog instrumentals composed just to show off the musicians\u2019 talents, they are rather interludes and segues although they don\u2019t even seem to accomplish that. Any subpar doom or groove metal band could\u2019ve jammed out Yellow Stone, hit record, and slapped on some cool effects. It\u2019s not even a proper interlude because it still sounds like the rest of the album. Liberation could\u2019ve been a decent intermission, but instead it closes the Mehalbum, a choice I don\u2019t understand. It sounds different from the rest of Magma, some acoustic noodling and hand percussion played together to get an ambient, chill vibe. Low Lands actually had a bit of buildup and it\u2019s one of the more memorable tracks, more atmospheric, but it doesn\u2019t seem as though it deserves a coda.\n\nAs much as it may seem like I\u2019ve shat all over this, it\u2019s really not that bad. Magma is proving to be a grower, as others have said about the singles. Despite inconsistency in quality, it\u2019s good to hear that Gojira can write slightly different styles of songs. Still, there\u2019s not a whole lot going into this. They\u2019re still trying to fulfill all the requirements for their sound but it\u2019s lacking the complexity, the heaviness, and most importantly, much of the inspiration.\n\nTop tracks: Silvera, Low Lands\n",
        "\nGojira has always been a band that flirted on the margins of the accessible in heavy music, basing a lot of their songwriting upon a foundation of simplistic, eager chugging rhythms and clear nods to once fashionable niches like the dreaded 'nu metal'. What clearly separated was their ability to elevate this sort of riffing component to a realm more transcendent, poetic and majestic, breathing new life with a combination of great studio production that really let them feel out those chords and mutes; and of course the almost hymnal nature of Joe Duplantier's grating yet melodic vocal tone, which is almost like the offspring of Pink Floyd's hypnotic, drugged, and harmonic quality with Neurosis harshness. But I think Magma, the Frenchmen's sixth full-length, is an example how regurgitating very basic riff cycles can only take you so far, and the record suffers slightly for this.\n\nDon't get me wrong, there is more than enough material here for a solid, I daresay even 'great' EP, and much of that arrives in the first four tracks. In particular, \"Stranded\" is one I'd toss on any mix tape, which does wonders with those chugging patterns as it offsets them with the spikes of higher pitched guitar and a rousing, uplifting, if predictable chorus. I even enjoyed the soothing, cleaner vocal harmonies that came in the bridge. \"The Cell\" also has its moments with those churning palm mute harmony patterns and the faint melodies they plaster over them, although even this track relies on an extremely primitive groove riff that I didn't feel could contribute much to its overall composure after maybe 3-4 repetitions. But honestly, there is a very consistent opening 15-16 minutes with a lot of subtlety alongside the jackhammering grooves, a few twists and surprises that help augment that banal 'heaviness' forced by a lot of the palm mute focus, very much in the style that they mastered in 2005 with From Mars to Sirius, or its superb successor The Way of All Flesh. Granted, there is no \"Oroborus\" of \"Toxic Garbage Island\" among these, but I'd say that the quality does hit the standard of L'Enfant sauvage.\n\nWhere it does NOT hit that standard is in the two vapid instrumental tunes, \"Yellow Stone\" and \"Liberation\", which have nothing on the excellent \"Wild Healer\" from the prior album. The first is an oozing, circular, bluesy Sabbath piece with a little bit of ambient accompaniment, which goes just nowhere for me, and the last was a traditional acoustic guitar piece with some percussion that is a pretty boring afterthought to all that came before it. Hell, \"Liberation\" seems like such a mistake that I thought someone had mixed up the production of the CD. Otherwise, there were some cuts like \"Magma\" itself, \"Pray\", or the bass-swerving chug onslaught of \"Only Pain\" which basically rips its 'surprise' riff off the much catchier \"Stranded\" that did little to nothing interesting. When Joe is shouting \"just wanted to be good\" in the middle of that last tune, I was forced to agree with him. \"Low Lands\" would have been a solid closer for my imaginative EP version of this album, since I like how he works the vocals throughout, and it's constant climbing feel, but even that is just not enough to save this from sub-greatness.\n\nSonically, I don't have an issue here, since it sounds as crisp, pulverizing and rich as the couple albums before it, but much as the production emboldens the parts of Magma that I do like, it also accents the parts that I don't. The lyrics are alright, but tunes like \"Silvera\" rely on a lot of nu metal, groove or hardcore cliche like lines and images that don't do as much for the imagination as even the very basest riffing they perform. So, ultimately, was this worth a four year wait? Half of it is a worthwhile followup to L'Enfant sauvage, but the other half seems like the ideas in the Gojira camp have run dry, and the ironic elegant primacy that fuels their songwriting has petered out to a more neutral plane in which their upward creative trajectory has halted. I'll still slap a passing grade on it, because I get enough emotional resonance out of its stronger pieces, but I can guarantee that I won't often feel a compulsion to listen through in its entirety, skipping those instrumentals entirely and giving or taking 2-3 other tunes.\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nOver the course of a decade, France\u2019s Gojira have grown to represent the next stage of heavy music\u2019s evolution. If you\u2019ve seen them live then nobody can dispute the fact that for all the technical brilliance of their peers such as Mastodon and Lamb of God, there\u2019s something so emotive and soulful about whatever the Duplantier brothers do that makes it seem like Gojira are in a complete league of their own. With their sixth album, \u201cMagma\u201d, they continue to traverse to further lands that are so eloquently dominant over the ocean of modern metal bands out there.\n\nJust like the layered tectonic structure of the Earth, \u201cMagma\u201d has been crafted upon foundations of varying emotions. On the surface you've got Gojira simply evolving their hammering sound into more simplistic rhythms, like \u2018Stranded\u2019, while sounding just as heavy as before. But, beneath the surface is a natural ebbing progression that lies deep in the roots of the Mt. Gojira. On \u2018The Cell\u2019 and title track you\u2019ve got Mario\u2019s inevitably stellar technicality on drums but it\u2019s the wisps of guitar from Christian Andreu on the title track or Jean-Michel Labadie\u2019s murky bass in the previous song, \u2018Yellow Stone\u2019 that boils the intensity towards the special, heated captivation that only Gojira can conjure. \n\nWith \u201cMagma\u201d, the relationship of music and melody is solidified by the sad passing of the Duplantier brother's mother in 2015. Compared their brazenly heavy catalogue, this loss has impacted the mood of this album greatly. The intense emotions contort from a slow kindling fire to blazing infernos of rage that characterize the title of the album: something boiling and ready to erupt. The serene intro, \u2018The Shooting Star\u2019, with its longing lyrics of \u201cWhen you get to the other side, please send a sign\u201d and pensive riffs exemplifies the calmer and reflective side of the album while transitions between imposing vocals and explosive guitar slides on \u2018Pray\u2019, plus the screeching whammy hooks on \u2018Only Pain\u2019, identify the extreme and severe cascade of emotions from the same tragedy. Having been immortalised within this album, \u201cMagma\u201d feels more like a celebration rather than a mournful eulogy of Patricia Rosa Duplantier.\n\nThough far from accessible, the music on \u201cMagma\u201d is just as diverse as ever. Mario\u2019s drumming is endlessly meandering round each guitar hook that his brother, Joe, can throw at him and the sound of the bass lines-when exposed- can only be described as the echoes of the Earth\u2019s plates grinding. Joe Duplantier also maintains the elasticity of his own riffing with death metal influences on \u2018Silvera\u2019 and progresses the flexibility of his tender clean vocals in various occasions throughout \u201cMagma\u201d with success, particularly in \u2018Low Lands\u2019. \n\nWould Gojira be the same beast that they are now without the conviction behind the music? No. Their ferocious environmental beliefs and maternal spiritual guidance on \u201cMagma\u201d are matched only by the sophistication of their instrumentation. Here, the music acts as a medium to which their messages are conveyed in a way that only makes Gojira\u2019s songs all the more compelling. Music and passion: one cannot live without the other.\n\nOriginally written for http://www.sputnikmusic.com/review/70996/Gojira-Magma/\n",
        "\n''Magma'' is a dull and plodding post-metal output with a constantly depressive atmosphere. Chugging groove metal riffs in the key of Pantera meet tiring riffs with a melancholic undertone in the style of S\u00f3lstafir and a few discordant guitar sounds that recall a light version of Voivod during the E-Force years. The humming and droning bass guitar and the tired drum play manage to remain unspectacular throughout the entire album. The vocals are diversified yet somewhat directionless since they are lacking an own identity. They are either psychedelic and effect-ridden, slightly clean and melodic but unimpressive or more aggressive as in previous releases.\n\nLet's dig a little bit deeper into the negative elements of what might be Gojira's worst output to date. Things start badly with the opener ''The Shooting Star''. Usually, an opener should either kick things off with a bang or foreshadow the things to come. This one does neither and is simply an overlong and repetitive post-metal tune without any song writing qualities. The length of some tracks is actually a reoccurring issue on this release. As soon as the band finally develops a gripping atmosphere or comes around with a tight riff, the idea gets repeated for minutes and loses all of its initial appeal. That's why the title track ''Magma'' is only average at best while the unsatisfying ''Low Lands'' is even harder to digest.\n\nThe band gets worst though when its songs are purely instrumental. There is no reason in the world for a song like ''Yellow Stone'' to even exist. On a rather short record with ten tracks, there is simply no place for a numbing sound check that makes the listeners waste seventy-nine seconds of their lives. This song doesn't follow or build up anything and is obviously an attempt at being an uninspired filler but it's actually so bad that it gets more negative attention than it was supposed to get. The worst joke on this album is the album closer ''Liberation''. Random and simplistic acoustic guitar sounds that remind me of a clumsy teenager that grabs a guitar for the first time in his life and tries to play some random sounds meet boring tribal percussion elements that manage to be ether repetitive or out of rhythm for three and a half painful minutes. There is no chemistry or harmony whatsoever between the two instruments and it only makes the record longer after the previous tune was already excessive. This might sound severe but these two instrumentals shouldn't even exist and it's almost offensive to include them on an album that is not named ''Demos, Jams & Outtakes'' with a warning sticker ''Only for fanboys/fangirls who would buy anything from this band''.\n\nIt's really tough to find anything really positive about this output aside from its coherent oppressive atmosphere. Maybe the shorter songs with vocals aren't so bad at times. ''Silvera'' has a decent main riff and some solid hypnotizing guitar and vocal melodies that recall System Of A Down. ''Stranded'' also has a certain appeal thanks to its mix of groove metal riffs and progressive guitar sounds that meet angry yet liberating vocals leading to a quite catchy chorus that could also come from KoRn. This song reminds me of a slightly more psychedelic version of nu-metal that was popular fifteen years ago. I guess most people will hate this tune but since I somehow grew up with this kind of music I may have a sympathetic feeling of nostalgia for it.\n\nThe few catchier tunes that were chosen as singles are acceptable but can't save an otherwise plodding record. I know that this frustrating output was created under difficult circumstances but the band should have just stopped recording this album, taken a break and come back with a more poignant and liberating song writing that wouldn't be influenced by those depressing events. What counts in the end is the final product and not how or why it was made and my verdict is that this sub-par record is so underwhelming that I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. The name Gojira usually stands for something monstrous but this here is just disappointing, elegiac and vapid.\n",
        "\nNeither of the 2 genres by which I know Gojira best are a very good description of the band. On the one hand, they don't have enough pace or ferocity or meanness to be a death metal band, although they do (at times) possess the same earth-moving, incensed intensity as any death metal band you would care to mention. On the other, there is far too distinctive a Gojira sound to call these guys progressive, yet all the light and shade, innovative instrument use, and unique writing style does make them good candidates for the position. Then we have groove metal, which I never usually think of on my own. Gojira do groove, and quite deliberately too in places, but then they groove in the same way that Fear Factory groove, like on the percussive title track here, or (and this really isn't the same thing) they groove in the way that Amon Amarth do, like on the opening riff of 'The Axe'. I really don't think they sound like Meshuggah all that much, despite their similar artist rating on the Metal Archives. Maybe both vocalists bark and the drums tend to be complex and prominent, I guess - that's not really enough for me.\n\nThus, Gojira end up largely unique in my eyes, on L'Enfant Sauvage dealing in a sort of smooth death metal or frozen progressive metal feeling that gives them quite a lot of atmosphere and quite a bit of heaviness. I never feel that they fully get the measure of either of those things on their own, often becoming too fixed on a featureless riff or completely out there on a soaring vocal passage that rises on an oddly top heavy construction. Then there are times when the band's unusual approach to heaviness is simply enormous and oppressive - that incredible harmonic that sounds like a dolphin on a helter-skelter near the beginning of 'Planned Obsolescence' - or the vocal and rhythmic fury is overwhelming, in the way that Strapping Young Lad were capable of on occasion. They are a different experience to other bands, and the listener must accept them as such.\n\nFor all that, I don't think that L'Enfant Sauvage (they just wanted something French didn't they?) has as much creativity or forward-thinking as the preceding albums. The epic touches are gone, while the huge groove riffs like 'From the Sky' have disappeared too, and with them a little of that fatter guitar tone. For me, those past features were great, because Gojira used to be a catchy band in a way that they don't achieve on this album; also, they seem to run out of ideas on a few songs ('Mouth of Kala', perhaps 'Explosia') and just let them finish in a relaxed, non-committal manner, like they were hoping no one would notice. I'm disappointed with the guitars in general, except for the Gojira-esque touches - the aforementioned 'Planned Obsolescence', the excellently varied 'The Gift of Guilt', and the palm-muted riff of 'Pain Is a Master', which actually sounds best, since it is more suited for the production. There are still no solos and no specific melodies, though contrasting heavy and clean parts often get pushed together, more for atmosphere and momentum than anything else. The circling hammer-ons are quite a feature, nor do I mind them, though I can't help wishing that they was another feature or two to make things more interesting. The drums are also very typical for Gojira, with a lot of Mario Duplantier's hammering beats: they vary in pattern and intensity and certainly in pace, but don't do enough to make up for the other absences. Bass is strong and scrambles about nicely in the hammer-on sections and the chugging riffs, though, again, it isn't a virtuoso performance.\n\nAll this means that we have a plain set of songs with scant attention-grabbing touches. The harmonics, pick scrapes, hammer-ons, and softer parts are all very well to give some detail and diversity to the songs - and it these things I remember most - but they can't do everything, and we must turn to the songwriting and production for answers. Only a couple of songs really have enough content to last their length: I prefer 'The Gift of Guilt', 'The Axe', and 'Born in Winter' the most out of these songs, while I have little praise for the title track, 'Mouth of Kala', or 'The Fall'. One reason might be a diminished presence for Joe Duplantier, whose vocals are so often the driving force of Gojira's elemental sound. He is a little quiet, a little restrained, an ounce more lamenting than he used to be and - with the absence of enough riffs - leaves the songs without an anchor and without a clear focus. The songs on L'Enfant Sauvage drift in a more progressive manner than ever before, yet don't have the ideas to call themselves progressive. It's not a totally bad release, but a failure by Gojira's standards.\n",
        "\nWhen pakicetidae evolved into marine mammals, it was to preemptively avoid having to hear this shit. The whale floggers in Gojira are here with a live album that captures their slacktivist rock music in the flesh (no appearances from the Whale Wars guy this time). Though their lyrics suggest caring about the ecosystem and whatnot, their being from France and playing in London suggests a plane flight and the use of a gas guzzling tour bus (not very green). This dishonesty with self and concept extends to the noise pollution that is their music (actually muzak).\n\nIt's no wonder this is on Roadrunner records. For a live album, it sounds suspiciously overdubbed to the point of sounding like a studio recording (band looks technically on point but, considering their dishonesty, that could just be a big editing budget). Although the selection of tracks here covers their whole discography, it's funny to see how this band was a sham right out the gate with early songs being indistinguishable from their later ones in terms of structure/substance/etc. All their music is a series of \"heavy\" drop tuned power chord groove riffs with pick scraping sounds ending each measure before some \"soft\" post-rock/indie noodling occurs in highly repetitive verse-chorus songs with added \"unorthodox\" bridges that are incongruous and thrown out there to distract the audience from the pop-rock sensibilities (think U2) disguised as \"angry metal music\". There were blast beats at a few select parts and the vocals are an invariant constipated broken English shout/grunt (recalling Max Cavalera on Chaos AD with added \"unngghhnn\" factor), but it does nothing to change the fact that this might as well be Devin Townsend on quaaludes doing Pantera covers (if a tremolo riff is played, it sounds \"grooved\" out into a 4/4 rock measure).\n\nIf you're a fan of indie-rock but are feeling \"rowdy\", then this media product will provide some transient entertainment before you move on to The Dave Matthews Band and U2. Self-respecting cetaceans and humans alike would be wise to steer clear of this affront to the biosphere. A crappy show where the band looks bored going through typical stadium rock maneuvers that look borrowed from U2 and Machine Head. Even when Slayer got old and started dressing like they'd rather be at a football game while playing crap like Stain of Mind, they looked cool. Vapid.\n",
        "\nThe French are most certainly not pussies. They've provided us with fine black metal (Anorexia Nervosa), brutal death metal (Happy Face), and even symphonic power metal (Fairyland). But in the last decade, progressive death metallers Gojira have really made an impact on the entire genre, bringing the French metal scene to the forefront of our minds once more. The phrase 'progressive death metal' brings to mind big names like Cynic, Opeth, or even \"Symbolic\"-era Death. But you should really dispel all pretentions when picking up an album by this Bayonne quartet. Their brand of prog/death is certainly unique. Despite being incredibly atmospheric and technically admirable, they're also crushingly heavy. This is Gojira, and they have come to pummel you.\n\nGojira's uniqueness derives not from individual stand-out performances, but from an overall sound which is simultaneously brutal and ambient. On \"The Link\", their second full-length release, atmosphere is certainly the key. The music successfully conjures up images of humid jungles and ancient tribal rituals through their de-tuned primal rhythms (\"Indians\") and occasional use of ethnic percussion (\"Connected\"). It's a strangely immersive sound which will instantly grasp you, right from the rhythmic bone-tapping of the opening title-track, all the way to the fading forest ambience of 8-minute instrumental \"Dawn\".\n\nOverall mood notwithstanding, the performances from the individual band-members are phenomenal - and they are clearly masters in their respective fields. Vocalist/guitarist Joe Duplantier's voice has an interesting characteristic which is rare in death metal; his growls are not just guttural and primeval, they are almost tuned, allowing for a wider range of timbres for this band to experiment with. His quasi-melodic grunts also add to the general humidity of the atmosphere. The twin guitar attack of Joe and right-hand-man Christian Andreu is a combination of detuned aggressive chugs, and sharp, dissonant accents, contributing a portion of the 'evilness' that is expected of death metal. Jean-Michel Labadie's bass rumbles wonderfully underneath the chaos, and Mario Duplantier's (Joe's younger brother) drumming has since become iconic among fans. So there's no doubt that we're dealing with a quartet of expertly-skilled musicians and composers.\n\n\"The Link\" certainly stands out in Gojira's praiseworthy discography, for having such an odd production quality. The following albums employ a very modern-sounding, yet edgy production which emphasizes the guitar-tone to beyond brutal. But \"The Link\" almost sounds as if all 11 tracks were recorded in the middle of the Amazon rainforest. The guitars and bass are crisp with plenty of weight behind them, whilst the drums pierce through with an almost metallic quality. Swirling airily around this musical maelstrom, is Joe Duplantiers semi-growled, slightly distant vocals - emanating an aura of eerie mysticism.\n\nThe songs themselves utilize irregular time-signatures mixed with savage rhythms - all surrounded by a framework of unconventional structures. There's never a boring moment if you're looking for musical substance - as this band's technical prowess will make even the most die-hard muso shrink in ego. Just take a listen to the outro to \"Remembrance\", and try memorizing that rhythm! That's the kind of virtuosity Gojira are capable of, and cleverly insert into their compositions to throw-off but greatly entertain the listener. \n\nHighlights include the bone-shattering heaviness of 2nd track \"Death of Me\", the beautiful ambience of closing instrumental \"Dawn\", the classic death metal sound of \"Wisdom Comes\", (complete with some fantastic blast-beats from Mario) and the sonorous chanting of \"Embrace The World\". However, this album's pi\u00e9ce de resistance (yeah, I had to put a bit of French in here somewhere) is the stop/start exoticism of \"Inward Movement\". Starting off as a swelling doom/death track, it quickly morphs into a real headbanging groove-machine, before completely letting loose with a torrent of vicious dissonance and barbaric blast-beats (I'm not kidding, listen to the section at 2:51 and tell me that's not musical ecstasy!).\n\nI have seen far too much hatred aimed at Gojira. Hatred which, I'm sure, has come from those who have simply dismissed them as 'mallcore' without even hearing a single ferocious note from this French quartet. Well, shut your fucking mouths, pick up a copy of \"The Link\" and let the feral turbulence of Gojira dig its knuckles into your face, leaving nothing but a satisfied, skeletal grin. Larry out.\n\n Highlights - \"Death of Me\", \"Remembrance\", \"Inward Movement\", \"Wisdom Comes\"\n\nFor fans of - Hacride, Death, Opeth\n",
        "\nGojira is one of the most iconic metal bands of today. They have an instantly identifiable style, and a strong ecological message that may be entirely unique in the genre. They also write some excellent music that pleases a wide swath of fans, leading to a rare combination of both mainstream and underground appeal. While they aren't universally beloved, few bands come close.\n\nThey have this annoying tendency to take years between releases. They blew a lot of people away with 2005's From Mars to Sirius. It wasn't until 2008 that they released one of my favorite albums of that year, The Way of All Flesh. It was well worth the wait. They made us wait another four years before releasing L'Enfant Sauvage. Was it also worth it?\n\nI'm a little late getting this review out there, so by now you've already heard a dozen different opinions, and maybe had a chance to form your own. But perhaps I can illuminate the discussion.\n\nThe record hits all of the things the band has become known for. Heavy groove/death metal with their signature guitar screeches (\"Explosia\"). Interesting rhythms and high-pitched leads (the title track). Duplantier's unique roar, Cynical computer-effect voice, and rough-edged singing (\"Liquid Fire\"). A mellow interlude (\"The Wild Healer\"). They even managed to record an epic featuring understated music and spoken word, followed by the heavy, dramatic part--and finished it in under 4 minutes (\"Born in Winter\"). The songs are catchy, hook-filled, groovy, and pissed-off. As always, an unlikely blend of Pantera, Cynic, and a bit of Meshuggah.\n\nBut L'Enfant Sauvage is sorely lacking one thing. It has no \"Oroborus,\" no skull-smashingly destructive, unbridled outpouring of fury. They've thoroughly explored their morose side, and to be fair Gojira still sound enraged in their sad mode. Every song has at least one foot in that mood. But it sounds like, in the last four year period, they've lost that little bit of hope they used to have. It's no longer the band hitting you with a hammer and telling you to wake up. Now it's the band who've given up. They're still mad, but it's become an aimless emotion.\n\nThe music is still excellent. As individual songs, they've got a lot to offer. But I really miss getting hit with that hammer.\n\noriginally written for http://fullmetalattorney.blogspot.com/\n",
        "\nGojira's fifth full-length release (first with Roadrunner) is everything that we have come to expect from a Gojira record. Following the precedent that was set by From Mars to Sirius and cemented by The Way of All Flesh, L'Enfant Sauvage (meaning \"the wild child\" in the band's native French) still focuses heavily on their particular, some might say unique, brand of groovy, complex death metal, while adding some new things, such as greater emphasis on groove and extended rhythmic passages. Also, the band, in their increasing age, have mellowed a bit, trading some of the fiery, youthful rage of their earlier releases for a more mature, smouldering musical experience.\n\nAs far as quality of playing and production, it's slick and spotless, without being overproduced or robotic. The production is crisp and clear, and every instrument stands out without being buried in the mix. Mario's drumming is punchy and tight, while Joe and Christian's guitar is loud and clear, without being distorted, too loud or muddled. Even Jean-Michel's bass is prominent, instead of being relegated to a faint low-end rumble like so many other bands. The compositions, while meticulously orchestrated, still flow quickly and easily. \n\nThe music follows a logical progression from the last album; the complexity has been scaled down somewhat, while rhythm has been emphasized. Taken at face value, the music may seem to be oversimplified. I was almost afraid that I'd be bored by this album, but upon repeated listens, the fine details of the music shine through. The opening track, Explosia, lives up to its name. It begins with a bombastic stop-start riff, trades into a similar fast chugging riff, and then ends with a slow, rhythmic section. The title track follows in a similar vein, but axes the longer rhythmic passage. Most of the songs focus on rhythm, not only in long breakdown-like passages, but in the riffs themselves. \n\nAll told, this is a very solid release from an excellent band. I was afraid that with their jump to a major label, there might have been a major compromise in their signature sound. These fears have been proven to be completely unfounded. My only real complaints is that a couple of the songs are a little bit formulaic or faceless (The Axe and Pain Is a Master) and that a few of the songs could have used a little bit of pruning (Explosia, The Axe, Planned Obsolesence for its long ambient outro) and parts of the album lack overall complexity or aggression. However, these should not discourage you from picking up the album or enjoying it. If anything, it retains a certain amount of freshness on repeated listens that some of their other albums lack. Enough of my word diarrhea; if you're a Gojira fan, get this album no questions asked. If you're just getting into Gojira, you may not want to start off with this album, as good as it is. Try From Mars to Sirius as a first listen instead.\n",
        "\nWhat a truly enjoyable album. The vocals sound great, from his chaotic bellows to his vicious shouts to his toned down talk-singing, it sounds perfect. One thing I would criticize though is a lot of the lyrics seem to make either no sense, have no flow or have no relativity to the previous verse. The singing and lyrics are a little scattered or seemingly misplaced at times, but they are carried through well with intense guitar riffs and technical rhythm and drumming. The instruments are absolutely mind-blowing, this albums technicality really made up for my disappointment of Meshuggah's new album, Koloss. If you felt that the aforementioned was a slap to the face, you should probably check L'Enfant Sauvage out. You can listen to this album over and over and never get tired of it.\n\nThis album has such amazingly strong staples on it such as Mouth of Kala and Born in Winter. Mouth of Kala is easily one of my new favourite songs, the second that drum crashes down in one fell strike as the song starts you know you\u2019re in for a treat. The intro and outro are so hypnotic you will have it stuck in your head for weeks. The guitar is so melodic and heavy, speaking of which, this album is a LOT more melodic than Gojira's previous releases. It sounds good though, nothing against it. A step in a different direction, but everyone does that eventually, and I support it. There are parts to this album where it becomes somewhat repetitive, especially one major repetition throughout the entire disc where they use this sort of very fast, soft, high pitched guitar riff every once and a while over top of their rhythm. It does get a little annoying sometimes since they do it on literally over half the songs. There is one very nice and relaxing instrumental halfway through the album that is very, very catchy, that is basically just this wild sounding loopy guitar riff with a pacing rhythm guitar following it and some keen soft drumming throughout. One of my favourite tracks off the album.\n\nI love this album, I LOVE their other releases as well but I find myself listening to this one far more than their others. A great album altogether, I don't see how anyone could be saddened after hearing this. Bonus: it only costed me $13, compared to most $20 new releases. I tip my hat to you French bastards; you guys sure do make good music.\n",
        "\nFrench musical phenomenon Gojira\u2019s second effort shows a slight upward momentum from their debut, Terra Incognita, and though it\u2019s still not nearly as compelling as the groundbreaking efforts they\u2019d be creating as early as their next release, The Link continues to establish the unique tendencies that Gojira would utilize to literally explode in pretty short order. Indeed, The Link is a good, if not great, listen that at this point serves more as a curiosity than a chunk of memorable tunes you\u2019ll want to repeat again and again. It feels tighter and more organized than its older brother, though, and is measurably more enjoyable.\n\nThe punishing, cyclical grooves are still the focus here, but there are some more expressive sections as well, some tremolo-picked, some atmospheric open chord, some almost tribal in essence, and these are where the record truly feels artistic. This variety of abstract weirdness counterbalances the reliance on the pounding of muted, Meshuggah-inspired rhythms, and this sort of warm, primal atmosphere, working in interesting conjunction with the cold, mechanistic gnashing that dominates these soundscapes, is what makes The Link interesting. I feel some latent Sepultura influence here, and this being the result of a hypothetical hybrid between them and Meshuggah, perhaps with a light suffusion of Tool, is not so far fetched, at least for this release. Joe Duplantier\u2019s vocals also feel like an admixture of Max Cavalera\u2019s gruff shouts and Jens Kidman\u2019s wilder, more gibbering style circa Contraddictions Collapse.\n\n\u2018The Link\u2019 displays these pervasive qualities right as it steps out of the portal, with an eerie cultish dissonance that immediately adds a strange, surreal nature to the rolling rhythms. \u2018Death of Me\u2019 lurches oddly in its choppy, lock-step grooves, which build from a bouncy Neanderthal stomp to a sheering wave of bright, strumming chords, and back again. Connected is a short sequence of light percussive notes that either originates from a Xylophone, or some kind of hollowed out wood, a calm before the storm of Remembrance, one of the best tracks here, channeling Sepultura aggression before breaking down into palm mutes and an odd sequence of boinging sounds. It\u2019s flanked by another short intermission, Torii, a calm oceanic guitar progression, leading into Indians, which feels oddly anemic, but is a touch more accessible than the rest. \n\nEmbrace the World is a lot of fun, exuding a very earthy, tribal feeling, like grim-faced, bare-footed shamans doing an enrapturing dance around a roaring fire, high on Ayahuaska, as the chanting voice that rises above the rhythms comes forth like a fire god, central to the stoned, mesmerizing proceedings, then disappearing into the smoke from whence it came. Inward Movement is an interesting journey with some really strong, dense riffs and a good progression of energy, flowing with both grim power and a feeling of melancholy. Over the Flows reprises the funky, Primus-like oddity that manifested as Satan Is a Lawyer last time around, and will in the future be sculpted into much more powerful aesthetics in songs like A Sight to Behold. Wisdom Comes is short and angry, with some hurried, vibrant notation to supplant the usual atonal chugging. The closing song, Dawn, is a lengthy, lightly progressive instrumental that saunters off into the sunset with a meandering grace, a fitting, if not entirely epic, conclusion.\n\nThe Link feels more cohesive than Terra Incognita, more skillful, intelligent, and purposeful. The grooves are a bit more complex, the riffing more soulful, and the general slant of the songwriting more mature. Though the majority of its time is spent carving out grooves in the forest floor, it also takes time to breathe, dancing under the stars or staring philosophically into the fire. Drummer Mario Duplantier especially shows a dynamic growth from his last performance, as he seems to do with every release, striking with mechanistic precision, while retaining a very human sense of creativity. The lyrics can be quite poetic and insightful at times (sometimes not so much), with lots of stark, simple statements that belie their innate wisdom, and this aspect continues to strengthen release by release. Spiritual outrage and personal development are strong themes here, though, a common thread for all Gojira material. The production is also improved slightly. In fact, everything is improved slightly, laying and strengthening the foundations for upcoming greatness.\n\nDespite the measure of growth and inherent memorability this exerts over its predecessor, however, I would not call The Link a great album. It is certainly more than acceptable, and conjures some very good ideas, but these ideas are simply not utilized to an extent as to entice me into repeating the performance very often. As I stated in my Terra Incognita review, the value here will be more intrinsic to the die-hard Gojira fan, who wants to inspect the building blocks for the towering spire of spiritual awesome they have become. Certainly, the spirit of Gojira, that special element of feeling persists here, alive and well, and I happen to know a lot of their fans like this album a great deal. I can certainly respect that, and I definitely would not want to dissuade you from checking it out, but for anyone not already familiar with these Frenchman, I\u2019d strongly recommend starting with one of the later albums, because at length, there is simply no reason to listen to this over its successors. The Link is good, but From Mars to Sirius, The Way of All Flesh, and L\u2019enfant Sauvage are amazing, so it sits in a very towering shadow. \n\n-Left Hand of Dog\nhttp://reaperdivision.blogspot.com/\n",
        "\nThis is the first tentative step on an incrementally improving spiral staircase of a career that has grown by leaps and bounds in recent years into one of the most important in the metal realm. Indeed, most of the defining elements of future groundbreaking Gojira releases like From Mars to Sirius and The Way of All Flesh are here in embryonic form, and though Terra Incognita is far from perfect, or even overly compelling or memorable, it contains enough inherent value to be worth a look from both fans of these innovative Frenchmen, and those who by nature enjoy crawling through the darker, heavier depths of groove-laden death metal.\n\nThere is a resounding mechanical darkness here, expressed through the pounding, cyclical slabs of notation, that even back in 2000 proved a strong counterpoint to the natural, philosophical slant of Gojira\u2019s blazing spirit. Some moments, like the oceanic tapping in 04, the plunking, bouncy, almost Primus-like funk of Satan Is a Lawyer, and the earthy, lumbering midsection of Deliverance are clear roots from which the distinguished, more avant-garde elements of their present releases have grown. Much of the record, however, is content to chug along in a variety of rhythmic patterning, some sections stronger than others, but with pretty consistent quality overall. I especially enjoy the dark, luminous riffing in Space Time, a nice contrast to the carving, pinch-harmonic sprinkled grooves, a dichotomy they would eventually perfect. A number of songs also provide clean, distinct, simmering choruses that are unmistakably evident as Gojira, even as we know them now, a true compliment.\n\nTruly, there are a number of good ideas and techniques that pepper this release, but they are not to a level of fruition that makes Terra Incognita a great record. Beyond a pretty fair handful of sections, it is not incredibly memorable, though to be fair, neither is it ever in any way bad, or even really average, as it certainly bears its own unique stamp. Certainly, if you desire this kind of plodding, mechanistic darkness in your metal, there is not a lot of quality material to choose from, and this is definitely far more interesting and talented than anything you\u2019ll find from a Fear Factory release around this period. Its mathematical, muscular pounding has more in common than Meshuggah than anyone else, another potential indicator of your enjoyment.\n\nIn the end, I don\u2019t think I will listen to Terra Incognita very often, as it\u2019s just so completely eclipsed and out-paced by its successors, but for a debut album of groove-laced death, it is both interesting and long on potential, the grooving tendrils that have encased my life of late already budding, if not lengthy enough to grab a firm hold. This will be of special worth and curiosity for huge Gojira fanatics though, like me, as it\u2019s an interesting history lesson in the evolution and basic biology of a band that\u2019s become so dynamic and important. If you fit into either one of these aforementioned categories, you should certainly hunt this down, though I\u2019d warn you not to be overly expectant, but if you\u2019ve already heard the bands newer, more popular releases, and count yourself unimpressed, there is no reason for you to visit this. For anyone new to this project, though, I\u2019d point you to the stunning The Way of All Flesh first and foremost, followed by From Mars to Sirius and L\u2019enfant Sauvage, all of them artful expressions of pure passion. Terra Incognita is a good effort, but it\u2019s so completely blown away by its siblings that at this point it\u2019s more interesting as a historical footnote than an endlessly listenable album.\n\n-Left Hand of Dog\nhttp://reaperdivision.blogspot.com/\n",
        "\n\"There is light in this world I fight for,\" one of the most powerful lines throughout the album (found at the title track @ ~1.50), one which Joe sings more enthusiastically than any other line. And there is light to find in this album, but you have to dig deep.\n\nI have personally been waiting for this album for just under 4 years since their previous effort; 'The Way of All Flesh.'And whilst that album changed the face of prog-death, their follow-up could not be more anticipated or openly appreciated once released. But, for such a well respected band like Gojira, could these expectations be met, or is the album just a fill-in for Roadrunner to release a more purchased and mediocre Trivium effort? \n\nTo interpret this album correctly, you must approach it with a neutral stance. No drooling fanboy bullshit that has engulfed the metal community for years (just look at my previous reviews: Chimara are shit, but I love them). So once you get past the fact that L'Enfant Sauvage has a avent-garde style cover (which the Duplantier brothers love) and is close enough to Elephant Sausage in english as you would get in metal, you find yourself listening to an almost-hour long effort, split up into 11 grueling tracks. The same problem arose with TBDM - too many songs. \"But too much of a good thing isn't bad for you, right?\"\n\nThe lead riff for almost every song has a fret slide, something that really gets on my nerve. It's not even like it balances throughout the song, anyway. Zakk Wylde uses his squeals more effectively in the song 'Addiction' by Dope - and they're everything that is wrong with metal. The riffs are catchy, but lack-luster; they hold little variation. And whilst it's important to use the same turning for every separate album, it's the same old fashioned open D tuning as every other album they churned out. If you listen to this album expecting amazing and life-changing guitar solos in an odd-time signature, you will be disappointed. And whilst the guitars sound off, almost purposefully, they fit the tone and experimentation of the album perfectly. Even just listening to 'Pain is a Master,' while the riff matches Joe's voice so perfectly, it's breathtaking. I mean that in the most metal-ly way. \n\nThe title track of the album so concisely matches the underlying theme of the album. And whilst this album is not a concept album, Joe gives a precise explanation to its message - even if it's nothing more than a ploy to sell more copies to industrial suckers for sap. But this track is an absolute standout, flawless in almost every way - if taken independently from the album as a whole. Mario's bell pierces the thick, rich bass riffs, whilst Joe's voice circulates a post-grunge style, similar to that of the new Decapitated. But the song does host the small issue of being boring as fuck. 10 seconds of build-up, going into a Gojira-style cliche riff with drum infused polyrhythms on the bell. This is more pointless than the minute build-up to 'The Art of Dying.' The song is fantastic in itself, but boring compared with the rest of the album. In fact, the whole album is boring. \n\nBut it's brilliant, a masterpiece. No, I'm not contradicting myself here. In the same way that Morbid Angel can put out a shitty effort that sounds good, Gojira can put out a good effort that sounds shit. There's nothing new in this album. No fantastic new concept style that will change the face of metal as we know it. Not even the auto tune in 'Liquid Fire' can change the style of Gojira. And thats how everyone likes it, its everything you want in a Gojira work. Its artsy, its mighty, it's boring, it's Gojira in its finest hour. You see, I've found the one thing that is wrong with this album - its originality. And that's the only thing wrong with this album. That's a good thing, because everything matches so perfectly otherwise. If you change the originality, you change Gojira, and then you get the same thing that happened to Metallica. It's called Trujillo-symptom. It's a good thing Gojira have a solid lineup.\n",
        "\nAfter their boring and plodding 2008 album, The Way of All Flesh, my expectations for this album weren't particularly high. After listening to \"L'Enfant Sauvage\" and \"Liquid Fire\", my hopes got a little higher. Then the full album was released and the album won me over. It seems as though Gojira have learned from past mistakes, and all the experimentation it took to reach this point was well worth it. Gojira's sound on this album shows that they are maturing in a way that is both intelligent and natural. \n\nThe first major difference between The Way of All Flesh and this album is that Gojira have managed to create song structures that are shorter and less plodding. Gojira are good song writers, but shorter song lengths are an advantage for them here. The songs on The Way of All Flesh felt like they were simply wasting your time. The amount of transitions wasn't enough to keep the music interesting, and the songs just kept going far too long. Not only that, but when Gojira did something on that album which was really good, they had a transition to material that was absolute boredom. The fact that Gojira have kept themselves distant from their fatal flaws on the 2008 album makes their maturity as musicians easily visible. \n\nThe album itself is well structured as well. An interlude is found in the form of \"The Wild Healer\" and is actually very well placed. The song helps keep the album from droning on. Another key factor about this album is that the songs are varied. The shorter song length coupled with the numerous transitions in each song helps keep the album interesting. The songs on here aren't aiming for speed, but the instruments help keep the pace going and don't allow the songs to become too slow. \n\nAnother major standout quality on this album is the guitar work. Gojira really plays around with the solid guitar tone they utilize. The combination of the grooves they write and the guitar tone makes for some really enjoyable moments. The opening to \"Explosia\" has a riff that is as groovy as it is heavy. \n\nA quality of this album which might bother some people is the vocal effects. There are moments throughout the album where Joe Duplantier sounds a bit robotic, but this isn't a major annoyance for me. The effects are used well, and don't show up too much. Speaking of Joe Duplantier, his vocals on this album don't hold back at all. His vocal style is easily recognizable among the metal community for its power and tone. \n\nThis is the Gojira album which has the most highlight moments for me. The opening to \"Explosia\" is fun to listen to numerous times in a row. \"L'Enfant Sauvage\" switches from soft to heavy material. \"Liquid Fire\" uses some entertaining vocal effects. \"The Wild Healer\" is a tranquil interlude with an upbeat sound. \"Mouth of Kala\" has a ferocious and powerful chorus. \"The Gift of Guilt\" has a building guitar riff which is used for the chorus and adds to the epic feel of the track. \"Born In Winter\" start out slowly, then becomes heavier and makes room for some excellent guitar work. \"The Fall\" is an eerie song which also uses vocal effects at times, and is the perfect closing track for the album. \n\nAre there some boring moments on this album? There are a few, but they are kept very brief. \"The Axe\" is the least interesting song on here, but still manages to give the listener some elements that spark their interest. The album has enough well-made music on here to make the album worth the buy, and each song has its own personality. Is it the best Gojira album to date? In my opinion, it is. The level of maturity on this album is superior to all of their past material. I am thoroughly impressed to see the leap from The Way of All Flesh to this. For Gojira fans, the four year wait was well worth it, and because of this album, my hopes for the band have increased tenfold.\n",
        "\nEasily one of my most anticipated releases this year, Gojira's fourth album comes at a point in which the French band's star couldn't possibly be rising along a steeper incline. Strong label support from the cold/hot Roadrunner, doubtlessly huge touring plans, a backlog which has only progressed in quality since the 2001 debut Terra Incognita, and an audience which seems to transcend any particular pigeonhole into which you might place it, they've got the chops and support to become one of the premiere 'groove' metal icons in the world. L'Enfant Sauvage is not likely to disappoint anyone with a strong connection to the past releases, and proves a pleasurable listen of some depth through numerous spins.\n\nThat's not to say it's a masterwork, or even that it surpasses From Mars to Sirius or The Way of All Flesh in quality, because for the first time in the band's chronology, I feel like we're faced with an album that does not progress from its predecessor in any blatant, meaningful way. The post-hardcore inflected rhythm guitar chugging, perky emotional tremolo or tapped melodies, expressive percussion and gruff vocals all return are by now all par for the course on a Gojira record, and the patterns proposed here do not carve themselves a new path through their sonic framework. If there's one exception, it might be the sheer atmosphere evinced through a tighter, more compacted space than The Ways of All Flesh. This is a shorter album, with only the opener \"Explosia\" eclipsing six minutes, and the Frenchmen manage to effectively exhibit mood and tone with no need for rampant technicality or undue complexity, while retaining the same modernist aesthetic in the riffs and lyrics which broke them out from the depths of the underground.\n\nWhere I enjoy this band the most is in their ability to communicate a hybrid of psychedelic and mechanical emotions through the hypnotic structure of the note progressions, and L'Enfant Sauvage has not let me down in this regard. The way the lush tapping repetition in instrumental \"The Wild Healer\" plays off the sludgier rhythm guitar, ringing ambiance and lightly distorted bass is so beautiful I wanted it to go on forever (it's not even 2 minutes long), while the denser chugging and harmonic sweeps of cuts like \"Planned Obsolescence\" build to an efficacious battering ram of headbanging payout. The vocal arrangements here are enormous and inspired, almost as if one were experiencing a robotic, post-metal Pink Floyd on \"Liquid Fire\"; and the use of cleaner guitars throughout the record (\"Pain is a Master\", etc) do not derail from its numbing convocations of wrenched violence and fragile melody.\n\nProduction and performance are two huge factors for Gojira, and the former is sleek and potent here which is truly key to the band's simplistic, palm-muted calculations. Without the strong mix, recorded in New York and assisted by Josh Wilbur (who has also worked with the popular Lamb of God), such a tactic might not yield such a penetration in the listener's skull. Everything is as clear as day, yet as heavy as nightfall. Mario Duplantier's beats are never showy or overly indulgent, but surprisingly organic considering just how damn mechanical the overall writing can often seem. As usual, I love Joe's vocals for their unique timbre, whether jarring and hoarse or ascending to some wistful, fulfilling harmony. Always, he sounds like an internal monolog being cyphered through the listener, one of great pain and joy and volume.\n\nIf anything holds L'Enfant Sauvage back, it's that the actual structures of the riffs here just don't seem all that novel or wholly consistent in their compulsion. Individually, the very stripped down note sequences don't hold a lot of replay value, so without the vocals, drumming and full, ooze of the bass, they might seem a bit undercooked. The band lacks the benefit of surprise here, and there are few songs quite at the level of an \"Oroborus\" or \"Ocean Planet\" in breadth of power. But that said, I've still been enjoying the heck out of this thing, despite its failure to set any new bars. It's a case where the phrase 'more of the same' doesn't equate with a negative resonance, and Gojira's balance of crushing and subtlety still shakes my teeth.\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nWith the new Gojira album coming out next month, I'll take the time to review their latest effort. The first time I listened to \"The Way of All Flesh\", my conclusion was that overall it's definitely a heavier record than its predecessor \"From Mars to Sirius\". At first, I didn't know for sure whether that was a good thing. Sometimes bands lose themselves in trying to be as 'brutal' as possible while they should actually be writing good metal songs. After I gave the record a couple of plays, I found out that Gojira isn't one of those bands. I think this is one of their best albums so far. \n\nIt seems that Gojira wanted to go into a heavier direction with this album. After their debut album which was pretty death metal-ish, the band has been experimenting with a more ambient kind of sound, but on this album their death metal and sometimes even groove metal style really dominates. It's a modern metal record with experimental aspects such as the highly-effected vocals on 'A Sight To Behold' and the tribe-like intro to 'The Art of Dying'.\n\nThe riffs on this record are pretty innovative from time to time. The famous signature Gojira-pickslide can be heard on several of these riffs. I was most impressed by riffs like the intro riff of 'Oroborus' and the riff at the bridge of 'Wolf Down the Earth'. I am already used to the lack of solos in Gojira's tracks so I won't bitch to much about that, but I do feel urged to say even some simple solos would surely spice up some of the songs on the album. Most of the songs work out well without solos though, as it has become part of Gojira's style. The aggressive style of bass player Jean-Michel Labadie makes the riffs sound even better. Thank god the bass player isn't too low in the mix.\n\nOf course, Mario Duplantier, the band's drummer, also deserves some serious praise for his work shown on this album. I think Mario has become the real star of Gojira. His drumming absolutely defines the way the band sounds and besides that it's also of an extremely high technical level as far as I know (I'm not a drummer). The way he hits the bell of his ride cymbal in his drum fills is just awesome. Amazing double-bass stuff can be heard on songs like 'Toxic Garbage Island'. I do wonder however how much he relies on triggers. I've heard some people say that he even triggers his toms. Even if that were true, Mario does a great job on this album and showcases his mind-boggling drum skills.\n\nVocalist and guitarist Joe Duplantier wrote all the lyrics for this album, though Randy Blythe of Lamb of God helped him write the lyrics to 'Adoration For None', who does a great job collaborating with the French death metallers on this track. The main themes throughout the record are contamination and the foolishness of mankind. I think Joe does a great job here. Too bad some lines are more carefully written than others on the album. For instance, on the outro of 'Toxic Garbage Island' he repeatedly screams \"Plastic bag in the sea!!!\". I found it a somewhat uninspired line but yet very 'to-the-point'. Maybe he just wrote it that way to get the crowd to scream along at live shows. But lyrics like the ones on 'A Sight to Behold' are very well-written, with lines like \"We all behave like children, taking off the head of our teddy bear to see what's inside, taking, not giving back\".\n\nThe album's production is crystal clear, which is very important for this kind of music. Whereas the studio material of some other death metal bands sounds kind of messy, Gojira sounds extremely well on 'The Way of All Flesh'. The guitars sound raw, not too much distortion and neither too much compression. The drums are great. Joe's vocals are loud enough but don't overrule the rest of the band. And as mentioned before, the bass guitar is loud enough to be heard clearly.\n\nThis album is just kickass. For me it's even one of the greatest death metal albums of the 21st century. Give this disc the time to grow on you though, I also needed to listen to it a couple of times before fully understanding how awesome it is.\n",
        "\nAs with many others who have since become fans of Gojira, I was first introduced to this French extreme metal band through their third album 'From Mars To Sirius', which sounded very fresh at a time when metal was feeling all but a little too generic and tired. Instead of continue down the path they had developed with the third album however, Gojira decided to do what any truly great band; to reinvent themselves once again, while retaining their core elements. The final result is 'The Way Of All Flesh', a more challenging listen than its predecessor, more technical, and more dissonant. While it's clear from the beginning that the album demands a greater attention than 'From Mars To Sirius', it is also clear that this is the most profound musical achievement the band has created to date.\n\nLacking any atmospheric or mellow introduction to ease the listener into the album, 'Ouroboros' starts with a memorable and technical riff over the meticulous and complex drumming of percussionist extraordinaire Mario Duplantier. From this first song onwards, there are still familiar sounds for Gojira; the crushingly heavy guitars, distinctive growls, and a lyrical gravitation towards environmental plights. 'The Way Of All Flesh' takes a greater sense of distinction with the next two tracks however, bringing the music to the brink of technical dissonance, and odd electronic melodies, respectively.\n\nTowards the middle of the album are quite a few tracks that would have easily fit in 'From Mars To Sirius', and are quite a bit less memorable than the songs that really show the band experimenting with their sound. However, although leaving quite a bit less of an impression, these are far from filler pieces. 'The Silver Cord' is a relatively sludgy, but mellow interlude piece, leading into two tracks of technicality and heaviness. The album's highlight then takes the form of the ten minute piece 'The Art Of Dying', which begins with a highly distinctive, meditative drum introduction that slowly builds with each repetition, bringing the listener to a feeling of great tension, regardless of how many times it's already been listened to. Then, just as a listener begins to be lulled into a sense of security, the guitars kick in, destroying the sense of tribal serenity with rhythmic experimentation and heaviness typically associated with Meshuggah.\n\nSomething besides the added heavy aspects of 'The Way Of All Flesh' that makes it a unique piece of work is the addition of atmospheric leitmotifs that appear throughout the album, towards the end of a few songs. These can either take the form of space electronic vibrations, or a sombre guitar picking played in reverse. In any case, while the couple of small mellow sections are used quite a few times, they only get more beautiful and introspective with time.\n\nAlthough with a topic and subject matter slightly less gripping than the fantasy-leanings of 'The Way Of All Flesh', this album's darker and more experimental feel all contribute to give Gojira's first legitimate masterpiece in their careers.\n",
        "\nWithout a doubt one of the heaviest metal bands in the progressive scene nowadays, France's premier extreme quartet Gojira's real breakthrough was this album; the conceptually geared 'From Mars To Sirius'. Drawing inspiration and their topic of interest from the looming modern problem of ecological preservation, Gojira has developed their death metal sound into something with a much grander scope. While the band's next release 'The Way Of All Flesh' would improve and further develop upon the sound of Gojira, 'From Mars To Sirius' stands as being a landmark in French metal, and will be for decades to come.\n\nWhile the crushing guitar and rhythm sound here could be compared to the tumultuous origins of the universe, Gojira manages to harness such a ferocious sound and channel it into something that is moreoften memorable and impressive than not. With the opening behemoth 'Ocean Planet' showing little hesitation to jump into the trademark primordial riffage that drives throughout most of the album. To give a much fresher sound to the music however, there are plenty of more moderate moments, and atmospheric soundscapes behind the main work, that give 'From Mars To Sirius' a stylistic similarity to some of Devin Townsend (of Strapping Young Lad)'s career work.\n\nDealing with a profound real-world topic through some aspects of fantasy, Gojira's sludgy take on 'From Mars To Sirius' is filled with small details in the production, but is quite straightfoward in terms of it's sound and uniformity, especially when compared to things Gojira have achieved after this point. While the style is done very well, some tricks (such as making the guitar squeal in between breakdowns) are a bit overdone. The songwriting here and delivery are still for the most part, quite excellent. Despite being quite inventive with the way they craft the music, there are still many songs that fit the anger and call for change into as little as five minutes. \n\nAs has been said before, the album does sound quite similar throughout, giving the album a nice flow, although some unexpected moments of variety would have been the strong songwriting here even better. The only song that does not stand out as being excellent is 'In The Wilderness,' which while engaging enough, lacks any ideas that distinguish it as a song of it's own. However, this album from the French death metallers is surprisingly consistent, and with time, I would imagine that popular appreciation for this piece will only serve to grow in the metal community.\n",
        "\nFirst of all, let me set the record straight. Many have compared Gojira to Meshuggah and I think that's not accurate. Sure I guess in the same heavy experimental odd time signatures and bizarre chord using way, you could call them similar. However what this album demonstrates is how far apart the two bands are and given time listening to this album, you forget about Meshuggah all together.\n\nThis is not metal for the simple minded and one quick listen won't do it justice. Gojira fans will be expecting this complexity and they will also tell you that's exactly what they love about them. Some bands chug along but Gojira kind of stutter along. This sounds quite bad but it's this stuttering that makes them so unique. Previous albums have impressed me but I think this album is where they really hit their straps. There is something about The Way Of All Flesh that is so familiar yet so fresh at the same time that after 30 or 40 listens you're still not bored.\n\n\"Oroborus\" is an unusual opener. It starts with a strange riff of hammer-ons and pick-offs which sets the scene for the entire album because you know you're not going to listen to a straight forward metal album. Many songs from other bands have several ideas that change and progress as the song goes on. Yet on this track it seems Gojira have done the opposite, in fact keeping the same idea and vibe then adding and taking away from it. It's a technique Gojira has used many times before but I think this could well be the archetypal track.\n\nThey back up the incredible opener with \"Toxic Garbage Island\" which starts out with the stuttering along that I described earlier. That is until it gets to a moment of sheer power with the chorus. At mezzo tempo and with Joe growling \"Pain is killing me\", it's one of the highlight moments of the album. The whole track has a painful feel to it which seems to reinforce their deep belief in enviromental issues.\n\nThe album continues with many awesome tracks until it gets to \"The Art Of Dying\". This track is probably one of my favourite songs of 2008. Starting with a \"The Link\" feel of a deep groan underlining the snare tapping, it builds and builds until it explodes into a melee of drums bass and guitar fighting against each other until the drums bring it all together with a pounding beat. There are several breakdowns and change of directions in the song. The most notable is the second and final breakdown after which one of the most epic riffs of the 00's starts. It's so good they repeat it for nearly 3 minutes straight but it never gets boring. You can't help but bang your head everytime you hear it.\n\nIt's an all round incredible effort from the Frenchmen and I hope it's not a carrer peak. I'd like to see them get better and better with every release. I think they have it in them because even though all albums have common themes, no two are alike and that makes a perfect band. One that can release quality after quality.\n",
        "\nTo most people who take an interest in metal, the story here should be pretty clear: when it comes down to it, as varied and innovative as it may be, the driving force behind the identity of French metal is Gojira. Although not as extreme as some of the country\u2019s more underground exports, they are without doubt France\u2019s biggest international offering, thanks due largely to 2005\u2019s brilliant \u2018From Mars to Sirius\u2019, which is generally considered to be the album that catapulted them to such recognition and acclaim.\n\nTo establish what we all may have suspected anyway, the follow up album, 2009\u2019s \u2018The Way of All Flesh\u2019 is easily inferior to \u2018From Mars to Sirius\u2019. It is still a display of the bizarre mix of \u201ctechnical simplicity\u201d that has defined their previous releases, but it lacks the progressive edge that made their other CD\u2019s feel fresh and different. \u2018Oroborous\u2019, the opener, reflects these sentiments entirely. There is a nice, moody groove that forms the backbone to the track, but Gojira don\u2019t experiment enough with these foundations to make them catchy and interesting. Between the little hooks in the song, there really isn\u2019t that much going on, and it doesn\u2019t take long to feel that the song is beginning to outstay its welcome (which, at under 4 minutes, isn\u2019t all that impressive).\n\n\u2018Toxic Garbage Island\u2019 follows in a similar vein, although the musicianship and songwriting is slightly improved in that there a few more crunchy (and, at times, pleasing) riffs being thrown around here and there to make it that little bit harder for attention to wane, and the final salvos of \u2018PLASTIIIIIC! BAG IN THE SEAAAAAAAAA!\u201d are definite live crowd pleasers, but there is an explorative depth that is tangibly missing, and it becomes obvious pretty quickly, and unfortunately, this is a rinse and repeat formula for the majority of this CD.\n\nOf course, because of the bands\u2019 musicianship and ability, and the fact that they happed to be, y\u2019know, Gojira, nothing they release is ever going to be totally bad. There are some moments of interest on \u2018The Way of All Flesh\u2019, some of which come close to harking back to previous albums. Aside from the needless inclusion of that retard Randy Blythe on \u2018Adoration for None\u2019, the latter half of the album is decent. \u2018The Art of Dying\u2019 is by far the most interesting song to be found here, with a weird, almost aboriginal intro that works its way into a song that finally carries some impact with it, while \u2018Esoteric Surgery\u2019 is full of the odd little syncopations that somehow make sense that have become a trademark of the Gojira style over the past few releases. \n\nFrustratingly, however, even the good bits are followed by some really crappy tracks that have somehow managed to tag along for the ride, the heavy as fuck but ultimately one dimensional \u2018Vacuity\u2019 coming across as pretty laboured and disinterested, through to the instantly forgettable and boring title track, which feels suspiciously like one big \u201ceasy option\u201d track: a bit of double bass here, some chugging there, a slow and semi-ethereal bit here, and there it is. Gojira have proven themselves already, and so we know that songs like this fall way within their musical scope, which is why the album ends on a distinctively low note (no pun intended).\n\nThe problem (unlike with some other bands) isn\u2019t that they have progressed in the wrong direction, it\u2019s that they have cut the progressive element out of their music, which has now proved to be vital to their songwriting if this style is going to work properly. Without it, everything is just a bit too comfortable. This could easily play in the background to someone\u2019s house party, and hardly anyone would find many moments that would prompt them to ask \u201cFucking hell, who is this?!\u201d It\u2019s still the same Gojira, but they have cut a few corners to make this album. If you\u2019re an avid fan and must have everything the band own, then don\u2019t listen to me, you\u2019ll get this anyway. If you don\u2019t know Gojira and want to explore them a bit more, then this almost definitely is NOT the place to start.\n",
        "\nFor their third act, the French mod metal squad Gojira aspired to make a mountain out of a molehill. From Mars to Sirius goes beyond aspiration to accomplishment, quashing their previous efforts like a landslide, so hard that rubble continues to pour onto The Link's face long past the original, explosive tremors. This is a dense and effective offering which transformed a band that was a mere curiosity into a massive, touring force and one that many journalists and hipsters acclaim to be 'the future of metal'. We've heard this expression before and it almost always peters out in the end, but one cannot deny the increasing success experienced by this band.\n\nAnd it's just impossible to deny. By the end of the first track, \"Ocean Planet\", the band has already crushed all of their prior songwriting. Bold, accessible and yet dusted in flecks of industrial rust and grime, the track functions off an alternating discordant groove akin to something Voivod might have crafted on their Negatron album (in particular the breakdown at 2:00), but blocky, mechanical and uniquely graceful. It's like a chunk of factory gaining sentience and operating itself, yet adorned in the bands pseudo-universal 'life peace love Earth' sentimentality. \"Backbone\" constructs an appropriate chug which reminded me of the rhythm to Primus' \"Toys Go Winding Down\", albeit glazed in industrial rock and Joe Duplantier's carnal multi-faceted throating. The song experiences a beautiful shift towards sombering melodic death metal at its own 2:00 mark, immediately an album favorite. \"From the Sky\" continues this trend with a barrage of fundamental grooving death metal and chugging fortitude, both barrels rolling forward towards a beautiful climax. \"Unicorn\" is another of the band's frequent interludes, this one's shining harmonics and tranquil beat winning out over the namesake.\n\nThis flight into deceptive fantasy continues with \"Where Dragons Dwell\", a winding passage of bass floes and chugging excess at the end of its cavernous melodies. The ambient break is very cool, transforming into another huge bottom end riff, which leads the track through its final pacing before \"The Heaviest Matter of the Universe\" explodes like a galactic genesis, which a flattening groove which will have you either twitching and banging your head like a goddamn automaton or throwing your hat in about how horrible this band must be for its ability to create such a convincing, simplistic slaughter. \"Flying Whales\" features whale song samples and melancholic clean guitars that slowly propel into another stompfest, and you can almost close your eyes to imagine the travails of such a figurative beast as it navigates the phlogiston between worlds and realities. \"In the Wilderness\" follows with more desolate crunching barbarity, as if the 'wilderness' of the title were in fact a post-apocalyptic scene, retired metal hulls stretching the horizon as we celebrate the waste of our passing.\n\n'Trees so strong, that they never can fall\nFour suns alight, in silver grey sky\nWild river flows, with rage alive\nLions of fire approach me'\n\nSuch stark and baleful imagery translates entirely too well into the plodding, slugging murder fest of the bands rhythmic guts, ever rising forth from the primordial elixir with a strong melodic surge that balances them back to the more accessible, impatient ear. From here, the crawling cosmic blues of \"World to Come\", and the brief, distant, half-titled prog piece \"From Mars\", which feels like a bit of Floyd-ian paving across the band's crushing path, offering a respite before the melee that is \"To Sirius\", a sequence of colossal grooves against the black border of interspace. \"Global Warming\" returns the band to its love for the guitar tapped rhythm, a slight sliver of foreshadowing towards the album that would follow this. The track is lovely, even as it digresses into another of the bands lumbering juggernaut riffs, and a gentle end.\n\nFrom Mars to Sirius is one of those albums with the transient ability to 'grow'. As easily accessed as it was upon release, I have found the years nothing but kind to its wiles, and I rank this now far higher than I ever would have in 2005. A beautiful, winged thing has emerged from its larval stage within the creative cortex of these four Frenchmen, and we are all the richer for its presence, trailing stardust and inspiration upon the potential found in the cauled corners of our beloved medium. Like the massive waves swelling across Tokyo Bay, Gojira has finally arrived.\n\nHighlights: Both the liftoff and the landing.\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nI will never for the life of me understand why a band with only two albums under its belt is releasing an official live recording, but I suppose if I looked back far enough into the past I might find some successful evidence that such an anomaly was possible. The Link Alive is the live audio recording which matches the previous year's DVD release, with the exact same track listing (only a 10 second difference on the opening instrumental track). Whether this is an earnest offering from the band or label I have no idea, but I do know that one is far better off spending his/her money on the DVD itself, which at least features videos and other material. This audio only version, The Link Alive, is a waste of time, and should have been included as a bonus to the DVD itself. But as it stands, it's only a very limited run release...for the truest of fans, so the band can be partially excused for its existence.\n\nAs far as the sound, well it sounds quite close to the band's first two studio albums, culling a fair amount of material from both. I doubt this is quite so hard, for though I love Mario's drumming, the music the band performs is extremely simplistic, and it would be a sad day if they could not pull it off as clean as possible in the live setting. The vocals are good and rough and loud here, but you can still make out all the thick bass and the ringing of the band's more pensive guitar riffing, circulating the chugging beast within. I can imagine that the mosh pits at a Gojira would be quite strange, I picture a bunch of strange Frenchmen in checkered pants and bunny costumes diving and decking one another to the violent jerking of the band's almost menstrual rhythms.\n\nAt any rate, this is a healthy cross-offering from the band's demos and earliest full-lengths. From Terra Incognita, you have \"Clone\", \"Blow Me Away You (Niverse)\", \"Space Time\", \"Lizard Skin\", \"In the Forest\", \"Love\", while The Link is represented with the title track, \"Death of Me\", \"Connected\", \"Remembrance\", \"Indians\", \"Embrace the World\", \"Inward Movement\", and the reconditioned demo track \"Wisdom Comes.\" The one track I didn't recognize was the instrumental \"Terra Incognita\", but it's little more than a jammy set-up for \"Indians\" without much memorable to report.\n\nThe Link Alive is a vibrant enough recording that seems ample evidence of the band's ability to put on a tight performance, but I can't think of any reason I would track it down or choose any of these versions above their studio counterparts. Sure, the chugs are a little more pronounced, and you can hear a little less of the studio mechanism and a little crowd participation, but the songs I didn't care for before are no better in this setting and it's just another quickly forgotten exchange not worth the 75 minute investment when so much else vies for your attention.\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nWhere the debut Terra Incognita might have struggled a little in terms of finding an identity, and understandably so, as half the album consisted of re-recorded demo material; The Link is a far more coherent expression of the French band's surreal, atmospheric grooving that falls somewhere between the realms of Neurosis, Prong, Tool, Voivod and Meshuggah without any clear re-iteration of the above. A spacious effort, hardly immediate, it continues to tread upon the mechanical nature of its predecessor, but lacks much of that album's sterility and confusion. Make no mistake, the sounds of The Link can grate upon the soul. Some of its lumbering, muted rhythms feel like an emptiness spread throughout the being, a tinge of paralysis that begins at the fingertips and scalp and then crawls through the capillaries into the organs of importance.\n\nYes, this is probably the 'coldest' of the band's full-lengths, but cold through the vistas it explores, where the only fractions of warmth must be earned. \"The Link\" is an early indicator that Mario Duplantier will be continuing to enthrall through his use of wood blocks and other unexpected percussion within the album's bouncing post-metal groove, like you were hearing some refined alternative to Sepultura's Roots, raised on paint thinner, with none of that album's shitty guitar grunting. Joe sticks to his better, tormented vocals, starting at the Roots Cavalera range (or Tommy Victor's sewer-scarred throat) and then howling off into a much more welcoming arena where they traipse like an aurora across the nightline. \"Death of Me\" see-saws like a pair of rusted golems, splattering itself in grimy death metal breaks and winding down like a mechanized toy that is slowly expending its battery juices in a final ballet. \"Connected\" is a sweet percussion piece, while \"Remembrance\" sears across a skillet of post-hardcore drone and bludgeoning old chug warfare.\n\n\"Torii\" is a peaceful instrumental piece, like a tone poem of scintillating clean guitars and random sound effects that flows quite naturally into the vibrant downtrodden chug of \"Indians\". Sadly this is one of the most boring tracks on the album, and I have no idea why it was chosen for a single...once you've heard the first 30-60 seconds, there is little to anticipate, and even the mathematical groove bridge does little to light the blood afire. Far better is the factory-line melody of \"Embrace the World\" (I loved the feel of the bass backing it up), which surges into spasms of noisy grind and crunch. \"Inward Movement\" is slow, like carefully processing bowels that wish to neatly package their contents for excretion, with a subtle architecture of flagellant noise and dense groove seeking to undulate the intestinal process.\n\n'The land beyond is deep within\nI took the path & I cannot go back\nI've just connected myself with I\nbut I don't me that well as you see'\n\nTrippy enough lyrics, though again, a rather boring song. \"Over the Flows\" is the weird, somewhat out of place song to supplant \"Satan is a Lawyer\" from the debut, but it's also quite a bit more mesmerizing, with sparse, cyclic moments of nauseous momentum and vocals that hiss off into a field of distortion. \"Wisdom Comes\" arrives like a brick through a window, and might be the worst song on this album, being the one thing here reprinted from the demo days. As forgettable as much of the songs squealing, dull death metal qualities are, there is the one bristling riff within at :40 which develops nicely before it transforms into awful chug grooving that you'd expect from any neighborhood metalcore band. The finale is an instrumental, experimental pattern of breathing guitar work ruptured through turbulent grooves, called simply \"Dawn\", and while fascinating in spots, it doesn't provide for many of the album's better moments.\n\nThe Link is a step up the ladder for a band on their rise to the stars, but it's a step suffused with some minor pitfalls which make for inconsistent listening. Most of the tracks are worthwhile, and the overall sound is fused together far more than the debut, but those few that are not land the album at a level just above average. Really, with the imminent existence of From Mars to Sirius and The Way of All Flesh, this is not something you'd ever reach towards for a fix of Gojira. But it's their first successful recording, speaking reams of potential if not engraving itself deep enough into your cortex for immediate reflection.\n\nHighlights: Death of Me, Connected, Embrace the World, Torii\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nWith its rather unassuming cover art (I like to refer to it as 'The Nose'...look closely), the debut of French Gojira might give the impression that it was any of a million typical alt rock or alt metal albums released by countless forgettable bands in the 90s. But the music contained within Terra Incognita, 14 tracks, half of which are culled from the band's Saturate and Wisdom Comes demos (1999-2000), is often not a great distance from their more recent material ala The Way of All Flesh. Combining accessible, mechanical grooves into the field of more intense death metal is not a trait often welcomed within the genre, and to be sure, Gojira have their lovers and haters like any other band that sticks their neck out and begs to be just a little different.\n\nTerra Incognita might be the band's first and worst effort, but that's saying a lot for the French band. Even on this formative release, which occasionally lacks the distinctness of its younger siblings, there are still a few good songs and ideas. With a sound culled from influences like Meshuggah, Sepultura, Carcass, Kong, Machine Head, and perhaps a little Prong, the band has a lot of modern, arguably nu-metal mosh to them that can often distract from their heightened sense of riffing, but occasionally even these LCD grooves can stun the listener straight into submission with their effortless precision. Although the band's musical skills were already well honed by this point, I am not a major fan of Joe Duplantier's vocals on many of the tracks, which feel like a rather ho-hum mesh of grunts and snarling, like a modern Carcass with little visceral splash.\n\n\"Clone\" showcases the band's love for tapping rhythms, something they continue to this day (on a number of Way of All Flesh tracks), and this is sadly the most interesting riff of the song. The rest of the track consists of big, mid-period Sepultura-like mosh/thrash, rolling double bass and not much in the way of a hook, not even the Prong-like riff at 2:00 with the squeal is enticing. They lead off \"Lizard Skin\" with a decent droning guitar rhythm, then break for a more mathematical chug-off akin to Meshuggah. \"Satan is a Lawyer\" introduces goofy, clean vocals over lightly distorted, almost funk-rock guitar rhythms, all of which are rather garbage until the band busts out the speed-picked neo-thrash rhythm at around 2:40. \"04\" is an interlude piece with more tapping mayhem, while \"Blow Me Away You (niverse)\" lurches with some sagging groove rhythms but finally picks up a little near the end.\n\nI'm not a huge fan of that entire chunk of album, but after comes fascinating second interlude, \" 5988 Trillions De Tonnes\" formed of ambient swells and raggedy tribal percussion, which precedes \"Deliverance\", which opens with some thrash-u-puncture and grating and groove-laden death. \"Space Time\" is one of the strongest tracks on the album, with strong and curious drumming courtesy of Mario Duplantier, and Joe using his more identifiable, hoarse, angsty vocals. \"On the B.O.T.A.\" emits some nutty tapping and a fusion-funk atmosphere, while \"Rise\" has an incredibly dense and sick verse rhythm, among some less interesting, chug chunks and then transforms back into the natural 'rain forest' percussive interlude of \"5988 Trillions...\".\n\nThe final stretch of Terra Incognito begins with the thunderous, low-end churn of \"Fire is Everything\", which devolves into a dull, minimal chug-a-long before taking the high road with a nice vocal/groove segment, only then to fall once more into another, sluggish, not very interesting riff that crashes into the closing patter of electronic rain. \"Love\" builds a rolling artillery in the verse, then crashing around your mind with some atmosphere before it erupts into a very Meshuggah breakdown interspersed with great percussive strikes. \"1990 Quatrillions de Tonnes\" uses somber, cleaner guitars and samples of vocal torment along a steady rock beat, like a river winding into Pandemonium and picking up echoes of the insanity beyond. The 'closer' to the album, \"In the Forest\" is another of its best tracks, building a feel reminiscent of the Dutch band Kong before the vocals, and then some very forceful palm muted rhythms that chug into the silence beyond...until a hidden instrumental track pops up for a brief spell.\n\nI was not a huge fan of this album at the time, and even listening back to it today, it feels dated and more than a little sterile. They were merely a curiosity in 2000, another band that dared walk the ground of a Prong or Meshuggah but with less interesting songs than the former and little of the machine-like hostility of the latter (i.e. an album like Chaosphere). Since the band have taken off, being booked on huge tours and profiting from a large degree of buzz, they've matured considerably. For that reason, I'd suggest any of their later full-length offerings above this, and delegate Terra Incognita to those fans who want to listen to the band's 'demo' phase, where the soil was fertile with a crop of dynamic intentions, but the early harvest was simply not the best of eats.\n\nHighlights: Space Time, In the Forest\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nGojira's popularity exploded over the past couple of years, and after many recommendations I've checked them out time after time. The several attempts to get \"into\" them failed, both with their 2005 breakthrough album and this one, but I suppose the answer is that there isn't much to get into in the first place.\n\nWhat you basically get here is a modern, slightly industrial groove metal extravaganza with the occasional random technical break. It mostly dwells around in mid-pace without any direction, and the songs suffer horribly from overly repeated riffs and the awkward twists and turns of when they try to become a poor mans Meshuggah. The musicians in the band, especially the drummer, obviously has skills. But technical talent alone falls flat on its ass when the final songwriting result lacks both direction and structure.\n\nTo make it further worse, vocals are possibly even weaker than on breakthrough album \"From Mars To Sirius\". A -coreish bark that is just kind of \"there\", without any aggression, is coupled with equally vapid clean vocals. There are some really annoying moments that make no sense, kinda like the intro in \"A Sight To Behold\". Weird overly effected vocals that sounds like they're coming straight of a Pain song. In the best absolute best parts the vocals sound like mid 90's Hypocrisy, which isn't exactly good either, but mostly it consists of the aforementioned bark.\n\nThere is really nothing redeeming about Gojira. Superlatives like \"epic\" is just the opposite of how this sounds. More than anything it's rock based and awkward sounding, often bordering on annoying. If you want good extreme metal from France, check out Benighted and/or Kronos and forget ever hearing about this band.\n",
        "\nOne of the more interesting bands to emerge from France in the past decade, Gojira return with their fourth album, a stunning work of hypnotic, grooving metal which I simply cannot get enough of. This is a pretty unique band, and they've gotten more so as they've progressed, but if I had to compare this to anyone I'd say it occupies a middle ground between Neurosis, Meshuggah and Prong. You could call it post-metal or post-hardcore and probably be just as accurate, but I am not writing a dissertation on scene semantics, so let's cut to the album itself.\n\nThe Way of All Flesh has a masterful mix, in fact it's the best mix I've heard this year. Amazing guitar tone, plodding bass, and balanced percussion. Joe Duplantier's vocals sound intense here, harsh and clear simultaneously. The album begins with \"Oroborus\", and as if you were staring into its endless coils, the world serpent has you directly in its gazed, hypnotized by the groovy tapped guitar riffing and pummeling bridge. The song is capped off in the end with some scintillating ambiance. A truly amazing track, and it's only the first. \"Toxic Garbage Island\" begins with a post-hardcore slugfest before slamming into you with this slower paced, simple progression of notes which once again hypnotizes. \"A Sight to Behold\" begins with some synth-like groove, mesmerizing vocal verse and then another of those sickeningly good tapped riffs. There's almost a shuffle in the band's gait here. \"Yama's Messengers\" is a heavier, mathematical groove with some lovely chords. \"The Silver Cord\" is an atmospheric, instrumental. The latter half of the album is consistent in quality, dominated by heavier tracks like \"Esoteric Surgery\", \"Wolf Down the Earth\" and the percussive \"The Art of Dying\".\n\nLyrics are also decent with this album, some good, some not so great, reminding me of a midpoint between Neurosis' pensive rumination and Meshuggah's awareness and precision:\n\n'Flesh bodies mute and blinded\nRoaming uncertain, lost\nInfected misinformed\nReleasing a black enormous insect\nOut from the chest\nArchaic from disease'\n\nSome tangible poetic insight, if not every inch the peer of the music. The Way of All Flesh is the total package for this band, easily eclipsing their earlier albums in style and replay value. Never aping a particular influence. Never less than intriguing. It's one of the most important metal albums this year and a must for anyone who values creative quality. Sure to be a year's end favorite for myself and many other snobs.\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nRegular perusers of these sultry pages should hopefully not have failed to notice my sheer all-encompassing love of Gojira's 'break-through' record \"From Mars To Sirius\", a love which isn't a passing flirtation with 'some' band but a passion for those 12 songs which still results in goosebumps after dozens of listens. In my mind I am confident in saying it is in my top 3 albums since the turn of the millennium, no mean feat when you know the size of my collection, alas all thus resulting in some stupidly high expectations on my part for their follow-up three years in the making, \"The Way Of All Flesh\". The problem with loving a band and/or album so obsessively much is that almost all else is destined to remain in the shadows, so the question is: does \"The Way Of All Flesh\" see any sunlight?\n\nWhat had first caught my attention to French metallers Gojira a few years ago now was their adept use of varying tempos and feels not only across the songs of an album, but also within individual songs. Coupled with the fact that in \"Backbone\" (among others) these ears were presented with some of the damn finest riffs they've ever been assaulted with and the reason for the critical praise lavished upon Gojira is clear. In creating \"The Way Of All Flesh\" Gojira have stuck very much to the formula perfected on \"From Mars...\" after the admirable work-in-progress \"The Link\", which is a recipe featuring \"Covenant\"/\"Domination\" era Morbid Angel at their most brutal, the staccato-riffing of Meshuggah and Strapping Young Lad at their most complex and massive, gigantic, godzillian vocal patterns that, well, I'll be damned if I've ever heard this side of a Bon Jovi classic. \"The Art Of Dying\" two-thirds through is the perfect example of these features: the free-spirited nature of the closing half of it's 10-minutes hiding the fact the earlier chorus takes the breath away, unilaterally matching the epic, humanitarian and sociological themed lyrics Gojira specialise in. Just to highlight my point about the power of that 'r' word, the whiplashing introduction to \"Esoteric Surgery\" cannot be disliked by any converts to the church of Riffology, there is no questioning that.\n\nLooking for weak aspects of Gorjia work is difficult. Production is superb, as is the artwork again, eschewing all conventional metal themes and cliches for another unique presentation. Every performance is spot-on, with brothers Duplantier deserving of special recognition: drummer Mario mixing the heavy and light with the dexterity of an octopus, and Joe on vocals (and guitar) furthering his claim for one of the most recognisable voices in metal with his hoarse, chanted and clean styles used to emphasise the qualities of the music, rather than to simply sit on top. Perhaps not unsurprisingly, the album's weakest track, \"Adoration For None\" is that most clearly emphasised by the style of it's guest vocalist, Randy Blythe of Lamb Of God, bearing unwanted gifts of semi-hardcore chanting and an almost-appearance of a 'beatdown'. Yuk. Claims of a lack of feeling by some in the output of Gojira seems to me wholly unjustified; yes they are well produced, however not 'shiny', but the passion in Joe's vocals with the virtue that Gojira rip out the corking riffs in moderation gives the ones that greet us marked approval.\n\nAs if Gojira had a point to prove, opener \"Oroborus\" is born of a cascading twisting riff, in the process proving Gojira have got better riffs than 95% of others out there. That's after just one riff! More moderately paced, \"A Sight To Behold\"'s spine lead riff spreads it's infectious influence amongst all others, upon which Joe pessimistically bleats \"the way I see things is so simple/ the fact I'm living dying on this land/ exhausted is the realm of nature\", sentiments I would claim to share to large degree. So, unlike the state of the Earth, does \"The Way Of All Flesh\" see sunlight and a positive future? Yes. Direct comparisons with the 10/10 \"From Mars...\" are difficult at this infant stage but Gojira have avoided settling wholly within it's vast shadow, instead building upon their unique style with another expertly-crafted slab of modern metal for every metaller. There is no arguing with this godzilla. \n\nOriginally written for Rockfreaks.net\n",
        "\nI don't own a lot of live DVD's, most of the time the quality (either the sound or the overall performance and stage presence) disappoint me, and I end up wishing I stuck to the studio albums instead of watching the band live. In this case, I watched some of The Link alive at a friend's house, and I immediately decided I will buy it the next time I went to a music store.\n\nGojira are today one of France's best rising metal acts, yet back when this DVD was in the making, they were merely another groove/death metal band. After a successful \"From Mars To Sirius\" in 2005, the band got a lot of the recognition they deserve within the metal scene. And the more I think about it, the more it's sort of contradictory. The material played on this DVD is from their first two full lengths only, no \"Flying Whales\" and no \"Vacuity\" or \"Art Of Dying\". Not to say that Terra Incognita and The Link are of lesser quality than their later albums, but Gojira fans --especially the ones unfamiliar with their first two studio albums-- will find this highly entertaining: Terra Incognita and The Link are somewhat heavier than the later two albums, more focused on the rhythm and weight than on the catchy melodic parts. And for us who have listened to these guys since Possessed, this is probably as good as Gojira will ever get on stage!\n\nFirst of all, a quick explanation of Gojira's music is needed. They play a breed of death and groove metal, that's very heavy, progressive, and with technicality. It sounds generic I know, and all those elements don't necessarily give a good product at the end, but Gojira set themselves apart from the rest of the death metal bands performing on stage with one thing: they work like robots, robots at perfection. The music is relatively very simple: the rhythm sections are extremely groovy and with very catchy time signatures and arrangements, but nothing out of the ordinary. The riffs are simple and solid, and the vocals strong and very well used: they're like melodic half screams half growls and they fit the music perfectly. The songs played live sound exactly like on the recordings, with an amazing sound quality, and the band members have all the stage presence you can think of. Duplantier constantly communicates with the crowd (in french), in his Chuck Schuldiner stance, precise guitar playing and overwhelmingly strong voice. The four guys are all very highly skilled and play their instruments with extreme precision, and this is what makes this DVD better than your average live show. The camera does a great job of capturing all the best moments of all four instruments, and seeing all these heavier Gojira songs played live feels very fulfilling \n\nThe track selection is very pleasant, I'm a big fan of Terra Incognita and I feel they played the best tracks from that album. \"Blow Me Away You Niverse\" and \"Space Time\" are my personal favorites and were just the same live, or maybe slightly more entertaining and more energetic. The Link was almost played in its entirety, although I kept waiting to hear \"Dawn\" at the end but it never came. Seeing the complete outro on \"Remembrance\" played with such precision and skill was almost unbelievable. Mario Duplantier is without a doubt one of the heaviest, most talented live drummers I've ever seen. He definitely reproduces the same intensity of the album's flawless drum work on stage. All in all, an outstanding 75 minutes of live metal performance, very few bands can pull this stuff off. I highly recommend this for all of you who enjoy watching metal masters at work. These guys are the best at what they do.\n",
        "\nLast year, I had finally progressed towards the instantaneous expense known to many as \"online shopping.\" Then, with the infinite ocean of malleable merchandising strewn ever so flamboyantly before me, it had dawned on me to finally begin the vast music collection that had haunted me to acquire for so long. So, I did a little 'window shopping,' if you will, and stumbled, somehow, across this, Gojira's \"The Way of All Flesh.\" Of course, I had checked at least two different sites to sway my desire upon, Amazon and this one. Strangely enough, the popular opinion was that this was an impressive work of modern music, the new age of metal for your ears, and the few detractors encountered all seemed to give the mutual impression that this just wasn't their cup of musical tea. Of course, what sold me on the purchase was that one reviewer on Amazon had likened the music on here to a melodic Meshuggah. Having experienced referenced band in the past and remembering not being able to really enjoy them in spite of their interesting song structures because of their continual dissonance, I decided to purchase this album along with one other to take advantage of the free shipping.\n\nLet's recap: I bought this album based on a couple of words from a review from Amazon.com.\n\nNote to self, and everyone else, for that matter: Never trust a review from Amazon.com.\n\nI'm going to admit, this really isn't my thing, either, but I want to know just what the fuck it is that people hear on this album that propels their enjoyment to near-unanimous praise. Sure, credit is due to some complex rhythms here and there, but overall, this is one rather boring chugfest that meanders too often to be of any auditory pleasure. I hear not Meshuggah here in the least -- I hear Lamb of God here all the time. No, that's an overstatement to be honest -- Lamb of God is fucking Exodus at their zenith compared to this slow, thick, slimy journey through randomness and atmosphere. The guitars do not harmonize well, which gives credence to the whole \"dissonance\" thing I've been moaning about, the music does not progress upon any good ideas (Hey, the ambient tracks here may be filler, but what if....), and the drummer sounds like a scared version of Lamb of God's own drummer, which isn't very impressive to begin with, as he plays along safely to the guitars' strange melodies. Oh, sure, there are moments where the music shows promise, such as a few key riffs and sections occasionally, but on the whole, this is a rather pointless exercise in attempting to drolly differentiate the music among the diverse majority of other works being peddled to the masses.\n\nTake the very beginning of the CD, for example -- it starts out with a nice little guitar part taking the lead that actually shows some promise that the next seventy five minutes will prove worth your hard-earned money. But even then, any half-hearted listener can discern the onset of a virulent hour -- the lead riff goes on longer than necessary before looping, the drumming is excessively careful in staying within its own boundaries, thus leading to a noticeable lack of excitement, the background riff is nothing but one chord chugging along at a moderate pace, and when the vocals kick in, they do nothing to improve upon the already lackluster music. Combine all of this together, and you have yourself a rather somnolent opener that does nothing but progress along to the ambient closer that's supposed to introduce the next track.\n\nAnd then I realized I still had over an hour left. Holy crap, this is not fucking happening.\n\nAs it was, the rest of the album was very, but I mean VERY uninviting. An abridged version of the rest of The Way of All Flesh, so as to prevent further violent infection: After passing pointlessly through the next track and guiltily enjoying the opener to A Sight to Behold, I was viciously assaulted and sodomized by the dual onslaught of the remainder of a rather childish track, followed by what is probably the worst possible execution of slow chugging on Yama's Messengers, leaving me a bloody mess only a quarter through this excruciating journey. Conversely, The Silver Cord was there to assuage the aural agony with its calming passage of substantial interlude, which was enough for the moment -- I needed a breather after the previous twenty or so minutes. Of course, having let my guard down for two and a half minutes, I was yet again the victim of undue conflict as internecine discord greeted me after the fade and continued to batter me relentlessly until the title track was halfway through, with only very short breaks to breathe that took the form of the ambient breaks in the last five or so songs. ... Sure, Randy Blythe's short appearance during Adoration for None may serve as something of a selling point for any LoG fans, but in this case, his vocals do nothing to improve upon the horrible beating administered via lack of musical integrity, a hapless bystander to the assault of the Duplantier brothers. I must be fair, though -- Joe's vocal performance is not completely totaled by the music, as his diverse range of screams are delivered with enough force that would serve to lead a decent death metal band to success. Oh, and the lyrics don't suck, either, but it's hard to notice that with the discordant music playing over them.\n\nThen I reached the last ambient piece that is the last five minutes or so on the album, and let me tell you, I have never been this glad to hear such a crappy ambient track before in my life. You know something is wrong when the most enjoyment one can derive from an album of seventy-five minutes in (painful, excruciating, mindless, sadistic, malevolent, gruesome, detestable...) duration is in its random interludes. The audible violence wasn't entirely unfruitful, though pinpointing specific parts that support this statement is a rather onerous task, as this would require additional research and blows to the psyche in its accomplishment -- if I recall, there were rather interesting sections in the Art of Dying before its repetitive second half, Vacuity's rhythm was interesting enough for me (though it shouldn't be for you), and Esoteric Surgery was probably the only track where I may, MAY, admit to have taken pleasure in its assault. Otherwise, this is one back alley I wish never to return.\n\nIf there's anything I can say, it's that this is probably the biggest disappointment I've ever received from following the popular opinion of one album. (Of course, I'm aware of the axiom of following thine own heart and am a devout believer of such, but then, one must wonder just what reviews are for.) The Way of All Flesh is a boring, uneventful, weak, and overall distasteful amalgam of three instruments that collide like a car accident for over an hour to provide the listener with interesting vocals and musical confusion. Hell, this mess could have used at least a few solos -- oh, that's right, I neglected to mention the fact that solos are pretty much absent from this record. (I may not be entirely accurate, but if after that rather memorable beating I am unable to recall any, then the statement can't possibly be too far from the truth.) I am fully aware that solos alone will not transform a meaningless experiment in music into a worthwhile record, but the manner in which this stridence is formed practically begs for a little pointless noodling. Seriously, even two small separations of thirty seconds each could probably propel enjoyment for The Way of All Flesh to actually desired repeat listens. But no, instead, you get a rather pointless mix of indistinguishable tracks to fulfill or haunt you.\n\nI know that this is going to sound pretty hypocritical, as a review is supposed to have an intended purpose, but you know what? Go ahead and buy this. Everyone else seems to like it, and I'm afraid I must say, this is just not my cup of proverbial tea, as it just sounds like a mess of disharmony to me. The only other advantage to this CD's credit? The other CD I bought with this one was Metallica's Master of Puppets. At least I can say this purchase wasn't a total loss!\n",
        "\nGojira have been called \u201cthe French Mastodon\u201d since their popularity skyrocketed in 2005 with their album \"From Mars to Sirius.\" Mainly because back then they and Mastodon shared a somewhat similar sound, Revolver magazine wouldn\u2019t shut the fuck up about either of them, and they both had whales on their album art. Time has separated the two, and while Mastodon are now experimenting with clean vocals, accessibility, and psychedelic soundscapes, Gojira are still sticking with the progressive sludgepool sound, and they\u2019re starting to smell. \n\nPeople say that Gojira\u2019s sound is hard to nail down, but the Wikipedia article gives an apt description: mix together 80\u2019s Metallica, Morbid Angel, Meshuggah, Neurosis, add a pinch of Eyehategod, a few wires, a giant loogie, some pubes, and of course a good helping of the first two Mastodon albums and the Lifesblood EP, bake until sludgy golden brown and you get Gojira. (Fuckton of M\u2019s in that paragraph ain\u2019t they?)\n\nThe album sounds good. It\u2019s mixed by former Machine Head guitarist (more M's!) and current modern metal producer Logan Mader while band leader Joe Duplantier produced the music at his home studio (\u2018cept the drums which Mader handled). For a (more-or-less) self produced album it sounds really good and heavy.\n\nThe art is interesting by Joe. It\u2019s no Mona Lisa, but it helps set the lyrical mood. Instead of environmentalism like the last record, this album takes the same route Metallica took the same year by talking about death, but really, who gives a flying fuck about lyrics anymore? Not like anyone's breaking any new grond on that front anyway.\n\nThe tracks as a whole are good, Most of it is a very chuggy Meshuggah/Morbid Angel/Neurosis/late-80\u2019s-early-90\u2019s-Metallica soup mixed with a pinch of Pantera\u2019s jizz with a few sprinkles of eclectic thinking. \u201cA Sight to Behold\u201d starts off with a synth-industrial\u2026 thing that was very interesting and made me literally go \u201cWhat the fuck?!\u201d out loud in a public gathering. \u201cThe Art of Dying\u201d\u2019s Opener sounds like it was lifted, yet fittingly so, from Sepultura/Soulfly. (Rather appropriate, considering Joe Duplantier is the bassist for Cavalera Conspiracy.) And \u201cEsoteric Surgery\u201d and \u201cToxic Garbage Island\u201d (fuckin\u2019 A song title) are just fucking great songs from beginning to end.\n\nBut that\u2019s really what\u2019s above average with this album. Almost every single song overstays its welcome, and the good riffs are bashed to the point of annoyance. The kick starter \u201cOroborus\u201d gets boring after not changing three minutes in, As do \u201cAdoration for None,\u201d \u201cVacuity,\u201d \u201cWolf Down the Earth,\u201d \u201cYarma\u2019s Messengers,\u201d and even \u201cThe Art of Dying.\u201d The riffs are great, but not paradigm shifting, and repeating them over and over kills how interesting they are for how annoying they are. In several cases, for example \u201cAdoration,\u201d and \u201cArt of Dying\u201d they take an eternity to fade out making the skip button a necessity. \n\nAnd the shit is in the drums. They are skillfully played, but someone needs to tell drummer Mario Duplantier that restraint can be a good thing. When the strings slow down sometimes, Mario decides to pull a Cannibal Corpse/Suffocation blast beat that sticks out and is very uncomfortable like a giant anal plug. \n\nThen there\u2019s \u201cThe Silver Cord\u201d; a very, VERY Neurosis/Isis styled interlude that\u2026 is\u2026 just there. The album has 14 songs and a good chunk are over five minutes, which makes it somewhat of a chore to get through, and having a random interlude just seems like filler to use up the ENTIRE fucking CD space. It is fine to use modern CD\u2019s space, but only if every single minute is passionately played. This though really serves no purpose and should\u2019ve been left on the cutting room floor.\n\n\u201cThe Way of all Flesh\u201d album is professionally played and has some rather good ideas, but it drags on and is in dire need of restraint especially the drumming. Most of the songs should be cut down so the listener won\u2019t be distracted by porn like I was. I don\u2019t hate long songs. I love Edge of Sanity\u2019s 40 minute long song \u201cCrimson\u201d (the best record of 1996) because it doesn't drag along like this record seems to do and has enough twists and turns in it to keep it interesting. \n\n\u201cThe Way of All Flesh\u201d is not a huge pile of shit, but it\u2019s not the masterpiece Revolver Magazine keeps screaming about, and its minuses outweigh the pluses...\n\nIf you are a huge fan of Mastodon, then just listen to Mastodon. So many bands like these guys, Kylesa, Baroness, and probably many other bands that no one gives a fuck about have been nibbling at Mastodon\u2019s shins for a while now. People say how \u201cdiverse\u201d this album is, but really it\u2019s the contents of a Heavy Metal blender spread way to thin for any real song to be memorable after the first few. If you think Mastodon shouldn\u2019t have evolved and should sound like grey, than go ahead and pick this up, but for the rest of us whose brains still have firing synapses, just keep \u201cCrack the Skye\u201d on repeat.\n",
        "\nGojira are one of the oddities of the metal scene today; their style is generally described as unique, even if detractors point to the occasional similarity to Morbid Angel or Strapping Young Lad (another metal oddity). They are possibly the only French metal band to have any kind of success in the Anglophone world thanks to their English lyrics (some say it matters), but they only really got the attention they deserve when their 3rd album, From Mars to Sirius, was released. Many of their fans would argue that this, the Link, their second album, is the best of the three released so far: while From Mars\u2026 is a consistent effort, the songwriting on the Link is generally more interesting, and some of the song structures used here are almost recycled in From Mars.\n\nThe album is notable for its variation: there are the speed-fests such as the Morbid Angel soundalike Wisdom Comes, the groovy tracks such as the opening track, and the downright stunningly innovative tracks such as Remembrance. The Link opens with cyclical riffs and a pummeling atmosphere which showcases some of Joe Duplantier\u2019s more melodic singing style. A very laid-back track as they go, and not one which one would normally associate with a band (such as Gojira) labeled as progressive death metal. Indeed, straight-up death metal is rarely heard on the album, as the band tends to sink back into mid-paced riffs. However, the speed can be found: Remembrance opens with a tremolo-picked intro, and does not relent until the final, shattering breakdown. Remembrance is a fantastic example of Gojira\u2019s knack of taking a song, applying a fairly simple song structure, and utterly enthralling the listener. The middle, spacy sections (is that a whale I hear? Sounds familiar) need to be heard to be believed, and the breakdown comes out of the blue and leaves my neck sore. Easily one of the highlights of the album.\n\nWisdom Comes shows the ability of the band to throw out a simple, blast-beat laden track and use them to their best extent. Not a single clean sound to be heard on this track, as Duplantier growls his way through. Death of Me, possibly my favourite track on the album, is a fiercely original track. It switches between a distinctive, swinging riff and some tremolo-picked, blast beat nuggets of goodness, with some interesting slower parts which contribute to make an astonishing track. Embrace the World is another highlight, keeping interest the whole way by the nature of the song changing several times throughout. Its lyrics are also the most interesting here, possibly one of the songs that states the band\u2019s purpose the most clearly. Inward movement is the slowest track on here, and has an almost drone, doom feel, and is one of the more interesting listens here.\n\nThe album isn\u2019t perfect, as the superlatives of this review might suggest. There are some utterly worthless tracks, which can be named: the atmospherical Connected, using some rudimentary percussion, sets up Remembrance nicely. However, it is simply tedious to listen to this for a whole minute, and one can only wonder if it\u2019s really necessary. Over the Flows\u2019 main riff is original, to say the least. However, the track repetitively plods its way through, and doesn\u2019t really make an impression comparable to the juggernauts of Remembrance or Death of Me. Indians attempts to make use of a \u2018swinging\u2019 riff similar to the main riff of Death of Me, except this one simply seems childish. Dawn also seems unnecessary and drawn out, and does not have the strength of Gojira\u2019s usually epic closing tracks. Any listener in possession of From Mars to Sirius should listen to the track Unicorn from that album. Interesting use of harmonics? Certainly. Now listen to Torii. That\u2019s right: Gojira, for some obscure reason, decided to reuse those harmonics for Unicorns. Well, since this review focuses on The Link, I can criticize this track only for its repetitiveness and, yet again, pointlessness, quite apart from the fact that From Mars to Sirius recycles this track completely.\n\nThe Link is able to showcase the talents of the bands very nicely. The Duplantier brothers (Joe on guitars/vocals, Mario on drums) are clearly the brains of the band, and admit it openly in interviews. The second guitar (Christian Andreu) follows Joe\u2019s lead, and one can only feel that his presence in the band is solely to provide extra heaviness and thickness to the band, not to actually provide leads. This is a shame, as Gojira\u2019s cover of Metallica\u2019s Escape shows that Christian can solo very nicely; it would be interesting to see if Gojira can incorporate leads into their future efforts. Mario on drums is one of the band\u2019s stand-out elements; he is fast on double kick, his fills are innovative, he is the master of adding in cymbals and snare hits on unusual beats in order to spice up a normal drumline. Bass, provided by Jean-Michel Labadie, falls prey to the second guitar\u2019s curse of simply following the root. Labadie\u2019s contribution can only really be seen live, where his energy is overpowering. However, on record, he fails to make a lasting impression.\n\nThe album is arguably the best recorded by Gojira, and some of the tracks are live staples. They do not often fall prey to the curse of repetition, some of the criticism leveled towards their two other albums. Gojira have managed to produce a very interesting metal album, going against many of the stereotypes and pre-conceived ideas that are packaged with most extreme metal music. One of my favourite albums overall.\n",
        "\nThey are back without changes, but for once we're very happy this way: the long time passed since the previous \"From Mars To Sirius\" (but they've always been working slow), the big success obtained with that album, as well as the direction the new single \"Vacuity\" (once again accompanied by a wonderful video) seemed to take them towards the commercial success through artistic suicide. \n\nBut not: \"The Way Of All Flesh\" is not only very nice, but can maintain unchanged the sound matrix of the transalpine band without bothering the listener. Sure, as usual it's not easy to digest a Gojira album, because even when they adopt a more melodic approach \u2013 and in this sense the opener \"Orobus\", with its hypnotic lead guitar lullaby, is exemplary \u2013 the songs are so rich in details, their scores so thick that ten listens won't be enough to appreciate all of their tasty solutions and details. \n\nUndoubtedly, the rhythmical side of their songs is astonishing. The almost continuous recurring to mid tempos and groovy riffs must not deceive, the syncopated and powerful arrangements of mr. Duplantier (a monstrous mixture between Tomas Haake and Pete Sandoval) turn every riffs sequence into a labyrinth. It's the middle part of the album especially \u2013 that with the songs \"Yama's Messengers\", \"Adoration For None\" (maybe the less successful in there) and \"All The Tears\" to give show of their most extreme Morbid Angel-like side, while it's up to the opening trio \u2013 the already mentioned \"Orobus\", \"Toxic Garbage Island\" with its unforgettable groove riff, and \"A Sight To Behold\", with that surprising synthetic riff that evolves in the usual killer walk \u2013 to witness about their more modern, catchy and innovative breath. In the end, with \"The Art Of Dying\", \"Esoteric Surgery\", \"Wolf Down The Earth\" and \"The Way Of The Flesh\", the French band finds the perfect balance between the most melodic earth of the album and the brutal instinct. \n\nSharing with Neurosis, Burnt By The Sun and Mastodon the same avantgarde sigh, Gojira have the single fault to have never written the perfect album: but also the huge quality not to have ever been just \"average\". Not even now. \n\nOriginally written for Silent Scream http://www.silentscreamzine.com/Home.asp?Lang=ENG\n",
        "\nGojira are starting to build a little reputation. I wouldn\u2019t say one of being the greatest band ever created, but one of a band that you can just count on. The four albums they\u2019ve created, including this newest effort The Way Of All Flesh, are great albums in their own ways. The Duplantier brothers are coming across as proficient songwriters, and they show no signs of slowing down, either.\n\nWhile many may condemn this album as the poorer cousin of From Mars To Sirius, I\u2019ll be one to disagree, as I think the material here has taken a step up, despite it being stylistically proximate. If you thought the material from From Mars To Sirius was tight and rigid, then you will not be able to get a pinhead through any of the riffs here. The guitars, bass and drums play in intricate formation. I wouldn\u2019t want to imagine the amount of takes needed to get the music as tight as it is. Nevertheless, the final product is very robotic in its delivery\u2026but without the use of triggers.\n\nWhile I said The Way Of All Flesh is close in style to its predecessor, there are some slight differences here. For one, the track \u201cA Sight To Behold\u201d is a different beast to the two preceding openers. It begins with a synth line, and Joe Dulpantier\u2019s vocals are slightly vocoded, giving the whole song a different edge than most others here. While some listeners will cringe, I actually like it, and see it as a highlight of the album. \u201cAdoration For None\u201d has guest vocals from Lamb Of God\u2019s Randy Blythe. I believe he fits into the mold here, but the first half of the song is a little too busy for my liking, yet it\u2019s not a detractor, either. \u201cThe Art Of Dying\u201d is THE song of the album, as it\u2019s a 9-minute monster that never feels drawn out or boring. There are several sections to the song, with the tribal-esque opening, the chugga-chugga riff that comes after it, the 2-minute closing riff and the segue into the next song, \u201cEsoteric Surgery\u201d. It\u2019s an excellent song and deserves its praises.\n\nThis album also shows some technical sides of Gojira, as well. The opening riff to \u201cToxic Garbage Island\u201d, while remaining 4/4, sounds more technical in theory than on paper, and it proves a great opener to a great song. \u201cEsoteric Surgery\u201d shows some excellent bass drum work, which apparently was the hardest song to record on this album. They also deliver their signature melodies, the likes of which don\u2019t sound forced or sappy, with tracks like \u201cWolf Down The Earth\u201d.\n\nWith their lyrical themes of nature and Earth (and some killer lyrics about death in \u201cThe Art Of Dying\u201d\u2026not gore, but about letting yourself go), it\u2019s still a refreshing theme. This could also be because they don\u2019t come across as \u201cpreachy\u201d, either. The Way Of All Flesh continue Gojira\u2019s incredible career, and this is perhaps their best effort to date. Well worth your money and time.\n\nBest tracks: Oroborus, A Sight To Behold, The Art Of Dying, Esoteric Surgery\n",
        "\nLike a whale skydiving, Gojira left a colossal dent in the metal scene in 2005 with the overwhelmingly well received \u2018From Mars To Sirius\u2019. After backing their new-found acclaim with a successful string of tours -- bringing their bombastic brand of death-thrash-whatever to ever widening audiences -- they kind of fell off the face of the earth. However, all of a sudden, looming over the horizon with a sadistic grin, we have \u2018The Way Of All Flesh\u2019, their newest disc. Straight off the bat there\u2019s that infectious ride-cymbal groove that we all know and love, courtesy of Mario Duplantier, and the warm, welcoming sound of a Joe Duplantier riff.\n\nI\u2019ll be honest with you all; I did not care for \u2018From Mars To Sirius\u2019, or the Frenchmen\u2019s 2003 effort \u2018The Link\u2019, but that notorious \u2018tightness\u2019 finally got the best of me with this one. In fact, the screws are turned ever tighter here, as even the sludgy outbursts of \u2018From Mars... \u2019 are condensed into razor-sharp rhythmic poundings, finalising Gojira\u2019s transition from band to part-cyborg riff machine. It is disturbingly easy to get sucked into the power behind it all, and as soon as you become comfortable, they pull something entirely new out of the bag. For example, after opening with \u2018Oroborus\u2019 and \u2018Toxic Garbage Island\u2019, two standard heavy tracks, we move on to \u2018A Sight To Behold\u2019, a bizarre creature based around a simple synth line and vocoded vocals which writhes in anticipation, without ever seemingly reaching that all-important climax point. Still, an exercise like this is entirely satisfying to the listener. Considering \u2018From Mars To Sirius\u2019 was a quagmire that wore you out long before it should have, \u2018... All Flesh\u2019 is mixed impressively well. A crisper sound is adopted this time, giving every instrument some room to breathe, which can only be a good thing.\n\nFor the more environmentally conscious death metaller in all of us, Gojira provide some food for thought about life, our planet and existence itself. Just what we all need, Greenpeace in our metal. Seriously though, for all the merit behind Joe Duplantier\u2019s messages, they can be difficult to follow as often full songs are scribed from very simple ideas and extracting a meaning from them can be a daunting task. Let\u2019s face it though; accessibility is not Gojira\u2019s game, so the eloquence is appreciated regardless. As with each album, Duplantier\u2019s distinctive vocal style comes closer to being one with the other instruments, and thankfully all traces of the grating inflections of \u2018The Link\u2019 are now nowhere to be seen. As a frontman and band leader Duplantier really gets the job done, co-writing all music with his brother Mario as well as handling vocals, guitars, production and even artwork to a slick standard.\n\nFor all the moderate experimentation and progression they\u2019ve made, Gojira circa 2008 still feels like the same brick-in-the-face Gojira that they always have been. The difference is that this time everything is more streamlined and the fat has been cut so that even the 9 minute \u2018The Art Of Dying\u2019, Gojira\u2019s longest song to date, feels neat and tidy, all the while continuing to strike you with the proverbial brick. Even the marginally duff \u2018All The Tears\u2019 and \u2018Wolf Down The Earth\u2019 have some way of working in the grand scheme of things. The flow of the album\u2019s songs is worth noting, with a good running order and segues between songs varying from an extended ambient break to mere nanoseconds before the next pummelling. All in all, a real classy album, the sort of thing Gojira needed to release to justify their status as an established professional act. Hell, just listen to \u2018Vacuity\u2019. You don\u2019t wanna fuck with that.\n",
        "\nThe French Metal scene is starting to produce many great bands with a modern sound and music that definitely has something to say. One of those bands is GOJIRA, the Bayonne, Aquitaine based Metal act that has managed to reach a pretty good status and get the respect of thousands of metalheads around the world. You know that I am not such a big fan of this whole \u2019modern\u2019 movement, but these French madmen have absolutely nothing to do with those meaningless noisy bands.\n\nIf you think that we are dealing with a new band that is consisted of several ugly teen motherfuckers you are completely wrong, since GOJIRA have been kicking ass since 1998. Just for your info, \"Gojira\" is the Japanese word for the well known \"Godzilla\". I guess that a French band with a Japanese name and a totally weird sound has already attracted your attention!\n\nThis is GOJIRA\u2019s fourth full-length album, as well as their second through the also French Listenable Records. For you who don\u2019t know this band, I will try really hard to describe their sound, although it is kind of impossible. The band has a classic distinctive heavy down tuned sound with bulldozer-guitars and a bass that causes earthquake. Their music contains many different elements like Death and Thrash Metal, as well as Hardcore touches, but there are more that make GOJIRA a fucking great band! There are times the band may remind you of CYNIC or MORBID ANGEL, as well as breaks that will definitely scream MESHUGGAH or TEXTURES until your ears bleed!\n\nSo you get ass kicking music with some brutal vocals, great technique and song structures that won\u2019t let you get bored even if you want to! And it\u2019s not only that. The band has done a great job on the lyrics for one more time, since GOJIRA are known for their themes. Life, death, ecology and spirituality are once again the topics that have been used in this album. Are you still waiting motherfuckers? Go get \"The Way Of All Flesh\" before the shelves empty!\n\nP.S.: LAMB OF GOD\u2019s guitarist Randy Blythe donates \u2019guest\u2019 vocals in \"Adoration For None\".\n\nOriginally written for Metal-Temple.Com\nYiannis D.\n",
        "\nI've always sort of been a fan of groove metal, not necessarily the genre, but merely a few bands within it. Pantera, Lamb of God, Mastodon, etc. You know, those really popular dudes with all of their MTV fandom and such. It wasn't until I listened to Gojira and this album specifically that I actually began to make an effort towards collecting groove metal albums. I've since gotten all of Gojira's albums, but this is by far my favorite.\n\nIt starts off with Clone which has some sort of ambient intro (how the fuck else do you describe that?) before just ripping your face off in something that couldn't be called anything but death metal. The song continues on with some groovy guitar noodling before continuing forward in extreme brutality. And get this, about half way through, there's a breakdown! \"Oh, how have you forsaken metal, Gojira, you've added a breakdown! ...wait a second, this breakdown kicks ass!\" Seriously, I can't even continue reviewing this song because it changes so much, but the whole time, it retains it's amazingly tight, groovy, death metal nature. This is music you fuck to. No, actually, don't. You'd probably hurt someone.\n\nLizard Skin is very similar to the first song in nature, but otherwise entirely discernable and decently memorable. Then comes Satan is a Lawyer. Don't let the silly name fool you; this song will kick your ass. It starts off with a clean guitar interlude with some spoken lyrics before crushing you with another groovy, breakdown-esque riff, and then back to the clean. The song picks up pace about 2:30-3:00 minutes in.\n\nI think I'm just going to quit while I'm behind. The songs are so amazingly diverse and so intricate, it's impossible to really review them all. Or any, for that matter. Words cannot do them justice. That's not to say that Gojira is made up of some sort of musical geniuses or anything whose work can only be ascribed to divine intervention. It's nothing of the sort. It's just tons of different shit slapped together in such a way that it works. Most of the songs have a general feeling to them: slow and crushing or fast and furious, always groovy. Many, however, have both. It's just the brilliance that is this album, I guess.\n\nThere's enough breakdowns and slow, \"br00tal\" riffing here to appease even the most casual of Hot Topic, deathcore kiddies and enough straight up metal and coherent songwriting to appeal to the strictest and purist of death metal fans. If you don't believe me, then get this and prove yourself wrong. This album has become one of my all-time favorites. Seriously, this is the best thing to come out of France since French Fries, and those came from Belgium.\n",
        "\nGojira, the menacing progressive death metal band from France, have more or less made a record to be remembered, for a very long time.\n\n\nFirst things first, the name Gojira is very misleading. These guys are basically the Green Peace of extreme metal, not some kind of \u201cdestroyer of worlds\u201d band. It greatly influences their music, not only in their lyrics, but in the themes as well, which is particularly obvious on this album.\n\n\nFrom Mars To Sirius starts out with a crushing groove as \u201cOcean Planet\u201d more or less assaults the listener. The mood has already been set for the rest of the album by now, but unlike many bands who just maintain a constant mood, Gojira decides to mix things up and have both uplifting, happy songs, but also melancholic songs, such as Where Dragons Dwell. \nThe crushing grooves certainly don\u2019t stop there. Many of the songs on From Mars To Sirius have grooves- MIGHTY grooves mind you, instead of the typical blast beats you often find in Death Metal. It\u2019s certainly a welcome change from the usual, and they have managed to perfect it with their style.\nStandout tracks on this album are definitely the crushing Ocean Planet, the fast Backbone, and In The Wilderness. That\u2019s not to say there are bad tracks on this album though, they all fit the theme and the style very well. Great songwriting on Gojira\u2019s part.\n\n\nThe production of the album is more or less stellar. Very clear sound quality, with great mixes that\u2019s sure to satisfy people who look specifically for that.\nAll the members are extremely proficient at what they do. The drummer is a maniac, pumping out some of the best fills you\u2019ll ever hear, while the guitarists mix things up even more, with their \u201cwhale songs\u201d. They basically play the guitar in a way that makes it sound like a whale. You have to hear it to understand it.\nThe lead singer is really good as well. He sings in many different ways throughout this record (Shrieks, growls, yells, screams and clean singing, also with some doomish spoken parts). It fits the music very well.\nOne could\u2019ve wished for even more \u201cocean\u201d influences than are here, but what\u2019s there is appreciated. It makes the concept of the album, that is, global warming, much easier to understand, for us people who don\u2019t really understand harsh lyrics that well.\nThe album is also extremely long for a death metal record, as death metal albums nearly never even reach 50 minutes. This album is 65 minutes, of pure awesomeness.\n\n\nSo what\u2019s actually bad about this album? \nSome of the riffs seem a bit uninspired, and it could\u2019ve been more progressive than it is now. While the songs do change their mood, they usually only do it BETWEEN songs, not IN songs. However, if you see the album as 3 huge songs, it\u2019s definitely progressive in nature.\n\n\nFrom Mars To Sirius is an astounding achievement by Gojira. One can only hope their next album will be just as good, hey, maybe even better?\n",
        "\nFor the many metal fans like myself that are fed up with the same old cliches that find themselves being copied over and over agian in the world of death metal, 'Terra Incognita' is a reassuring breath of fresh air.\n\nWhen you first experience Gojira, it is very hard to analyze what you are hearing. The brutal style of death metal that they play, mixed with the atmospheric instrumentals and eco-conscious lyrics make for a very new sound. That is not to say that their music is completely new. Many of their riffs resemble that of bands like Sepultura and Entombed, and Joe Duplantier's vocal style is similar to Max Cavelera's, but the way that they play the music is very different. Their is a very enlightening aura that haunts the whole recording, and ties it together very well. This is very impressive, because the songs themselves are very unique to each other- that is, they don't all sound the same. 'Satan is a Lawyer' is by far the most different, but, when listened in context to the rest of the album, it works.\n\nIndividualy, the band is brilliant. Mario Duplantier is one of the best drummers I have listened to in a while, bringing a unique, almost funky, style to the genre. Christian Andreu and Joe Duplantier are both great guitarist, who instead of using overdone harmonies or flamboyant solos, mesh together with insane riffs and blasting grooves. Also, the evident connection between bass player Jean-Michel Labadie and Mario makes for a great, aggressive rythm section.\n\nTo try to analyze the CD would be very hard, though. It is the type of thing that you must liisten to and experience to understand. To try and and critique it is very hard, because it is so flawless. One thing that could have changed is the sound clip at the beginning of 'Blow Me Away You (niverse)'. It takes away from the abstract and original feel of the song. Also, some of the breakdowns are similar. However, they do a great job of making their break-downs sound good, unlike many of the grindcore bands that completley overuse and ruin them. \n\nThe only thing I can say is that you should definitely give Gojira a chance. If you are into the standard stock bands of today, you won't like them. However, if you really want to open your mind and experience something fresh, buy 'Terra'.\n\nBest Songs: Love, Satan is a Lawyer, Clone, Fire is Everything\nWorst Songs: If I had to pick one, it would be Blow me Away You (niverse)\n",
        "\nGojira were a bit of a surprise, that's for sure. Lately, i've been willing to put aside my issues with the death metal genre and search for some talent within it. I came across Gojira by sheer accident, as per usual and decided, as their latest full-length received some positive reviews, that I would give it a whirl and see how it goes. I was pleasantly surprised by what I had found. It was unlike any death metal band I had heard before and because I don't exactly have an acid passion for the genre, that was a good thing.\n\n\nIt's not the most brutal of affairs, is 'From Mars To Sirius'. It's not as aggressive as I had expected. Death metal bands usually opt for an attack on the mind, body and soul by using superhuman low growls brought to you by the devil himself. Their approach is also quite restricted due to the brutality they are aiming to create. The guitars don't really have much room to manoeuvre and are restricted to fast and heavy solos, much of the time anyway. Gojira aim to tear this stereotype of death metal apart. They this rather convincingly and have even me, a man who usually shuns away from the genre, drooling over what they have created.\n\n\nFinally, a death metal band who can express themselves competently through instruments and vocals, perhaps the most surprising element of all. According to Metal Archives, the band also incorporate thrash into their music, this is perhaps where the vocals profit so much from. They're not typical at all. They don't come in the form of low guttural growls. Instead, they're more open to change. Variation is something the vocals like to surprise you with. They have a habit of sticking to one particular style and then surprising the audience with a new sound at different intervals. They're unpredictable, but in a good sense of the word. Generally speaking, they're high pitched screams, but with a low edge. It's quite unusual. This very fact makes Gojira instantly interesting. As well as the always altering percussion section. 'From Mars To Sirius' isn't simply filled with blast beats and overly using the cymbals, it's varied and exciting.\n\n\nBy no means are they restricted from change. They, at times, do turn from these screams to low growls which will appeal to the hardcore fans of the genre. Although seemingly not brutal on the surface, if you peel away the facade that Gojira elegantly wears, you'll come across an uncompromising band that leaves no prisoners. The lyrical themes suggest the brutality lies hidden within the band. The one element that keeps cropping up, is the fact that the individuals behind the instruments and the vocalist, aren't restricted by the genre. There is always room for musical expression. Mostly, this comes in the form of the melodies created by using two guitarists. They play simultaneously together and it works a treat. Solid riffs flow from the hands of the musicians and will keep fans of melodic music happy for hours on end.\n\n\nThe bass is where the heaviness of the band lies. It's subtle, but effectively working it's magic behind the scenes. Weaving it's way in and out of the solos, it majestically forms a concrete barrier of noise. Gojira's atmospheric tendencies are what keeps them interesting. Generally speaking, death metal bands keep atmospheres on records quite similar throughout. It's meant to portray an image of death and brutality. To an extent, it works. Gojira don't aim to do this. \n\n\nThey change the soundscapes throughout, making this full-length incredibly interesting. There is always a new element of the music that you pick up on every time you listen to it, which makes it a winner. Also, unlike many death metal acts, Gojira aren't afraid of producing lengthy songs. To me, this is a great thing. I like gradual build ups and an explosion of noise towards the middle and end. Gojira fulfil this desire effortlessly. With their sufficiently good production, they're able to let all their musical explorations out with ease. Highlights have to be 'Ocean Planet' and 'From The Sky'.\n",
        "\nWOW...I am throughly impressed with this band. WIth minor quibbles aside, this is an excellent effort that moves me. Like the reviewer before me, I first heard these guys opening for Behemoth last month and I was impressed enough to score this album, and I am not disappointed at all. \n\nThis is reminiscent of a primo mashup of Strapping Young Lad, Morbid Angel, and even Helmet. You've got the sweeping, dramatic feel of SYL, which includes a plethora of riffs that are equal parts disciplined, structured, melodic, and crushingly heavy; there is the throughly chaotic feel on several songs that evokes MA in their evil prime (the riffs in \"From The Sky\", \"Backbone\", and \"In The Wilderness\" in particular--tell me you don't hear Trey Azagthoth's warped sensibility in their approach on these tunes); and the drumming is the ace in the hole in this album. Like John Stanier (Helmet), Mario Duplantier is the hero in Gojira, his style providing a versatile and swinging feel to even the heaviest riffing moments, the odd blast parts excepted, of course. His is the role that makes the music really breathe and work and groove--yes, groove, and not in the lunkheaded Pantera/Lamb of God wannabe sense. Groove in the elusively funky sense, I mean, a la Van Williams of Nevermore, to cite another example. \n\nThe songs focus on swaggering, stomping mid tempos with a palpable sense of forward motion no matter how repetitive the music gets. And they work the repetition angle to its maximum effect, establishing a concrete base and a hypnotic feel that really drags you in. In fact, I'd go as far as to say that they channel the essence of their daikaiju namesake very, very well, menacing and dark yet heroic in an odd manner. The odd blast part surfaces here and there, and while I thought they were gratuitous at first they've grown on me, like the chaotic rush of \"Backbone\". But yet they also come off as simultaneously relaxed and confident as well as aggressive, an odd-sounding combination that manages to work. \n\nGojira even incorporate gentle, atmospheric instrumental parts like the short and sweet \"Unicorn\", which has haunting snippets of whale songs--those, in fact, pop up throughout the album to add a thematic coherence to it--and that takes courage and a firm belief in your music to write something like that and have it fit so well instead of seeming out of place. \n\nJoe Duplantier's vocals are best described as a harsh yet melodic shouting that somehow seems all him. He delivers his deep lyrics with conviction and occasional clean vocals as well as death growls here and there, all the while surprisingly coherent too--his accent is very minimal and he enunciates very well. And the lyrics are heady stuff, intelligent and well-written, dealing with a variety of subject matter of the spiritual/personal order that adds a healthy dollop of emotional resonance. His and Christian Andreu's riffing is tight and makes ample use of pinch harmonic squawks for punctuation and occasional Martian squalls--but no solos. And I don't miss them on this album at all; if there were any they'd seem out of place and disruptive. You do not interrupt a groove this massive and profound for self-indulgence. \n\nThe production is perfect, as well; the kick drums only occasionally sound triggered and the guitars are crisp and clear, plus the bass has its own niche in the mix that fills out the sound with gritty Fender tone to maximum effect. Every instrument fits into the whole to create a beautfuil sonic picture, something you don't get too often with metal at all. And I love it! \n\nStandouts for me are \"Ocean Planet\" (what a great opener), \"Backbone\", \"Unicorn\", the crushing \"Where Dragons Dwell\", and the menacing Morbid Angel worship of \"In The Wilderness\" and \"From The Sky\". Overall, the grand and again, sweeping epic feel of this album is breathtaking and will have you gently bobbing your head rhythmically in time witht the music more than headbanging. And this is not a bad thing, to me. \n\nI really hope these guys make some headway in America given that the anti-French sentiments of a few years back may well still be alive in some parts of this country. Forget all about that crap and settle in with this album for some deep listening, you will need to absorb this album over the course of several listens, as I did. Give it time to win you over, I think you will not regret it.\n",
        "\nFinally, real genre-spanning progressive metal. This record touches on too many styles to name, but never stays on one long enough to be labelled. That is something you cannot dismiss.\n\nMy first exposure to these songs was live, and it prompted me to pick up the record immediately. And I was not disappointed; the energy in performance and passion for the subject matter is perfectly carried through to disc. It really feels like Gojira is doing exactly what they want to do and don\u2019t care at all what anyone thinks. Although this can be a marketing ploy in itself I really feel it may be true here.\n\nWhat I find coolest about this band is that none of the members are trying to be the next virtuoso of their instrument. They don\u2019t overshadow each other, and everything is in place sonically. That is a great accomplishment in metal, where usually people can complain about one instrument or the other being too high or low in the mix. Not the case here.\n\nAlmost every song has a really cool part or arrangement which adds a particular Gojira stamp and has you remembering the compositions individually. What\u2019s coolest is that these stamps are never the same gimmick, sometimes it\u2019s a technical progression, other times just a properly pitched vocal, or even just the way a note rings out. I won\u2019t ruin any surprises by doing a track by track, but I will say with no shame (okay maybe a little shame) that I shed a tear the first time I read along to Global Warming when he sings \u201cI hold my inner child within / And tell him not to cry / Don't fear the living\u201d.\n\nMy only criticism after repeated (and lo!) listens is that a few of the songs drag on a little too long. Mostly this happens with outros, which makes it that much more noticeable because it is usually in the intros that Gojira throw in the most stop-start-surprise-prog stuff.\n\nDefinitely worth a purchase, because I promise it\u2019s different than anything in your collection.\n",
        "\nWell, the review title says it all, doesn\u2019t it? \u201cFrom Mars To Sirius\u201d was the first Gojira album I bought, and I thought it was pretty good. It had a nice mix of death, thrash, doom, and possibly others thrown in there. A good album all-round.\n\nSubsequently, I found Gojira\u2019s \u201cThe Link\u201d in a shop and I thought, oh, what the hell, and I bought it. Upon the completion of the first listen I wasn\u2019t gobsmacked in any way, but I thought it was good. After a while, I realised that I was listening to \u201cThe Link\u201d more than their follow-up, and that\u2019s when I decided that I liked this album more.\n\nIt\u2019s definitely much heavier, with raw production, but everything stands out perfectly. Nothing is too loud or too soft. Joe Duplantier\u2019s voice has a more raspy, deep tone here as well, making the whole experience much heavier, which is more suited to this album than \u201cFrom Mars To Sirius\u201d.\n\nOne aspect that\u2019s noticed is that their writing skills on this album don\u2019t match that on their next album, but ironically, this actually makes the songs better. The reason is because they experimented with different sounds and styles, which make for a nice spread of songs. \u201cDeath Of Me\u201d, for example, has some weird soft guitar riffing at the start, which shows that they didn\u2019t quite have the knack for it just yet. But, on the other hand, it\u2019s completely unexpected, which is one of the most important things in music. The end of \u201cRemembrance\u201d is also good, with the guitars and bass drums following the same thing until fade-out. Nice stuff.\n\nWhat makes the album complete more-so, is the final track \u201cDawn\u201d, a complete instrumental piece that actually DOESN\u2019T suck! Sometimes, final track instrumental\u2019s are a pile of shit (see She Said Destroy\u2019s \u201cMorituri Te Salutant\u201d), but then there can be really good one\u2019s (see Chimaira\u2019s \u201cImplements of Destruction\u201d\u201d). Fortunately, \u201cDawn\u201d falls into the latter category, and it\u2019s something to look forward to through the album.\n\nSo, all in all, this album is definitely some good death metal, with nice vocals and excellent instrumentation throughout. A nice mixture of songs from slow (the start of \u201cInward Movement\u201d and \u201cIndians\u201d) to fast (middle section of \u201cInward Movement\u201d and \u201cWisdom Comes\u201d) to some pure death metal pieces (title track, \u201cRemembrance\u201d). Personally, it\u2019s better than \u201cFrom Mars To Sirius\u201d, and most death metallers should like this.\n\nBest tracks: The Link, Remembrance, Inward Movement, Dawn\n",
        "\nWho knew it - FRANCE of all places strikes again. Between Yyrkoon, Hypokras, and Gojira, I find myself growing a silly moustache and drinking red wine more than ever. Well, maybe not Hypokras, though they do have some of the funniest band member pictures EVER.\n\nGojira is a very different beast than the other groups I've mentioned - though I heard they got their start in death metal this is disc seems to be a style unto itself. The closest comparison I can make is Meshuggah, but differences between the Swede masters of weird and Gojira abound. What they have in common is a super-low, bowel scraping guitar tone (think \"Nothing\"), vocals that are more clean than growls but do sometimes venture into the cookie-monster/gremlin territory, and precision-drill drumming. The atmosphere that each band creates is different, though - Meshuggah are trying to bring about the rise of the machines, whereas Gojira just want to watch some whales fly around in space.\n\nIt appears that a hate trend has grown around Gojira simply because they are getting popular. I think that trend may also have developed because many underground metallers don't like some of the things the group incorporates - (relatively) clean vocals and a bit of stop-start, simplistic riffage. I can understand the vocal gripe, though the singer's tone fits the music well. The guitars, though, CHUG - and that ain't a bad thing when the drums are hard at work. It makes a nice, Morbid Angel style sound (Gateways to Annihilation era) to have some low, slow riffage with a double bass barrage tearing shit apart at the same time.\n\nSo as you can tell I haven't fallen into the hate trend, in fact I find \"From Mars to Sirius\" to be a challenging, intelligent, and inventive listen. There are quite a few highlights on here, which have already been mentioned, I'd have to say \"From the Sky\" is a personal favorite. I just saw them live, and they held their own with Amon Amarth (and easily outshined Children of Scrotum - damn I hate that fucking band). For metalheads who are willing to branch out, Gojira is worth a listen.\n",
        "\nWhat to make of this band? They have their own sound, that much is clear. Gojira tends to chug along like the 1000-ton behemoth they are named after. Guitars are heeeaaaavy, and alternate between low-tuned power chords and squalling pick-scrapes and harmonics. It's not technical in the sense of being show-offy, but it's well-performed and leaves bruises. Under the guitars are usually precision double bass and other mathematical drum parts, reminding me of Meshuggah only more tolerable and less machine-like; and soaring over the top of it all is a powerful voice that sounds quite a lot like Max Cavalera, if Max was able to be melodic. It's a very forceful and raw, yet melodic, sound. And it really works for this music.\n\nSpeaking of which, the music Gojira makes is very difficult to categorize. They come from a death metal background, but there are lots of other elements: doom metal, hardcore, and post-rock. They are in the same neighborhood as Isis and Mastodon, but I find their sound to be both heavier and more distinctive. They throw in some chiming Pink Floyd-like clean passages, some whale sounds and similar atmospheric shenanigans... just enough variety to keep you on your toes, and to make the heaviest parts more effective by contrast. Crystal-clear production gives the proceedings a sheen that is definitely not kvlt, but definitely abets the massive, magestic feel.\n\nGojira is one of those hype bands of the moment, but I'd encourage you to look past the hype and find out on your own if you enjoy them or not. I keep going back to this album and finding more in its rich textures and ambitious scope. Their previous album \"The Link\" is also recommended, and is just a little rougher and deathier than this release.\n",
        "\nThis is the only album of 'Gojira' (bit of a silly name, but then they are French) I have heard, and it at least made me notice them. Not a terribly heavy album, nor terribly brutal, it does have a lot of catchy riffs that have you wishing the rest of the song was better. \n\nThe vocals are good, sometimes excellent, but never brilliant, a kind of aggressive yell similar to Tom Araya except with more melody. Duplantier has a strong voice and he knows how to use it, although the lyrics lack in creativity. The general theme of the album is global warming and the world flooding. \n\nThe guitar work ranges from crummy cliche metalcore licks to these quite nice thrashy riffs, an unfortunate mix for those of us who can't stand our metal 'compromised'. Some impressive pieces from these new-comers, however. The bass also has a few interesting fills, but thats about all. \n\nDrumming is good, not great. Nothing terribly original in that department, but definently skilled. The double kick is scattered throughout songs, which I prefer instead of a constant barrage. \n\nThe production is a little glossy and overdone, with the guitars sounding a bit too flat at times. Not for experienced metalheads, definently something aimed at all the kiddies who love Bodom and similar shit. \n\nI won't be running out to buy the next release or even rushing to downloading the next album, but I would definently keep an eye on these boys and hope they grow the balls to shake off their metalcore influences and make some serious death metal, which I think they are very capable of doing. \n\nNot a bad effort at all, but let's hope it improves next time around.\n",
        "\nWell, Gojira. These guys seem to be the flavour of the month at the moment. An issue of Terrorizer Magazine (#151) had them on the front cover with the heading \u201cAre these guys the saviours of metal?\u201d\n\nWhile these guys are pretty good, they\u2019re definitely not the be-all-and-end-all of metal.\n\nThe collection of songs here are very unique. They\u2019re not thrash, they\u2019re not completely death, hints of metalcore. They\u2019re not limited to one style of playing, and that makes for a good, varied spread of songs.\n\nThe best thing about the album is easily the production. Everything is crystal clear, the drums have a slight echo, and nothing dominates or takes over anything else. If the production were muddy, then it wouldn\u2019t fit the vocals, which would give off a false interpretation of what the album is trying to convey. Could you imagine the opening riff of \u201cWhere Dragons Dwell\u201d with thicker production? Neither could I.\n\nAs of the vocals, he does vary his style from clean to harsh. He never uses deep growls or grunts, which, again, wouldn\u2019t fit the flow of the music at all. His voice is almost epic in a way, leaving a sense of beauty (perhaps), and connects perfectly with the sound of the music. The deepest his voice gets would probably be on \u201cGlobal Warming\u201d where he says: \u201cWhat is this thing that we call hate? And that\u2019s inside of me? Get out of here!\u201d\n\nThe guitar work is very good. All the notes are heard very crisply. While they never solo, I don\u2019t really think the album needs it, as the riffs they use are fulfilling enough. One of the best guitar riffs is at 4:20 on \u201cFrom The Sky\u201d, using a long, simple riff structure, but it just fits really well.\n\nAs for the drums, they\u2019re also great. Plenty of double-kick action, putting it just where it is needed, plus slower and faster beating action, and even a blast beat thrown in occasionally. He goes through the whole repertoire of drumming techniques, so there is no limitation. All the beats are played tightly, and they all just sound great. \u201cOcean Planet\u201d is a good example of his skills behind the drum kit. The best part of the album, however, in both the drum and guitar aspect, is the final two minutes or so of \u201cIn The Wilderness\u201d. Everything about that is completely kick-ass. Listen to it, and I dare you not to have it stuck in your head.\n\nFlaws? Well, not major ones. \u201cWorld To Come\u201d is a pretty average song, probably the weakest of the album. The fact that it goes for over 6 minutes doesn\u2019t really do it any good. In fact, 8 of the 12 songs on offer go over 5 minutes, two over 7 minutes, making the whole album approximately 67 minutes long. For album standards, it\u2019s an exhausting listen, but if there are heaps of intriguing musical pieces, then it won\u2019t seem so long.\n\nSo, in saying that, this album is pretty good. It\u2019s also very accessible. With the clean production and understandable vocals, this album is a good place to start for someone who is new to metal. However, unlike what Terrorizer thinks, they\u2019re not the saviours of metal (who said metal needed saving?). Fans of extreme metal won\u2019t like it, but it is a well thought-out, unique listen for everybody else.\n\nBest tracks: Ocean Planet, Flying Whales, In The Wilderness\n",
        "\nGojira's newest record was a very impressive mix of thrash, death and metalcore with a bit of doom thrown in, and I was expecting this one to be equally good. While it doesn't have the same huge epic vision of the From Mars to Sirius, it's still a progressive and very solid mix of genres, but a lot faster and heavier.\n\nOne of the things I noticed fairly quickly in this album was how much Gojira use techy riffs. Rememberance has a few pretty awesome off beats riff, with a super tight flurry of guitar and double kick. It's pretty damn tight and awesome, and when some weird didgeridoo type effect comes over the top, it fits perfectly. Death of Me has some awesome quick bursts of death metal tremelo, although there's also some weird death metal pirate song (best description I've got for it) bits in that song, which suggests Gojira haven't quite got their song writing honed to the point they had it in From Mars to Sirius.\n\nStill, there's plenty of great bits here, like the sudden speedy bits in the title track, the clean respite that's Torii, the spine-tingling chants and semi industrial riffing of Embrace the World (terrible song title, though). The powerful doomy intro and wall of sound ending of Inward Movement rocks, as do basically all of the unexpected yet totally fitting changes in time signature/speed/mood that happen in almost every song. Gojira don't write with a predictable structure, and a few times in this album, some completely unexpected instrumentation will kick in, and it's always to great effect. Don't get me wrong though, every part flows perfectly into the next bit.\n\nAll of Gojira are very skilled at their instruments. The guitars do plenty of dissonant stuff but they are also adept at melody, and they're incredibly versatile, while the rythym section locks in tightly, providing a great backing for the guitars. The drums are really solid. There's plenty of unique drum beats and fills, and there's the occaisonal blast beat too. All of this has been recorded really well too. The guitars are super thick and the vocalist has been mixed perfectly. The only real complaint I have is that sometimes the song-writing gets a bit unfocused, but that's fairly rare. All in all, a really good prog death/thrash album that most metalheads should love.\n\nEdit: Just dropping the score down by a bit. It's still a great album, though.\n",
        "\nI've heard a lot of interesting things about this album, and it has a pretty damn cool cover (Whales!! IN SPACE!!!) so I bought it, and damn is it good. My friend described it as Pink Floyd's Metalcore project, and while I don't think that's quite accurate, it's definetly a cool, progressive and exciting album.\n\nThe album starts off on a pretty strong foot. \"Ocean Planet\" Besides being a cool name, is full of interesting, off beat and fairly oceanic riffs. Great vocals here, both sung and screamed, with some pounding riffs, and some unique sound that are pitch harmonies and something else. Maybe a whale song put through a few fx pedals. Either way, it's a great start, great to headbang to. The thick, raw but fairly clear production helps too.. every hit of the snare, every guitar riff is represented really good here. Great production doesnt make an album great, but it definetly improves an album. \n\nFair bit of variety on show here too folks. We have the oceanic riffs of the first song, the fast, chugging monster that is From the Sky, the cool mellow interlude of Unicorn, and the song with the coolest title in the universe, 'The heaviest matter in the universe' also being full of great riffs, sounding at times like a psycho version of In Flames. but with some good clean vocals. The vocalist is a pretty decent. All too often, great bands can be let down by the singer, but everything this dude does makes the songs better, whether it's growling, or singing. \n\nA lot of bands will have some good first few songs but then the album will go downhill. Not Gojira though.. Indeed, the album improves. Flying Whales, In the Wilderness and Global Warming are almost 8 minutes long, and these extended lengths give Gojira a chance to be a bit more progressive, to stretch out a bit, and they do that well. Flying Whales has a super awesome mellow intro, while In the Wilderness is just real heavy and doomy for the whole time.. It's quite an exhausting listen. Global Warming has some damn cool riffs, even if it does beat you over the head with a message. The opening riff of Global Warming is maybe the best one here, and shows of the Guitarists' skills. The guitarists, while they doesn't solo much, they are always playing great riffs, all of which are super headbangable, and fit the songs great.\n\nGojira aren't reinventing the wheel, but you won't really find any other bands doing the same thing. Their next album should be real exciting. A great album that most metalheads would dig. Highly recommended!\n",
        "\nThe french metal scene has always been subject to much ridicule. People have been known to say that the book \"Great French Metal Bands\" is just as thick as the \"Norwegian Warheroes\". But Gojira is here to blow you all away! With their progressive mix of Devin Townsend and Morbid Angel they create a very eerie and beautiful sonic soundscape full of monstrous destruction power and awesome moments.\n\nVocally this is one of my favorite albums. When Joe is screaming his guts out he still holds this massacre under control and manages to keep it sounding just purely awesome. It's not mindless shit, you can hear the technique. And no amount of \"awesome punk attitude\" can replace that. That's the real shit, kids. In just the perfect places Gojira slashes us with excellent clean vocals that cuts the air with long strung out notes. My skin is crawling.\n\nDrumming has awesome time-signatures and fills. Riffs crunch your face off and everything is played together with great skill. And the silent parts get the finishing touches with whales singing. Man, nothing is cooler than whales. Especially in outerspace.\n\nOne of the best albums of 2005! All hail Gojira!\n",
        "\nGojira is something of a conundrum. Consider the cover to their newest album \u2018From Mars to Sirius\u2019. It\u2019s color is white, which is hardly skull-crushing, but there is also a flying whale on the cover, as large as the planets it appears to be circling. Whales are quite weighty, so that might imply heaviness. The band was originally named Godzilla, but changed to Gojira after copyright fussing ensued, and hell, the album even has a song titled \u2018The Heaviest Matter Of The Universe\u2019, so this has got to be thick stuff, right? Well, that\u2019s the thing. \n\nGojira never takes off. I definitely want to like this album, and I definitely do, but only to an extent. I like most everything about this album \u2018to an extent\u2019 (except for the amazing pinches, which I simply cannot get enough of). It\u2019s heavy, to an extent. It\u2019s creative, to an extent. It\u2019s progressive, to an extent. The press release uses words like \u2018memorable\u2026chunky\u2026extreme\u2026groovy\u2019, and I agree with all of these\u2026to an extent. \n\nLet me explain. The album starts with a few seconds of whale song, which almost immediately kicks into a large, rolling riff, and a fantastic pinch harmonic. The pinches could be a motif of whale song emulation, but I\u2019ll leave that to you to decide. Moving on. The drums are tight, the bass usually mimics the lead to lend it strength, and when the vocals come in, they are quite apropos. Think Andreas Sydow of Darkane, just slower. And it is true, \u2018Ocean Planet\u2019 is a good track. It\u2019s different. Darkane meets SYL meets something else; head-banging is required. \n\nAll this is well and good, but the album just doesn\u2019t get off the ground. There\u2019s a fantastic foundation here; solid low end, good production, and guitarists who have their riffing technique perfectly set. I have no doubt that in time Gojira will lay down on the table a slab of metal-so-thick-and-groovy-I-can-hardly-believe-it. It\u2019s just not that time yet. \n\nWe\u2019ll hear some well-placed pinches and unique theme-and-variations on lead guitar, but then pops up a filler riff. A few good choruses, then a completely uninspired passage that kills the momentum of the song. For example, \u2018From the Sky\u2019 spends a few minutes building up, and at about 3:30 comes to a segue with a bit of dissonant ambience in the background. No problems so far. It cuts out, and the overused somewhat mild but trying-to-be-foreboding quiet part comes in, which again builds back up to a louder repetition of the same riff. This style represents at least 10 percent of each song, and it can go. Gojira would have well served themselves if they\u2019d cut this album down a third or so. It\u2019s already a monster at 70 minutes plus; around 50 and they would have had a killer album. But, since I can\u2019t go in and slice this apart, I\u2019ll just recommend listening to it in half-hour segments. Much longer than that, and I stop appreciating the nice ideas I do find and begin to think how this could be improved by brevity. \n\nSo, to take my own advice, I\u2019ll end it here. I do recommend this, but with sligh reservations. \n---\n(Originally written for Maximummetal.com)\n",
        "\nHeavy yet crystal clear production creating \u201cexperimental\u201d catchy death metal. Now I use the word \u201cexperimental\u201d lightly because they aren\u2019t overtly experimenting around, but to just simply classify them as death metal would be wrong too. But lets just say this is some unique death metal that doesn\u2019t suck.\n\nThis is the kind of metal that you just want to be high when you listen to. The riffs are constantly changing, not in a jazz-metal like manner where it just happens suddenly, but they just fuse it together so two completely different riffs flow smoothly. That style in itself is unique since one moment you\u2019re listening to some heavy chugging then all the sudden it goes into some atmospheric acoustic melody then suddenly changes into this fast thrashing riffage. No its nothing like that fagass band Opeth, this is different. Its much simpler but the structure is solid making them kickass.\n\nThe musicianship is tight, although they have almost no solos. The guitarist rely mostly on chugging and powerchord melody, which isn\u2019t bad at all. When he starts chugging, I mean he fucking start chugging. He fucking tears his guitar apart, using weird rhythms and creative noises from his guitar that are uncommon in metal. The bassist\u2019s style is also different since he follows mostly the drums but does it in a way where it almost resembles funk. The drummer also is unique. Its been a while since I\u2019ve been impressed by a metal drummer but he managed to do just that. Its not overtly fast or anything like that, its just that he uses a style mostly found in trip hop or even rap. Shit, did I just say rap? I hope I didn\u2019t scare any hardcore death metal kids away, but don\u2019t worry this isn\u2019t some shitty rapcore. It is death metal, with a weird bass structure and different drumming style.\n\nAnother highlight of the album is the weird and atmospheric instrumentals. Its so atmospheric to the point its almost haunting. The album as a whole conveys a very haunting mood but the instrumentals really ice that up. The vocals too are impressive, its nothing special but there\u2019s just something about his vocals that\u2019s captivating.\n\nThe album as a whole is mid-paced but there are some fast songs. But even me, being an avid speed metal freak, liked some of the slower songs in this album. The unique chugging from the guitarist really makes up for all the lack of speed (but still the slower songs gets boring though). Like I said before, this is an album you would want to listen to when you\u2019re high. Just a very unique and haunting death metal album overall. Its not for everyone, listen with an open-mind, you may like what you hear.\n\nRECOMMENDED SONG: Clone, Fire is everything, Love\nLYRICS: I don\u2019t know what the fuck they\u2019re talking about: ie. \u201cSatan is a Lawyer\u201d\nPRODUCTION: Heavy, yet really clear\nPACKAGING: A guy giving himself a blowjob is on the cover\nOVERALL: Not a bad album at all, very unique and different\n"
