        "\nOn Parole really can't be called the first Mot\u00f6rhead album. There's 2 reasons for that, one of which the obvious one that it was released in 1979, by which time the British group had put out 3 other albums, 2 of them in the same calendar year as this. However, it's true that On Parole had been ready to go since 1975, and that brings me to the second reason: this (chronologically) first showing doesn't feel like a Mot\u00f6rhead album. The problem can't be put down to the make-up of the band, since already Philthy Animal had joined on drums alongside Lemmy, while Larry Wallis passes me by rather on guitar (not having stayed with the band afterwards), it's much more to do with the songs and the style employed by the trio. If you want to hear Mot\u00f6rhead actually playing rock 'n' roll - how you understand it, not just Lemmy - you should listen to On Parole.\n\nI have a version with some \"alternate takes\" on the end of the disc, and these seem even more obvious nods to a past in (and before) the early '70s where heavy music was measured in drugs and vibrations from the bass rather than crushing guitar and downer topics. In some instances those songs plod in the manner that safe dance pop music might, although nothing abandons rock attitude so much as to veer away from guitar at the centre and dangerous lyrics floating just above the dope haze. Those vibes ended up on the final album too, 'Iron Horse/Born to Lose' especially sounding like a bluesy song that would be perfect for drivetime radio were it not for the lyrics about being \"Loaded forever, and righteously stoned\" or \"Wasted forever, on speed, bikes, and booze.\" I mean, what kind of peace and love era was this from? Trust me when I say that I have never associated Mot\u00f6rhead less with speed than the relatively relaxed and light tones shown there. Elsewhere, nothing gets sonically much heavier, the guitar really jangling more than anything and the bass making little of the impact that Lemmy later would, only the drums and inevitable whiskey-soaked vocals cutting with more grit. In this environment, Wallis taking the lead vocal role on 'Vibrator' and 'Fools' makes a lot more sense (plus it's barely clear who sings 'The Watcher'), particularly as the former cut ends up positively cheeky - again, almost a pop song if the content could be overlooked.\n\nSo, should my comments about Mot\u00f6rhead's stylistic primitivism be taken as complaints, or just enjoyed in the context of their early incarnation? I'd argue that the blade cuts both ways in this case, because although Mot\u00f6rhead will forever be renowned for the amped up, adrenaline surge of raucous heavy/speed metal that they began to deliver a few years after these recordings, the roots of the band deliver something attractive, if rather less vital. In a nutshell, what On Parole presents - especially to the modern listener - seems rather dated, if pleasantly so, a fact that the origin of these songs can attest to at least as strongly as the performances. 5 of the 9 songs on the album are covers. Re-read that if you need, I'll wait. Granted, 3 of them originated with Hawkwind, so they would have begun as Lemmy's songs anyway, yet the rather bedraggled spread of 'The Watcher' and the catchy 4:4 romp of 'Lost Johnny' feel like they straddle the gap between where metal's ultimate icon was coming from and where he was going. The psychedelic touches left in the former particularly feel out of place among largely natural rock instruments elsewhere. Back to the origin of these cover songs though, because, even if 'City Kids' comes from Larry Wallis's prior band, let us not forget that 'Leaving Here' was an Eddie Holland hit on Motown from 1963. That's not even very rock 'n' roll, let alone heavy metal. Of course, the final cover is 'Mot\u00f6rhead' itself, but that can't entirely capture the essence of the band despite a proper bass guitar clouting and adequate biker growl from the vocals and other instruments.\n\nThus, whichever way you look at it, On Parole fits poorly into the overall Mot\u00f6rhead history, showing a stark contrast between the early steps of the band and the impressive impetus they gained in 1979. Indeed, the success of Overkill and Bomber played a large part in getting this lost album released at all, even if perhaps it might have been better resigned to a belated \"from the vaults\" kind of compilation. Fans - and me too - would probably prefer to limit themselves to the first 3 tracks, encapsulating the slightly disjointed moods of the album and also the material that would most often be revisited in the future. If you came here for Mot\u00f6rhead, however, no more than a single cursory spin will be necessary to know that the band you are thinking of hadn't really started yet.\n",
        "\nMotorhead\u2019s seventh full-length represents one of the most dramatic turning points in the band\u2019s long-running career, perhaps even more so than the preceding Another Perfect Day. Record label issues caused Orgasmatron to be released three years later in 1986, an eternity in early Motorhead time, and the album also saw them upgrade to a four-piece lineup for the first time. This would prove to be their only album with former Saxon drummer Pete Gill, but guitarists Wurzel and Phil Campbell managed to stay on long term to the point that the latter\u2019s tenure was second only to Lemmy himself.\n\nThankfully the twin guitar configuration is integrated naturally, just sounding like Motorhead with a second guitar rather than attempting to get too flashy. There aren\u2019t too many moments of shredding or over technicality, but the simple interplay is effective with the rhythms getting some extra power. While this could risk the rhythm section losing some of its potency, the drumming strikes the balance between precision and looseness in a way that Philthy Animal never could, and the bass is as thick as ever. It\u2019s also interesting to note that Lemmy\u2019s voice seems higher pitched and almost squeaky at times, but his mannerisms are always there.\n\nOne aspect of this album that I find nobody ever really talks about is how it saw the band shift to more chorus-oriented songwriting. Past Motorhead classics certainly had their share of hooks, but they tended to just focus on the riffs with the chorus either being a shout of the title or a quickly run through segment, often making them feel like afterthoughts. While the choruses on Orgasmatron still aren\u2019t exactly tailored for arena rock, they certainly have a more anthemic quality than what came before.\n\nIt also helps that the band uses this approach with a decent variety of song templates. \u201cDeaf Forever\u201d starts the album cycling through marching verses and rung out chords soon contrasted by the much faster hits like \u201cAin\u2019t My Crime\u201d and \u201cRidin\u2019 with the Driver.\u201d \u201cBuilt for Speed\u201d and \u201cDoctor Rock\u201d are the catchiest tracks of the lot, the former cruising along a steady mid-tempo groove with reflective lyrics and the latter putting a hard-hitting bounce that would\u2019ve fit right in on Ace of Spades. Even a song where the chorus is just the title like \u201cThe Claw\u201d has a sense or urgency with Lemmy almost going full Halford with his screams at the climax.\n\nOf course, the final coup de grace comes with the closing title track. \u201cOrgasmatron\u201d is unlike any other Motorhead song that came before it, consisting of a simple but ungodly dark trudging drone interspersed with swirling distortion and the vocals delivered in an effect-laden growl. All the past themes of politics and warfare on past songs are given full attention, resulting in what may be the most cynically brilliant set of lyrics Lemmy ever composed and giving life to what could\u2019ve been an otherwise dragging experimental rocker. Future efforts would see the occasional attempt to repeat this formula, but nothing could ever be this striking.\n\nOrgasmatron may not have the brand recognition of Overkill or Ace of Spades, but it is secretly one of the most important albums in Motorhead\u2019s history. It effectively bridges the gap between the looseness of their classic era with the more consciously metallic tightness of their later years. The admittedly odd production job can make it easy to pass up and the phallic Snaggletooth train (Snaggletrain?) on the album cover might be a bit too gaudy for some, but it\u2019s ultimately just as worthy of your attention as their best-known staples. Future installments like Bastards and Inferno would arguably take this approach with even more powerful returns, but this was the start of a very solid second wind.\n",
        "\nMot\u00f6rhead may have established a strong identity with their self-titled album, but 1979\u2019s Overkill could be seen as their true debut. Having shed the baggage of early members and lingering material, this album sees the trio consolidate their tropes with boosted musicianship matched by focused songwriting. There\u2019s a real sense in pushing forward throughout, both as a band and throwing down a gauntlet of extremity for groups from Venom and Metallica to follow through the following decade.\n\nWhile Mot\u00f6rhead set a standard for high velocity openers with their self-titled song, they never had one with such a strong statement of intent as Overkill\u2019s title track. Plenty of hard rock and metal bands had utilized double bass drumming by this point but you\u2019d be hard pressed to find patterns with this degree of filth, especially when reinforced by these grimy bass lines and flailing solos. Throw in Lemmy\u2019s rock \u2019n roll declarations, relentless instrumental breaks, and two false endings and you\u2019ve got an anthem that is simultaneously exhilarating and exhausting.\n\nThe album\u2019s other songs may not reach the same levels of intensity, but they still offer plenty of grit and attitude. \u201cStay Clean\u201d and \u201c(I Won\u2019t) Pay Your Price\u201d keep the momentum going nicely, the former pairing a driving rhythm with washed out guitars and vocals while the latter has a more straightforward click-clack heft. I also love the swing on \u201dNo Class,\u201d self-admitted ZZ Top ripoff riff and all, as well as the interweaving bass and vocal lines of \u201cTear Ya Down.\u201d\n\nOf course, there\u2019s also a lingering sense of seventies-inspired dynamics that help set Overkill apart from the classic lineup\u2019s subsequent outings. \u201cCapricorn\u201d and \u201cMetropolis\u201d feel like the last hurrah for Lemmy\u2019s Hawkwind-isms, the former being a personal favorite as it pairs a spacey stop-start pattern with echoing vocals calling out autobiographical reflections. The closing \u201cLimb From Limb\u201d also serves as an example of the shifts in sound, as it opens on a sleazy blues crawl and climaxes on another burst of speed.\n\nAce of Spades may be the most famous Mot\u00f6rhead album, but Overkill is arguably their most important. Having already debuted with a personality-defining mission statement, this is where everything truly comes together. While the band may not have intended to be anything more ambitious than simple rock \u2018n roll, the musicianship puts forth some serious power and the songwriting has more variety than they are even given credit for. As far as I\u2019m concerned, this is their magnum opus as well as a damn near perfect album.\n",
        "\nOn first glance; the legendary Mot\u00f6rhead\u2019s 1977 self-titled debut feels rather cobbled together compared to the subsequent releases that would make them iconic. The album reflects the group\u2019s early struggles, having had a false start in 1975 that would later be released as On Parole with this album having been done in a two-day studio session in lieu of recording what was set to be their final show. The material itself is also a mixed bag, consisting of numbers from previous bands, a stray cover or two, and a couple originals that had been put together in the meantime.\n\nBut what really matters is that the band had their signature style more or less in place from the get-go. The production is rawer than future releases with more of that overt seventies flavor throughout, but their personality already shines through. Lemmy is immediately established as the domineering force with his sharp bass tone driving most of the songs and his voice having that gravelly snarl even if it\u2019s a little more melodic here. Of course, the other members don\u2019t slouch as Fast Eddie Clarke\u2019s soloing provides a bluesy edge and Philthy Animal Taylor\u2019s drumming is still loose though still working on the wild factor.\n\nThis contrast from everything else going on at the time is perhaps best demonstrated by the three songs that Lemmy had originally recorded with Hawkwind, all stripped down and made even dirtier. As much as I love the respective violin and horns on the original versions of \u201cMot\u00f6rhead\u201d and \u201dLost Johnny,\u201d these takes bring out the riffs more and hit harder. I\u2019m not quite sure if \u201cThe Watcher\u201d has enough of an anchor to fully translate from spaced out acoustics to a driving rocker, but it still keeps that ominous cynicism.\n\nAnd with that, the album\u2019s strongest moments come with the fresher material. \u201cWhite Line Fever\u201d is a powerful burst of energy with its most infectious riff set and \u201dKeep Us on the Road\u201d keeps to a steady groove. \u201cIron Horse/Born to Lose\u201d may be the most impactful track of the lot, perhaps the most enduring behind the band\u2019s self-titled song and the closest that the band gets to their psychedelic roots. \u201dVibrator\u201d is another noteworthy track as the raunchy lyrics are pretty on brand for not having been written by Lemmy.\n\nOverall, Mot\u00f6rhead is an interesting case as far as awkward debuts go. The songwriting reflects their jumbled early years and the style has more traces of their background than the forward momentum they\u2019d get after this. However, the band certainly knew how they wanted to sound and brought plenty of attitude. It\u2019s not out of character as the debuts from bands like Rush or Judas Priest, but there\u2019s still plenty of developments to come. At the very least, it\u2019s an electrifying listen for fans who want to see how the band found their footing.\n",
        "\nMot\u00f6rhead have always been a relatively simple band. Lemmy has always called them plain-and-simple \"rock 'n' roll\" but technically they're a mix of speed metal, punk rock, and hard rock. The band's first No.1 album \"No Sleep 'Til Hammersmith\" leans more into the speed metal side, with songs like \"Stay Clean\", \"Iron Horse\", and \"Mot\u00f6rhead\" all sounding more distorted and heavy than their respective album versions. Over 40 years after No Sleep was first released, how does it hold up?\n\nLet's start with the first song, a Mot\u00f6rhead staple, Ace of Spades.\n\nWhat much is there to say about Ace of Spades at this point? It's fast, it's catchy, and it was destined to be a \"hit single\" type song. They start the album with this song and deliver it well. While It's not necessarily my favorite version, it's in no way bad. The band plays 2 songs from their self-titled release, and I think these performances greatly demonstrate Mot\u00f6rhead's transition from hard rock to speed metal. Play the album version of Mot\u00f6rhead and the No Sleep version side to side, and you can immediately tell a big difference in both the bass tone and Lemmy Kilmister's vocals. I believe starting with \"Ace of Spades\" he fully embraced the deep, growl-like vocals he's known for. Of course, this applies to the self-titled songs, but what also applies is Lemmy's crunchy, distorted bass tone.\n\nI can only imagine what hearing the bass tone on this album would've sounded like live, but hearing it from my turntable makes me realize how well-calibrated Mot\u00f6rhead's roadcrew was. Speaking of, the entire band is TIGHT on this recording. Everyone plays in time with each other, but still maintains that raw, punk feeling I get with many Mot\u00f6rhead releases.\n\nAce of Spades and Overkill get the most love on the band's setlist, with Overkill songs taking up 5 songs on the setlist, and Ace of Spades songs taking up 3 songs. A bit disappointing, as songs like \"Stone Dead Forever\" from Bomber and \"Keep Us on the Road\" from Mot\u00f6rhead would've been welcome additions, especially combined with the aggressive tone Lemmy and Eddie have on their instruments (and anyways, one more song to make each side of the record even would've been nice.)\n\nDespite this, the band plays the songs from Overkill and Ace of Spades exceptionally. Overkill's title track deserved the tone it has here on it's album version, and (We Are) The Roadcrew hits all the right spots for an enjoyable Mot\u00f6rhead listen. I would argue this album is one of the best answers you can give for a definition of \"speed metal\".\n\nWith a band like Mot\u00f6rhead who have so many releases that can (admittedly) start to blend in with each other, it can be a bit difficult to pick out where to start with the English rockers. However, if you ask me what to start with, I would usually recommend No Sleep 'Til Hammersmith, as there's a good reason why it's the band's first No.1 album.\n\nCheers.\n",
        "\nSome people say Mot\u00f6rhead kept releasing the same album over and over. They are of course tone deaf folks with bad taste in music, because Lemmy tried different approach with almost every record he has released under the Mot\u00f6rhead banner. If there is one album that stands out most though, it indeed is Another Perfect Day, originally released in 1983 as the band\u2019s sixth full length studio LP. The circumstances were quite extraordinary, because \u201cFast\u201d Eddie Clarke, who played on the first 5 albums left the band following an altercation with Lemmy after the release of the previous LP, Iron Fist. The band has then recruited Brain Robertson (known from Thin Lizzy) and went on to deliver new music as quickly as possible. After all, in 1980s it was customary for a band to release a new album every year or so.\n\nThe very beginning of the record hints at its atmosphere \u2013 first we hear a snippet of a band talk and then APF kicks off properly with a signature riff played on Lemmy\u2019s famous Rickenbacker bass. The music is more relaxed than on Iron Fist, Ace of Spades or Bomber \u2013 but there is also an imminent feeling that it is a Mot\u00f6rhead album. The bass pulsates with energetic riffing rather than playing rhythm alongside Philthy Animal\u2019s drums, who has kept his position, at least for the time being (he will be replaced by Pete Gill on the next album). But inviting Brian Robertson on board meant there must have been made room for his guitar \u2013 after all, his style differed significantly from Eddie Clarke\u2019s. Instead of motoric and frugal riffing, former Thin Lizzy\u2019s axeman showcases long bluesy licks and Lemmy, writing material for Another Perfect Day, needed to take this into mind. Hence there is much more space in music, with long guitar leads and extensive solos (\u201cOne Track Mind\u201d, \u201cAnother Perfect Day\u201d, \u201cI Got Mine\u201d). This is also one of Mot\u00f6rhead\u2019s slower albums \u2013 song structures often allow for a drift toward Hawkwind\u2019s (Lemmy\u2019s previous band) territories, only that that does not happen \u2013 in Mot\u00f6rhead there is no room for space rock blur, otherwise it would lose the characteristic Mot\u00f6rhead drive. Occasionally, some keyboards are added as a spice, but that\u2019s it.\n\nThis is as much a Brain Robertson album as it it Lemmy\u2019s and that\u2019s what makes it so much different from other Mot\u00f6rhead records \u2013 the two lads seem to coexist here on equal terms, which was generally something new. Enough to say that one of the reasons Eddie Clarke left was that he wanted to have more to say, to write more music, to have more influence on the sound (he produced Iron Fist which proved to be a mistake), even tried to sing (\u201cStep Down\u201d off Bomber \u2013 the only Mot\u00f6rhead song with Clarke\u2019s vocals \u2013 also wasn\u2019t a success). Well, at least Robertson made no attempts at sharing lead vocals with Lem. However, on the tour following the release of Another Perfect Day, things between Lemmy and the new guitarist started to look uglier and uglier and as a result he was fired \u2013 APD is therefore the only Mot\u00f6rhead album he appeared on.\n\nWhat\u2019s the bottom line on Another Perfect Day then? Is it a hit or a miss? Well, despite it sounding unlike any other Mot\u00f6rhead album, it is a very enjoyable experience not only for me, but also for the vast majority of the band\u2019s fanzone. It abounds in great riffs, beautiful melodic solos and in case someone tuned in while the record was being played, there\u2019s always the distinctive Lemmy\u2019s rasp which leaves no doubt what band is playing. I do value Another Perfect Day and rank it very high in Mot\u00f6rhead discography. I must say it gets played by me more often than any other album from the band, perhaps due to it being so unique?\n\nThe 2 CD edition released by Sanctuary Records I own contains a bonus track, \u201cTurn You Round Again\u201d (b-side of \u201cI Got Mine\u201d single) as well as a second CD with a live show the band played on the APD tour in 1983 in Manchester. The concert is well over an hour long and sounds so good (both in terms of musicianship and audio quality) that it could\u2019ve been released as yet another Mot\u00f6rhead standalone live album.\n",
        "\nSix years. Is it really true, already six years? Indeed, the man who seemed to be blessed with the power to live a rockstar life eternally, died exactly six years ago. But a lot of his songs have no expiration date. Fortunately, some of them can be found on \u201cInferno\u201d.\n\nLemmy, Phil and Mikkey offered a few extremely catchy yet absolutely heavy tracks on their album from 2004. The first one I must mention is \u201cIn the Black\u201d. It consists of an ingenious riff, uncouth yet smooth verses and a chorus that jumps into your brain like a parasite that will never leave you again. Lemmy sings like he has always sung and \u2013 only the best is good enough \u2013 he delivers the second voice as well. Needless to say that the number does not only provide solid heaviness, but also the casual touch that has given a lot of Mot\u00f6rhead\u2019s tracks its special flavour. \u201cIn the Name of Tragedy\u201d is a bit darker, but it also profits from a fantastic flow, a memorable chorus and its simple construction that invites you to bang your head. I know, it\u2019s no new finding that Lemmy was always an expert in reducing music to its essentials and this song shows once again that conventional song patterns are no indication for a stale overall picture. This is all the more true as the production conveys determination, conviction and muscles. \u201cInferno\u201d bursts out of the boxes with lots of self-confidence and so the right frame is set for the songs. Already the voluminous up-tempo opener \u201cTerminal Show\u201d leaves no doubt that the album gives no reason for concern in terms of the mix. \n\nBut Lemmy has more aces (of spades) up his sleeve. His lyrics have always reflected his special view on the world. He delivers his potpourri of angry, cynical, ironic and laconic (\u201cLife is not a TV dinner\u201d) poetry which makes the musically strong songs even more enjoyable. A few times he also reflects on his own past (\u201cOur badge the ace of spades\u201d, \u201cEat the rich, life\u2019s a bitch\u201d, \u201cStay clean, be true\u201d). And so he and the other two ruffians create a cool album that avoids almost completely lukewarm stuff. This does not mean that each and every song provides an overdose of excitement. But I guess that no Mot\u00f6rhead tune ever did this after \u201cAce of Spades\u201d \u2013 and this is no problem at all, because this band offered other values: permanent reliability, dirty humor, powerful chords. That\u2019s what made them a constant, well-appreciated factor in the metal community. \n\nWith this said, the flawlessly produced \u201cInferno\u201d is not as apocalyptic as its title indicates, but most of its songs have a nearly perfect flow, a great drive and a compact arrangement. Sometimes the band borders on speed metal (\u201cFight\u201d is a distant relative of the rapid \u201cEat the Gun\u201d from \u201cOvernight Sensation\u201d), but they also take a trip to bluesy territories (the closer). Of course, a blues song is neither great nor necessary, but if there is a band that has the right to perform such a number, than it\u2019s Mot\u00f6rhead. Every now and then, a song walks the thin line between \u201cokay\u201d and \u201cmeaningless\u201d, for example \u201cIn the Year of the Wolf\u201d, but after all, there is no reason to skip a song. Even the somewhat lethargic \u201cKeys to the Kingdom\u201d spreads a certain charm, although its neighbor \u201cSmiling Like a Killer\u201d sounds much better: simple, direct, old school, simply Mot\u00f6rhead. Lemmy, we do not know exactly what you have done during the last six years, but we are happy that you and your comrades gave us such a rich legacy.\n",
        "\nI\u2019m sure that after the success that Mot\u00f6rhead had had with their first five albums that it was an unexpected occurrence when \u2018Fast\u2019 Eddie Clarke decided to move on just after the tour to support the Iron Fist album began. Given that the band seemed to find plenty of faults with that album almost immediately, perhaps it wasn\u2019t unexpected. It did give drummer Phil Taylor the opportunity to coerce Lemmy into agreeing to hire former Thin Lizzy guitarist Brian Robertson as his replacement, who then went on to help write and record the follow up, Another Perfect Day.\n\nThe most obvious thing to say about this album is\u2026 it is different. For everyone who has heard the first five studio albums, the style is immediately different. But all of those five albums had a degree of change along the way, none of them were an exact match for the previous one, so if you take this album as just a natural progression and not focus too much on the different guitaring styles of the previous guitarist and the new guitarist, you are halfway there to being able to appreciate this album for what it is rather than just dismissing it offhand because of the change. I know that I initially went down this path, completely put off by the change in guitar style especially. But once I sat down and just listened to it as an album, and not an album that Clarke had had no part of, I found a lot to like. \n\nIndeed, having been a fan of sections of Thin Lizzy\u2019s work over the years I admired most of what Robertson has to offer here. I don\u2019t think it always works, and I don\u2019t think it really settles into what you would call a Mot\u00f6rhead sound, but there\u2019s no denying it is catchy. There is almost none of the typical Lemmy bass lines and even the drumming appears much less frantic and rebellious.\n\nWas the world ready for piano on a Mot\u00f6rhead album? Robertson contributes this on the songs \u201cShine\u201d and \u201cRock It\u201d, and while it isn\u2019t a big thing it is a noticeable thing. Opening track \u201cBack at the Funny Farm\u201d has that classic bass sound to start, as does the closing track \u201cDie You Bastard!\u201d, but apart from that there is little that makes it stand out. \u201cDancing on Your Grave\u201d is probably the closest this album has to a song that fits in with the past.\n\nThe most irritating song on the album is \u201cOne Track Mind\u201d which closes out the first side of the album. It feels like five and a half minutes of the track title being repeated over and over and over again, and it is so different to most of the other material on the album. It sticks out like a sore thumb. Both \u201cJust Another Day\u201d and \u201cMarching Off to War\u201d are dominated by long instrumental breaks, including long solo sections from Robertson. The length of these is another point of difference between earlier albums. While Clarke had solo breaks they didn\u2019t dominate songs by their length. That is not the case here, Robertson seems to have plenty of time to ensure he is noticed. It\u2019s not unlikeable at all, in fact for the most point they are enjoyable, except maybe they just sound a bit too similar to each other? Perhaps. \u201cI Got Mine\" follows on a similar vein, with plenty of upbeat tempo, while \u201cTales of Glory\u201d is a short, sharp burst of what has come before.\n\nBy the end of the album, and in real comparison to the other albums that preceded it, what really pulls this back just a little bit ends up being those extended solo breaks from Robertson. It feels a bit formula-oriented, a bit too try-hard for what would make it a better or equal album to the first albums. They are not bad or Malmsteen-esque in the show-off department, but they do perhaps tend to over dominate which was not a trademark of the earlier material. Overall the songs are good. Lemmy\u2019s vocals are as good here as they probably ever got, and Taylor\u2019s drumming sounds good as well, though it feels as though it has lost its intensity and is more interested in just keep time in places. Robertson is excellent, but his style eventually holds firm that it is indeed a different era that the band has moved into. Given that it was the only album he played on, no doubt the other extenuating factors proved to be a problem as well.\n\nI enjoy this album more now than I did when I first listened to Mot\u00f6rhead and that probably has more to do with my maturing years and willingness to accept change than I used to in my youth. This is a good album (barring one notable song), but you need to take it on trust to get the most out of it.\n\n\u201cLet me hear it 'til the end of time\u201d.\n",
        "\nBlack clad, rickenbecker-bass wielding, rock and roll enthusiast Lemmy spent much of his post-Hawkwindcareer fronting Motorhead, a band that could play slow, medium and fast-paced numbers, as long as they were loud. No Sleep \u2018Til Hammersmith was a well-received live album which cast a long, often mutton-chopped shadow over the band\u2019s studio output. Put it this way, if you ask a rock fan to name a Motorhead release, the chances are, the first things they\u2019ll say is \u201cAce of Spades\u201d, and the second is No Sleep \u2018Til Hammersmith.\n\nIt takes a certain level of confidence to open a live album with your widest known hit, yet \u201cAce of Spades\u201d strides in and pummels any unbelievers in earshot into submission. This is Motorhead in all their leather-clad, biker-booted, and above all loud glory. You may not be the biggest Motorhead fan, but as statements of intent go, it\u2019s impossible to take No Sleep \u2018Til Hammersmith lightly. Actually, it\u2019s difficult to take anything that Motorhead did lightly. Motorhead were not a band that did subtlety then, but what they did was fly the flag for loud and roaring rock and roll played at thunderous volume. This is hard rock in its purest sense, with the emphasis on a cavalier attitude to personal hygiene, grunted vocals, audible sweat, dedications to the audience, bandmates and roadies, and the sense that, even if many of their songs follow a tried and true pattern, their fans wouldn\u2019t want it any other way.\n\nIs it a work of art? No, but Motorhead weren\u2019t about the art, they were about delivering their idiosyncratic brand of rock and roll to their faithful fans. The sense of passion you get from the audience is palpable, and the same goes for the band too, as they\u2019re evidently in love with what they\u2019re doing. No Sleep \u2018Til Hammersmith is the sound of a band at the top of their game and absolutely nailing it at break-neck speed. Okay, so there\u2019s precious little in the way of sonic variation, but this is Motorhead, so how much sonic variation do you expect?\n\nIn an era when musicians are still desperate to convince us all how rock and roll they are by repeatedly telling us how rock and roll they are, it\u2019s refreshing to put on No Sleep \u2018Til Hammersmith and remind yourself that the true rock and roll legends never have to tell us how rock and roll they are, we just know.\n",
        "\nLetting go of the past can be a difficult thing in and of itself, but when it is filled with so many iconic artists and works as the glory days of heavy metal were, it borders on sheer impossibility. British hard rockers turned unwitting heavy metal trailblazers Motorhead have been no exception to this fact, as a multiplicity of posthumous releases turning up since the outfit\u2019s iconic front man and founder Lemmy Kilmister in late 2015. While some of these releases have been the usual box sets and related fodder for hardcore fans that consider exclusive material to be optional, a fair number of obscure live versions of various songs have also been making the rounds over the past few years, arguably paving the way for something a bit more substantial. Sure enough, with just over 5 years having passed since Lemmy hung up his leathers to sing with the angels, Silver Lining Music has unleashed a highly polished keepsake from the latter days of this powerhouse outfit\u2019s illustrious career.\n\nTo the casual observer, Louder Than Noise\u2026Live In Berlin might seem a superfluous release given that the corresponding Kings Of The Road tour that ran from 2010 until late 2012 had already seen two major live releases while it was still going on. However, in contrast to the The World Is Ours \u2013 Vol. 1 & 2, this particular offering stands more as a standalone concert event than a compilation of multiple touring stops, a format more conducive to both the video medium and the online streaming one that has been all the rage of late. Likewise, the production job of Herwig Meyszner, whose work with noted metal veterans such as Saxon, Exodus and Kreator has resulted in some truly spectacular home viewing experiences, provides a unique cinematic quality to the finished product that makes the event seem all the more realistic. With the memory of the days when Lemmy was still raising a ruckus across the entire globe still fresh in everyone\u2019s minds, this is a performance of mostly obligatory classics that will appeal to veteran followers and newcomers alike.\n\nAs with most of Motorhead\u2019s latter day live appearances, the album being toured upon is sparsely represented in the set list, an irony not likely lost on most given Lemmy\u2019s frequent complaints that few seemed to be giving the band\u2019s new material a fair shake. Nevertheless, while \u201cI Know How To Die\u201d was the lone representative of 2010\u2019s The World Is Yours to make the cut, it proves to be a fine up tempo banger to kick things off with and brings home the grit and grime with the best of them. Few things have changed between the band\u2019s inception and where they ultimately ended up, as the lone representative from the band to the 2010s found on here blends in seamlessly with the next three heavy hitters \u201cDamage Case\u201d, \u201cStay Clean\u201d and \u201cMetropolis\u201d, each of which are more than 30 years the opening song\u2019s senior and among the more punchy yet bluesy offerings off 1979\u2019s Overkill.\n\nOld tricks tend to be the best ones, and as the rest of the performance unfolds, it\u2019s pretty clear that despite the massive back catalog of material to draw upon, the lion\u2019s share of this performance if focused upon the heyday of this outfit when Fast Eddie Clarke and Philthy Animal were still involved. Suffice it to say, drummer Mikkey Dee and guitarist Phil Campbell do an exemplary job of emulating the signature sounds of their predecessors, with standout moments including their renditions of the AC/DC-like hard rocker \u201cOver The Top\u201d and the boisterous closing rendition of \u201cAce Of Spades\u201d. Phil winds up stealing the show about halfway through with a rather auspiciously technical guitar solo slot dubbed \u201cString Theory\u201d, accompanied by a lone droning keyboard line and culminating in a rather unconventional moment for a band that generally eschews the virtuoso end of heavy metal. Other solid offerings that represented the subsequent four-piece era of Motorhead includes \u201cThe One To Sing The Blues\u201d and \u201cGoing To Brazil\u201d, which are also notably more technically adventurous than the late 70s and early 80s bangers from the Clarke and Animal days.\n\nThe world may seem a bit less interesting without the trailblazing figures that were responsible for crafting half of the songs found here, and there is definitely a bittersweet element to hearing the gravely brilliance of a man who wasn\u2019t past his prime until a few months prior to having both feet in the grave. All the same, the sheer scope of material that exists under the Motorhead name is a gift that should not be passed up, and while this concert largely falls back on most of the better known material of the distant past, it offers a stellar showing by the band towards the end of their run and quells any notion of one being too old to rock. This outfit defined the concept of the power trio, and while in their own minds they were simply playing rock \u2018n\u2019 roll louder and messier than the rest, that is essentially what birthed the subsequent heavy metal explosion of the 80s, and Lemmy\u2019s own sentiments to the contrary notwithstanding, this concert underscores why they were so influential upon it.\n\nOriginally written for Sonic Perspectives (www.sonicperspectives.com)\n",
        "\nThe New Wave of British Heavy Metal in the early 1980's is commonly thought to be the point at which this loud and larger than life genre of music began to gain steam and become much faster and more aggressive, but one need look no further than the early work of Mot\u00f6rhead (okay, punk is important in the equation too) for a sense of where the increased focus on speed came from. In early 1979, Overkill was released and its title track is to this day considered an indispensable influence on speed metal, and in 1980 the band would release the not even remotely overrated Ace of Spades which was the recipe for sheer badassery. And yet, the more balanced and paced Bomber, seems to be the band's most overlooked early album - a shame, because it's the most essential Mot\u00f6rhead album for my money. However, having been released in October 1979, it was sandwiched between their two most popular albums. Despite this, it doesn't really matter to me that Overkill came first, because Bomber was still ahead of its time for 1979 and showed enough songwriting progression from Lemmy and co. to be an extremely worthy follow-up album not even a full year later.\n\nHerein, though, lies the disadvantage of releasing more than one album in such a short span of time. One or more of them is likely to be overlooked, and it just so happens that the two more canonically important albums overshadow the one that is the most varied and consistent of the bunch. Like I said above, there's a great deal of fully realized songwriting chops on display on Bomber; it's got plenty of hooks which are usually just a few simple notes or power chords like in the main riffs of \"Lawman\" and \"Sharpshooter\", not to mention the main bassline of \"Stone Dead Forever.\" I feel that it's overall a bit riffier fare than on Overkill, both on these balls-out tracks and on slower ones like \"Sweet Revenge\", which is much more involved than the bluesier songs Mot\u00f6rhead had done up to this point like \"Capricorn.\" However, it never reaches Sabbath levels of emphatic riffiness (which defined heavy metal music in general), therefore still lending the music the looser, more rock 'n' roll feel that makes this band feel so charming and timeless. \n\nBomber is also really well-paced, and I love that. Side A is pretty much flawless since it's got kind of a valley structure; \"Dead Men Tell No Tales\" is really energetic and inspires the listener with a good message about staying clean (if nothing else I always sing \"but I don't care for lies!\" to myself), but then the album gradually slows down before picking up again on Sharpshooter. \"Poison\" might be slightly less memorable than the first four songs, but there's really nothing truly bad I can say about that song, either. Side B is honestly even better, though - I especially like \"All the Aces\" and \"Talking Head\", since they're the prime examples of satisfying deep cuts for full-album listeners. In fact, I whenever I include \"Traditional Heavy Metal\" bands on my playlists to break up the Grave, Incantation, and Bolt Thrower, I'll usually throw \"Talking Head\" into the shuffle. Finally, you get an awesome burst of energy to close out the album with the titular \"Bomber\", which showed Lemmy's interest in history as much as women and having a good time. This is definitely an album where I prefer the older CD pressings without the bonus tracks. The live songs and B-sides are cool on the Sanctuary reissue, but this album feels complete as it is, clocking in just under 37 minutes.\n\nSo that's all I have to say about Mot\u00f6rhead's third album. It's their best early album because it has the most variety and no filler at all. Ultimately a pretty humble album, it's nothing the average rock or metal fan won't get down with even if they do prefer Overkill or Ace of Spades. For me though, this album is a desert island necessity because it's feel-good kinda stuff and that's generally not the music I gravitate towards. And yet, there's not a ton that I have to say about this album, because it's rock 'n' roll, nothing more and certainly nothing less!\n",
        "\nLemmy (R.I.P.) was a challenge. He challenged the laws of ageing, the alcohol industry and academic music fans. He was a thorn in the side of people who thought (with good reasons) that there are better hobbies than collecting Nazi memorabilia. And sometimes he even called on his followers to fight. This was mostly the case whenever he had recorded a ballad. Many of them are really not the shit you want to smoke. \u201cDon\u2019t Let Daddy Kiss Me\u201d is among these examples for a calm Mot\u00f6rhead song gone wrong. That\u2019s a pity, because its empathic lyrics are remarkable, but the musical execution sucks. To be honest, it sucks completely and right from the beginning. Lemmy\u2019s voice opens the track and it sounds weak, powerless and odd. Is this the same singer who claims \u201cI am the voice of broken glass\u201d, a line from \u201cBurner\u201d? Anyhow, \u201cDon\u2019t Let Daddy Kiss Me\u201d would have been a noteworthy poem, but as a piece of music it belongs in the trash can.\n\nFortunately, \u201cBastards\u201d as a whole deserves a much more positive description. There are probably not many dudes who count this album to Mot\u00f6rhead\u2019s most relevant albums and I do neither, but it definitely shows its muscles. Apart from the terrible ballad, the quartet (yes, quartet) covers the range from good time rockers with piano support (\u201cBad Woman\u201d) over pretty harsh, rock \u2019n\u2019 roll inspired tracks to speed / thrash metal. The last category is represented by the excellent \u201cBurner\u201d. Here Lemmy\u2019s vocals really sound like clashing glass, while the restlessly advancing guitars and the hammering drums form an outstanding speedster in the catalogue of the legend. By the way, this song kicks off the best part of the album. The directly following \u201cDeath or Glory\u201d is another intensive, swift number. Mikkey Dee swings the hammers and his comrades at the (bass) guitars do not hesitate to show their fresh, energetic and impulsive side as well. The lyrics of \u201cDeath or Glory\u201d appear as Mot\u00f6rhead\u2019s version of the lyrics of \u201cSympathy for the Devil\u201d, but with an emphasis on World War II, how could it be otherwise? Finally, \u201cI Am the Sword\u201d brings the album back on a more rocking yet still heavy track. These three highlights have all that it needs to enrich a Mot\u00f6rhead album; they are compact and avoid useless gimmicks, they sound straight and catchy, they enthuse with directness and the typical Lemmy paradox: this filthy purity that made his band (and himself) to something special. \n\nHowever, this trio after the somewhat unspectacular opener is not the only reason to enjoy the album. \u201cLiar\u201d, a bone-dry headbanger, grabs you by the collar, no matter whether it is blue or white. I always liked the fact that Mot\u00f6rhead can provide a good mood, but they can be very humourless as well. \u201cLiar\u201d confirms this thesis with regard to its second part. \u201cLost in the Ozone\u201d also reflects a surprisingly serious and thoughtful band. Moreover, the melancholy of the lyrics is underlined by the dragging tempo of this song. I don\u2019t want to say that I was surprised about the fact that Lemmy was a thinking man, but I did not know so far that he also took care about the climate. Religion, World War II, politics, okay \u2013 but here he broadened the spectrum. \n\nApart from the differences in terms of style and tempo, all songs benefit from the voluminous and powerful production. The guitars have an all-embracing sound, the drums are perfectly staged and Lemmy is, well, Lemmy. With all his authenticity, vocal constraints and perpetual unrest. The mid-paced \u201cWe Bring the Shake\u201d with its flawless flow is the final jewel, before the repetitive yet solid \u201cDevils\u201d, carried by a simple yet decent riff, brings the album to an end. It clocks in at 48 minutes, but its impact lasts longer. Or is there anybody out there who does not want to listen to some songs again?\n",
        "\nSpoilers - Lemmy dies.\n\nShocked? Why? It's been a few years, you know the story, there's nothing new under the sun yada yada, blah blah.\n\nEvery and any band has recorded and released their ever-so special tribute to the unique and ballsy personality of Lemmy and the rest of Mot\u00f6rhead, chocked with yawns and clich\u00e9s, and they all pale, PALE, next to the force this band actually was. Airbourne, Saxon, Metallica, bands I like, none of them come close to what Mot\u00f6rhead actually stood for and played. \n\nIn 2020, it's sacrilege to even question dead people. That's not a new phenomenon, but it feels especially acute, seeing as any fame-hungry dickhead will jump on any criticism (perceived or otherwise) of the American \"liberal\" (Americans don't know what this word means) movement as endorsement of their short-sighted dogma, even through a tenuous connection. Consequently, any allegations of Mot\u00f6rhead as rock dinosaurs will be jumped on by non-fans as evidence of evil leftist agendas trying to shut down rock n roll. These commentators need to shut the fuck up. \n\nLemmy, Phil and Mikkey are above all of that, and as such, their final collaborative effort needs to be judged as an album, not some statement of a movement, culture or ideology they are not a part of and likely have no interest in. \n\nReady? Good.\n\nThis is a Mot\u00f6rhead album. There aren't any revelations, new directions or experiments to be found. It's an album that does what Mot\u00f6rhead does. If you what experimental, listen to 'Another Perfect Day'. \n\nLemmy's lyrical talent seems to have been downplayed among aficionados and critics alike, which is frustrating, because they all seem poignant and relevant to me. Lemmy probably knew he was facing an imminent death, and although this bleeds through in some songs, his irreverent and 'don't give a fuck' attitude overwhelms any despair. His vocal performance is energetic, although if you point out it's not as powerful and more reliant on vocal layering, I will reply 'Yeah, and? Man was pushing 70, allow it.' Please get to 70 and have the energy to get out of bed, let alone into a vocal booth to record lyrics you wrote down, and then moan it's not as powerful as a 33 year old. I have done enough stints in healthcare and seen enough granny fanny to recognise not everyone gets to be an active senior citizen.\n\nThe rhythm duo of guitar and drums are as powerful as always, Phil and Mikkey are a good team, and their aggression and energy seeps through, elevating the album beyond expectations. \n\nIn terms of the music, it is the mix of heavy bluesy rock and punk attitude that Mot\u00f6rhead has epitomised throughout their career. If you ignore the fact it is (or pretend it isn't) their final album together, you probably wouldn't believe it. The snarling, rebellious attitude is present in every song. Even the Mot\u00f6rballad, 'Til The End', gives the musicial middle-finger to convention and what is expected from an over-the-hill band. \n\nListen to this album. Blast it loud. Let it wash over you. Tell me when it's over that you think it's average album from a band on their way out and I might believe you that YOU believe that. \n\nTo me, this is as good a swansong as anyone could hope for. This album is a the chair over the head to anyone who believes in getting old and letting go peacefully. Every song slaps. The band is tight. If Lemmy hadn't died, they would have kept going. That's the takeaway. This isn't a dying gasp, but rather a band cut down when they had more to give. \n\nNone of the musical tributes seem to capture that. Everyone seems to accept it was fine for the band to go and 'This is what Lemmy would want'. This album begs to differ. You can drag up every example of Lemmy's voice deteriorating or recycled riffs and I will tell you 'They were still there, still playing and trying to tour worldwide.' This isn't a perfect album because it is the best musical representation and send-off to a legendary band, but because it was the last album before the fucking shocking news of Lemmy's death. No one expected it, no one wanted to believe it and when you listen to this album, years on from the fact, you still can't fully accept it. \n\nAs an aside, this review is light on actual musical critique. It's a Mot\u00f6rhead album - you know what you'll get. Music isn't just about the 4/4 drum beats, the professional production or the endless riffs and solos, which this album possesses. Sometimes, it's about the way it makes you feel, and how you know everything will be alright, even when reality begs to differ, \n\nI love Mot\u00f6rhead, and I love this album. \n\nRock on.\n",
        "\nEven four years after Lemmy\u2019s last drink (on earth), one question is still unanswered. That\u2019s surprising, because the relevance of this open issue cannot be over-estimated. Who the hell is the man in the centre of the cover? A goddamned beardless doppelganger of Lemmy? Must be something like that, I guess. Anyway, \u201cOvernight Sensation\u201d, probably the most ironical or even cynical album title of Mot\u00f6rhead, is no album that needed an ugly artwork to be overlooked. Back in 1996, Mot\u00f6rhead and everything else that called itself metal was totally out. Okay, there were some obviously imbecile children in Norway that entertained a small circle of probably equally insane creatures with a crude mix of noise, suicide and murder. But a movement whose main protagonists were mostly criminals could not last very long, right? So one could be happy that Lemmy tried to hold high the banner of real metal - even before Darkthrone\u2019s Fenriz had opened the doors to the altar of the eponymous church.\n\nBut Norway aside, the presumably shabbiest trio in the history of our music offered eleven tracks that gave a little hope in the dark times of metal. The most unusual song is \u201cI Don\u2019t Believe a Word\u201d, a semi-ballad and a kind of trivial backyard drama with well-hung guitar lines and a multiple Lemmy who accompanies himself while singing both the frustrated lead vocals and the pretty consumptive background choirs. Anyway, Lemmy here proved once again that it does not need a powerful, well-developed voice to sound charismatic. By contrast, the faster songs did not offer much room for expressive vocals \u2013 and there were some pieces that gave full speed ahead. Mot\u00f6rhead were flirting with speed metal in tracks like \u201cCivil War\u201d, \u201cShoot That Gun\u201d or \u201cThem Not Me\u201d. Of course, their albums had never been known for inextricable complexity and in these short and poisonous outbursts Mot\u00f6rhead made clear what they could do best. Nevertheless, \u201cOvernight Sensation\u201d does not put all its eggs in one basket. \u201cBroken\u201d, for example, is a casual headbanger that surprises with an earworm-chorus. We can assume that Lemmy had found out relatively early in his life that melodies can make a song better, but mostly he preferred to keep this finding private. Given this situation, \u201cBroken\u201d marks a welcome exception.\n\n\u201cOvernight Sensation\u201d was neither an album that catapulted the reputation of the band into new dizzying heights nor did it cause any kind of damage. Even the pretty superfluous harmonica in \u201cCrazy Like a Fox\u201d is endurable. During their entire career, Mot\u00f6rhead had been an authentic unit and the here presented album underlines this due to its non-experimental character. On the other hand this means that the full-length is prone to run-of-the-mill tracks from time to time. Of course, the manual dexterity is out of question and to be honest, Mikkey Dee\u2019s drumming is not that difficult \u2013 but technical flawlessness alone has never shaped a good tune. Aside from this self-evident fact, the album with the surprisingly conciliatory closer (a soft yet acceptable song) fulfilled its mission, because it came as a more than sufficient sign of life; both Mot\u00f6rhead and heavy metal were still living. And as if this hadn\u2019t been enough, Lemmy added another very important statement in the booklet, a message of barely assessable implications. \u201cLemmy Sez: Blah Blah Woof Woofa.\u201d Frankly speaking, he was simply right. As always. And of course, I agree. Especially to Woofa. Rest in peace, hero of the four strings. Can\u2019t say that I miss you every day, but the history of metal without your contribution in terms of music, lyrics and attitude is hardly imaginable.\n",
        "\nThis split is a sore spot for many fans. They'll tell you how poor Wendy O. Williams' vocals are (apparently her scratchy wailing is a bad pairing for the angelic voice of... Lemmy Kilmister), but the real reason is that the split has entered Mot\u00f6rhead lore as the catalyst for the departure of guitarist Fast Eddie Clarke marking the end of the band's classic lineup. Had Lemmy not carried on the band (quite ably I might add), then Williams would probably be a hated scapegoat much as Yoko Ono once was. Though the story of Clarke's displeasure with this collaboration (on which he acted as producer) comes from the band members themselves, the reasonable assumption is that this was merely the final straw in a relationship that had already soured. If Kilmister and Clarke were on the best terms with no tension between them but were then torn asunder by recording a duet for a mere EP, then some other bullshit would have parted their ways had Williams not come along* (and it'd be amazing they made it as long as they did (and yes, we're done with parentheticals for this paragraph)).\n\nTime has brought not only sobriety to our assessment of the drama behind the making of this split but kindness to our judgment of the music within. Maybe in 1982 it was the height of gimmickry for metal/punk royalty to turn to Tammy Wynette for material, but after slews of metal and heavy rock bands covering pop songs for yucks despite the joke not being funny in the first place, \u201cStand by Your Man\u201d is positively staid being neither ironic nor goofy. Wynette's lyrics convey heartache with the simple sincerity of the best country music. The traditional values it espouses are belied by the wounded resignation of lines like \u201cYou'll have bad times/And he'll have good times\u201d. Then there's \u201c'Cause after all, he's just a man\u201d by which Wynette likely meant he's human therefore fallible, but which is open to a less nice reading taking a jab at men as a group. Good lyrics being insufficient for major pop success, \u201cStand by Your Man\u201d was a radio smash, and then bona fide classic, because it's also a right banger, a quality not lost in Wendy and Lemmy's rendition. The tempo is cranked up and it's more boisterous even disregarding the metal instrumentation. What a shame these two didn't record more songs together. Their sandpaper voices would not be mistaken for one another, but so many timbral similarities abound that they'd be matched together on any dating site worth its salt. Were their voices characters in a romcom and they didn't end up together by the movie's end, it would be met with a resounding \u201cThe fuck?\u201d Intonation reveals the main differences: Kilmister is steady, controlled whilst Williams is wild, explosive, though she's also capable of singing in a regular, pleasant tone; something not displayed on this song.\n\nIn that reliable split format, two covers\u2014one of and by each band\u2014comprise the B side. \u201cMasterplan\u201d, a cut from Beyond the Valley of 1984, is Mot\u00f6rhead's choice and a fine one it is for a rendition that is exceptional in its adequacy. Unlike the infamous A side, a fast rocker is precisely what you'd expect the band to be playing, with Lemmy's bark being a cozy fit for the angry, subversive message. Basically it's faithful, though the solo is shortened and the production is raw to the point of adding a new layer of harshness. It is not as harsh as the Plasmatics' cover of \u201cNo Class\u201d in which Williams' vocals continually peak. This is a description not a criticism. Such raw production distinguishes this version from the one that appeared on their magnum opus Coup d'\u00c9tat released the same year. Even the version on the demo recordings of that album (later released as Coup de Grace) is not so rough, sounding merely unpolished. Any skepticism about the Plasmatics' ability to do this song justice can be quelled with this fact: on the live album Everything Louder than Everyone Else Lemmy dedicates \u201cNo Class\u201d to Wendy who'd recently died. She committed suicide on April 6, 1998, the same date that saw the death of Tammy Wynette.\n\nStand by Your Man bears a strong resemblance to St. Valentine's Day Massacre, the last of several splits Mot\u00f6rhead released with Girlschool the year prior, and though that one is more solid musically, it doesn't fascinate the way this one does. The first ladies of NWOBHM shouldn't feel bad; it's hard for any band to be as interesting as Wendy O. Williams and the Plasmatics.\n\n\n*There is another side of the story that hasn't been explored. While writing this review, I came across High Roller Records listing for Coup de Grace in which it is claimed by Gene of Plasmatics Media (no last name is given) that the real source of strife during the recording session was the heavy drug and alcohol use by Mot\u00f6rhead.\n",
        "\nCrusader, Born in America, Metal Heart, and Iron Fist. What do all these albums have in common, besides the fact they all sound like hashtags on a Fox News Tweet? They're all albums released by talented bands, early in their career, in a time when heavy metal was at its peak popularity. And yet they all suck. (I'm talking about Riot's Born in America, in case there was any confusion.) There appeared to be a bizarre, sweeping epidemic of incompetence afflicting veteran metal bands, with symptoms ranging from nagging coughs (Point of Entry) to vomiting black blood (Crusader), and even Mot\u00f6rhead, a band routinely celebrated for their godlike consistency, wasn't immune.\n\nTo my ears, Iron Fist is their worst 80's album without any close competition. The banality and bone idleness of forgotten bupkis like 'Speedfreak' and 'Shut it Down' was not due to an X-Files-esque \"auditory sickness\", of course, but rather the result of a group resting hard on their laurels after the massively successful sleeper hit Ace of Spades. Which is an album you may have heard of. And if you also happen to be familiar with its title track, you may get acute deja vu from the thrumming bass riff that introduces 'Iron Fist', followed by its entire copy-pasted song structure. This is among the more egregious examples of Mot\u00f6rhead's penchant for self-quotation, which, contrary to the hearts and minds of most fans, will become a very bad habit throughout their career. Iron Fist's notable lack of creativity, not to mention lack of finesse and completion, was by Lemmy's own admission, by the way. Iron Fist was, in fact, his least favorite album.\n\nIf you're wondering why nearly every composition ends with an unceremonious fadeout after two minutes and some change, it's because these songs were indeed incomplete. Literally unfinished. Not only that, but the riffs that propel them are considerably less bluesy, soulful and imaginative than what I'm used to, with most getting the job done in the same way a paperboy \"gets the job done\" by flinging the newspaper through your front window. While stiff, chunky rock riffs roll across the floor through a shower of broken glass, you get the feeling most songs were penned with a decidedly British \"That'll do\" punctuating every bar. No rewarding crescendo, hardly a noteworthy setpiece to be found. Even Fast Eddie's solos just can't be assed. '(Don't Need) Religion' is one of the worst culprits, with a handful of slow, messy, tuneless licks that make themselves known for all of fourteen seconds.\n\nAnd speaking of messy, the sloppy kiss of death is an awful production that plunged almost every decibel into a hollow, tinny chasm that wholly contradicts the album's nomenclature. Every decibel except Philthy's, of course, whose drums sound like they're echoing from some distant, Eldritch plane. I'm not the first person to say this and I won't be the last; Iron Fist, due to its production and slothful approach to a genre they had just finished perfecting, should have been an EP. Take a listen to 'I'm the Doctor' and 'Bang to Rights', two of the more competent, thrashy sleaze-fests this album casually boasts, and you've officially strip mined all the value out of Mot\u00f6rhead's very first clunker.\n",
        "\nSo I was planning to start this review with a big spiel about how I first heard 'Ace of Spades' from the Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 soundtrack, and how my mind was blown when I found out Lemmy and Wendy O' were more than just Koopa Kids from Super Mario World. I toyed with the idea of using my geeky anecdotes to illustrate Mot\u00f6rhead's cultural omnipresence; how even a shut-in weirdo like me managed to stumble across them before the internet, and before my formal introduction to heavy metal. But ultimately, it felt like a cheap justification for a meaningless endeavor. I know no one cares. I know my life is irrelevant. Makes me wonder what I'm doing writing a review for this album at all. Or why I write at all. Or why I exist at all.\n\n...Ace of Spades, to the seething disdain of their long-suffering and much-bereaved frontman, is the Mot\u00f6rhead album. Not necessarily the most varied, nor the most interesting, nor the best. Just, the. It's the one we all think of first, and don't even deny it. No matter how big, small, or non-existent of a fan you are, the word 'Mot\u00f6rhead' conjures up an image of the classic lineup dressed as swarthy bandaleros in a valley. End of story. It's kinda like, no matter how smart you are, if someone says 'Frankenstein', you immediately picture the big groaning monster instead of the scientist. There's no shame in it; it's just how things are. I suppose the most pressing question on today's agenda is simple. Do you share my greed, and is the only album you need, the Ace of Spades? The Ace of Spades?\n\nIt's a blues metal barbecue that's every bit as invigorating, spicy, and artery-clogging as its reputation suggests, much like Saxon's Wheels of Steel. Released just a few months apart, and sharing quite a bit in terms of song structures, impetus, and public opinion, if you like one album you're almost guaranteed to like the other. A savage haymaker in the form of its title track is followed up by an onslaught of filthy, minimalist batterings. Considering the way people talk about this album, it'd be reasonable to assume Ace of Spades is just half an hour of complete silence after the title track has had its fun. On the contrary, it's remarkable how \"never\" this album lets up. Bold and incursive in its proliferation of blues, rock, and proto-speed metal, Fast Eddie simply outdoes himself with luminiscent setpieces and teeth-kicking solos, and the ferocious tempos mean a constant workout for Philthy as well.\n\nOn the flip side, dare I say Ace of Spades is Mot\u00f6rhead's most accessible album, even moreso than the slow and moody Bomber. Stuffed with cherished favorites like '(We Are) The Roadcrew', 'The Chase is Better than the Catch', and of course the title track, if this album isn't commercial, it's certainly lent itself nicely to being commercialized, ex post facto. And don't mistake that for a criticism; when vulgar compositions are capturing the imagination of the mainstream audience, it speaks volumes of their songwriting quality and capacity for memorable melody. The mainstream audience in 1980, no less, when people were wondering whether Jethro Tull was heavy metal.\n\nAt the risk of inverted crucifixion, I was never fond of '(We Are) The Roadcrew', and I can't stand 'Jailbait'. Subject matter notwithstanding (in both cases), I can't shake the feeling of meandering contrivance trammeling these tracks, in stark contrast to the natural, gutsy dynamism of, say, 'Damage Case'. Chalk that up as them being the rare few mid-tempo tracks surrounded by an album-full of bloodthirsty speed metal werewolves. I'm well aware I occupy a microscopic minority when I rag on '(We Are) The Roadcrew'. Sorry folks, that chorus gets stuck in my head in the worst way possible. But don't worry; I'm sure we'll all agree on their next album.\n",
        "\nIf any aspect of warfare could ever be considered glamorous, I'd bet most people would say dogfighters. There's the superhuman bravery and prowess of their pilots, not to mention the sensuous aerodynamic designs of the aircraft themselves. Most every Brit drools over the voluptuous curves of the Spitfire, just as Yanks do over the striking stature of the P40 Tomahawk. I'm more of a Mitsubishi A6M man, myself. The point I'm trying to make, though, is that bombers are on the complete opposite end of this spectrum. They're the hulking, ugly, graceless monsters of warfare, responsible only for the dirtiest of a conflict's dirty work. No one on Earth has a \"favorite\" bomber... except maybe Sabaton. So with all that said, guess what Mot\u00f6rhead took a shine to.\n\nPossessing the same fiery impetus as the album released just seven months before it, albeit played noticeably slower and smoother, it's easy for me to equate Bomber to Saxon's Denim & Leather. As I illuminated in my Saxon marathon, the two NWOBHM elder gods had a bit of a buddy system going on; similar touring schedules and similar veneration for 50's and 60's rock legends led to many similarities in their musical trajectory. Mot\u00f6rhead was of course the irresponsible uncle and bands like Saxon and Tank were the impressionable nephews. That being said, I wouldn't be surprised if Saxon was inspired by Bomber when writing their more 'accommodating' album Denim & Leather.\n\nRest assured, I'm not implying Mot\u00f6rhead wrote a single stanza of music with critics or the mainstream in mind. God no. However, I do surmise they made the executive decision to dial back on their own aggression after Overkill tore everyone's heads off, probably to distance themselves from the fast-approaching NWOBHM label. Remember, Lemmy never ever wanted to be called heavy metal, thus, a finely bred habitarium of down-tempo, introspective blues ballads were well in order, with 'Sweet Revenge' and 'Step Down' moving glacially slow with mesmerizing, pendular rhythms, and the latter not even featuring the coaly lungs of Lemmy. Meanwhile, 'Lawman' and 'Sharpshooter' are hot and sticky cruisers that are not to be headbanged to, but rather played through the speakers of a '72 Lincoln Town Car.\n\nBut what about the title track? Or the furious combination of devilish solos throughout 'Stone Dead Forever'? Or the utterly ruinous chorus of 'All the Aces', punctuated with the fattest rock n' roll changeups known to man? All perfectly reasonable pieces of counter-evidence to my theory, I confess, though I would emphasize that all three tracks still have somewhat moseying bloodlust by Overkill's standards. Anyone who's listened to No Sleep 'Til Hammersmith (which, by rights, should be everyone on Earth by now) will note how much better the title track sounds when played that teensy bit faster.\n\nSo there's an endearing slothfulness present throughout Bomber. Definitely not Mot\u00f6rhead's harshest, a strong contender for their most accessible to the uninitiated, and early evidence to the fact that Mot\u00f6rhead albums do not, in fact, all sound the same. If you can surmount this, the production as thin as giftwrap, and the rare instances of filler (*ahem* 'Poison' *cough*), your reward is a series of mellow, cowboy boot-wearing blues gems piled somewhere in Mot\u00f6rhead's dragon hoard of classics.\n",
        "\nI remember a time when little Tanuki was sitting in an elementary school music class, with unfocused eyes drifting around the room, probably thinking about Monster Rancher, while my teacher tried desperately to get a class full of morons to give a shit about Dizzy Gillespie. As my boredom reached escape velocity, I found myself reading some of the posters on the walls. \"If it wasn't for the blues,\" one said, \"there'd be no rock n' roll, hip hop, pop, EDM, or heavy metal.\" And at the time, I remember thinking \"Wow, what a stupid poster. Dizzy Gillespie sounds nothing like Bolt Thrower.\" As the years progressed, so did my wondrous voyage through Mot\u00f6rhead's discography. And gradually that poster made a lot more sense.\n\nThat was an extremely convoluted way of saying \"Overkill is heavily influenced by blues\", which I imagine you knew already. Or did you? You see, Overkill is most known for being an incalculable influence on extreme metal subgenres, so much so that nary a thought is spared for its influences. And this is where things get interesting. Beyond the anvil-striking fury of 'Tear Ya Down' and the legendary double-bass rhythm of the title track, Overkill is simply an overhaul of its wishy-washy predecessor. They took a more courageous approach to songwriting, galvanizing it with an abrasive edge without caring what other people might think. Hence, this is the first album where Lemmy growls from opener to closer, Fast Eddie's riffs are all smoke-venting dynamos, and of course, Philthy's thunderous polyrhythms pioneer much of what's implemented in thrash and speed metal to this day.\n\nYou want the best examples of the resultant 80%-proof blues metal savagery? How about we start with the not-so-great examples first; it's a much shorter list. 'No Class', as many others have pointed out, is a flagrant rip-off of ZZ Top's 'Tush'. It offers no changeups or bridges of its own, simply allowing its solitary riff to carry its comatose body to the finish line without any fanfare. Why this rudderless do-nothing song got so much airtime throughout Mot\u00f6rhead's entire career is one of the greatest mysteries of the universe. Luckily, two spectacular tracks surround it, assuaging Overkill's lone instance of filler. On one end we have the sleazy rock n' roll shuffles of 'Damage Case', featuring megaton riffing and a billowing performance from Lemmy's rarely-heard higher registers.\n\nOn the other side, we have a mammoth blues spectacle by the name of 'Capricorn', solemnly representing the doomier, more oppressive side of Mot\u00f6rhead. Saturnine and relentlessly burdensome in aspect, icy blues licks, immuring bass, and hauntingly brilliant lyricism are all cloaked in a celestial reverb. It sounds like it's singing straight from Master of Reality's occult hymn book. It, alongside similarly paced numbers 'Metropolis' and 'Limb from Limb', are mystic doom flirtations stunningly articulated, and akin to what Al Atkins was getting up to after leaving Judas Priest. Still doesn't sound anything like Dizzy Gillespie, though.\n",
        "\nPop-quiz for the three people on the internet interested in reading my thoughts on a Mot\u00f6rhead album: Is there a more expertly articulated opening track that expresses full musical intent, than the revving engine and teeth-rattling bassline of Mot\u00f6rhead's 'Mot\u00f6rhead' from Mot\u00f6rhead? The correct answer is yes. Black Sabbath's Black Sabbath from Black Sabbath. But Mot\u00f6rhead is a very close second. While Iommi and the boys cultivated doom metal from blues and rock, Mot\u00f6rhead was using those genres to gift NWOBHM to the world. Just, um... not quite yet, unfortunately.\n\nLemmy's infamous quote about Mot\u00f6rhead \"never being a metal band\" actually finds relevance in the context of their perplexingly humble 1977 debut. The aforementioned title track is as heavy as this album gets, and even then, we're dealing with a fleetfooted jive written in a similar mindset to Saxon's 'Stallions of the Highway' or 'Still Fit to Boogie' from their 1979 self-titled debut. The stampede of Hawkwind covers (more accurately described as repurposed tracks from Lemmy's time in Hawkwind) feature jaunty major-scale riffing and clean-ish vocals, of all things. As a result, frolicking punk affair like 'Vibrator' and 'The Watcher' will sound decidedly alien to most fans. Add to that the atypically reserved rolling drumlines and terse guitar solos that enter and exit the spotlight as abruptly as a Ronda Rousey comeback, and it becomes evident that Mot\u00f6rhead was indeed written in cautious veneration of 50's blues and rock n' roll paragons, with much less time devoted to inventing new metal subgenres. How selfish, right?\n\nThat's not to say Mot\u00f6rhead's calling cards are completely missing in action. Even as early as 1977, Lemmy's distorted bass was sounding like an electric guitar with a headcold, and most tracks put his gravelly baritone to good use. Their masterful cover of Tiny Bradshaw's 'Train Kept'a Rollin'' is one such precocious showcase, not to mention the sweltering 'White Line Fever'. In terms of Fast Eddie's riffs and Philthy's perfect command over hypnotizing blues rhythms, I actually got some Rocka Rolla vibes from both this track and 'Keep Us on the Road'. The solo of the latter lays down crispy blues licks like strips of bacon on a skillet, and much like Priest's maligned debut, it boasts an untraditional heaviness that's delivered through cryptic atmosphere rather than raw crushing power.\n\nBut alas, therein lies the problem. Everyone's expecting that crushing power, but 1977 was just too early for that. As a result, Mot\u00f6rhead is quite understated and uncharacteristic of themselves, and this much is obvious from both the sheer amount of covers, and how barren the metal landscape was at the time. I don't regard Mot\u00f6rhead particularly highly - it's not even in the same zipcode as my top ten - but I do still acknowledge its importance and appreciate it in the context of its time. Don't worry though; Mot\u00f6rhead won't have to settle for my consolation prizes for long.\n",
        "\n\"We are Mot\u00f6rhead, and we play rock 'n' roll.\"\n\nDespite fronting one of the most influential metal bands\u2014and if we're talking extreme metal, the most influential\u2014Lemmy always maintained Mot\u00f6rhead was a rock band, which is understandable given the time he grew up in. His love of the Beatles and time as a roadie for Jimi Hendrix are well known, though his fixation goes back to the genre's beginnings, specifically Little Richard. \u201cDon't Waste Your Time\u201d could be interpreted as Lemmy's attempt to settle the question of what type of music Mot\u00f6rhead really played. It has the band's usual amount of distortion, but the simple melody is pure 50s and they even add in piano and saxophone, played by John Paroulo and Bill Bergman respectively. Of course, twenty years into their career, Mot\u00f6rhead had nothing to prove, and this track is just a tribute to the greats of a bygone era of music.\n\nIf being mistaken for a metal band were such a concern, they would have chosen a different song for the title track. \u201cSacrifice\u201d doesn't open the album; it blasts through its doors. If Mot\u00f6rhead ever recorded a heavier track, I haven't heard it. You can depend on the band to deliver a pummeling, but here they crush the listener like skulls beneath the treads of an M1 Abrams; a stark contrast to the lyrics' antiwar message. Lemmy is no one's idea of a versatile singer, but when he does make small variations he makes them count and here his bark is full of menace. Troma Studios used the song in their film Tromeo and Juliet* as well as the \u201cAroma du Troma\u201d: a montage of clips from various films in their catalog. The latter was included on a DVD of Plymptoons: The Classic Works of Bill Plympton and served as my formal introduction to Mot\u00f6rhead (and to Troma) (I say \u201cformal\u201d because I likely heard them before without knowing it).\n\nIf you only know the band by their reputation or their biggest singles, you're probably under the impression they're like a more respectable Mortician, recycling through the same formula for every song. Listen to one of the albums and you'll be cured of that notion. Sacrifice shows plenty of variation. \u201cSex & Death\u201d, \u201cOver Your Shoulder\u201d and \u201cIn Another Time\u201d are straightforward bashers not far off from each other in terms of pace, yet each remains distinct. \u201cSex & Death\u201d is the second rockingest cut on the album, offering an upbeat good time. Its followup \u201cOver Your Shoulder\u201d returns to hard metallic sounds. \u201cIn Another Time\u201d is somewhere between the two in heaviness, with wah-powered licks breaking up passages of quick, choppy picking.\n\nWith \u201cOrder/Fade to Black\u201d the band prove they're capable of crafting complex songs. It starts with a gravel-throated call and response between Lemmy and Lemmy over a repetitive marching riff, bursts into their trademark blazing speed fueled by pounding double bass, rinses and repeats before breaking into an extended solo that's slow with a few gusts of notes and makes good use of that wah pedal, then switches to just a drumbeat and the bass playing a line that hearkens back to the opening of their most famous song (and some other stuff happens after that). That solo comes courtesy of Phil Campbell who handles the majority of the solos, again showing unappreciated diversity. Some are impressive, while others are quick 'n' dirty, but all are appropriate. W\u00fcrzel left after this album, but his riffing is strong as ever. Mikkey Dee puts in another dynamite performance. He was always a more precise, nimble drummer than Philthy Animal Taylor, yet never sterile or unduly enamored of his own skills.\n\nThe cover is one of Joe Petagno's best, showing that decades on Snaggletooth had power left in him. Surrounding the great beast's head is a hellacious scene worthy of Bruegel. Silhouetted gravestones crowd the foreground, on the left a battle rages beneath a procession of towering banners while on the right a conflagration billows into a whirlwind of bodies being ridden by Death himself and even the clouds above portend violent doom. All of it is rendered in shades of black and searing orange. Snaggletooth and his war-ready accoutrements have never been so textural, with leathery hide, rough tusks, molten slits for eyes, a speckled helmet covered in cracks and a mouth oozing translucent, viscous saliva. Topping it off, the tongue is distinctly penile and the throat vaginal. (Petagno would later use such a tongue on the cover of Bonehunter's Children of the Atom; a cover with a composition that seems to be a subtle nod to this one.) It's the perfect image for a flagitiously underrated album. Ace of Spades is their most important album and they have plenty of others better known and more influential than Sacrifice, but, for my money, this is Mot\u00f6rhead's best.\n\n\n*Though the soundtrack contains some shit like Sublime, it features plenty of legit acts like The Meatmen, The Wesley Willis Fiasco, Brujeria, and Unsane.\n",
        "\nHow does this one get forgotten about when it's called - of all things - Rock 'n' Roll, a.k.a. the philosophy of Mot\u00f6rhead? Maybe people think it's a greatest hits compilation, but no, it's a ragged, brief album from 1987, right after the well-renowned Orgasmatron and a long way detached from 1916, which seemed to usher in the next era of the band. After all, there are a lot of Mot\u00f6rhead albums to choose from, and this isn't the best one. But, if my phone autocorrects Motorhead to Mot\u00f6rhead, surely that's enough status to make sure people keep your fucking raison d'etre in mind. And don't tell me that Lemmy didn't like raisins, just because they're made from fruit.\n\nAdmittedly, considering that this has just about the best Mot\u00f6rhead line-up ever (Lemmy and Philthy Animal, plus Phil Campbell and W\u00fcrzel on guitars), the songs themselves are a little disappointing, even if the attitude is all there. Lazy, lewd, and loud all accounted for: the album does what it promises and delivers more blues-based riffs than the efforts either side, the bass turned up and crackling, the pace just a mite down on the rollicking speed that the band gave (and took at least as often) at other career junctures. Isn't it nice though, for a band who have been accused of repeating their songs and recycling their sound over the years, that Rock 'n' Roll feels distinctive, the clumpy drums stomping round 'Blackheart' like it's actually about the pirate of the same name tapping his wooden leg into the planks of the foredeck. Certain familiar tropes crop up ('Stone Deaf in the USA' sounds like a patchwork of Mot\u00f6rhead song titles), yet this is also the only album by the band where you can hear the country twang of lap steel, not to mention such silly innuendos as Lemmy's \"bacon torpedo\" in 'Eat the Rich'. Oh, and 'Blessing' is funny as fuck even if it is just the same joke from Monty Python being dedicated to the band.\n\nOne might even say that this is the most relaxed you can catch the Londoners, what with the jokes (a few voices can be heard kidding about in the studio too) and laidback feel of the title track and sparser 'Dogs'. Among the nine songs, some variety comes the way of the listener, getting into heavy boogie mode for 'Traitor', silly singalong on 'Eat the Rich', which was also on a soundtrack, and cranking things up for 'The Wolf', seeming almost what would happen if Mot\u00f6rhead were covering something from the first Bathory LP. They knock out some decent choruses, sounding almost nostalgic on 'All for You' (not a ballad, I promise) and 'Dogs', though some of the more obvious stuff on side A isn't top notch in that department. It would be an exaggeration to say that Rock 'n' Roll contained a full hand of good songs, but - as Mot\u00f6rhead albums usually prove - none are actually bad either, merely a few mediocre cuts and a slightly thin spread of hugely memorable ones. Ending on 'Boogeyman' was certainly the right way to go, while a couple of B-sides prove diverting on the big ol' Sanctuary reissue, as does a full set at Monsters of Rock 1986.\n\nRather a shame it is that Rock 'n' Roll has been so hugely sidelined over the years, I can't say that its status constitutes an injustice. Certainly little of top quality floats around in the sparing 34 minutes, while the laidback vibe adds enjoyment but also detracts from the primal feeling of Mot\u00f6rhead at full throttle. If you've already decided that these guys are your kind of thing, you'll want to check this out and be amused. For those merely curious, just remember the title and start with something else.\n",
        "\nListening to Mot\u00f6rhead's entire discography, an inexperienced listener might have a hard time discerning between their earlier works and the later stuff. Sure, the production quality was increased significantly; but there's only a very small difference between the songwriting formula or riff style despite the large chronological gap. Mot\u00f6rhead was arguably one of the most stylistically consistent groups in metal history. Aftershock, the band's second-to-last full-length album ever, is as predictable as the rest yet still widely enjoyable.\n\nThe guitar tone has a biting quality to it, reminiscent of Skynyrd-esque American Southern rock. Some of the riffs also seem to match this style; Phil Campbell's playing seems more raunchy and groove-centered than on previous recordings. His solos are bluesy and blistering; yet they're pretty much the same as all the ones he, W\u00fcrzel, and Eddie Clarke had laid down on the band's records for the previous 35 years. There's very little variation between songs (except for the quieter \"Dust and Glass\"), and many of the tracks seem to be based largely on one-note riffs (see the verse of \"Going to Mexico\" for the most well-executed example).\n\nMikkey Dee of King Diamond fame contributes his drumming once again on Aftershock, making this the eleventh of the band's albums he was featured on. His drumming is relatively simple, and rarely captivates the listener's attention, except for a handful of songs that feature a drum fill as the intro.\n\nOf course, the late legend Lemmy Kilmister is the star of the show on Aftershock. His innovative, fuzz-laden bass tone is a staple of the Mot\u00f6rhead sound, and it shines through quite well throughout the fourteen-song running length of this album. His harsh, raspy vocals are nearly as strong as ever, although a bit of compression can be clearly heard at some moments to increase the punch of his delivery.\n\nThe production quality is good enough that it takes away slightly from Mot\u00f6rhead's earlier, authentically dirty and raw sound. This isn't a huge issue, but prevents the album from standing out as a gem among the vast depths of the band's discography.\n\nAftershock is a great album, but should only be experienced by those already familiar with Mot\u00f6rhead's sound. This is by no means a unique record by their standards, so it's much less important than their earlier and more influential releases. But for a seasoned fan, it can still be appreciated as an effort to maintain a solid sound by one of the greatest bands of all time late in their career.\n\nBest songs: \"Heartbreaker,\" \"Going to Mexico,\" and \"Queen of the Damned.\"\n",
        "\nThough Mot\u00f6rhead is credited time and time again with the creation of the speed metal genre, I see very little relationship between the blues-based British trio and other well-known acts to have been given that label. \"We are Mot\u00f6rhead, we play rock 'n' roll\" is an immortal Lemmy Kilmister quote that is possibly most accurate when applied to the band's legendary 1980 LP Ace of Spades, which just feels like an exceptionally fast traditional, bluesy hard rock record.\n\nThough I totally understand why the band is cited as a major influence by countless thrash bands, I've always had a hard time seeing them as a metal band themselves. Sure, they have the attitude, speed, and look; but when it comes to their actual sound, there's very little metal in it and very few of the bands who claim to be influenced by them actual sound anything like the British rockers. Lemmy Kilmister was nearly 35 years old when Ace of Spades was released, so it makes sense that he would be playing music based in slightly older formulas.\n\nThe guitars have dirty, distorted sound that is comparable more to bands like Led Zeppelin than Judas Priest. At the time, Mot\u00f6rhead was a three-piece band and \"Fast\" Eddie Clarke was the only guitarist in the band. His riffing is quite simple, yet very fast (as his name would suggest). He flecks each song with blazing, fitting blues solos that are predictable but necessary.\n\nPhilthy Animal's drumming is frantic and intense, producing some of the fastest rhythm patterns ever heard at the time. Each song on the record is nearly inconceivably high-tempo, slowing down to a reasonable tempo next to no times throughout the entire album.\n\nNow, there's an obvious reason Lemmy was the face of Mot\u00f6rhead besides the fact that he was the only constant member. His overdriven bass tone and raspy singing are the most crucial, defining elements of the band's entire sound. Originally a guitarist, he plays his bass in a more syncopated way than most would, and it sounds good with his heavily distorted tone. His iconic vocal style is the result of years of smoking and his odd choice for a microphone angle; he always sang with his head facing at least 45 degrees upward.\n\nThe production has an unclean atmosphere that is to be expected of such an album, though the mixes are clear and consistent. The original pressings featured 13 songs, but newer versions have added some tracks that Mot\u00f6rhead recorded with Girlschool. Ace of Spades is best experienced in its original form, and I find these newer additions to be rather useless and disposable.\n\nAs any entry-level metalhead can tell you, Mot\u00f6rhead were one of the bands that had the biggest influence on the evolution of the genre, and Ace of Spades is the perfect example why. The fast-paced tempos laid the groundwork for thrash, and Lemmy's incoherent vocal style could be considered a prototype for the more intense barking and growling that made their way into metal later that decade. Although it's an extremely historically significant album, the most important thing to take into consideration is just how high-quality the songs here are. Each one is short and sweet, and they all add up to a phenomenal listening experience that puts Ace of Spades among the top metal (or metallic) albums ever created.\n",
        "\nJust a year after the unrealized ambitions of 1992\u2019s March or Die, Motorhead returned with a different direction in mind for Bastards. While the album\u2019s more grounded approach would suggest a back to basics rock \u2018n roll style, the songs here are heavier than anything ever released under the Motorhead banner before it. Late 70s anthems like \u201cOverkill\u201d and \u201cStone Dead Forever\u201d were certainly heavy for their time, but the band had never been this aggressive.\n\nMuch of that aggression can be directly attributed to the recruitment of drummer Mikkey Dee. In contrast to the often-sloppy performances of past timekeepers, his technique is both tight and hard hitting while still allowing for plenty of groove. It\u2019s understandably not as technical as the work with King Diamond that established his reputation, but speed metal scorchers like the appropriately titled \u201cBurner\u201d would\u2019ve been literally impossible without him. I dare wager that Mikkey Dee played a more important role in the Motorhead sound than anybody but Lemmy himself.\n\nThankfully this heightened musicianship is matched with some fantastic songwriting. Most of the songs are upbeat as \u201cDeath or Glory\u201d and \u201cI Am the Sword\u201d offer blistering tempos while \u201cBorn to Raise Hell\u201d and \u201cWe Bring the Shake\u201d have some commercial remnants in their hard rock singalongs. On the flip side, \u201cLiar\u201d puts that heaviness to slower use with a grinding riff set and some of Lemmy\u2019s most vicious growls ever. There\u2019s even some room for psychedelia as the warped grooves on \u201cI\u2019m Your Man\u201d would be quite potent in the hands of your local stoner doom group.\n\nBut like 1916 before it, a tragic ballad proves to be this album\u2019s biggest curveball. \u201cDon\u2019t Let Daddy Kiss Me\u201d is a jarring song both musically and lyrically; its sudden transition to soft acoustic strums from \u201cBorn to Raise Hell\u201d party rock is enough to give one whiplash and its child abuse theme is heartbreaking but not overwrought. Its placement in the middle of the album and Lemmy\u2019s vulnerable vocal performance make it an uncomfortable listen, but I\u2019ll be damned if that wasn\u2019t what the song set out to do in the first place!\n\nOverall, Bastards may be the most underrated Motorhead album ever. In addition to serving as a strong bounce back from the misguided March or Die, the album is just as good as the band\u2019s best-known efforts and set a new standard for everything that followed. The songs are some of the band\u2019s catchiest ever and its heaviness would only be matched on the subsequent Sacrifice and 2005\u2019s Inferno. Thankfully it gets more appreciation these days than it did upon its initially obscure release and I can only hope its greatness will discovered by more fans with time.\n\nHighlights:\n\u201cBurner\u201d\n\u201cDeath or Glory\u201d\n\u201cBorn to Raise Hell\u201d\n\u201cLiar\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m Your Man\u201d\n\nOriginally published at http://psychicshorts.blogspot.com\n",
        "\nMarch or Die will always be remembered as Motorhead\u2019s sellout record. The band didn\u2019t ape any trends of the time, but they really leaned on their mainstream connections this time around. Lemmy\u2019s participation in the songwriting for Ozzy Osbourne\u2019s No More Tears likely left an impression on him, perhaps further fueling the desire for prominence that started getting traction on 1916. Unfortunately, this album doesn\u2019t quite have the same focus as its predecessor.\n\nWhile March or Die is more stylistically in line with classic Motorhead than 1916, this is a rather watered-down variation of that formula. Songs like the opening \u201cStand\u201d are decently written and feature the bass drive and gravelly vocals fans know and love, but the executions don\u2019t seem to hit as hard as they should. Other songs feel like retreads as \u201cJack the Ripper\u201d has a bumpy groove in the vein of \u201cThe One to Sing the Blues\u201d and the closing title track channels \u201cOrgasmatron\u201d without properly channeling its misanthropic menace.\n\nThese issues reach an early culmination on the rather misguided cover of Ted Nugent\u2019s \u201cCat Scratch Fever.\u201d Having the song be second in the track list is awkward enough and the band\u2019s performance is frankly neutered. This song is tailor made for Motorhead\u2019s signature sleaze, but the high-pitched vocals and uptight rhythms really don\u2019t do it justice. This cover would\u2019ve been so much stronger with meaner guitars and grittier vocals and it\u2019s sad to see it not live up to what I can imagine in my head. \n\nOddly enough, those mainstream connections end up working in the album\u2019s favor. A power ballad featuring a duet with Ozzy Osbourne seems disingenuous on paper (and makes me want to listen to Lita Ford for some reason) but, \u201cI Ain\u2019t No Nice Guy\u201d may be the strongest track on here thanks to its surprisingly sincere performances and smooth buildup. I also enjoy the Motorhead take on \u201cHellraiser\u201d even if I prefer the bombast of the No More Tears version and \u201cYou Better Run\u201d makes fun use of the tried and true \u201cHoochie Coochie Man\u201d rhythm.\n\nOverall, March or Die isn\u2019t a bad album but rather an underwhelming blunder by Motorhead standards. It\u2019d be easy to blame it all on celebrity pandering, but the songs exploiting those cameos end up being the best while the songs that sound the most like the band\u2019s typical work are ironically the weakest. I don\u2019t think the writing is quite on par with the classics, but the effort really would\u2019ve benefitted from more aggressive performances. There\u2019s enough good here for hardcore fans to enjoy it but the band\u2019s other works from this era are so much better.\n\nHighlights:\n\u201cI Ain\u2019t No Nice Guy\u201d\n\u201cHellraiser\u201d\n\u201cYou Better Run\u201d\n\nOriginally published at http://psychicshorts.blogspot.com\n",
        "\nSince exactly three years, the incarnation of heavy metal is dead. But its spirit lives on and there is absolutely no end in sight. Lemmy's music is still omnipresent and that's only logical in view of songs such as \"Brave New World\", the climax of \"Hammered\". Those of you who think that they haven't heard the ultimate metal chorus so far, listen exactly to this track and the search is over. The neckbreaking catchiness of this number has the potential to drive you insane. A strict up-tempo smasher with an excellent riffing and lyrics that could not be more typical for Lemmy. Lines like \"being poor is worse than having AIDS\" speak volumes. Not to forget the dynamic solo part and, of course, Lemmy's well known boozy voice. This track has to be played on every celestial Mot\u00f6rhead concert (or did you really think that the Grandmaster of Rock has stopped his activities only because of the fact that he has left us?).\n\nIn direct comparison, \"Brave New World\" tramples everything else of this work into dust. But having forged one \u00fcber-mot\u00f6rsong does not exclude the offering of further good pieces. The screaming riff of \"Down the Line\", the very good flow of \"Voices from the War\" and even the pretty strange, somehow soft and simultaneously harsh vocal line in the chorus of \"Walk a Crooked Mile\" has a strange charm. Right from the beginning, all these songs prove evidence that Mot\u00f6rhead still sound fresh, impulsive and spontaneous. Of course, the experienced warhorses know their trade, but the joy of playing shimmers though each and every composition. The throbbing bass lines fall in love with the casual or vehement guitar riffs and it seems as if bass and guitar sound coalesce with each other in order to create a unique and powerful sound, full of energy and enriched with a healthy amount of negativity. Apart from this, the tight drumming dictates the rhythm consequently. I am still convinced that the band pic on the inner side of the tray portraits Klaus Meine and not Phil Campbell, but maybe my German eyes love to fool me.\n\nThe songs show the band (with or without Campbell) from its rocking side (\"Mine All Mine\") and its metalized side as well. \"Red Raw\" seems to be the little brother of \"Burner\", one of their straightest songs ever which was released on \"Bastards\". \"Shut Your Mouth\" lies between these poles and is built upon a riff that seems to originate from the cellar of an Australian family called Young. If you like songs of this clan, for example the great \"Overdose\", you will also enjoy this piece. In other words, Mot\u00f6rhead dish up their usual program, but with a big number of excellent riffs. Only \"Dr. Love\" can't keep the pace and the worthless outro consists nearly only of spoken words. It doesn't matter. The very powerful production fits the musical approach perfectly and so the listeners get blown away in a very appreciated manner.\n\nJust like more or less any other long-standing formation, Mot\u00f6rhead did not only release fantastic records, but \"Hammered\" belongs to those works that ensured them a firm place in my heart. It guarantees 45 minutes of filthy fun and unlike its spiritual fathers, at least \"Brave New World\" has been made for eternity. So come on, dear fellows, let's raise our glasses and celebrate Mot\u00f6rhead! This makes it easier to say the truth without an overdose of melancholy: Lemmy, we miss you. And Philthy Animal, Fast Eddie Clark and W\u00fcrzel. And, by the way, Johnny, Joey, Dee Dee and Tommy. And Malcolm and Bon... shit, the list is much too long.\n",
        "\nBack in the early 90s, Motorhead sought to conquer the American market. It only made sense as Lemmy had relocated to Los Angeles by then to become a permanent mainstay at the Rainbow Bar and Grill while the band was getting endorsements from such mainstream acolytes as Metallica and Guns \u2018n Roses. Fortunately, Motorhead wasn\u2019t too watered down in the process. On the contrary, 1916 may have been the most experimental album they ever released.\n\nI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any other Motorhead album with as much variety as 1916. An array of different styles is pursued as \u201cGoing to Brazil\u201d goes full on rockabilly, \u201cNightmare/The Dreamtime\u201d is a creepshow with keyboards and vocal backmasking, \u201cLove Me Forever\u201d is an all-out power ballad, and \u201cR.A.M.O.N.E.S.\u201d is the perfect stylistic pastiche of its punk rock muse. Ideas like \u201cNightmare/The Dreamtime\u201d and \u201cLove Me Forever\u201d really shouldn\u2019t work with how far they take the band out of their comfort zone, but the strong songwriting helps see them through.\n\nOf course, there\u2019s still plenty of classic Motorhead to go around. \u201cThe One to Sing the Blues\u201d starts the album off in a somewhat bumpy fashion, but \u201cI\u2019m So Bad (Baby I Don\u2019t Care)\u201d and \u201cNo Voices in the Sky\u201d make up for it with their dirty guitar charges and catchy choruses. These songs are still noticeably leaner and heavier than any of the band\u2019s 80s works, but they\u2019re comfortable listens for longtime fans.\n\nBut the album\u2019s biggest wild card is its World War I-themed title track. In contrast to the band\u2019s other famous war-themed slow burn \u201cOrgasmatron,\u201d \u201c1916\u201d is an incredibly subdued track. Lemmy narrates a tale of young soldiers killed too young in a crackling voice accompanied by funerary keyboard work and a lonely timpani rhythm. It\u2019s such a jarring listen, especially when compared to the album\u2019s more fun tracks, but its placement at the end has an incredibly haunting effect. Easily the band\u2019s most effective closer and one of their all-time best songs.\n\n1916 doesn\u2019t quite have the legendary reputation of Ace of Spades or Overkill, but it\u2019s a strong collection of tracks all the same. The album\u2019s stylistic variety does an excellent job of highlighting sides of the band not often seen and I imagine the subsequent Grammy nomination was pretty nice too. It\u2019s not only an essential listen for fans and casual listeners alike, but also an effort that\u2019s fun to throw in the face of the hacks who think that Motorhead albums all sound alike.\n\nHighlights:\n\u201cI\u2019m So Bad (Baby I Don\u2019t Care)\u201d\n\u201cNo Voices in the Sky\u201d\n\u201cNightmare/The Dreamtime\u201d\n\u201cR.A.M.O.N.E.S.\u201d\n\u201c1916\u201d\n\nOriginally published at http://psychicshorts.blogspot.com\n",
        "\nFor some reason this is considered a disappointment by some Motorhead fans but why? Honestly, I can hardly imagine music getting better than this. Top notch playing, energy, lyrics, and almost nothing but perfect 5 star hits from front to back. If there's one Motorhead album I want to be buried with, it wouldn't be this one but man on a stick this is great music. Motorhead made a name for themselves for their intensity and speed and in no album is that more evident than in Iron Fist. Fast, loud and (for their first time ever) clearly produced effort. Sure it sounds cleaner than Ace Of Spades and earlier albums, but it also sounds mean as hell. Fast Eddie's guitar sound never sounded this good (too bad, for the last time!). This album is for people who like fast and loud Motorhead. Hardcore punks and proto thrashers are also welcomed to love this album because it's got everything for them. Compared with previous releases, Motorhead toned down their bluesy overtones, so people expecting the \"bluesier\" side of the band might be a bit disappointed. \n\nDrop in quality some say. How stupid a comment like that is! Fast Eddie Clarke produced this and, Phlithy Phil's drumming exceeds everything he had done up to that point. Lemmy's bass is ever present, as evident in his great bass intros for Iron Fist and Don't Need Religion. Fast Eddie's guitar sounds sharp and more incisive and, of course, his solos lose none of their great tendencies. \n\nInteresting to point out is that this album is probably Motorhead's fastest album. You have to remember that it was released at a time when the british hardcore bands were basically aping Motorheads sound, so I'd like to think that Motorhead was not oblivious to this going on so they pushed up the sonic ante with this album. Songs like Sex & Outrage sound like all-out hardcore blasts, and what's wrong with that?Remember that this is the band that both punk and headbangers dug alike. It's sad that this was the last album with the classic line up, and although its follow up (Another Perfect Day) was decent, it is nowhere near this gem. If you don't have this record in 2018, try and rectify this.\n",
        "\n...replaced with something good.\n\nI know, I know. I just can't past that crappy song. Why it was a staple for 40 fucking years when there was at least 2 or 3 better choices from Overkill, let alone Motorhead's 22 record discography? Even the filler songs from Bomber that I slagged in that review I'd welcome here, on the off chance that maybe, just maybe the track in question would come out listenable here. Stranger things have happened (see the studio and live versions of Priest's Genocide).\n\nThat aside, No Sleep Til Hammersmith is every bit the legend it's been made out to be over the decades. The incomparable lineup of Lemmy, Fast Eddie and Philthy come together for a live performance NWOBHM statement that would transcend the ages. Hell, this is the quintessential NWOBHM experience. On the Ace of Spades tour no less. Strangely enough, despite being their current album at the time, it's the Overkill record that gets the most exposure here with 5 samples. The most frightening of which is the title track, played at a chain chomping double speed (someone must have tipped Lemmy off to the fact that Priest did it first and faster). I personally always preferred that song at its studio speed, with it's more controlled fire, but I can't deny that at this speed, it suits Motorhead's modus operandi perfectly. Fast, loud and dirty. Yes, one should definitely adjust their expectations in terms of musical finesse with No Sleep. Philthy's off time hi-hat rhythm within the first few seconds of the album ought to set that tone swimmingly.\n\nThe highlights of this particular outing include Bomber, which is played at 1.25 speed and ends before that glorious riff is driven into the ground like its studio counterpart; We Are (The Road Crew) which turns the day-to-day monotony of the unsung heroes of rock bands everywhere into a true do-or-die frenetic fling (and yes, Eddie does have the good sense of humor to replicate his feedback fall-down of the studio track). The grand finale of the band's eponymous song, is also worth a mention. Already a garage-romp in the studio, No Sleep turns \"Motorhead\" into a \"kid in the candy store already hopped up on Pop Rocks and Coke\" meditation on hyperactivity that makes rock & roll such an essential component to the human experience.\n\nNo Sleep Til Hammersmith is a must own. One of the greatest live albums in music. If you don't own this, you'd better run to get it.\n",
        "\nMuch as I love 1916, it's a small pity that was the Motorhead album to be released on Sony and thus appear in all of the FYEs and not this one.\n\nBastards is the Kilimister gang's finest moment. Taylor being given the heave-ho and replaced with King Diamond drummer Mikkey Dee gave the band a massive upgrade in heaviness as well as percussive technique. It's funny, Mikkey Dee always says he holds back when he plays with Motorhead but you'd never be able to tell during his tenure with the band. He doesn't sound like he's overplaying, but almost displaying a Keith Moon sense of abandon where he's trying to be as thrashy as possible while keeping time. This lineup would be Motorhead at their deadliest, their most metal. Sadly, it would only last them for two albums, including this one, but we got 3/4 of the rest of them for Motorhead's remaining years (my Lemmy in rock & roll heaven it's depressing to refer to Motorhead in the past tense). That has to count for something, right?\n\nOne point of contention with this album is Don't Let Daddy Kiss Me. That, and it's sequencing of coming right before Bad Woman. As if following up a song about being molested by one's father with a typical Motorhead sex romp is in bad taste. Well, I'm sure if Lemmy were still with us today, he'd respond to this criticism with \"rock n' roll is supposed to offend you every once in a while. Fuck em if they can't take a joke.\" Not to mention that Don't Let Daddy Kiss Me takes the listener to such a dark place that it's practically vital to follow the song up with happy-go-fucky (not a typo) song, for fear it would stop the album's momentum dead in it's tracks. Kind of like how Teacher's Pet followed Buried Alive. In any case, the song is a fine ballad, and honestly, I can't think of a bad ballad that Motorhead ever put out, or even an average one (well, ok Dust & Glass doesn't really go anywhere).\n\nIf there is a weakness on this album, it's the final half of the closing song, Devils. I actually was so annoyed by this interminable \"angels in my heart tonight\" section that I ignored the song for many years, completely forgetting that it's opening riff is one of the better riffs on Bastards. Tiresome as that ending is, I'm not gonna take any points off because it's the proper end of the album, so you can just fade it out early. Unless you're one of those people who take iTunes plays seriously, thus needing to play the whole track through, in which case you're fucked.\n\nHighlights? Good fucking God what isn't a highlight here? Aside from that pesky Devil's ending everything here is Birmingham factory quality titanium! On Your On Your Knees is the best Motorhead opener since Ace of Spades, possibly even better. Burner [anyway] is a surprisingly successful recycling of that immortal speed metal chestnut. We Bring The Shake features the most delightfully oblong riff in the Motorhead catalog along with brilliant vocal harmonies (another thing that Motorhead had a great signal-to-noise ratio with; moreso than most). I'm The Man was supposed to be given to Aerosmith but they turned it down for reasons that can only be concluded as \"they're fucking idiots.\" Seriously, they'll collaborate with Nsync, Desmond Child and Diane Warren but not Lemmy? Cunts. Finally, I Am The Sword is a Rickenbacker induced San Andreas rumbling with that perfect combination of metal, punk and rock & roll that we all worship Motorhead for.\n\nBastards is a giant middle finger to all the trends and foolishness of American record company stupidity in 1993. A quintessential album no one's collection should be without. Hopefully in the next few years Paul Inder and Todd (Motorhead's final manager) can work together to get this on Blackened Recordings so everyone can get their claws on it. Maybe even pull a U2 and stealth download it onto everyone's iPods. Eat your 90s Motorhead kids, it builds character.\n",
        "\nToday it is exactly two years ago that Lemmy left us in order to raise hell in heaven. No doubt, we miss him. But his music is still on earth and this applies even for \"Another Perfect Day\", an album which celebrates its 35th anniversary in 2018. It's a special work, because it always invites me to a controversial discussion with myself. I hate its ugly artwork and songs like \"Shine\" or the meandering title track do not give me much, albeit they are not truly bad. However, they leave a somewhat stale taste, lack inspiration to a certain extent and show a pretty powerless overall picture. The short and really funny comic that illustrates the integration of Brian Robertson in the line-up indicates the different musical approach of the band members - and we all know, that the \"integration\" of the guitarist failed in a miserable way, not only because of his strange outfit on stage. Nevertheless, \"Another Perfect Day\" has its moments and, unlike other albums of Mot\u00f6rhead or further formations, it has not fallen into oblivion. Quite the opposite, the album has found its niche and the participation of Robertson lends it a unique touch - for better or for worse.\n\nOne of the best pieces is \"One Track Mind\". It is not a typical Mot\u00f6rhead song, because instead of cynical belligerence and straightforward velocity, the three-piece reveals its doom-affine side. Well-hung leads create a casual flow and the minimalist, catchy chorus crowns the track almost perfectly. Robertson has room to show his skills and his guitar work makes \"One Track Mind\" to what it is: an exciting number that withstands its rather boring pattern very cleverly. (By the way, all songs have a predictable configuration...) The short time worker on guitar plays more riffs and leads that cause cool vibrations. \"Marching Off to War\", for instance, sounds loose and sinister at the same time. Further examples, namely \"Dancing on Your Grave\" or \"I Got Mine\", partially show a nearly lenient side of the band due to the guitar work. Robertson seems to be on a mission and tries to transform Lemmy's spiritual baby from a metal to a rock band. This results in pieces that have nothing in common with \"Ace of Spades\" or comparable signature tracks of the group. Lemmy, not lazy, fights against the treacherous activity of his band mate and his boozy voice reminds us that Mot\u00f6rhead are still Mot\u00f6rhead. His \"die, die\" screams at the end of the closer, which scores with a nice chorus, provide evidence that a certain degree of aggression is always helpful. Nevertheless, some mysteries remain, for example the ridiculous fade-out of \"Tales of Glory\".\n\nAlready the first track does not have the vehemence of some previous openers. \"Back at the Funny Farm\" sounds somehow glassy. Once again, the guitars deliver a somewhat light touch, although the opening riff is fully convincing because of its rebellious character. In any case, the best detail of the solid number is a part of its original lyrics: \"What was that injection 'cos I think it's going wrong, I really like this jacket but the sleeves are much too long\". This bone-dry humour tells me that Lemmy must have been a good guy, albeit I would not describe his appearance as trustworthy. Honestly speaking, I would never had bought a used car from him. But come on, today the entire \"Another Perfect Day\" has the aura of a used car, even though it appears as a more or less well maintained vintage vehicle. These cars are symbols of a time gone by and we do not want to drive them everyday, but sometimes it feels good to take a trip with them (for example to the Funny Farm, does anybody know where it lies?). Moreover, the fact that the engine of the vehicle causes - due to an acceptable production - appropriate sounds makes it a bit easier for me that the car from 1983 lacks speed. But it is really a pity that the driver seat is deserted since exactly two years.\n",
        "\nLegendary rock band Mot\u00f6rhead has released numerous outstanding cover tracks throughout the forty years of its incredible career. The group's first single included a cover of Eddie Holland's ''Leavin' Here''. The second single included a rendition of Pink Fairies' ''City Kids''. The band's first studio record even included tight renditions of Hawkwind's ''Mot\u00f6rhead'', ''Lost Johnny'' and ''The Watcher''. The album included a fourth cover song with Tiny Bradshaw's ''The Train Kept-a-Rollin'''. An underrated classic is the band's rendition of Richard Berry's ''Louie Louie''. Think of the cool cover version of Girlschool's ''Emergency'' and Mot\u00f6rhead's collaboration with Girlschool to record Johnny Kidd & The Pirates' ''Please Don't Touch''. I could mention many more excellent examples. \n\nNow, what do all of the aforementioned tracks in common? That's right, none of them is included on Under C\u00f6ver, a release that is supposed to showcase the band's greatest cover songs. This fact basically nullifies the purpose of this questionable release alone. It's another example for a cheap attempt by a label to grab some cash from nostalgic fans and to take advantage of Lemmy's legacy in the most disgraceful way.\n\nLet's get this clear. The songs on this record are mostly very good. Mot\u00f6rhead's raw rendition of Judas Priest's ''Breaking the Law'' might be better than the original version, the ferocious garage rock take on Metallica's ''Whiplash'' kicks ass and Sex Pistols' ''God Save the Queen'' underlines the band's rebellious spirit and connection to the reckless spirit of the punk scene. There is a reason why punks, rock fans and metal maniacs equally admire Mot\u00f6rhead. It's just that this release itself is incomplete and doesn't do this legendary band any justice.\n\nThe only reason why this record doesn't get the worst possible rating is the inclusion of a previously unreleased cover song which is basically the only reason to potentially buy this release. Mot\u00f6rhead covered David Bowie's thoughtful anthem ''Heroes'' to honor one of the most influential musicians of the twentieth century a few months before Lemmy passed away himself. This makes said rendition even more emotional and nostalgic. The song might not be Mot\u00f6rhead's most convincing cover song but it's one of the most authentic, emotional and personal ones and manages to send shivers down my spine.\n\nTo keep it short, grab this record if you can find it for five bucks or less to experience the band's hypnotizing, nostalgic and thoughtful rendition of David Bowie's ''Heroes''. This song is the only redeeming quality of this cheap and incomplete compilation. An extensive greatest hits collection of the band would have made much more sense than exchangeable product here.\n",
        "\nThere is just so much to love about this Mot\u00f6rhead 7\" that I'm not sure where to start. How about that ridiculous and bad-ass cover photo? If I was gonna write a song called \"Iron Fist,\" I'd want to be photographed wearing one too. That's Philthy menacing us with it with Lemmy brandishing a huge sword and everyone just looking to wreck your world. \n\nWhich is just what the title track does. \"Iron Fist\" rumbles and menaces with Lemmy's jagged bass, Eddie's punchy riffs, and Philthy's punk-y drums. Perhaps a touch too similar to \"Ace Of Spades,\" \"Iron Fist\" is still iconic Mot\u00f6rhead with great chorus:\n\nYou know me, evil eye\nYou know me, prepare to die\nYou know me, the snakebite kiss\nDevil's grip, the iron fist\n\nThe b-side, \"Remember Me, I'm Gone,\" definitely fulfills the requirements of a b-side, in that while fun, it is not nearly as memorable as the a-side. While it has a nice foot-stompin' boogie to it, and a decent solo, it lacks the oomph of \"Iron Fist\" and lyrics aren't Lemmy's sharpest. At just over two minutes, it also feels slightly underdeveloped. But it's also a Mot\u00f6rhead tune so it ain't bad by any stretch! All of Mot\u00f6rhead's b-sides have been reissued on comps and stuff so one hardly needs to track these old 7\"s down anymore unless you are a die hard collector.\n",
        "\nMot\u00f6rhead's sophomore effort is with no doubts their strongest release, and it represented a huge leap forward from its predecessor, as it shows the band's trademark sound at the highest level in terms of speed, violence, and songwriting. None of their following albums would ever reach these levels (including their successful \"Ace of Spades\"), as well as being one of the first metal albums providing the basics for the creation of thrash metal's musical foundation.\n\nRegardless of the different kind of rhythms included in the release, there are many features that the songs share. Among others, the highly insane drumming, the fierce bass notes played by Lemmy that even sounded like a rhythm guitar, and the noisy punkish guitar riffs that characterized the band from the beginning. Although it is not so dissimilar from the debut, the formula here is more forceful than in the debut, and instead of using the punk-oriented sound from the latter, the band goes far beyond and takes the sound of heavy metal into another dimension.\n\nThe obvious and definitive highlight is the opening forceful thrasher title-track. Besides blowing away Lemmy's mustache, the thunderous rampaging fury of the song became revolutionary for heavy metal in general, and no single song in the thrash metal's repertory was able to outweigh the insanity of the same. A powerful double-bass drumming paired with Lemmy's bass notes was what they needed to create such an insane number whose chaotic intro is easily one of the most furious in the metal scene.\n\nRegarding the rest of the songs, they do not run in the crazy fashion of the opening track. However, the songs are forceful speed metal numbers if not thrashers, including of course slower numbers like \"Capricorn\" and \"Metropolis\", which would be played in even a faster fashion in \"No Sleep 'til Hammersmith\". The crazy ideas introduced on this album are highly treasured by many fanatics of the band since further releases would not sound as good as the sophomore effort. That's why everything here is a highlight, and there is no single filler material here. This album is a highly recommended item for authentic fanatics of the speed metal subgenre, but this does not mean that there are no other good releases afterward. Besides this album, the songs featured in No Sleep are also worthy-listening and even more intense at some point than the studio versions. However, this does not kill the fact that \"Overkill\" is the most powerful and the best release in the band's catalog.\n",
        "\nIf I had to pick the most overrated albums of all time, I'd list Metallica's Ride the Lightning, Iron Maiden's The Number of the Beast, and most importantly Ace of Spades by Mot\u00f6rhead. This album gets a great deal of praise, and a good portion of that is right my deserved, but there is no doubting that this is an overrated album. Even Lemmy himself has said that he didn't understand what it was about the title track that people liked...\n\nWith the quarrel about how much attention Ace of Spades gets aside, this is an awesome album. It combines the classic bluesy sound of the with the heavy crunch of Overkill, while eschewing most of what dragged Bomber into being a below average album. The production hits you like a hammer over the head as soon as the first notes of Lemmy's distorted bass kick in. The production is perfect. It's raw and stripped down, highlighting Mot\u00f6rhead's no frills power trio sound, the bass is plenty loud, and the sound is very harsh and abrasive.\n\nAce of Spades sort of marks the point where Mot\u00f6rhead truly found themselves as musicians, with the music sounding much more natural and less forced than on any of the band's previous efforts where they seemed to remain on the side of caution. \"Fast\" Eddie Clarke has really made a name for himself here. The album is jammed packed with fucking awesome guitar riffs. His style varies from the proto-thrash of the title track, to the powerful punk interlude of the standout \"Love Me Like a Reptile\", and finally, to the bluesy style exhibited on such songs as \"Fast and Loose\" and the overrated \"We are the Roadcrew\". Even with all of this said, the technicality and musicianship is not that important to Ace of Spades. In the traditional Mot\u00f6rhead spirit, the emphasis is mainly on the \"feel\" and \"taste\" of the songs. All of these riffs are played very emotionally, exuding a feeling of insane classic-ness, as if this is some old 50s rock and roll. The lyrics also take on this persona, with Lemmy taking on the wording style present in older rock and roll. They range from antigenic (\"Ace of Spades\") to hypersexual and somewhat lackluster (on the otherwise awesome track \"Fast and Loose\".)\n\nDespite Ace of Spades being an overall masterpiece, there are some issues with the album. For one, Lemmy's vocals are somewhat weak. I preferred the darker voice would assume on Iron Fist, as well as his prior, less comprehensible sound. He just sounds too cliche here. Another issue is the one filler track, \"Fire Fire\". I know that I praised the \"classic rock and roll\" vibe of this album, but this one takes it too far, sounding like some sort of retro stuff in the vein of Stray Cats or something. Other than that, Ace of Spades is a great album that any fan of metal ought to get.\n",
        "\nWhile Overkill and Ace of Spades receive way more credit when people talk about the birth of extreme metal, the importance of this formative debut is not something to be argued with. It represents a major innovation in metal, a move away from the slower likes of Black Sabbath, Led Zeppelin, Bang, and Deep Purple, in favor of the rock and roll inspired speed metal that would spawn forth thrash metal, black metal, and death metal.\n\nWhile Mot\u00f6rhead bears the band's signature sound, for those who were introduced to this after hearing the band's later work, it will be quite obvious that the band was still in the process of finding their own style. The album is very heavy, rawer than any of the albums the band had put out later, fast, but it still retained some of Lemmy's musical roots in the psychedelic rock band Hawkwind. It's not too prevalent, though, and most of these songs, especially \"Mot\u00f6rhead\" and the hilarious \"Vibrator\" are just fun, punk-inspired speed metal tracks. Others, \"Lost Johnny\" and especially \"Iron Horse/Born to Lose\" for example, are very psychedelic rock inspired, and in all honesty, do not have much to do with the band's typical style.\n\nThe production on this album is just damn cool. It's very heavy, with Lemmy's grinding bass high in the mix, and the guitars being raw, unpolished, and almost secondary in importance to the bass. Lemmy's vocals are somewhat incomprehensible, buried in the mix, and while I normally would consider this to be a bad thing, I think it suits this album very well. There is some experimentation with interesting sound effects, notably with the weird phaser on \"Iron Horse/Born to Lose\", but this is more of a no frills, straight ahead album than anything. Generally, the faster, simple numbers sound much better in this style than the slower, more extravagant ones, hence why Lemmy went on to focus only on these ones and was more successful.\n\nIf you are new to metal and want to introduce yourself to something more aggressive and less accessible, then I would highly suggest this album as sort of a \"gateway to extreme metal\". Otherwise, it's always great to revisit the roots of the genre.\n",
        "\nExit the great Wurzel due to some he-said she-said bullshit (and given Mr. Benson's future credentials one might wonder if it was him), and once again the mighty Motorhead are as they once were; a trio. I've always been a believer that two guitarists are better than one, but Phil did a reasonable job holding down the fretboard fort the last almost two-decades. You'd think nothing was wrong at all with the results Overnight Sensation yields. While it's not quite as destructive as Sacrifice or Bastards, it's still a quality metal listen from front to back. Yes, metal. Lemmy might have been able pass off the over-distorted English MC5 reasoning during the Clarke/Taylor/Kilmister years, but the first few seconds of Civil War will convince even the staunchest retro-rocker of its steel.\n\nI'd want to say \"Eat The Gun\" was the worst song on here if it wasn't so fucking catchy. I'm shocked this wasn't a hit or a live staple of any kind. At any given point during the past few weeks either the riff or the lyrics (Your gun is so big [oh wow]) will get stuck in my head even when I'm listening to other music. That's how much it rocks. This is definitely one of more Motorhead's punk moments, as there is no solo and it's relatively fast, simple and extremely effective. Matter of fact at the moment I'm hard pressed to find one that tops this, even RAMONES.\n\nThe thrashiest song on here (and the biggest surprise) is definitely Them Not Me. I was especially impressed how they manage to not gronk the Ace of Spades riff again (although you kind of hear it in the bass underneath when the rhythm kicks in, oh well, I'll take what I can get). But the secret weapon here, as it always is with Motorhead, is drummer Mikkey Dee. This song is one of his finest moments in Motorhead and not just because it's fast, but the way he causes the chorus to swing and groove. This my friends, is the example of heavy metal's true purpose, to smash a spike through the brains of the listener and make him/her/it perk up and die hard. Dee's ability to turn that time around in Them Not Me's chorus is one of those moments. His other truly great moment on this album is Shake The World, whose double bass insanity recalls the chaas of Pleasure To Kill, except at Battle Hymns speed. It's just as head-splitting as it sounds, and I highly recommend it for brain surgery.\n\nOther highlights include Love Can't Buy You Money, which has one of the greatest Lemmy lyrics ever, \"Watch your mouth or you might get the dentist you deserve.\" I was going to put that line as the title for this review, but fucking character limits. On top of that, it is most certainly one of the CHOICE Motorhead slow songs, which is more than I can say for \"I Don't Believe A Word.\" That song on the box set actually kept me away from this album for a long time. 'Fucking hell if they thought this was good this must have been one of their out of idea periods.' Listening to it now, admittedly, it's way better than I remember it, and certainly doesn't sink to the depths of utter boredom like Metropolis, but it damn sure ain't Love Can't Buy You Money.\n\nEven though 95% of the man's discography is utter swill, I have to tip my hat to Howard Benson for making Motorhead sound as dangerous as ever without repeating the same tones as his other masterworks, Bastards and Sacrifice. Most lazy producers just find a sound that works and run it into the ground (*cough* *cough* Scott Burns, *cough), but not Howard. Hell, if not for the album cover spelling it out, Howard makes you think Wurzel never actually flew the coop. What's especially impressive is how he makes Lemmy, in all his mid-range majesty sound like he's playing an actual bass! \n\nWhich brings me to one final song I have to mention, the title track. I will never forget where I was when I first heard this. I was on a senior high school travel abroad trip to Italy, and of course, I brought my double disc best of Motorhead album with me. I was riding on one of the trolleys with my party and Sacrifice had just concluded. Eagerly awaiting what was next, I was not expecting THAT bass riff. To be completely honest, it's the Welcome to Hell/2 Minutes To Midnight riff we've all heard a thousand times, but the way Lemmy executes it in that pocket, just fucking rocks. Is Lemmy playing an actual bass sound here? Yes he is and Motorhead is brilliant for it! This is one of those songs that you just have everyone in your party put on a pair of sunglasses, flip the top of your convertible down and cruise down a beach sunset highway. As cheesy as that sounds, it damn sure isn't cheesy when you are doing it to this song, and it damn sure isn't cheesy when Motorhead plays rock & roll. In approaching this album, I was worried that nothing could possibly rise to this song's level, and I'm very happy to say that I was wrong.\n\nForget Overkill, Bomber (ha!) and Ace of Spades. Bastards, Sacrifice and Overnight Sensation is the real classic Motorhead trilogy. Buy this with sunglass confidence.\n",
        "\nLemmy, I gotta tell ya. I get it. I understand why this album's acclaim annoys you. I get your annoyance at the fact that everyone wishes you guys broke up after Ace of Spades; how nobody wants to pay attention to your far more interesting 90s/00s discography. I get it as a fan and as an aspiring artist. But here's the problem: as an album? Ace of Spades really is that good. \n\nHow good is it? Well, it's not 100% perfect. I always found myself skipping Dance and Jailbait after Fire, Fire just to get to the killer one-two punch of Bite The Bullet/The Chase Is Better Than The Catch (which I consider to be all one song, both thematically and lyrically. Bite The Bullet the relationship is over, and with Chase the man is on the prowl again). I did warm up to Jailbait after a few years, but perhaps there is one song too many on here. Point being, this album is so goddamn good you can erase the legendary title track from history; wipe it completely from memory, start the whole thing off with Love Me Like A Reptile and STILL have one of the best goddamn albums of 1980.\n\nSpeaking of Love Me Like A Reptile, all you buttholes wondering \"are there really x songs here\" can go fuck yourselves. Yes, there are goddamn 12 (or 15) songs here and they are all quite distinct both in riffs and in tempos. One cursory listen to the groove metal(!) mayhem of Shoot You In The Back and the Sabbath swing of Fast & Loose is all that's required to comprehend that Motorhead was never a one speed band. Hell, The Chase Is Better Than The Catch is about as close to Living After Midnight anthemicism as one can get. The fact that Motorhead were playing that fast made them revolutionary. I realize everyone has heard the title track a million times, but they need to hear it one more time and realize that is a BASS riff. Admit it, the first time you heard that you thought it was a really sick, delightfully over-distorted guitar. Even when they played it live afterwards that riff always sounded more like a proper bass (dare I say losing a bit of spark), but not here. Here than midrangey bass just sounds so....metal! But it's a testament to the bands ears that not once does the song (nor the rest of the album) sound like it's missing a pinch of bottom end. I can't deny that bass and low end rhythm is an important and overlooked component in metal, but Motorhead in all their noisy glory manage to side step that problem with style. Motorhead has always in essence been a two (or three) guitar band with different higher end frequencies but Lemmy's always figured out how to be the glue in that pocket.\n\nI'm also not going to challenge the notion that this album is \"Fast\" Eddie Clarke's finest moment as a riffer and a soloist. While his contribution to the title track is undeniable, again, that intro lick is a bass moment. However practically every single song afterwards has that absolutely deadly hook that causes you to pull your finger away from the skip button with the same speed like you just touched a piping hot radiator. The way he shreds through that final solo of Love Me Like A Reptile as well as Fire, Fire is so fucking raw yet melodic it brings a damn tear to your eye. Is it Randy Rhoads quality shredding? No, but it doesn't need to be! This is Motorhead dammit! Even Eddie's screw-ups are sonically salacious (behold the fallen and can't get up feedback foolery of We Are The Road Crew)!\n\nRun, don't walk, to buy this album. It's likely the only studio album besides whatever recent ones are out to be on the shelves. DO NOT just listen to the title track. Matter of fact, skip it the first few listens and entertain my scenario of beginning with Love Me Like A Reptile, so you can truly appreciate everything this monster has to offer. If you're trepidatious about not getting any hyper-speed, fret not because The Hammer will be waiting at the end to smash in your skull! Happy thrashing, I hope you don't have any fragile pottery floating around. Rather, it will be floating around once this goes on your stereo!\n\nRecommended tracks (that aren't Ace of Spades, because that one is a given):\nThe Hammer\nLove Me Like A Reptile\nWe Are The Road Crew\nFast & Loose\n",
        "\nMot\u00f6rhead's live album compiles some of the best moments from the \"Short Sharp Pain in the Neck\" tour, basically, their concerts in Newcastle and Leeds. Featuring some of the best songs from their earliest years, \"No Sleep\" is much more than the typical album that a band releases just to have a live album making up their discography. Rather, the album is pretty much a step forward in many senses, since the songs are shown at their best, and even the production work was greatly done for the standards at that time. \n\nNevertheless, what really makes the album a quite valuable and memorable item is the performance itself, which was frenetic and somehow unforeseen, outweighing the insanity already displayed in the studio. In other words, what \"No Sleep\" offers is a very unique set of songs played in a quite accelerated fashion and just with the dose of speed that is required to blow your speakers away. Of course, all the credit goes to the combination resulting from Taylor's energetic drumming, the loud and powerful bass notes played by Lemmy and the harsh riffs from Clarke.\n\nFrom the very beginning, things get quite explosive through the opener \"Ace of Spades\", which is exactly the way in which a Mot\u00f6rhead concert should begin due to its energetic atmosphere. Going forward, things get even more interesting, as this album is mainly focused on songs from \"Overkill\" (their most effective release by far), especially since once again, these songs were played at their best. \"Overkill\" gets somehow thrashy thanks to the riffs featured in the same and the even more insane drumming (if compared to the studio version), while \"Capricorn\" sounds more solid and powerful than the studio version, although Lemmy heralded the same as a \"slow number\". On the other hand, numbers like \"Mot\u00f6rhead\" and \"Bomber\" were not less than remarkable, mainly the latter.\n\nBased on the above, it is more than obvious that regardless of Lemmy being born to lose, the listener would rather win. If the studio songs resulted quite relevant and influential, the songs included on this album went far beyond, bearing in mind that by 1981 many ideas began to flow and the NWOBHM bands like Mot\u00f6rhead provided a different idea any time they played something, whether on the studio or the stage (isn't that true Metallica?), thus if 1979 many ideas were flowing, by 1981 those ideas were either reinforced or renewed. The latter is precisely why this album is essential and an unskippable item for those who love Mot\u00f6rhead.\n",
        "\nThroughout the metal genre's constant evolution, there are three bands that epitomize heavy metal to my ears. Not thrash, not death, not power, but unadulterated pure heavy metal. Those three bands are Black Sabbath, Judas Priest, and last but certainly not least, Mot\u00f6rhead. While Sabbath invented doom metal, and Priest combined Sabbath's developments of doom with raw speed and aggression, Mot\u00f6rhead brought punk into the newly formed sound of metal which would strongly influence the early thrash metal acts.\n\nAfter getting fired from heavy space rock pioneers Hawkwind in 1975 for \"doing the wrong drugs\" in Lemmy's words, Lemmy was on his own and formed his own band. Named after the last song Lemmy wrote for Hawkwind, Mot\u00f6rhead stormed onto the scene with their self-titled debut in 1977 (Although the release On Parole was recorded two years earlier, it wasn't released until 1979.). With the help of \"Fast\" Eddie Clark and Philthy \"Animal\" Taylor, Lemmy had already gotten together a now-classic metal lineup.\n\nMot\u00f6rhead, despite being a debut, is not much different from classics like Overkill and Ace of Spades. The only main difference is that you can still hear the remnants of the punk-y space metal of Lemmy's time in Hawkwind. That is most evident in the Hawkwind songs that were re-recorded for this debut. Along with the classic title track, \"Lost Johnny\" and \"The Watcher\" are both previous Hawkwind tracks written by Lemmy. The former originally appeared on 1974's Hall of the Mountain Grill, while the latter was found on 1972's Doremi Fasol Latido. Each of these songs all more-or-less retain the spacey punk metal of the original recordings, albeit with a bit more bite. This is Mot\u00f6rhead we're talking about after all.\n\nOut of the new songs \"Iron Horse/Born to Lose\" is a classic, and \"Keep Us on the Road\" has a nice mix of the space rock of Hawkwind and the already developed sound of Mot\u00f6rhead. The cover of the blues classic \"Train Kept a Rollin'\" kicks the ass of Aerosmith's cover with Mot\u00f6rhead delivering what I like to call Punk Blues. The remaining songs, \"Vibrator\" and \"White Line Fever\" are great too, but aren't quite as memorable as the rest of the tracks.\n\nJust like the debuts of Black Sabbath and Judas Priest, whom I mentioned before, Mot\u00f6rhead's debut album is a classic as well. It's not only a classic for paving the way for the band's sound, but it's simply a damn great album that appeals to both metalheads and punks. Do you want speed, but aren't quite in the mood for Slayer? You can't do much better than Mot\u00f6rhead.\n\nAttribution: http://www.metalmusicarchives.com/review/motorhead/319392\n",
        "\nI'm a huge Motorhead fan, but I gotta level with you reader, I do not get this album's acclaim. When I first heard it back in 2005 it sounded very generic to me then, and it sounds generic as hell to me now. There's a reason this isn't as discussed as Overkill or Ace of Spades, and it's the same reason Motorhead barely touched any of it live: It's not that good.\n\nWhich is not to say the whole thing is a snorefest. Dead Men Tell No Tales, Stone Dead Forever, and of course, the fantastic title track are all classics of metal. Though I must say as a personal preference, I never listen to the studio version. Fadeouts are always shit and the studio version actually makes you get kind of tired of that killer riff. No Sleep Til Hammersmith indeed. But in any case, either one of these three songs could have made the Overkill (or Ace of Spades) album and been a fine replacement for the snorefest that was Metropolis (or Dance?).\n\nBut the rest? Well, Lemmy remarked on how Jimmy Miller's heroin addiction was fucking everything up on this album during recording and it definitely shows. Sweet Revenge is an example of this. This was before Motorhead figured out to play slow like champs, this wouldn't be their first blunder in that department either (see:Metropolis). Sharpshooter would be a great song if not for that lame underdeveloped intro riff, which makes you want to hit the skip button within seconds. Poison sucks, just clunky from beginning to end. The entire thing really just reeks of underdeveloped ideas, and \"should have kept to Overkill tour on the road til 1980.\" The thing about Motorhead is when they're subpar, there's nothing inherently awful about it, but it is very generic. Incidentally Over The Top, a B-side, didn't make the album and not only was it better than most of the tracks here, but it would go on to be a live staple. Go figure. \n\nI will say that the lineup or Clarke/Kilmister/Taylor did have a synergy and a chemistry which has never quite been duplicated since. In no way does that declare anything about Motorhead's quality post that lineup (Another Perfect Day easily beats this), but there is a special sonic personality here. Perhaps it was just Fast Eddie's guitar tone, which, while undoubtedly metal, also had shades of rock & roll and even punk. There's no mistaking any of the post-Clarke/Taylor/Kilimister lineup for anything but metal. \n\nIn conclusion, what a waste of awesome cover art. If there were a list of \"weak albums with awesome cover art,\" this would have to be #1.\n\n\nRecommended tracks:\nDead Men Tell No Tales\n",
        "\nUsually, I hate to behave as an alternative person. So many are the people who amuse themselves going against common thinking, seeing it as cool or trendy. Music doesn't exactly differ from this, since it's not hard to find someone denigrating your Reign in Bloods, Ride the Lightnings etc. hoping to rile the passing metalheads, also on this site. I imagine them in the act of saying: 'Hey, it would be fantastic to make fun of *insert name of half world's favourite band here*, surely nobody has ever done it!' or similar. It has degenerated, really. Anyway, what does this reflection have to do with the review?\n\nBy now, I guess everyone has noticed the title, and most of all, in the eyes of many people, the certain dose of blasphemy it contains. Sure, I've listened to the Ace of Spades title-track countless times, it has never tired me, and possibly it never will. I recognize that the album is a milestone of Mot\u00f6rhead career and of music history, it's universally known. Same goes with Overkill and its historic, proto-metal opener. Still, when somebody asks me about the Bastards' 'definitive' album, I've never had any doubts: I've always answered with 4 numbers. Yes, my friends, this time it's my turn to differ. 1916 is my favourite album composed by the late Lemmy Kilmister's (road) crew, and probably the most complete of them. This because it's one of their few albums which contains no weak songs, a small flaw otherwise verifiable on most of their many 'classic' albums. \n\nAlthough Mot\u00f6rhead, at a surface level, have never been renowned for originality, be sure that you won't find 11 copycat tracks here. Rather, it seems that the band wanted to write an album which could sum up the best things of their first 15 years, and even recall some solutions experimented on the overlooked (but, needless to say, great) Another Perfect Day. There is speed, there is melody, there is emotion: there is Hard Rock, with capital letters, and plenty of it. The tracklist shows indeed all the different faces of 1916. We have powerful tracks like 'The One to Sing the Blues' and 'Make My Day' (one of my favourite songs ever), classic, carefree R'n'R cuts like 'Going to Brazil' and 'Angel City', the emotional apexes found in 'Love Me Forever' and the title-track, the anthemic 'No Voices in the Sky', the experimental, doomy 'Nightmare/The Dreamtime' or the punk-infused 'Ramones'... you know it's gonna be a great album when even the so-called fillers are pretty good! 'Shut You Down', while not a first choice of many, is straight-to-the-point and shredding; 'I'm So Bad (Baby I Don't Care)' is the only song which I didn't fall for, yet the guitar work is still stunning.\n\nMusically speaking, I feel Lemmy couldn't surround himself with better mates than he did here. Philthy Animal left his final mark, returning as a band member for the last time, but still showcasing sparks of brilliance like on the opener track. Guitarists W\u00fcrzel and Phil Campbell are instead at their 3rd effort, but their potential wasn't wholly exploited on the previous efforts, so it sounds like a step forward. Some of their leads are able to reach a legendary status, be it the seemingly endless outro of 'Make My Day' or the memorable climax of 'Love Me Forever' first solo, which still gives me goosebumps every time.\n\nThere's really no need to add something else: if, for some strange reason, you still haven't checked whether Mot\u00f6rhead are your ideal band or not, or (even worse) you don't know them and you need some music to begin, look no further than 1916. If you love Lemmy's crew you will surely have heard it, several times. But fuck it, play it again! It's too good to be left inactive.\n\nOn a final note, it really hurts to see that Phil Campbell is the only alive member to have played in this masterpiece. May Lemmy, W\u00fcrzel and Philthy rest in peace, mankind won't forget you.\n",
        "\nToday it is exactly a year ago that Lemmy left us in order to look what's going on in heaven. In view of this date, I want to pay tribute to the one who became an icon of heavy metal. Of course, he does not need to be honoured by an ordinary metalhead from Germany, but I'll just have to do it for my inner hygiene. \"Iron Fist\" was my first album of the band and the second metal album I ever bought. (The first was \"Let there be Rock\" and I still think that AC/DC deserve a place on this site. However, here is not the place to discuss this.) To be honest, \"Iron Fist\", the song as well as the entire album, is nothing else but the afterburner of \"Ace of Spades\", but come on, who gives a f**k about that? Even more than 34 years after its publication, the full-length has its charm, both the music and the lyrics (\"You feel much better when you take these little pills / I'm gonna give you 60 bottles, I believe in overkill... I'm the doctor\"). What I like the most about Mot\u00f6rhead is the way how they established two things in heavy metal: the dark, sometimes cynical humour and the dirty, coarse element that formed the basis for their compositions. Of course, their sixth album presents these features.\n\nThere are some things that all tracks of \"Iron Fist\" have in common. They rely on conventional patterns and they are short without redundant parts. Ballads are not included. Back in 1982, an emotional lament like \"1916\" would not have been possible. Nevertheless, the best songs of the album, which are placed at its beginning, do not only celebrate the triumph of intensity and brutality. In addition to these traits, they welcome the listener with surprisingly catchy elements. Fast Eddie pulls the strings for the last times and the succinct yet concise melodies indicate that Mot\u00f6rhead had more to deliver than absolutely simple tunes, although their rather primitive image spoke another language at the beginning of the eighties. The title track with its alarming chorus (\"You know me, evil eye, you know me, prepare to die\") alone is worth the money, but the unfriendly \"Go to Hell\", the fatalistic \"Loser\" and the patronising \"Heart of Stone\" leave some deep cuts as well. They all have this aforementioned iota of catchiness that separates great songs from ordinary noise. In addition, I must mention \"I'm the Doctor\" one more time, because its casual approach adds this sarcastic element which reflected Lemmy's personality very well (as far as I, who never met him, know). \n\nYet besides all these advantages of \"Iron Fist\", one cannot hide the fact that the trio runs out of ideas during the second half of the album. Somewhere I have read an honest statement of Lemmy who said that three of the twelve songs were actually not finished at the time of their recording and this lack of inspiration shimmers through titles such as \"(Don't Let 'Em) Grind Ya Down\". If the truth be told, I never have put the album on my turntable in order to listen to the pretty average tracks of the B side. Songs like \"America\" or \"Speedfreak\" do not score with the same amount of liveliness and belligerence that ennobles the outstanding title track or the further highlights.\n\nOne might be of the opinion that the guitar sound is too loud and polished, but I beg to differ. Lemmy's roughshod vocals ensure the necessary degree of ugliness and the album conveys this specific outlaw feeling that made, in combination with the thundering guitars, early heavy metal so unique. Thus, I cannot say that \"Iron Fist\" belongs to the most appreciated items of my collection, but it documents the metallic spirit of the early eighties very well. With regard to the better and more famous \"Ace of Spades\", \"Iron Fist\" is the outsider in the community of outsiders and, to a certain extent, the same applied for Lemmy, Philthy Animal and Fast Eddie back in 1982. Even in the metal society, they had a shady reputation. However, Lemmy, we all know it very well, made his way and reached the terminal station on the 28 December 2015. Rest in peace, Mr. Kilmister, and celebrate a good time with Philthy Animal and all the other guys in the celestial (or hellish?) sanctuary. Have a drink on us, unforgotten comrade, and rest assured; those you have left are trying to keep the flame burning.\n",
        "\nBack in the day when the phrase about the dying lawn \u2013 caused by Mot\u00f6rhead if they moved in next door \u2013 was coined I guess this song would have made a very fine example to illustrate the saying's meaning. Just try it for yourself: set up some decent speakers in your garden, play this song at full volume and watch every single blade of grass turn brown and drop to the ground in no time (affects beetles and stuffy neighbors too).\n\nRe-recording classic songs is not much appreciated by many metalheads. Often the original renditions are deemed to be definitive and there would be no need for a re-recording. I second this opinion, especially if the re-recording is clearly subpar compared to the original and takes a place in time where a new album with fresh material could have been \u2013 I'm looking at you, Manowar!\n\nLemmy and his lads were wise enough not to re-record a whole album. Instead they decided to give one of the most well known 'head songs a try. So here we have \"Overkill (Exclusive version)\" which was originally recorded in 2006, appeared on a vinyl the following year and has been reissued approximately three months after the demise of Mot\u00f6rhead's mastermind.\n\nNow that's what I call a proper re-recording! Though the original song from 1978/1979 got a nostalgia vibe and roughness that was rather uncommon back then \u2013 and is still a killer tune \u2013 the 2006 rendition simply slays in each and every aspect.\nLemmy's bass work is as great as usual, his vocals that are as gruffy as we all love them don't show a sign of age yet. Phil's guitars and solos are on point while Mikkey provides a steady and classy drum bombardement. So we have top notch musicianship here but the sound is where this little baby really shines. Everything is mixed so perfectly balanced and there's so much force here that this recording stands as a landmark in Mot\u00f6rhead's studio sound. The bass has truckloads of punch, the guitars blend in perfectly and the drums simply make your ears shake with their natural and pummeling tone. The overall sound is like Lemmy smashing 100 bottles of Jack Daniel's over your head along the double bass rhythm and forcing you to lick up whiskey and shards alike \u2013 pure joy and pain at the same time.\n\nThis is near perfection. The only thing they could have skipped is the last reprise which gives the song more length than it needs to take full effect. Actually it does so within half a minute: simply listen to the first 30 seconds and you already know how awesome this ride's gonna be.\n\nIf you find some folks who don't know what Mot\u00f6rhead sounds like just play this song to them. They shall understand...\n",
        "\nBefore this band went on to mix their dirty, fast punk with metal elements that gave rise (eventually) to every extreme metal and punk band ever, we have this scrappy little album. Consider this a rough template for the classic Mot\u00f6rhead sound, a booze-fueled mixture of aggressive, hard edged hard rock and dirtied punk rock. While not quite as savage, intense, heavy or fast as what would follow the undeniable vigour and attitude that this band had right up until the end is clear as day, behind the gritty production. The songs are short, sweet and to the point. We don't have any too structurally elaborate or complex (despite the numerous Hawkwind covers) but that's OK - simply rocking out is what Mot\u00f6rhead does best.\n\nThe riffs are dirty hard rock riffs that were pretty standard issue for the time, but are aggressive enough to drive the songs well. The distinctive grumbling, rhythm-guitar like bass lines of Lemmy are perpetually in the background, giving rise to the punk bounce and added aggression behind the riffs, and also making the album sound quite rough, combined with the production. The vocals are like an early take on the characteristic and terrible-yet-awesome 'I've just had 3 bottles of Jack Daniels' singing voice, they're not quite as rough or powerful as they would be on subsequent recordings. In fact they sound quite clean when held up against the rough'n'ready nature of the production or the guitars, and are the only thing that really makes it sound like a Mot\u00f6rhead album.\n\nThe main issue though is that outside of a few songs (like the first couple) nothing really sticks. The album lacks the identity and memorability of say, their next album, and is held back a bit by a few weaker songs. It is still caught up in the trappings of late '70s punk rock, and the fact that occasionally the band's trademark sound shines through makes me think of this as a transitional piece. When viewed in context (as the album that follows On Parole ) it is a movement to their signature sound, but they're not quite there yet. It's still a very good booze and attitude driven bit of scrappy punk rock, but at every turn you realise that it could be so much more, and that the band hasn't existed long enough to find their sound yet. Should you get it though? Of course - not a lot of albums are more historically important than the debut of extreme metal and punk's godfathers.\n",
        "\n''Clean Your Clock'' was probably released to honor late rock ' roll legend and Mot\u00f6rhead bassist and singer Lemmy. This last live album covers one of the band's last concerts recorded in Munich a little bit more than a month before Lemmy's death. It's already clearly audible that Lemmy is struggling here and very sick. It's admirable that he was still able to tour at this time. He gives his very best to play bass and perform vocals accurately on this release but he is sometimes lacking energy. His vocals have always been a little bit hoarse and mumbling but certain parts of the lyrics are nearly impossible to hear and to understand. It's simply saddening to hear and see this legendary artist that way and it would have been much better not to release this record to keep the memory of a juvenile and tight rock star instead of a sick old man who just wasn't able to stop performing when his health issues seriously impacted his abilities. If you want to see a more recent concert of the band where Lemmy was still in acceptable form, you should go for the two volumes of ''The W\u00f6rld Is Ours'' released five and four years prior to this output, respectively. If you simply want to listen to more recent material instead of watching one single show, the bonus live disc of the tour edition of ''Aftershock'' is also quite satisfactory. \n\nLemmy's declining health that becomes obvious in performances of songs like ''Orgasmatron'' isn't the only problem with this release. The crowd is rarely audible and an authentic live atmosphere is absent. In my opinion, the lengthy introduction, guitar solo and drum solo prove that the band already intended to give Lemmy longer breaks than usually during the last tours and while this makes perfect sense in the context, I must admit that these parts aren't particularly interesting to watch or listen to.\n\nOn a positive note, Lemmy really delivers an outstanding job if one considers how sick he really was. His bass play is solid, he doesn't forget any lyrics as far as they're audible to me and his interactions with the crowd are very sympathetic. The fact that he dedicates the song ''Doctor Rock'' to the band's deceased ex-drummer Philthy Animal is also a nice touch. The authentic and unpolished sound of this release fits the band. Especially the guitar play is really solid throughout the entire show concerning both the riffs and the solos. The set list is also quite good and includes both some of the band's greatest hits plus a few more recent tunes. Obviously, some people might argue that some classics are missing but at that point one shouldn't forget that it was already a miracle that the band was able to pull off this show. Let's also add that some of the stage decorations as during the opening tune ''Bomber'' look truly awesome.\n\nDespite several positive points that make the final result tolerable, it would have been better to cancel this last live record and to release an older and more energizing show or a greatest hits compilation with a few bonus tracks instead. Only die-hard Mot\u00f6rhead fans should purchase this record. For anyone else, it's rather depressing to hear and see Lemmy in such a bad condition.\n",
        "\nIt's pretty much the general opinion that Motorhead has wrote the same song since their debut. A good song done well, but nothing worth listening too once you heard it a million times. However, that's only what the uninitiated surface fan whose only listened to \"Ace of Spades\" and the beginning to \"Overkill\" would say. Throughout their vast career, Lemmy and his gaggle of drunk musicians have explored many different genres within the world of rock while retaining their style since the beginning. For example, their debut would be punk rock if the band had absolutely no talent. Or how about their experimental album known as \"Another Perfect Day\". Can't forget about their thrash-laden bullet train, \"Bastards\". Or perhaps the most baffling of all, their foray into blues on \"Inferno\". Point is, Motorhead is more diverse than any of these half-baked jerk-offs are giving them credit for. However, you can only see this observation over the span of their entire discography. Suffice to say, individual albums can be summed up by a couple of songs off them. By no means is that a bad thing. If anything, that's called consistency and that's what this album is, a consistently great hell-ride.\n\nThe most notable track off this album is...well, do I even have to say it? Everyone fucking knows \"Ace of Spades\". The song by itself is trumpeted for setting the foundation of speed and thrash metal. This is the first Motorhead song that anyone has ever heard. You all know the lyrics and the main riff off the top of your heads. There's nothing more I can say about this song except for one thing: Lemmy never remembers the lyrics to the bridge when performing live. I swear, I hear it every time when Lemmy is supposed to say, \"That's the way I like it baby, I don't want to live forever, and don't forget the joker!\" I guess a man whose known for his intake of booze and amphetamines would be little forgetful. Just look at Ozzy.\n\nEven though that's the most memorable and popular track of the album, I wouldn't list it as the best. No, that title goes to a tie between \"Fast and Loose\" and \"Jailbait\". Picking between them is like choosing your favorite whorehouse prostitute: it comes down to personal kinks. On one hand, you have \"Fast and Loose\" which details Lemmy's sexual exploits in the late night. Apparently, this chick likes it fast and loose which also serves as an accurate description of this album, come to think of it. It has this old timey rock and roll swing to it which is present in basically every Motorhead song, but is more discernible here. It really displays how artists from that early era of rock influenced Lemmy. The downside to this awesome song is the lackluster solo courtesy of \"Fast\" Eddie Clarke. Looks like Eddie is more suited for...you know, fast material as opposed to this slightly down tempo piece. On the other hand, you have \"Jailbait\" which details Lemmy's sexual exploits...okay, y'all might be on to something for saying that he has a bit of a one-track mind. However, there's a twist, this song is about Lemmy's fixation for underage girls...Oh. God damn it, I'm trying to defend you here, Lemmy. Anyway, this song is catchy as all hell. Not only is that accredited to Lemmy and Eddie's riff crafting, but also Phil Taylor's drumming. Christ, what a fucking animal. \n\nLooking back on this record, I noticed some flaws. For one, there's 12 fucking tracks. That's way too many for an album that's the equivalent of a speeding bullet through a desert hell. Despite the fact that there's 12 tracks, it's only 36 minutes long. I think the only reason why there's so many tracks is due to making the time length quota. You know, the Anal Cunt dilemma. However, I don't think some of y'all will see that as a problem. I mean, what's the matter with more Motorhead? To me, that just adds to much filler to this legendary album. It makes a complete listen through just slightly more tedious. Shave the album down to 8 songs by cutting out songs like \"Fire Fire\", \"Dance\", \"Bite the Bullet\", and \"The Chase Is Better Than the Catch\" and this record would be perfect.\n\nOf course, I strongly recommend this album. Looking back with fresh eyes, the album displays some minor faults that personally irritate me. However, it's a classic for a reason. This album showed the world that Motorhead is a force to be reckoned with. It's incredibly fast and unforgiving with its blend of heavy metal and hard rock elements. While technically overrated, I don't mind the praise that it deserves. This album paved the way for thrash, speed, and almost in a way, the entire extreme metal genre as we know it. I'd tell you to pick it up, but chances are that you probably already own this classic.\n\nBonus: This version of the album comes with a second disk that contains 11 alternate versions, 3 live versions, and one actual bonus track. I'm not going to talk about the live and alternate versions since that'll just be treading the same territory. No, I'll be covering astoundingly awesome \"Dirty Love\". Technically, this is the B-side to the \"Ace of Spades\" single, but I can't think of anywhere else where I can cover it. This song takes off with Eddie shredding away with an all to catchy rhythm section behind him. The solos to this song is impressive to say the least. This is Eddie in his Prime and there's no restraining him. This song serves as a platform to why Eddie Clark is a great guitarist and why the classic lineup is Motorhead's best lineup. Not much else to say, but instead ask why? Why was this a b-side and not on the actually album? I'd be a lot less harsh on those filler tracks if this track was there to hold me back. Anyway, I'd recommend the Sanctuary Records 2005 2CD deluxe edition under one condition: if you don't already own the \"Ace of Spades\" single. Otherwise, it'll be a waste of $31 for some soiled versions of already great songs. Seriously, you can get about 31 chicken sandwiches at McDonalds with that money.\n",
        "\nMot\u00f6rhead's first offering (technically their second recording, but whatever) - their self-titled album - was released in 1977. It opens with \"Motorhead\", which was the final song Lemmy would write for Hawkwind. So, technically being a cover, Mot\u00f6rhead's rendition of the song stays fairly true to the Hawkwind version(s), but is faster and grittier, less psychedelic, more straight-to-the-point, and Lemmy's vocals are gruffier than in his Hawkwind days. Despite all that, the nature of the music is still very rock 'n' roll; only done in a new way. This is essentially what Mot\u00f6rhead is all about.\n\nThe album continues in a similar vein. With a couple of more Hawkwind covers, as well as a Tiny Bradshaw cover. They're all good; especially \"The Watcher\", which has \"Fast\" Eddie Clarke ripping out some wicked leads all over the damn joint. Songs penned by Lemmy and his comrades in Mot\u00f6rhead, not Hawkwind, are the more interesting ones. \"Iron Horse / Born to Lose\" is a Mot\u00f6rhead classic by now; a sleazy, laid-back rocker with an awesome guitar solo by Clarke. The song retains the strong blues elements that, after all, is the main culprit by the birth of hard rock and heavy metal. \"White Line Fever\" is also very bluesy in nature, but doesn't sit as well as \"Iron Horse / Born to Lose\" does. However, \"Keep Us on the Road\" stands as the album's best tune. A classic heavy metal-sounding tune with a somewhat laid-back, mid-paced tempo, catchy guitars and strong vocal lines. Maybe not a Mot\u00f6rhead classic a la \"Ace of Spades\", \"Overkill\" and \"Bomber\", but definitely knocks this album up a few levels.\n\nThis album suffers a little bit from mediocre filler tunes, but at the same time, has some great tunes as well, with \"Motorhead\", \"Iron Horse / Born to Lose\" and \"Keep Us on the Road\" standing as absolute highlights, so there is no excuse to not listen to the band's first release. It shows what Lemmy's intentions were with Mot\u00f6rhead. A raw, testosterone-filled rock band that combines elements of rock 'n' roll and bluesy heavy metal that would pave the way for punk and speed metal. The best thing is, that it only got better from here for the band, as their next few releases would be based on the very same ideas as the ones present on this album, but with improved song-writing and better overall execution.\n",
        "\n\"Look, if I see things as being f*cked, I'm gonna tell you they're f*cked. I can't sit there any say, 'Oh, everything's nice because I've got a new Porsche...[not that I do].\" - Lemmy\n\n1986 was such a landmark year for metal already that a new Motorhead album must have seemed like extra icing on an already dense, heavy cake. During a time when the metal genre seemed inexorably careening into ever-crazier realms of extremity, Orgasmatron was an important reminder that metal's roots were unforgotten. At the time, it was the first studio effort from Lemmy and friends in three years--which is a long time for them!\n\nAssuming they spent all that time just drinking and writing, the effort really shows: the songs on Orgasmatron are some of the band's finest...and angriest.\n\nUnlike the gentlemen of Motorhead themselves, I'm not as critical of Orgasmatron's production, which was mixed by an engineer from the then-untested, 80s hip-hop world. It can sound a bit thin and tinny at times, but it's nothing to really complain about. Lemmy's vocals are a bloodthirsty roar throughout, the best and clearest I've heard from those whiskey-soaked pipes. Especially on \"Claw,\" where he tries his hand at a climbing, banshee yell. \"Deaf Forever\" is a rousing call to attention, a fist-raising rally of shouts calling the fans to order. \"Nothing Up My Sleeve\" is noteworthy to me for its well-phrased, Old West style guitar solo.\n\nDespite the hot start, I think this is one of those albums where the second half is even better than the first, and a key factor is the title track, a dark anti-religion-and-politics scree. \"Orgasmatron\" finds Lemmy diving below the audio surface of his usual yell. The song is deceptively simple, but it is Motorhead's sheer force of will that makes it a classic. It is an unstoppable march. Sepultura covered the song as well, and Max Cavalera claims he got completely hammered just so he could experience what it was like to rip through a Motorhead cover while blackout drunk. I'm surprised he made it through the intense lyrics:\n\n\"Your bones will build my palaces\nYour eyes will stud my crown.\"\n\nNot all the songs are angry, though. The live classic \"Doctor Rock\" has been the Motorhead show opener for many years, and it's a rollicking fun time. I wonder how many headbangers have complimented a woman by telling her she has \"a body like a Marshall stack.\" If you do attempt this and she responds well...keep her.\n\nAnother reason the second half of Orgasmatron rips even more than the first is \"Mean Machine,\" one of the band's fastest all-time tracks. The band is simply all over this song in tight form, and then you have two of Lemmy's most autobiographical songs to follow. They describe his life to a T, \"not giving a good god damn\" (in \"Built For Speed\") and \"spitting in the devil's eye\" (in \"Ridin With the Driver\"). \"Don't you listen to a single word against rock n' roll\" is a lyric that rings with ultimate truth in its delivery.\n\nSadly the world is no less of a shitshow today than it was in Lemmy's 1986. But like the hell-train on Orgasmatron's cover, the force of Motorhead's music remains an unstoppable ride with a big grin and a big Jack and Coke into the future...one that is better, or worse.\n\nWritten by and for www.headofmetal.com\n",
        "\nWhile Mot\u00f6rhead previously recorded On Parole, which was shelved by the record company and later rerecorded, this is not only the first album to be released to the public but also the first to feature the classic lineup. After been given the boot from Hawkwind for being busted for drugs at the Canadian border, Lemmy decided he was going to create the world\u2019s dirtiest rock 'n\u2019 roll band, which he aptly called Bastard. After being convinced that Bastard was not commercially viable, the name was switched to the last Hawkwind song Lemmy wrote, \u201cMotorhead\u201d. Coming off like classic rock 'n\u2019 roll reimagined for the greasiest, most hedonistic biker bar imaginable, Lemmy did succeed in creating some of the dingiest rock of the \u201870s (and he must have done something right, as Mot\u00f6rhead was one of the biggest influences for the earliest examples of extreme metal). \n\nThat said, I honestly don\u2019t give this album the time of day very often. While some songs are much more memorable than others, it\u2019s definitely an enjoyable album. The main problem here is no fault of the album \u2013 it\u2019s that they\u2019ve created other albums in the same style that are much better. However, Lemmy and company laid down one hell of a template here. This mixes old rock 'n\u2019 roll, punk and early metal with a methamphetamine-laced outskirts of society vibe and the result is a hell of a lot of fun. Lemmy had a habit of correcting people who called Mot\u00f6rhead a metal band, saying they were either a punk or rock 'n\u2019 roll band. While metal is clearly the genre Mot\u00f6rhead sonically best falls into, Lemmy was always more inspired by the likes of Little Richard than Black Sabbath (even if some of Iommi\u2019s playing seeps into a few of the solos). This does have a decidedly rock n\u2019 roll backbone, which they use as a springboard to explore the murky depths of the darker side of society. The one factor giving the band its most potent edge is Lemmy's vocals. The gruff just-chasing-my-whiskey-with-some-razorblades vocals are the one real showstopper here. For all their rough around the edges appeal, if you peel back the jack and coke drenched exterior, there's often quite a bit of catchy melody. \n\nHalf of this album is comprised of covers, probably a product of having to start from scratch after the original debut was rejected. Three out four of the cover songs are of songs that Lemmy sang on during his tenure in Hawkwind. While I do prefer the more expansive feel of the Hawkwind songs, reimagining these songs with a dirtier sound was not a bad idea. The song from which the band derives its name is the obvious victor of the three, with its testosterone-drenched attitude practically screaming for this heavier makeover.\u201d Lost Johnny\u201d is pretty cool, and the only one that doesn\u2019t really make sense is \u201cThe Watcher\u201d. Hawkwind\u2019s original was a wonderful sun-soaked acoustic tune and the cover version just sounds like it could be any other song on the album, although it\u2019s one of the weaker tracks as the songwriting doesn\u2019t carry over particularly well. The final cover is of the classic 50\u2019s rock n\u2019 roll song \u201cTrain Kept-a-Rollin\u201d, which the band updates wonderfully. As for the rest of the songs there are two that really stand out: the impossibly fun early punk ruckus of \u201cVibrator\u201d, and easily the most metal of the bunch, \u201cIron Horse/Born To Lose\u201d, with its grime-laden biker punch. \n\nWhile the self-titled debut definitely sounds like the Mot\u00f6rhead we all know and love, this is a quite primitive form of the band. Featuring dirty barebones production and simplistic song structures, this largely relies on memorable songwriting and grit. The only thing not dead simple about this is the lead guitar, which is mostly a haze of bluesy rock n\u2019 roll but also contain hints of the more melodic style that would punctuate 80\u2019s metal. While this is far from being Lemmy\u2019s crowning moment, it\u2019s pretty interesting to hear the origins of this legendary band. And, hell, this is a pretty good album for what it is.\n",
        "\nOne would think after a while, Mot\u00f6rhead's brand of punked up sleazy rock metal would get tiring. Sure, there are times when they do sound a bit worse for wear, even though there are always a few good songs to thrash along to. And every now and then this old dog just rips the opposition apart with albums that harken the halcyon days of the early 1980's. We Are Mot\u00f6rhead is definitely one such album. \n\nAt its heart we have Mot\u00f6rhead at their most metallic. As you would expect there are still plenty of punk and rock bits but overall this is pure speed metal bliss. The riffs are, for the most part, fast and furious and even at times even modern in a late 1990's kind of way. But, importantly, they maintain that memorable Mot\u00f6rhead vibe the band has been known for.\n\nThere is an aggression and energy here that even young bands struggle to attain. Lemmy's trademark delivery is superb and would not be out of place on Overkill or Ace Of Spaces. He does tone it down for the softer and heartfelt \"One More Fucking Time\" which is an absolutely Mot\u00f6rhead classic in this author's mind.\n\nIf one has to fault the album, it would be in its relative short running time of a mere 38 minutes. The title track pummels along and then nothing, despite the listener being ready for more furious yet catchy riffage, more Lemmy and certainly more beer. In many ways that's not a criticism. After all like most good things in life, you want just enough to leave you wanting more!\n",
        "\nReleased after a major lineup change, Orgasmatron is Mot\u00f6rhead's first full studio album to feature a two guitar lineup. The style has changed a great deal from albums such as Ace of Spades. Instead of a holding a rock and roll style, Orgasmatron takes some influence from the thrash metal that Mot\u00f6rhead was a major influence on.\n\nLike most good metal albums, Orgasmatron has a raging opener. \"Deaf Forever\" has an extremely simple riff and strong structure, but it is fucking heavy. It contains some pretty serious lyrics, which is something new for Mot\u00f6rhead, as most of their earlier lyrics were more about fun and games. There are even Viking references in \"Deaf Forever\". The more serious themes are present throughout Orgasmatron, along with typical Mot\u00f6rhead sex, drugs, and rock and roll lyrics.\n\nSongs such as \"Nothing Up My Sleeve\" and \"Ain't My Crime\" are fun, speed metal type songs that contrast with the darker, political and antireligious tendencies of songs like \"Orgasmatron\", which is one of the best songs on Orgasmatron. While it is actually one of the slowest songs on the album, if not the slowest, \"Orgasmatron\" takes a lot of inspiration from bands like Metallica and Megadeth, with its political lyrics. It is definitely new territory for Mot\u00f6rhead, as is the war themed opener.\n\nOrgasmatron has what, in the realm of Mot\u00f6rhead, could be considered epics. Most of Mot\u00f6rhead's songs are fast, under three minute tracks. Nothing on Orgasmatron goes on for much longer than a short five mintues, but this is long for Mot\u00f6rhead. Also, with darker, more serious themes, and more musically mature song structures, Orgasmatron becomes even more of an \"epic\" type album. The most \"epic\" songs on Orgasmatron are \"Deaf Forever\", \"Orgasmatron\", and \"Built for Speed\". \"Built for Speed\" is a nice, fun metal anthem. It is about the typical sex, drugs, and rock and roll stuff, but it puts these lyrics into the format of an epic song.\n\nDespite the darker stuff, Orgasmatron is an album loaded with humor. The title of the album is the first instance of humor you will notice. \"Orgasmatron\"- it sounds like some brand of vibrator. Actually, it was named after something from a comic book. The title track is very deceptively titled, as it is actually the most serious song on the album. Still, it gives a good laugh while you listen. \"Claw\", also known as \"ClawBomber\" on some versions. This may be a misprint of some sort. \"Claw\" contains a hilarious sexual reference. It is clearly one of the more fun songs on Orgasmatron.\n\nAfter the fun \"Ridin' With the Driver\", and the rather humorous \"Doctor Rock\", comes \"Orgasmatron\", the albums centerpiece that also happens to be the closing track. \"Orgasmatron\" is a dark, slow epic. It has some of the greatest lyrics ever written. It is essentially a dark poem about the main ills of society- politics, religion, and war, from Lemmy's point of view. Not only are the lyrics themselves the most powerful lyrics Lemmy has ever written, the vocal delivery is also Lemmy's most powerful. This is especially evident on the last verse about war. His voice is low and grinding, as opposed to his usual, dry rasp. This is most likely where Abbath Doom Occulta of Inmortal got the idea for singing like he does. While actually a quite simple song, \"Orgasmatron\" is definitely the best part of the album. It is insanely heavy, and it has a great solo that is actually quite rock and roll influenced.\n\nOrgasmatron is a very underrated album, and one of Mot\u00f6rhead's best releases. It is a must have. I would even say that it should be one of the first Mot\u00f6rehead albums you buy.\n",
        "\nIf you are new to Mot\u00f6rhead, and are wondering which album to start with, Overkill would be a great place to start. While Ace of Spades gets a lot of attention, Overkill is the better option for the new listener of Mot\u00f6rhead.\n\nOverkill has more speed metal tendencies than the self titled debut, which carried more rock and roll and psychedelic tendencies. This is the first Mot\u00f6rhead to feature the style that Mot\u00f6rhead would become so well known for. The classic, gritty, speed metal is extremely prevalent here.\n\nThe opening track, \"Overkill\" is a a rather fun speed metal track, complete with double bass drumming from Phil \"Philthy Animal\" Taylor. It seems like a relatively straightforward song, but deceptively so. It starts like a regular song, but then it stops with a fakeout ending, an then it starts again. It does this a few more time, making room for some of the best solos by Mot\u00f6rhead, or even in metal in general.\n\nWhile a lot of Overkill is very fast, songs like \"Stay Clean\" move at a slower midtempo that would ask be used on later Mot\u00f6rhead albums. Even the midtempo songs are excellent, though. \"Damage Case\" is an almost fast song that is quite heavy, as well as very catchy. Like the title track, \"Damage Case\" is classic that will stick with you upon hearing overkill. It is also one of Mot\u00f6rhead's heaviest songs, thanks to Lemmy's aggressive style of bass playing.\n\nAll of the elements that make Mot\u00f6rhead kick ass are present on Overkill. Lemmy's harsh voice has gotten even harsher than it was on the debut. He also has a very youthful sound to his vocals here. This is an obvious improvement in the vocal field. Lemmy's signature bass playing is also excellent. Like the vocals, the bass has gotten harsher, in terms of distortion. His distorted bass grinds in the background like an extremely heavy rhythm guitar. The only actual guitar Mot\u00f6rhead need is the lead guitar, because Lemmy plays his bass as if it were a guitar. Phil \"Philthy Animal\" Taylor uses the trademark double bass drumming technique that he at least popularised, if not invented. This, alongside with the harsh vocals, intense speed, and gritty bass playing, helped to give rise to thrash metal. Metallica and Overkill, who went as far as to take their name from the album, were both extremely inspired by Mot\u00f6rhead's Overkill.\n\nLead guitar wise, this is Mot\u00f6rhead's best work. \"Fast\" Eddie Clarke provides great solos, especially on the title track. Normally, a guitarist would limit their playing to only rhythm guitar during a main riff or verse riff. With Mot\u00f6rhead, however, Eddie Clark sounds as if he plays a lead version of the riff being played by the bass. Lemmy plays the root note, and Eddie Clarke plays the top of the chord, leading to a sound that is unique to early Mot\u00f6rhead. This is most prominent on the title track.\n\nWhile Ace of Spades is a great album with fun music, Mot\u00f6rhead's true peak lies at Overkill. Overkill has a great deal over variety. There is everything from the bluesy, slower \"Capricorn\" to the extreme speed metal songs like \"Overkill\" and \"No Class\", which along with \"Damage Case\", are the best songs on Overkill.\n\nLike I mentioned, the rock and roll sound has been toned down quite a bit. This is a good thing for Mot\u00f6rhead and their fans. \"No Class\" retains some rock and roll, but it still manages to keep enough speed metal to make it an awesome song. \n\nOverkill is an excellent Mot\u00f6rhead record. It is filled with awesome, insanely heavy riffs provided by Lemmy, as well as excellent drumming from Philthy Animal. Overkill is another must hear classic from Mot\u00f6rhead.\n\nR.I.P Lemmy.\n",
        "\nAnother Perfect Day is a real odd-duck in Motorhead's discography. The fact that it came right after Fast Eddie Clark quit the band and was released a short time after their \"classic trilogy\" (Ace Of Spades, Bomber and Overkill) made the timing for this album a really under appreciated album and a quite obscure one in their discography.\n\nAlong with Fast's departure, the band resurrected with a new guitar player- Brian Robertson of Thin Lizzy, which introduced a different approach to the usual Motorhead sound. Take the songs Dancing On Your Grave and I Got Mine for example- they both feature a very melodic intro and an accompanying riff (which is something the band has never done before), and both having some great hooks and catchy solos as well as being heavy and having a genuine Motorhead essence to it. It is accompanied by some very simple straightforward drumming patterns by Philthy Animal which fit the music perfectly and set the pace to the album with emphasizing the guitars and the vocals at the same time- a thing which not many bands would achieve in their entire careers.\n\nAs of every Motorhead album, there are some speed metal songs (Back At the Funny Farm and Shine being the most notable) which really outshine themselves this time- they aren't the usual \"fast heavy metal\" songs the band has known to produce- but actually feature some speed/early thrash characteristics this time with being bluesy and melodic at the same time- sounding more like an Eric Clapton/ Metallica hybrid would have done rather than just being mediocre. Another standout point in this album are the slow, chuggy songs that take a major place in the album- they don't hurt your usual Motorhead album headbanging routine, but instead, make it much more diverse and interesting- Lemmy sounds more aggressive, yet having a larger gnarling scale this album. This fact is one of the most definitive highlights of this release- they accentuate the music and function like an instrument themselves.\n\nThe production is the most muddy production a Motorhead album has ever had- and works perfectly. The instruments and vocals are embroidered into each other, creating a not-so cacophonous mess and empowering the whole \"metal essence\" of the release- along with the lyrics, that focus more on society-based issues rather than focusing on the classic sex/women/rock n' roll lyrics that characterize the rest of their discography. Overall, this flawless album is definitely one of the best Motorhead albums ever forged, and marked a new era for the band. Mandatory.\n\nStandout songs: Dancing On Your Grave,  I Got Mine, Shine\n\nR.I.P Lemmy (1945-2015)\nR.I.P Philty Animal (1954-2015)\n",
        "\nContrary to popular belief, Motorhead didn\u2019t always release the same album every time they recorded something. While they didn\u2019t stray too far from the template that was laid down by Lemmy\u2019s bass distortion and gargled wheeze, their sound did evolve over time as they discovered variations to their tried and true formula. 2004\u2019s Inferno is one of the finest examples of this phenomenon, giving the band a major burst of energy as they were reaching the latter days of their career.\n\nOverkill and Ace of Spades are more influential and were ungodly vicious for their time, but Inferno just might be the heaviest album Motorhead ever put out. Phil Campbell\u2019s guitar tone is at its most dominant thanks to the bright production job though the rhythm section still holds its own throughout. The songs themselves also seem to be more up tempo than usual as the pummeling \u201cTerminal Show\u201d and \u201cFight!\u201d pack in several thrash riffs while others such as \u201cLife\u2019s A Bitch\u201d and \u201cSmiling Like A Killer\u201d thrive on a punk oriented delivery.\n\nOf course, the sing-along hooks still offer plenty of melody and there are some slower moments that keep things interesting. \u201cSuicide\u201d may be the most accessible song on here thanks to its building guitar work and surprisingly catchy vocal layering and \u201cKeys to the Kingdom\u201d also stands out for its mid-tempo shuffle. One also can\u2019t forget about the closing \u201cWhorehouse Blues\u201d as Mikkey Dee trades his drums in for another guitar and Lemmy breaks out the harmonica for a rousing acoustic jam that makes you wonder how many of these the band had left in them.\n\nBut when it comes down to it, Inferno stands out thanks to its more ambitious scope. You won\u2019t find any fancy frills on here but moments like the building intro on \u201cKillers\u201d and the lyrical imagery on \u201cIn the Year of the Wolf\u201d give things a more noticeable weight than usual. Albums like 1916 had attempted this sort of thing before but it\u2019s never sounded as natural as it does here.\n\nIf Inferno isn\u2019t the best album that Motorhead ever put out, then it\u2019s a surprisingly powerful addition to their extensive discography at the very least. The songs may be not as iconic as their classic staples but they\u2019re written with a great deal of care and the energy involved is well worth the price of admission. It\u2019s a shame that the band never reached their level of intensity again but they never stopped finding ways to live up to their unshakeable reputation.\n\nHighlights:\n\u201cTerminal Show\u201d\n\u201cKillers\u201d\n\u201cSuicide\u201d\n\u201cSmiling Like A Killer\u201d\n\u201cWhorehouse Blues\u201d\n",
        "\n('That's the way I like it baby, I don't wanna live forever...')\n\nWhen listening to a Mot\u00f6rhead album, one should come in with these expectations: Simple songwriting, simple riffs, gruff vocals, lyrics about sex, alcohol and gambling, and just a general sense of pure fucking testosterone driven Grade-A vintage coolness. Rarely will you hear something that better represents the absolute rebellious rock attitude that was espoused by the best acts of the genre than this. Take any song, at any given moment, and it is about as awesome and driven as it comes.\n\nFrom start to finish, this is just about the finest hard rock you will ever come across. Literally 99% of all rock albums you are thinking of right now that you believe to be better than this? You are wrong. None of those albums display the carefree, laid back and yet booze fueled drive that this has. Lemmy's lyricism and vocals on this is a really good summation of why this album is the epitome of coolness. Lemmy's vocals sound like a man who has done several hundred women and downed at least... oh I don't know, 500 bottles of whiskey? And I mean that in the best possible way, though his voice can be considered technically awful, it just works so well. He has a very gruff and yet powerful singing voice, one that goes with the gruff and powerful guitars singing about living fast.\n\nAnd those riffs... oh my word. Admittedly, there aren't too many of them, and they are kind of similar. However, who gives a flying FUCK?! Every last riff on here is driven, aggressive, dirty and once again, fuckin' cool! They are some of the finest hard rock riffs you will ever hear, perhaps with a slight punkish bounce to them too. They are meaty and powerful in their sound, going full speed ahead into the night. Lemmy's bass lines are loud and follow the riffs closely, further reinforcing the riffs and giving them that extra bit of grunt, not that they needed them in the first place. The drums are pretty good too, throwing in loads of little fills and rolls along with the simple straight beats. The solos are bluesy, pedal driven, and melodic, serving as an interesting counterpoint to the rough as hell vocal performance.\n\nOne criticism that I need to address is the lack of variety. The riffs sound similar, the vocal style is constant, all the solos are cut from a similar cloth, all the songs sound the same, etc.. To this my response is: WHO FUCKING CARES?! Really, when every last song features consistently aggressive, driving and memorable riffs backed up by a consistently loud and ugly bass, when every song has Lemmy's cool lyrics and awesome vocals, why the fuck is that a reason to complain? Mot\u00f6rhead are one of the most consistent bands ever, and the fact that you can select practically any song of theirs and always get awesome... everything, is a testament to just how driven and passionate their music is. The fact that Lemmy can mix up the same formula for 23 albums and never ever produce something even remotely bad (even if it bordered on average at times) just shows how creative and beautifully simple Mot\u00f6rhead's music is.\n\nIt isn't like the songs ever overstay their welcome, either. Nothing here is longer than 5 minutes, or even 4 and a half. They never really stagnate due to the immense amount of energy and drive put into the performances, and even if they do start to drag a tiny bit (to you that is, I have no issues with this) you will be headbanging too much to even care. The guitars play their punkish heavy metal/hard rock riffs with the utmost urgency and carefree nature, the drums are simple and yet highly energetic with double bass and fills all around, what isn't there to like? This album is the very embodiment of what heavy metal is. Pushing things to extremes. This was, for its time, highly driven and aggressive, about as rough and heavy as it came. Later bands built upon it, taking one individual element of this album and pushing it to the absolute maximum. These guys play on '11' for the whole fucking album, never once stopping to think.\n\nThese songs are not necessarily technically amazing, and may even come across as dumb, but Mot\u00f6rhead have always been a band that is more entertaining as a complete package. Everything about their music fits together to form one massive rocking whole. The individual instruments are OK on their own, but come together (along with the rough as hell production) to produce aggressive, heavy and driving music. The songs fit together to make 40 minute odes to booze and women. And these odes fit together to make Mot\u00f6rhead's complete run, their enormous bastion of riffage, their legacy. You can't necessarily pick out a single stand out from this pack, but it all comes together.\n\nThis, my friends, is the very embodiment of what we stand for. Rebellion, not giving a damn, turning it up to 11 all day every day, living fast and dying old. Maybe this isn't the most technically accomplished album ever, but really. This shit is fucking awesome, one of the most aggressive, focused, driven and cool albums of its day. And it still holds up over 35 years later.\n\nPerhaps this review comes across as a bit haphazard and rushed. The reason for that is because I have written this review largely to sing my praises of one of the greatest rock and metal musicians of all time, Lemmy Kilmister. It is with a heavy heart that I found of his passing on the 28th December 2015. He had turned 70 just 4 days prior, and died due to an extremely aggressive cancer. His legacy is inimitable, being a catalyst for some of the finest music in the '80s that the world had ever heard. Entire subgenres at least partially owe their existence to this venerable founding father of the genre and his amazing work. Let us not dwell upon his passing, but celebrate the life and times of Lemmy! Blast your Mot\u00f6rhead albums as loud as possible, crack open the beers, and live fast people. Its what Lemmy would have wanted.\n\nR.I.P. Lemmy (24th December 1945 - 28th December 2015)\n",
        "\nGoing into Mot\u00f6rhead's 22nd studio effort 'Bad Magic', I was uncertain of what I'd be getting. Would I be getting an 'Inferno' reprint like the last 4 albums? Or would I be getting the Mot\u00f6rhead album to usher in a new era for the band? Well, the album happens to deliver more of the latter than the former; and let me tell you, this is a rock solid Mot\u00f6rhead album. More than anything, I was hoping that the album would be as good, if not greater, than Mot\u00f6rhead's previous album 'Aftershock'. Wishful thinking really, 'Aftershock' happened to be the band best album since 2002's 'Hammered'. So 'Bad Magic' didn't quite live up to my wildest hopes and dreams; and I wouldn't call this outing from the band great, but 'Bad Magic' is a good album none the less.\n\nI give 'Bad Magic' props for definitely deviating from the formula. I do not believe this to be the same Mot\u00f6rhead that we've seen on the last 5 albums; there is something else that drives this one. I found the band takes a more bluesy, laid back approach to the songwriting. That's not to say that the tight, blistering speed metal cuts don't crop up here and there (see: Victory or Die, Tell Me Who to Kill), it's just that more often than not I find the band dropping more mid-tempo/slower tracks throughout the album. The lyrics on the album I thought were fairly weak. Besides the choruses (which really save a lot of these tracks with mediocrity, seriously the choruses on this album are awesome), the lyrics seemed regurgitated from the band's back catalog with minor tweaks and changes. It's mostly the same nonsensical/war and death/bar brawls/pretty women/life on the road lines that spew from Lemmy. Luckily, the music is nowhere near stagnating. The old flame that's driven the band this far burns bright as always. Mikkey Dee's trashy drumming really reminded me of that late 70's Phil 'Philthy Animal' Taylor sound. Phil Campbell's new found bluesy-ness both helps and hurts a lot of the songs, and Lemmy's bass playing is pretty top-notch; I think that his bass is the best its sounded in awhile. I wasn't fond, however, of Lemmy's vocal performance.\n\nLemmy's voice practically hasn't changed since the band's 1977 self-titled debut. This album proves an exception. Lemmy's voice sounds aged, not hardened, on this album. His vocals honestly are what hold a lot of these tracks back from greatness. His voice sounds slurred a lot of the time, and he's harder than ever to understand. As far as the tracklisting goes, I'd say this album has a great deal more filler than their last album. 'Till the End', the album's ballad, is pretty god-awful. Mopey lyrics, tired songwriting, and an uninspired performance makes this one of the worst Mot\u00f6rhead songs I've heard in a long time. 'Choking On Your Screams' also did not impress me in the slightest. Lemmy sounds as hoarse as ever, and the song suffers from the same flaw nearly all Mot\u00f6rhead filler tracks suffer from. Weak songwriting, plain and simple. Mot\u00f6rhead is not a band that writes boring songs often, so whenever one (or a few) make it on to an album, it really sticks out. It's also interesting to note that the main riff from 'Electricity' is ripped straight from 'Smiling Like a Killer' on 'Inferno'. Regardless of whether or not this was intentional, I didn't enjoy it.\n\nMany of the tracks on 'Bad Magic' have the ability to be excellent concert staples though, I personally think that Mot\u00f6rhead will be playing the likes of 'Thunder & Lightning' and 'Shoot Out All of Your Lights' multiple times in concert. Also, I was surprised to find how many of these tracks grew on me as time went by. That's why I waited so long to write this review; my score for the album was constantly changing. Take 'Fire Storm Hotel' for example. Upon my first listen of this song, I simply passed it off as one of the weaker tracks on the album. Now, after quite a few listens to 'Bad Magic', it's one of my favorite cuts. The same is true (except to a lesser extent) for the cover of 'Sympathy For the Devil'. It's honestly a great end to this album. A bit unorthodox, but it works.\n\nOverall, this is a good Mot\u00f6rhead album. As I stated previously, I truly believe that this is the album to usher in a brand new era for Mot\u00f6rhead. It's a new sound for them that might take a little time to grow into, but in the end, it'll be more than worth it. This sound has a lot of promise and a lot of potential, and I'm excited to see what it'll evolve into. \n\nRecommended track: 'When the Sky Comes Looking For You'\n",
        "\nAt the time of this writing, Lemmy Kilmister has been going through a serious life-transition. His body is slowing down and performances are becoming laborious and shorter. It truly is heartbreaking to see this larger-than-life musical giant becoming so fragile right before our eyes. I suppose we forget that as we age, our heroes also grow older. That said, I find it nothing less than typical that Mot\u00f6rhead has issued yet another strong album in Bad Magic. At nearly 70-years of age, Lemmy still provides the fans with 110% heavy metal goodness.\n\nThe Mot\u00f6rhead of old is gone, of course, but this lineup of Mikkey Dee and Phil Campbell is the most solid and long-lasting of any of the previous incarnations, and if it ain't broke, don't touch it! The opening track, \"Victory or Die\" pretty much sets the tone for the record, offering a weighty alternative to some other recent offerings by aging bands that are, for all intents and purposes, laboring through mediocrity. That thick, recognizable sound of that Rickenbacker bass still thumps out of the speakers with all of the shyness of a bowling ball down a freshly-waxed lane. I would honestly never guess that this band was at AARP status because there is no sign of Mot\u00f6rhead slowing down the pace, despite the aforementioned ailments Lemmy is currently handling. Everything that makes for quality metal music is found here, with a crisp guitar sound, drums that fill the bottom end with subtle perfection, and the grimy and filthy vocals that are a staple of the Mot\u00f6rhead sound. \n\nThe magical formula that is Mot\u00f6rhead's existence is pretty much the blueprint for what basic, yet memorable metal music should be. The lyrics are, as always, pretty simple in that Lemmy doesn't offer up grand compositions to get his point across, and that is what makes a song like \"Electricity\" so damn perfect. The vocal melody follows a poetic pentameter that he has found comfort in for many years now, much to the delight of the fans who know exactly what each new Mot\u00f6rhead offering entails. The punk-laden opening of \"Evil Eye\" screams Black Flag-meets-Lemmy-in-a-scummy-alley all the way. It's amazing to see that the influence of this band still reaches back into the swirling cauldron of rock music and pulls forth a viable, fitting compliment in each track. The fantastic part is that Mr. Kilmister still sounds as gruffly evocative and familiar as he did some 40-years ago. The fact that his vocals will never win operatic awards is certainly not lost on me, but, as I said before, if it ain't broke....\n\nNow there are some who will argue that this all-too-familiar and simple style that Mot\u00f6rhead encompasses is a lack of ability to advance or unwillingness to change the sound for a more updated audience. Bad Magic follows one of the greatest rock bands to ever grace a stage into its suggested 'retirement home' phase and spits directly into the faces of the naysayers who think it's time for Lemmy to hang up the Ric for good. When I hear \"Till the End\" and feel that bluesy influence just fill my torso, I know exactly what Mot\u00f6rhead has left in the proverbial tank, and they aren't ready to call it a day just yet. So many ancient bands today, who I'll mercilessly leave nameless, refuse to recognize the magical qualities of subtle repetition and instead flood their catalogs with meaningless drivel they've since copied from the lesser imitators of the legends' own early sound. Mot\u00f6rhead follows no leader and pretty much never has, so what might appear as a lack of diversity in the tunes is actually, quite simply, Mot\u00f6rhead music. Even the cover of The Rolling Stones' \"Sympathy for the Devil\" is a cutting, bass-driven piece of rock 'n roll history that Mot\u00f6rhead makes their own for 5:35 out of your day. \n\nYou simply can't go wrong digesting Bad Magic, because everything that the band is worth is spelled out for you in yet another great addition to one hell of a long discography. I challenge you to find one solid clunker is that line if you can. By the time you're finished finding fault with maybe two or three songs from any given album, you'll have taken in this record at least twice and will no doubt be utterly amazed at the prowess that Lemmy and the boys still have after all this time.\n\nIt gives us all hope to see those stupid social media memes about Keith Richards and how he's defied death after a life of unabridged excesses and know he's got absolutely nothing on Lemmy.\n",
        "\nAs with any Motorhead album, this is full of rock 'n' roll swagger, down and dirty punk rocking riffs and Lemmy Kilmister's ragged, hoarse shouts. Titled Bad Magic, it's pretty much exactly what anybody expected. I thought their last one Aftershock was really great, one of their best post-2000s albums overall, with tons of really great, memorable songs. This one by comparison is more punky and raw, with a pinch more aggression to it \u2013 I get the idea Lemmy was very consciously trying to reinvigorate his old flame and make music like he did when he was young. Even though, really, he never exactly stopped. But here we have this album anyway. On tracks like venomous opener \u201cVictory or Die,\u201d the bluesy smash \u201cFire Storm Hotel\u201d (one of their best songs of the last few years) and the rugged speed metal \u201cShoot Out All Of Your Lights,\u201d the band is on point, sounding fiery and energetic \u2013 really fucking good songs.\n\nThe problem is just that it isn't really pushing things much. Not that I expected them to experiment, but some of the songs on here do tend to sound a bit in one ear, out the other. Songs like \u201cTell Me Who to Kill\u201d or \u201cThunder and Lightning\u201d don't see the band at its best, with stock riffs and melodies. They're still energetic and enjoyable while they're on, but you won't remember them when you think of the album. \u201cChoking On Your Screams\u201d is kind of a misfire with weird harsher vocals that don't work \u2013 certainly no \u201cOrgasmatron\u201d here. The latter half in general tends to run together a bit, as despite being entertaining, it feels like you've heard it all before. Some stronger choruses or riffs would have helped.\n\nFortunately they redeem themselves with \u201cTil the End,\u201d actually a touching and heartfelt ballad. Then \u201cWhen the Sky Comes Looking for You\u201d has a hook-barbed riff and some cool, biting lyrics \u2013 a killer track. The \u201cSympathy for the Devil\u201d cover is excellent too, with a great vocal performance that benefits from Lemmy's wearier, more tired sound on this album \u2013 it sounds creepier and more standoffish, which helps the mood set by the twanging, ominous guitars.\n\nSo overall this is a solid album, and if you like Motorhead you'll enjoy it thoroughly. I don't think it's anything too noteworthy, but it's a solid chapter in the band's latter-day history and it's too much fun to pass up. Bonus points for the lyric booklet, which is full of study hall styled doodles that are actually hilarious. Like, one of them shows a dude stranded on an island Cast Away style, and he has a thought bubble over his head reading \"I hope I didn't leave the oven on.\" Bands handle aging in different ways, and it's good to see Lemmy kicking back and still having such a good time. That carries over to the music, too.\n",
        "\nAfter an alarming health scare in 2013, many were left wondering if Lemmy Kilmister would continue to soldier on. Mot\u00f6rhead assured fans that everyone\u2019s beloved whiskey loving mainman was doing well, having traded bourbon for vodka while cutting back on the smokes a bit (Lemmy admitted that he\u2019s unlikely to stop altogether, as he\u2019s been smoking since he was eleven). Despite the health woes, Lemmy claimed that he\u2019s still indestructible and vows to continue performing until he can\u2019t physically get on stage anymore. To prove his point, Mot\u00f6rhead, in their fortieth year of existence, along with Lemmy at a mere sixty-nine years young, released their twenty-third album, 2015\u2032s Bad Magic.\n\nMuch like the rest of their career, Bad Magic could be described as business as usual. Lemmy\u2019s healthier lifestyle choices, if we can call them that, prove to have little effect on his performance, as he\u2019s still able to channel that whiskey-drenched, gruff delivery that only decades of living in sin could produce. Joined again by Phil Campbell on guitar and Mikkey Dee on drums, Mot\u00f6rhead continues with their twelfth album featuring this lineup. It\u2019s safe to say that Bad Magic sounds mighty similar to the band\u2019s last two decades of albums, but one of Mot\u00f6rhead\u2019s strongest points over the years has been their ability to sound fresh and virile despite their longevity.\n\nFalling in line with the band\u2019s previous outing, Aftermath, the tracks on Bad Magic bring a wide swath of sounds, from the fiery and destructive \u201cShoot Out All of Your Lights\u201d, with it steamrolling percussion, to the catchier, rollicking sounds of \u201cFire Storm Hotel\u201d, which focuses Lemmy\u2019s gruff tones and Phil\u2019s bluesy rock licks. \u201cTill the End\u201d is one of Mot\u00f6rhead\u2019s finest ballads in years as well, paying fine tribute to Lemmy\u2019s rough delivery while Phil brings a solid melody. Really, Bad Magic is an amalgamation of all of Mot\u00f6rhead\u2019s strongest points. The driving bass lines and ferocious riffs, not to mention Mikkey\u2019s thundering double kicks, sound like a band rejuvenated, without belying the band\u2019s four decades of experience. Let\u2019s not forget the bonus track, which is a cover of The Rolling Stones\u2019 \u201cSympathy for the Devil\u201d, which brings Mot\u00f6rhead\u2019s edge to the classic, while not straying far from the original.\n\nWhile there has yet to be an inherently bad album in Mot\u00f6rhead\u2019s catalog, Bad Magic shows the band at their strongest in quite some time. Perhaps Lemmy\u2019s health scare brought a renewed vigor and fueled a fire under their collective asses during song writing. Despite the reduction in smokes and booze, Mot\u00f6rhead\u2019s latest effort captures the band\u2019s essence with a blend of rollicking heavy metal, hard rock swagger and bar room attitude. Bad Magic shows that Mot\u00f6rhead is unstoppable and Lemmy is, indeed, indestructible.\n\nWritten for The Metal Observer.\n",
        "\nBefore getting this album, I wasn't very big into live albums. I mean, ok, you simply hear the band playing the same songs you already heard before but this time, the songs are played during a live performance instead of in a studio. But man, I'm so happy to be proven completely wrong by the God almighty Lemmy himself.\n\nMot\u00f6rhead's legendary live album No Sleep 'Till Hammersmith features all of Mot\u00f6rhead's hit songs up till 1981. It therefore includes such classics as Ace of Spades, Overkill, Bomber and No Class among others. And when compared to the studio versions of these songs, these live versions are simply a ton better. For example, compare Ace of Spades' opening riff from this album with the original studio version and hear how much more powerful the former sounds. The same goes for everything else on this album and I really mean everything. The drums, guitars, Lemmy's vocals, the performance's overall speed and intensity, it's all jacked up on steroids for this release. Faster, heavier, louder, absolute passion and strength! Just like Mot\u00f6rhead should be!\n\nPersonal favorite track is this album's version of Overkill (my personal favorite Mot\u00f6rhead song, by the way). It's the perfect proof that Mot\u00f6rhead truly shine when they play on stage. The drums sound heavier, the guitars sound more crisp and Lemmy's voice is full of power and aggression. Another top track for me is We Are The Road Crew, just another awesome track that you cannot help but sing along to and once again, this album's version easily outrocks its studio counterpart!\n\nThere's actually nothing negative for me to say about this album at all. I've already listened to the entire album quite a few times but I cannot find anything bad to comment about. The album is just a true roller coaster ride from beginning to end! But ok, you could say that after listening to the album, I really wished that I could travel back in time and experience the show live! Oh well, nothing that imagination and a glass of bourbon can't fix!\n\nThis album features Mot\u00f6rhead's classic lineup of Lemmy, Eddie and Filthy Phil in their absolute prime! I would even daresay that you should get this masterpiece before buying any other Mot\u00f6rhead album. So go buy this album, get a bottle of Jack Daniel's and prepare yourself for an unforgettable ride!\n",
        "\n\u201c\u2026what will the wind bring these days?\u201d\n\nWhat Tom Fischer didn\u2019t know when he let that lyric sail is that in this instance the wind brings an ideal case-in-point for the old \u2018which one doesn\u2019t belong\u2019 game, for this 7\u201d falls easily into contention for that trophy. You\u2019re gonna run into a slap if I have to explain further. \n\nBeyond that obviousness, this is a curious little four-track sampler that's made more curious as it exhumes a few rarer-than-standard picks that newer archaeologist labels like Old Metal or Sentinel Steel wouldn't have to excavate to serve to us on silver trays, and that, my friends, is due to unassuming little outlets such as this. The problem is, however, that the disc\u2019s sleeve doesn\u2019t seem to have a clue what\u2019s bubbling inside it, nor who it\u2019s poised to impress. Yep, with its warm ocean-blue, decade-familiar, yet metal-unfamiliar pop \u201880s \u2018hey you, put down Rod Stewart and l00k at my big 1, dammit!\u2019 cover, it implies to...um...someone this 7\" has the #1 metal goods you\u2019re searching low and high for. Well, around 60% of the civilized world population was under the impression that Def Leppard\u2019s Hysteria was the latest heavy metal champion at the time, and since this disc is tattooed with underground and rather ignoble band names, it\u2019s only natural Sounds Waves was gonna be a hard sell to such an audience. Looking for a alternate horizon or perhaps a bigger picture, the disc squints at the .001% - the bedraggled few who are aware of and actually give a swig about underground metal \u2013 and naturally doesn\u2019t see a parking lot full of anywhere near semi-expensive rides being exited by adults with anywhere near semi-bulging wallets. So...who\u2019s gonna buy this thing? \n\nThen what makes this yet all the more a curious curio actually forms the solution to the last haunting question - as a promo release it\u2019ll be issued free with Sounds magazine, which even then was a long-running, well-respected rock rag that led early cheers for metal when NWOBHM was an acronym that meant very little to just about everybody. Gone are most complaints of wasted money, and the publicity\u2026ah, you can figure out the rest. \n\nSince \u201cVisual Aggression\u201d was already a warrior made fierce on Frost\u2019s 1985 The Emperor\u2019s Return ep, there was a minor chance it was already speed-racing recklessly somewhere in your collection, and if it wasn\u2019t\u2026well, then it should've been. Much obliged. Meanwhile, more hidden from view was Kreator\u2019s \u201cAfter the Attack\u201d, a song armed for slaughter along with the rest of Pleasure to Kill's dreadnoughts, yet was only to be found on that release\u2019s picture disc version, making this arguably the scarcest thing finding shelter here. \n\nI say arguably about \"After the Attack\" because, really, how often were/are The Stupids ever on the tips of anyone\u2019s tongues? I mean, even in the poorly dug ditch of underground metal, The Stupids were a hardcore band far underfoot and covered in indiscernible mud if they were in the ditch at all, and even today I never hear a syllable uttered about these guys. So basically if \u201cLive to Rock\u201d, actually an almost halfway decent h.c. specimen, wasn\u2019t the unicorn of the disc in 1988, it probably is now. \n\nThen there\u2019s\u2026yawn...ever-present Motorhead traipsing through \u201cKilled by Death\u201d, to me one of their stolidly standard and ultimately slow lane snoozers that could never spark even a moment\u2019s interest in me, and the so-called dazzle that comes from it being live from The Birthday Party at the Hammersmith Odeon video/album is only a big fizzle to someone who could care less about most live albums. Enter the last reason I throw a smile at this thing (yes, The Stupids beat out Motorhead. I\u2019ve lived with this truth for a few decades and still hold my head high. Now you can, too).\n\nShould be slightly more collectible than it is. \n\n\u201c\u2026everywhere starts the search for water and groceries\u2026\u201d\n",
        "\nIt may come as a surprise to most who aren't familiar with their full catalogue, but Mot\u00f6rhead are a band who have never really made a bad album. The first seven of their LPs (excluding No Parole which is essentially an inferior alternate version to their self-titled d\u00e9but) are all stone cold classics featuring the best of their material, and although their has been a few troughs since then like Snake Bite Love/We Are Mot\u00f6rhead at the tail end of the 90's there has been absolute killer cuts after their glory period too such as 1916 and even as recent as 2008's Mot\u00f6rizer. As a follow up to The W\u00f6rld Is Yours in 2010 this is at least an equal achievement, a solid effort to show that Mot\u00f6rhead are timeless and will always still have it. And with the band skirting the edge of destruction more than ever before a reassuring cut like this is exactly what fans need.\n\nA track by track breakdown of a Mot\u00f6rhead record is always going to be a bit of a pointless exercise as everyone will know their 21 times tried and tested formula, and I'm happy to report that it is still as effective as always. \u201cKeep Your Powder Dry\u201d wonders off true course slightly with a lead riff that sounds more like something from an AC/DC song but Lemmy's unmistakable chord-driven bass style keeps it in Mot\u00f6rhead's yard. Likewise when things get bluesy on the Steve Miller Band-style Hammond organ-accompanied \u201cCrying Shame\u201d and the stripped down John Lee Hooker/Lightnin' Hopkins-esque Folk Blues feel of \u201cLost Woman Blues\u201d and \u201cDust and Glass\u201d it always has Lemmy's trademark stamped firmly across it.\n\nWhen it comes to the more straight-up rockers there is not many tracks here I would like to hear replace some classics in a live set, but \u201cQueen Of The Damned\u201d is definitely one of them. Most of the songs on here clock in at under 3 minutes and that is more than enough time for a chord-driven bassline to open it up, a cracker main riff, bluesy licks, throaty vocals, short but sweet solo and lyrics about a dangerous woman. What more could you want from a Mot\u00f6rhead song?\n\nNothing else on here quite matches this tune, but a few stand out thanks to Lemmy's still timeless lyrical ability, in particular closing track \u201cParalyzed\u201d which boasts probably the band's best opening lyric since \u201cKilled By Death\u201d when Lemmy croons; \u201cRunning through the jungle/looking for a light/running like a bastard baby/in the jungle night\u201d Young whippersnappers like Speedwolf could take a tip from \u201cDo You Believe?\u201d when it comes to righting great Rock n Roll lyrics but there is a worldweariness in some of the lyrics here that can only come from the seeing the things an ageing rocker has and can never be faked by youth. \u201cCoup De Grace\u201d is one such cut but when the man himself \u201cdances with the devil\u201d at \u201cThe End Of Time\u201d it is the perfect song for describing where he is in life right now. \n\nMot\u00f6rhead have definitely had their reputation slightly tarnished in recent years by some borderline Gene Simmons-like poor choices for merchandising ( Mot\u00f6rhead wine anyone?), being unable to control the pricing and content of endless compilations and boxsets fired off their label's production line and more recently Lemmy's ill health affecting live performances. As I said before, Mot\u00f6rheadbangers are in need of a little reassurance and I think this album fits that bill well. They have always been a band who have behaved like every day could be their last as a band, and while this is an emotionally tough time to be a fan of theirs as that possibility edges ever closer it is almost comforting to now that if Mot\u00f6rhead were no more as of tomorrow then this would be a fitting epitaph to an unparalleled career.

        "\nThere\u2019s no point in describing Mot\u04e7rhead\u2019s sound at this point. I\u2019ll give you guys a hint: on their 22nd album in a near-40 year career, they didn\u2019t start playing mellow progged-out jazz music. Aftershock sees the boys in fine form with a collection of looser, faster and more energetic tunes than you\u2019ve seen on many of their other recent releases. I was one of those who thought The World Is Yours was a weak album, and it was one of the Mot\u04e7rhead albums I played the least. I didn\u2019t expect this one to knock my block off so thoroughly, but there you go.\n\nThe band just sounds hungry and energized as hell on this album. You get a lot more dynamic on here than the stodgy sound of the last few, and also a lot rawer, more punky performances and songwriting ethic going on \u2013 there are fewer spots where they slow down to a midpaced stomp. Now, as much as I enjoyed those tunes from albums like Inferno, I always liked Mot\u04e7rhead better when they were just playing fast and furious. On ball-busters like \u201cEnd of Time\u201d with its down and dirty punk style, and \u201cDeath Machine\u201d with its gritty, teeth-gnashing stomping like a horde of wild boars, the band sounds virile and pissed off as hell. Opener \u201cHeartbreaker\u201d and its immediate sequel \u201cCoup de Grace\u201d are both fine Mot\u04e7rhead tunes that show the band still kicking ass and able to get way more pussy than most bands starting out now. And \u201cDo You Believe\u201d is just a killer tune, with Lemmy howling away about the glories of a rock \u2018n\u2019 roll lifestyle like he hadn\u2019t already done it for 30 years before this. But it\u2019s so good here that I\u2019m giving it a pass.\n\nNot to say that there\u2019s no variety here. \u201cLost Woman Blues\u201d is a contender for best song here with its slow, bluesy (shockingly enough\u2026) build up and then its raunchy, rocking finish \u2013 Lemmy shows off his sensitive side, too. \u201cDust & Glass\u201d is a weird little psychedelic-style ballad that sort of just serves as a breather between the heavy stompers, but it\u2019s good. \u201cCrying Shame\u201d is the band\u2019s usual 50s-style rock \u2018n\u2019 roll ditty with the swingin\u2019 pianos behind the groovy metal riffs, and it rocks \u2013 how much charisma can a 67 year old man possibly have? Look no further than Lemmy right here. Bad fucking ass. The best tune has to be \u201cSilence When You Speak to Me,\u201d though \u2013 an absolutely crushing song with a bass line that will turn your skeleton to dust by the time it\u2019s over. Just an absolute winner of a song.\n\nThe album gets a bit weaker as it goes on, with shorter songs like \u201cQueen of the Damned\u201d and \u201cParalyzed\u201d not quite living up to the standard of the first half of the album. But on a 14-song album with so many highlights, and from a band this old, I\u2019m inclined not to care about a little filler too much. I mean, even the filler is still pretty damned good in its own right. And seriously, 22 albums in and Mot\u04e7rhead sounds like this. That\u2019s just amazing. If they were just going through the motions, that would be one thing, but they\u2019ve got a fire under their collective asses and their material here is as strong as it has been at any point since the early 90s, at least. This is a winner of an album, and I\u2019ve had a lot of fun listening to it this year. Definitely going on the Best of the Year list for \u201913. Get it now and let Lemmy show you the light and the way.\n",
        "\nEvery Motorhead review ever written starts with some statement about the band\u2019s apparent invincibility and unwavering persistence, but their infallible reputation has been slightly shaken over the last year. Iconic vocalist/bassist Lemmy Kilmister\u2019s recent health troubles have caused some alterations to their touring schedule, leading some to question the band\u2019s future as a fully functional unit. Fortunately, Motorhead\u2019s twenty-first studio album adheres to their longstanding status quo while reviving a few tricks that haven\u2019t been seen in some time.\n\nEven with health scares to consider, it\u2019s safe to say the band dynamic hasn\u2019t changed a bit. Lemmy\u2019s vocals retain their slurred but commanding croaks, his ferocious bass playing often leads to guitarist Phil Campbell playing a lot of catch up, and Mikkey Dee\u2019s drumming is as rapid fire as ever. The clear production and chorus-oriented songwriting also make it quite similar to the efforts that have been put out since 2004\u2019s Inferno.\n\nBut with there being fourteen tracks on here, more than any other Motorhead album, it does end up being one of their more diverse releases. In fact, it has a fair amount in common with 1977\u2019s Overkill. In addition to many tracks having a less than three minute run time and a fast punk execution, \u201cLost Woman Blues\u201d plays like a mellower version of \u201cLimb From Limb\u201d and the melancholic \u201cDust And Glass\u201d has a psychedelic tone that recalls \u201cMetropolis\u201d or \u201cCapricorn.\u201d There\u2019s no track as massive as \u201cOverkill,\u201d but \u201cEnd Of Time\u201d does come close to matching its intensity.\n\nOf course, having fourteen tracks also means that there are some bits of filler to be found. Even the most casual fan can tell you that there is no such thing as a bad Motorhead song but a number of tracks do run together, especially towards the album\u2019s end. The highlights make up for them as always but even those seem like they needed more development or more dynamic song structures.\n\nOverall, Aftershock has a few tweaks that make it more unique than its most recent predecessors but is about even with them in terms of quality. It doesn\u2019t have the fire to challenge the likes of Inferno but it secures the band\u2019s standing in a more uncertain time. I\u2019m still holding out for a bluesier direction, but the classic aspirations may be enough to recommend it to established fans.\n\nCurrent Highlights:\n\u201cHeartbreaker\u201d\n\u201cLost Woman Blues\u201d\n\u201cEnd Of Time\u201d\n\u201cDo You Believe\u201d\n\u201cSilence When You Speak To Me\u201d\n\nOriginally published at http://psychicshorts.blogspot.com\n",
        "\nIt\u2019d be easy to take Motorhead for granted, or even to (foolishly) write them off. A recent health scare for main-man Lemmy may have looked like it was going to slow the band down, but thankfully that doesn\u2019t seem to be the case. After almost 40 years now as a band, Motorhead are still touring and releasing music.\n\nLet\u2019s put this in to context for a moment. This is an age in music where there seems to be a great appetite for reunions and bands performing \u201cclassic\u201d albums, where reasonably successful musicians of all genres attempt to coast by on past glories. Yet here are Motorhead, arguably the epitome of rock\u2019n'roll, who have penned more classic songs than anyone has a right to, releasing their 21st album a few months after their iconic front-man was hospitalised. Sure, they may play Ace Of Spades and Overkill at every single show, but there\u2019s nothing wrong with giving the fans what they want and playing the classics rather than relying on them. At 67, no one would blame Lemmy for taking it easy and living off of past glories; but that\u2019s not the kind of person he is; and for that we should all be thankful.\n\nMusically, there\u2019s no real surprises here for anyone who\u2019s familiar with Motorhead beyond playing Ace Of Spades on Rock Band; but what might be surprising is just how good the album is. There\u2019s plenty of high-tempo rockers, as well as some slower ones, and they\u2019re as strong as almost anything else the band have recorded. The unmistakable blend of hard rock and heavy metal that forms the basis of the Motorhead sound is present and accounted for, with several tracks reminiscent of their back catalogue. The furious double-bass drum work on End Of Time propels the song along in the same way that Overkill charged ahead, whilst Queen Of The Damned\u2019s bass opening isn\u2019t a million miles away from the first moments of Ace Of Spades. It all still manages to sound modern though, aided by an excellent production job from Cameron Webb, who has also produced the past few Motorhead albums.\n\nThat\u2019s not to say that the band is relying on past glories. More that, after so long, the band have their sound well-defined (hell, it was well-defined years ago) and know how to make it work. They\u2019re not going to go all prog on us. Modern trends will pass them by unnoticed. Motorhead will do what Motorhead do, and that\u2019s to sound like Motorhead; and that\u2019s something they do so very well.\n\nBut as anyone familiar with the band will know, that doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re a one-trick pony. They\u2019re perfectly capable of writing something a bit different from time to time. Lost Woman Blues makes that clear early on, and it sounds like what you\u2019d expect from the title. It\u2019s slow, heavy blues, drenched in the atmosphere of rainy nights and dimly-lit bars as Lemmy laments the loss of a woman. The later half speeds things up, but it\u2019s the first half that makes it a truly special song. Dust And Glass at the half-way mark further demonstrates that the band aren\u2019t even close to running out of ideas. It initially sounding like another blues track, but there\u2019s something more to it than that. Lemmy\u2019s singing is as clean as it gets, and the verses have an almost regretful atmosphere not associated with the band. It\u2019s a very successful change, and the faster tracks that follow it benefit from the change of pace it presents.\n\nEven after the initial rush of the album has worn off, it still holds up well. It\u2019d probably be an over-statement to describe it as the band\u2019s best album (though frankly, arguing which one of their 21, mostly excellent albums is best is a pointless exercise), but it\u2019s certainly a very strong record that holds up to repeated listens, and is worthy of note not just for the simple fact that it exists. There\u2019s plenty here to get excited about, and I can\u2019t imagine anyone who likes Motorhead being disappointed by this record.\n\nOriginally published at http://thesoundnottheword.wordpress.com/\n",
        "\nThis album lacks in variety. This album may lack in depth, but 'Ace of Spades' is just a relentless heavy metal machine. It's all about riding motorcycles, drinking alcohol, and laughing in the devil's face while dying. It's dirty, it's hard, and it's fast. It is simply rock 'n' roll. Songs like the almighty 'Ace of Spades' itself, the rocky 'Shoot You in the Back', and the groovy '(We Are) The Road Crew' are flawless pieces of manhood, motor oil, and blood transformed into music. It would be ridiculous if it wasn't Lemmy, the incarnate rock star, who is so clich\u00e9 that he is actually epic.\n\nIndeed, not every song is a killer. In fact, there are many fillers, such as 'Fire Fire', 'Dance', and so on. Fortunately, Mot\u00f6rhead don't write long enduring epics, but short songs, so you won't get bored. Also, 'Ace of Spades' may be too consistent. There is always a first verse, a rocky refrain, a second verse, a small solo, and so on. I'm not of the kind that would deny the little piece of rust on the mot\u00f6r of the 'Ace of Spades'. However, the many highlights of this album compensate its short fillers. \n\nDon't expect the best album by Mot\u00f6rhead and you'll get catchy rock 'n' roll with classic guitars, equally awesome and unusual E-bass, and Lemmy's far beyond technically-perfect, but fully fitting voice. Just imagine a showdown between two members of a biker gang in the desert of Mexico (that's how I'd understand the cover photo). That's how the album sounds. They're not even trying to appear as a sophisticated project of professors of music. They're Mot\u00f6rhead and they play rock 'n' roll.\n",
        "\nThe godfathers of rock \u2018n\u2019 roll are back and they need no introduction whatsoever. The W\u00f6rld Is Yours is the twentieth Mot\u00f6rhead album and it holds no surprises, for better or for worse.\n\nRegardless of some mixed feelings of mine regarding the recycling of an old song title, Born To Lose is a perfect opening track which sounds just as a great Mot\u00f6rhead song should. Speaking of sound, the production follows in the footsteps of the last few albums, which strikes me both as something positive and as something negative. Some of the songs kind of seem to melt together to me, such as I Know How To Die, Get Back In Line, Devils In My Head and Waiting For The Snake. It\u2019s not that they are bad but they strike me as half-hearted reruns of songs we\u2019ve heard many times before. \n\nOne song that breaks the pattern, which I appreciate, is Rock \u2018n\u2019 Roll Music. It stands out with a more boogie-like feeling than the preceding songs. Some of the lyrics may be a little cheesy (\u201cRock \u2018n\u2019 roll music is the true religion\u201d) but that\u2019s forgivable as it\u2019s a pretty enjoyable song.\n\nBrotherhood Of Man is another song that takes a different approach. It\u2019s a sort of slow, heavy song reminding me somewhat of Wake The Dead from We Are Mot\u00f6rhead. I love what Lemmy\u2019s doing with his voice here \u2013 that threatening and somewhat scary tone \u2013 and this is actually my favourite on the entire album. The following song, Outlaw, is another great track \u2013 a classical, fast Mot\u00f6rhead song with a really strong chorus. It almost takes me back to the feeling of the monumental Inferno.\n\nHowever, the last two tracks \u2013 I Know What You Need and Bye Bye Bitch Bye Bye \u2013 don\u2019t really do anything for me. There are some qualities there, of course, but I had hoped for a stronger finish and all in all I\u2019m left feeling kind of disappointed when the 39 minutes have passed.\n\nCriticizing a Mot\u00f6rhead album is hard. The W\u00f6rld Is Yours is of course exactly what we expect it to be: another Mot\u00f6rhead album. If you love Mot\u00f6rhead (And why shouldn\u2019t you?), check it out. It isn\u2019t that I dislike the album; there are a few great songs but as a whole I\u2019m just not that impressed. If I were to feel an urge for \u201cmodern\u201d Mot\u00f6rhead, I can\u2019t say that I would ever choose The W\u00f6rld Is Yours over Inferno or Kiss Of Death.\n\n\nOriginally written for www.metalcovenant.com\n",
        "\nFebruary 11th is a special day for me. There's no concrete date to when I began this whole reviewing shtick that I've been trying so desperately to make my internetical legacy. But for my money, I consider it to be today, February 11th. That was when I posted my (frankly terrible) review for Gojira's ode to Lunesta, From Mars to Sirius, and the reason I consider this to be my anniversary is because that was the first one I wrote as less of just a time waster and more because I just really, really enjoyed writing about music. And so, with this in mind, I'd like to celebrate my five year anniversary (!!) as a reviewer with a bit of trivia: Motorhead is where \"BastardHead\" comes from. Legend has it that when starting this new rock n' roll band after leaving Hawkwind, Lemmy had decided to name his band Bastard to reflect the kind of attitude he exudes so naturally. His manager convinced him otherwise, saying \"You'll never make it on Top of the Pops with a name like bloody Bastard\", presumably immediately after his monocle popped out. Lemmy, for the first and only time in his life, relented and changed it to the name we all know and love right now.\n\nSo obviously, Motorhead is a pretty special band to me. I didn't grow up with them like other sentimental bands (Metallica, Guns n' Roses, Pantera, et cetera), but really getting into Motorhead truly does open a lot of doors for metal fans. Lemmy, being the bottomless quote machine that he is, has always said that the band was never meant to be a metal band, they're a rock n' roll band first and foremost. Most metal fans tend to disagree, but I actually tend to side with the creator here. There's obviously a lot of heavy metal at play here (especially on this album, \"Burner\" is a fucking speed metal monster), but listening to the guitar work, the attitude, and the overall feel of pretty much any Motorhead album ever released (barring maybe Inferno) just makes it clear that the band has always been more about rock 'n roll sleaze than heavy metal thunder.\n\nAnd that's one of the reasons Bastards is such a brilliant record in my eyes, it's both the most overtly rock n' roll album since Bomber, and it's also without a doubt the heaviest album they'd released up to that point in time. The two best songs exemplify the two extreme ends of their spectrum, with \"Burner\" being a high octane, double bass filled, speed metal aggressor, while \"Born to Raise Hell\" is the quintessential rock n' roll party anthem. The rest of the album runs the gamut set by those two extremes, with only one exception, which I'll get to later. I won't lie and say nothing feels like filler, because \"Devils\" and \"Lost in the Ozone\" tend to go in one ear and out the other during most runs through the album. But everything else stands as one of the most obviously varied experiences the band has ever provided listeners with. The common attack against Motorhead is that all of their songs sound the same, which is demonstrably bullshit. Chances are that if you abide by that belief, you simply haven't bothered listening further than \"Ace of Spades\", \"Iron Fist\", and maybe \"Killed by Death\". Now, all of those songs rule, but to say those sound identical to \"Born to Raise Hell\" or \"Liar\" or \"On Your Feet or on Your Knees\" might as well be the equivalent of a bright green sandwich sign that says I DON'T KNOW SHIT ABOUT SHIT AND PROBABLY LISTEN TO ARCADE FIRE. \n\nAnyway, the point is that Bastards starts off on one of the strongest feet that any Motorhead album ever has. Eight excellent tracks in a row, from \"On Your Feet or on Your Knees\" through \"Liar\", the album just charges forth at full speed before playing around with some more typical rock n' roll, the most shockingly dark Motorballad of all time, and even a sort of extraordinarily heavy quasi-blues track. As much as I love this band, I really can't think of any other albums they've released that start off this strongly and stay this consistently good for as long as this does. No album of theirs is perfect, but it takes a whopping nine tracks before this one stumbles in even the slightest, and that is definitely a commendable feat, especially considering how many of these songs are wildly different from one another. \"Death or Glory\" is almost a straight up punk song to start, with minute set aside for a marching beat in the middle, \"Liar\" is preposterously groovy and almost feels like the song Satan would sing to blues musicians at the Crossroads, and \"Bad Woman\" is essentially a 1950s piano rock song ala Little Richard, except performed by four raucous party animals who reek of Jack Daniels and hand rolled cigarettes. Bastards is basically just an amalgam of every influence the band has ever had (which to be fair, most of their albums are basically this, but this is one of the most blatant examples), and when most bands try to do a little bit of everything, they end up bland across the board. But nope, turns out Motorhead is just fucking great at everything so pretty much every idea sticks. \n\nDespite this being the heaviest album the band had put out at the time, it somehow manages to contain two ballads, one kinda power ballad \"Lost in the Ozone\", which ranks as the only track I out-and-out don't like, and then there's the almost entirely acoustic \"Don't Let Daddy Kiss Me\", which I'm... pretty conflicted about. On one hand, it's an incredibly daring song, dealing with a horrifying subject matter that most bands tend to shy away from, and then nails the emotional impact by telling it from the perspective of the little girl, painting the scene in a very depressing, bleak, and most troubling of all, realistic light. The verse about how if she tells anybody about what is happening, she'll lose her family and her home is just brutal. This song is crushing on the most emotional level possible, and there's no happy ending to the story either. There's no ending at all. Dad molests/rapes his daughter nightly, he feels nothing, she's praying for death because she has nobody to turn to because even God hasn't saved her. The end! No moral! But on the other hand, as much as I admire such a brave and horrifying song from an otherwise irreverent group of wildmen, it's... well by a band of wildmen, right in the middle of a wild album about wild parties. Following up such a heavy subject with \"I KNOW YOU'RE A BAAAAD BAD WOMAN\" just feels... wrong. Maybe it's just personal preference here, but the rest of the album just feels somewhat uncomfortable after that harrowing dirge. I don't know about you, but if I just discovered somebody was sexually abusing his small daughter, I wouldn't be able to so seamlessly shift back to partying. But then again Lemmy is no ordinary man, so I guess such a hard left turn into Depressionville didn't seem out of place to him. HERE I COME BABY WOOP DEE DOO!\n\nApart from the album's iHawk style \"irreverent - maudlin\" switch, and one or two songs that are ultimately pointless in the grand scheme of things, Bastards stands as potentially my favorite Motorhead album. This one just does nearly everything it sets out to do just right, everything hits bullseye. I'd honestly recommend this as a starting point over more seminal albums like Ace of Spades or Overkill or Another Perfect Day, because this one gives the best taste of everything Motorhead is capable of, and can help act as a guide for where to go next. What was your favorite song here? \"Burner\"? Go to Inferno. \"Bad Woman\"? Go to 1916. Et cetera and so forth. For reasons I can't quite fathom (perhaps because 1992 is the last year that fans of 80s metal care about and this was released in late 1993?), Bastards seems to have ended up as one of the forgotten albums in the grand scope of the band's career, which is bizarre since it has the significance of being Mikkey Dee's first album and Wurzel's last, essentially being the last step before solidifying the power trio lineup that has persisted for the last 20 years, but hey, I guess they can't all be winners. Bottom line is that Motorhead is awesome and Bastards is a brilliantly fun album, oozing with attitude and sleaze, and really what more could you ask for from this band? Straight up, unadulterated rock n' roll with a punk and metal edge, just the way it should be.\n\n\nOriginally written (WITH ADDED VISUAL AID) for http://lairofthebastard.blogspot.com/\n",
        "\nAfter releasing the mighty \"Ace Of Spades\" and having won critical praise with their live album, how on Earth could Mot\u00f6rhead top themselves? Easy! By releasing a relentless, no holds barred album in the shape of \"Iron Fist\". Released in 1982, \"Iron Fist\" sees Mot\u00f6rhead fully grasping their place in the hard rock/heavy metal world. \n\nBy this time, hardcore punk and the very first seeds of thrash were already evident in the British music scene. Bands like GBH, The Exploited and Discharge weren't afraid to show their loyalty to Mot\u00f6rhead and Venom wanted to be just like them with a Satanic angle. It's no coincidence that \"Iron Fist\" was the band's most intense, brutal and fastest album to date. \n\nThe production (done by Fast Eddie) was intense and gave a better balance to all the instruments. The sound is considerably more modern than on \"Ace Of Spades\" and by the same token, slightly cleaner. The title track is truly intense and other songs such as \"Sex And Outrage\", \"Heart Of Stone\" and \"Speedfreak\" could easily pass by as hardcore punk tunes due to the sheer brutality and speed. Slower songs such as \"Don't Need Religion\", \"Loser\" and \"America\" are just as intense. \n\nI still have trouble reading reviews that say this album's a \"let down\". Let down in what way? This was the last album done by the \"classic\" line-up of Fast Eddie, Phil Taylor and Lemmy. Their next album, \"Another Perfect Day\", although quite good, was a much more tamer affair than this. It's true that \"Ace Of Spades\" gets all the accolades and recognition but very close to it I'd put \"Iron Fist\".\n\nIf you want pure, undiluted Mot\u00f6rhead in their primest of primes, do yourselves a favor and buy this classic album!\n",
        "\nKnowingly or not, everyone has listened to Motorhead. If you've watched TV in the last couple of years, you saw a slow version of 'Ace of Spades' being played for Kronenburg 1664 (although Jack Daniels would have been more keeping with the spirit of the band). If you sat down to frown at Shoot 'em Up, you heard 'Ace of Spades'. \n\n'Ace of Spades' is not on this album, so you won't see it in this review again. What you will see is more Motorhead worship, the return of the power trio and the start of the current line-up. If you are unfamiliar with the history of Motorhead, well, that's what Google's for. This is a review by a raving fan, not a history lesson. \n\nSo. Bass. Specifically, Lemmy's bass. It is beefy. It is responsible for making this album so heavy, even though not all the material was written that way. It sits in the mix under the guitar, dominating the low frequencies. And it sounds good. It is always felt no matter what else is occuring in the mix, brass-knuckling your guts with the kick drum, beating on you whilst you fall to the floor, especially on an aggressive track like 'Civil War'. The bass doesn't sound sterile, but packs an organic fuzz that becomes apparent on 'Broken' and the title track. In terms of bass lines, Lemmy fills the bottom of the mix with what would probably be the second guitar part, if such a player existed. On 'Crazy Like a Fox' under the harmonica solo, there is a nifty bass line on the higher frets that duels the harmonica, and the bass has other small solos throughout the album which raving fans appreciate and probably pray for (if you're gonna pray, why not do it someone who can get back to you on it?) \n\nMikkey Dee is alive and winning on this album. He makes 4/4 rock beats that have been around since rock n roll started sound badass. There probably isn't anything on his kit that isn't utilised on the album, with marching kick-snare beats and double-bass assaults broken up with tom fills that spice every song up. The drum sound is immense. The kit is miked up near perfect and everything sounds balanced, sitting perfectly in the mix, not overpowering anything whilst still beating you up for your beer.\n\nHowever, this album showcases one element in particular. Phil Campbell's guitar sounds perfect. It rivals Slash's tone on 'Appetite for Destruction' as one of the best guitar tones in rock n roll. It is clean, warm and powerful. When it needs to be heavy, it is. When the tempo starts to inflict neck injuries to listeners, the guitar doesn't disintegrate into a muddy mess. When fretboard gymnastics occur, the guitar is alive. But what about the riffs, you ask? The solos? Well, what do you think? They're great. It's debatable whether Phil Campbell enjoyed the pressure of having to come up with all the guitar parts, but they are brilliant. Riffs like 'Love Can't Buy You Money' and 'Shake the World' belong in the catalogue of classic Motorhead riffs. Faster tracks have meaty thrashy riffs that attack the listener; elsewhere, chord slams invade the sonic space and leave lasting bruises in visible parts of the body (tip: don't headbang in tight spaces). On solos, there is a mixture of bluesy shredding with a soaking of wah and uplifting lead sections in which every note is beautiful i.e. the end solo in the title track. \n\nLemmy's voice on this album is soulful yet aggressive, gruff but genuine, like on every other album. And what the hell were you expecting? The lyrics are well-written as always with social commentary appearing occasionally but without being preachy, with sarcasm and humour also getting involved. There is only one song that has 'serious' lyrics, namely 'I Don't Believe a Word', with its melancholy delivery for which Lemmy doesn't sound like Lemmy for the verses. \n\nAll in all, this is a brilliant album. The production is near perfect, the instruments are amazing, and it has two of my favourite songs of all time, and 'Broken' has the poignant line \"Must we be expendable, is that what we are for?\" So, buy the album. It won't let you regret it. \n\nI couldn't really think of a good closing statement so you'll get this instead. In case you were wondering why this album isn't rated 100% when it is clear that is what it should deserve. It's simple. \n\nI have to be objective somehow.\n",
        "\nIt is always hard to write a unique-sounding Motorhead review, especially if it's for one of their more recent albums. The band has undergone some evolution over the years, but every review seems to revolve around the idea that nothing in the band ever changes. However, this particular album is made unique by its form of distribution more than anything else. While it received standard distribution in most of the world, it got an exclusive release in the UK through Classic Rock magazine.\n\nFor the most part, this album's sound plays out like an extended version of 2008's Motorizer. Like that album, this release has a particularly gritty production job. But at the same time, it also shows the band moving away from the blues influence that was prominent on previous tracks. But like every other Motorhead album, what really makes this effort enjoyable is the band's energy. Despite the members' advancing ages, they are more intense than just about every other band out there and breathe a lot of life into what could have been otherwise typical songs.\n\nAs expected by the band's energy, a majority of the songs on here range from fast-paced borderline thrashers to upbeat rockers. The closing track, Bye Bye Bitch Bye Bye, might be the strongest track on here and hearkens back to 2004's Inferno in terms of speed. Of course, there are some mid-tempo tracks on here that attempt to show variety. Opener Born to Lose (Not to be confused with an earlier song with a similar title) is a grinder with a riff not unlike Shoot You In The Back, Rock 'N Roll Music plays out like a modern version of Born to Raise Hell, and Brotherhood of Man could be seen as the latest update of the immortal Orgasmatron.\n\nOverall, this is another good Motorhead album that I would put on the same level as Motorizer in terms of the band's recent releases. They might never write anything as intense as Inferno ever again, but they can keep writing energetic anthems like this for all I care! But I suppose things could be interesting if the band went for a slower direction in the future. It's been hinted at before and managed to sound promising on the band's recent Ace of Spades re-recording. In the worst case scenario, the new movie about Lemmy should be worth watching.\n\nCurrent Highlights:\nBorn to Lose, Waiting For The Snake, Rock 'N Roll Music, Brotherhood of Man, and Bye Bye Bitch Bye Bye.\n\nOriginally published at http://suite101.com\n",
        "\nI remember the first time I discovered this album and being mesmerized by the cover art. Lemmy and the boys were almost certainly unaware of it, but the picture adorning their album was way ahead of its time. They had next to nothing to do with the development of death metal, but the art on Another Perfect Day was very much in the spirit of what was to start hitting the record store shelves by the end of the decade. Not back then in the genre's heyday, and certainly not today, are any records found with a cover as badass and downright frightening as this one. Just what the hell is going on here? Ol' Snaggletooth doesn't look like he's doing so well, caught up in some kind of infernal tempest of fire, ice, and lightning, complete with a forked tongue and lava spewing from an eye socket. The title lettering looks like a scabbed-over wound in the aftermath of it being carved in someone's arm.\n\nTruly, the cover seems out of place when you consider the type of music for which Mot\u00f6rhead is known. \"Ferocity\" isn't a term that I would attribute to the Mot\u00f6rhead sound. Rather, the first two words that come to mind as I try to describe it are \"grit\" and \"sleaze\". What perhaps makes Another Perfect Day an oddity in the band's catalog is that here the lyrical subject matter and the overall tone of the music is darker and a bit more serious than on any of their previous successes. Don't take my statement the wrong way - I'm not saying that Mot\u00f6rhead is trying to make legitimate political or social commentary with this music. What I am saying is that this album isn't as heavily punk or blues influenced as most of their earlier work, and the subject matter is focused on insanity, revenge, and war more so than it is on sex, drugs, and rock 'n' roll.\n\nAll that being said, what does the music actually sound like? Well, for lack of a better term, gritty. It's unfortunate, but the production here really isn't good at all. The first time I listened to this album, the opening track really threw me off-base. The bottom end of the mix is so hopelessly lost that I hadn't realized the song's first verse had started. I understand how this can be upsetting to many fans. One of the things that is always expected of a Mot\u00f6rhead album is to hear Lemmy's bass loud and clear. You have to really search for it on this release. During the segments of the album when the band isn't simply pounding away, there is a noticeable amount of reverberation in the guitar tone. At other times, it all sounds very hollow. It sounds under-produced. It isn't normal for this band at all.\n\nI suppose it's for reasons such as those that this album is often considered \"overlooked\" and why it wasn't a commercial success. It's a shame, really, because the quality of songwriting here is a considerable improvement over the previous year's Iron Fist and quite a bit more complex and varied than their offerings on Ace of Spades (although not nearly as catchy). The opening track, \"Back at the Funny Farm\", is without question one of Mot\u00f6rhead's best songs. In a way, it serves as a microcosm of everything the band had done up to that point in their career - and is no way indicative of what anything on the rest of the album sounds like, save for the closing track, \"Die You Bastard\". Two blazing tracks bookend the rest of the contents, much of which is very strange for this band. \n\nThe main riff to \"Shine\", the song which follows the fantastic opener, is simply awkward. If you can stomach it, this is the kind of music the remainder of the album portrays to the listener. Nearly all of the tracks have calm, unoffensive introductory sections which are directly influenced by 70's-style prog rock, and many of them have overtones derived from the same style of music. Does this detract from the album's quality? No, it's just different. \"Dancing on Your Grave\" is a Mot\u00f6rhead classic and is the genesis of Sepultura, and despite that it's an oddly melodic track. Even so, it's not nearly as toned-down as \"One Track Mind\" or the title track. If you followed my statement there, yes, that's right. This album's title track is not a tearing, speeding song. It's mid-paced at most. Mot\u00f6rhead isn't known for playing ballad-type songs, but all of the slower work here is executed very well. Lemmy knows how to handle his voice even when the music isn't at its most aggressive and the music is still heavy even when it's slow. Odd for Mot\u00f6rhead, but enjoyable. \n\nIt's the innately unusual character of this album that makes it so memorable for me. Mot\u00f6rhead's music is supposed to be about motorcycles and booze and picking up trashy women and getting into fights in shitty bars. Another Perfect Day paints for us a vastly different picture. I'm not claiming that Mot\u00f6rhead is atmospheric, but for their style this is a very bleak album. It sticks with me - the tangible insanity of \"Back at the Funny Farm\", the desperate feeling of the chorus in \"Marching off to War\", the depression of being worn down by the perpetual grind in the title track... Maybe it doesn't stick out for some people, but it definitely does for me. In a nutshell, that's why I like Another Perfect Day so much. It feels to me almost like Mot\u00f6rhead's attempt to take their music and image in a slightly different direction while remaining true to their roots. Of course, we're all aware that no such change ever truly happened, and most are grateful for it, too. Mot\u00f6rhead today is the same old Mot\u00f6rhead, but I still strongly recommend this album as look into their past from a very strangely placed window.\n",
        "\nReviewing a Motorhead album is challenging. Why? You try doing it without a) stating that it sounds like Motorhead, b) mentioning how Lemmy and the lads haven't seemed to have aged or c) or some reference to Lemmy's infamous life of excess in all departments. So, to save myself the heartache, I've decided to include all those things at the beginning, so here goes. This is a Motorhead album, I guarentee it will sound like Motorhead. Lemmy, MIkkey and Phil don't sound as if they have aged and Lemmy will drink you under the table. There. Now I can tell what album sounds like (if you haven't figured it out already). \n\nMikkey Dee has always been an awesome drummer, from King Diamond to Dokken to his (not so recent anymore) association with Lemmy. He is capable of providing the unbreakable spine to Motorhead without ever getting boring, adding tasteful fills everyone now and then for flavour. His unrelenting energy is breathtaking to listen to, which combined with the strength of the production gives the drums an unmatched power (just listen to 'Outlaw'). For sure, this is 4/4 rock n roll drumming but it never gets boring, especially not as boring as the drumming on Reload. And they sound better. \n\nGuitar-wise, I have come to the conclusion that Phil Campbell will never run out of riffs. The monster riff on 'Brotherhood of Man' has been compared by everyone to capturing the essence of Orgasmatron, while 'Bye Bye Bitch Bye Bye' is one of the best riffs on the album, rightfully earning the song the title of album closer. The guitar is thick and crunchy, which is great for the heavier and faster songs, but also give the old-school style 'Rock n Roll Music' a light touch, which interwines well with the bluesy licks that are prevalent throughout the song. When it comes to soloing, Phil Campbell is the man for the job. His style ranges from pure blues-rock with wah-wah tinges, to fast, frantic picking as evidenced on 'Outlaw' which is my favourite solo on the album. Top-notch work to be found here. \n\nYou can always feel Lemmy's bass. It is not always distinct from the rest of the music, but your bones will thank you profusely when it is not rumbling away. For the most part, bass follows the guitar line, but will occasionaly break away to strike out on its own, such as the bass solo on 'Brotherhood of Man', which duels with Phil's guitar for a little bit, which was cool to hear, but more is requested from this humble listener.\n\nVocally, Lemmy sounds the same as he did on Motorizer, Kiss of Death, Inferno... I could go on, but by now, you should have listened to all of Motorhead's discography and realised that while other singer's voices may have detoriated (provide your own examples here), Lemmy's hasn't. He adopts a lighter touch on 'Rock n Roll Music,' paying homage to the music that defined his life, which he has said many times, whilst heavier and more energetic tracks receive Lemmy's trademark gruff shout which no one else should ever attempt to imitate. My throat testifies to this. \n\nI have a special spot for Motorhead lyrics, from the bacon torpedo to the bed that is a mess of rattlesnakes, and this album doesn't fail to deliver more of the same. The whole album is awash with great examples, but I'd have to say that 'All things come to he who waits, but these days most things most things suck,' reveal Lemmy's acidic disdain for modern culture in the best way possible. \n\nOverall, this is a solid album from one the world's most consistent bands. Cameron Webb has set a Motorhead record by sticking with the band for albums straight, which is major factor in the consistency department, although it does make the album sound a little less unique. I am sad that this album like the album before it doesn't feature a famed Motorballad, because they are always awesome. I suppose I could wait for one to appear on the next album, but there is a chance that it might suck.\n",
        "\nOnly falling very, very slightly short of the standards of the preceding Overkill or the following Ace of Spades - and that's only because the title track is very, very slightly less iconic and memorable than the title cuts from those two - Bomber continues Motorhead's ongoing fusion of heavy metal aggression and volume, punk rock attitude, and classic rock and roll songwriting.\n\nAs with many Motorhead albums, the title song is the best - this time placed as the album closer rather than kicking off the set - with an insanely catchy chorus it's almost impossible not to sing along to. Lemmy's talent as a lyricist is in full flow this time around, with Poison being a frank and emotionally raw condemnation of his absentee father and Lawman being one of the most eloquent \"fuck the police\" songs ever recorded. Fast Eddie gets a shot at lead vocals on Step Down, but can't really match Lemmy's iconic roar - not that anyone could expect him to, but it does mean that song is a step down compared to the rest of the album.\n\nAs far as the music goes, it's more of the classic Motorhead sound - loud as fuck bass and percussion, with Lemmy playing bass like it's another lead guitar, and fast and furious lead guitar from Fast Eddie to sweeten the deal. If you've heard one of their songs from this era - and who hasn't heard Ace of Spades? - you know what you're letting yourself in for, and you know whether you love their classic sound or hate it. If you love it, there's plenty to love here. If you hate it, well, I'm not going to convince you otherwise and Bomber probably won't either.\n",
        "\nThe legend about Lemmy is that he started playing bass by mistake - Hawkwind needed someone to play quick, he happened to be a roadie for them, they handed him a bass guitar and he started playing it like a lead guitar. Whether that's true or not, Lemmy developed a then-unique \"lead bassist\" style whilst in Hawkwind and based the Motorhead sound around that, plus a fat dose of speed metal aggression, and a punk rocker's appetite for good old-fashioned rock and roll.\n\nOverkill is the album where the pieces of that formula really came together to create the classic Motorhead mode we know and love today. The title track is a bass apocalypse which is still a centrepiece of the band's live performances to this day, and closing track Limb From Limb is - when you look past the heaviness - a very traditional rock and roll number performed in an incredibly confident way. Between the two is a range of songs which begin to show the full power this trio are capable of.\n\nSeveral songs are particularly notable - Capricorn and Metropolis are the two slower numbers on the album, Metropolis particularly effectively catching an oppressive and doomly atmosphere, whilst I'll Be Your Sister is an extremely odd love song rendered all the more unusual because, hey, it's Lemmy singing it. (Lemmy's famous gravelly tones are beginning to take shape here, sounding mliles away from the clean and inoffensive vocals he lent to Hawkwind tracks such as Silver Machine.)\n\nOverall, the album's running length might not be up to much - a nose over 35 minutes unless you count bonus tracks (and I don't) - but typically of Motorhead it's 35 minutes of all (over)killer and no filler.\n",
        "\nTo a metal-fixated, pre-pubescent boy in England at the start of the 1980s, Mot\u00f6rhead were who you wanted to be and Girlschool were who you wanted to be with. Admittedly, you didn\u2019t fully understand why (on either count), you just knew that you did. Consequently, \u2018The St Valentine\u2019s Day Massacre\u2019 EP constituted something of a dream pairing, although the lewdly punning moniker of Headgirl chosen by the two bands was also something the average 10-year-old wouldn\u2019t quite have grasped back in those na\u00efve times.\n\nThe EP was released around the high-water mark of the mainstream popularity of NWOBHM \u2013 mere months before \u2018No Sleep \u2018til Hammersmith\u2019 was destined to reach the number 1 spot in the UK album charts \u2013 but the motivation to record it was not a cynical urge to ring the cash tills but an unforeseen and oddly fortuitous consequence of Phil Taylor piledriving his head into the concrete during some post-gig shenanigans and thereby fracturing his neck, delaying Mot\u00f6rhead\u2019s tour. Mind you, it was probably also not unrelated to Lemmy\u2019s desire to spend a few days cooped up in a studio with Girlschool, almost certainly the only thing he had in common with English 10-year-old boys at the time. As his sleeve notes to the \u2018No Remorse\u2019 compilation wistfully observed some years later, \u201cI still love Kelly\u201d.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s also worth noting that those same sleeve notes see Lemmy describing \u2018Please Don\u2019t Touch\u2019 as \u201c\u2026one of my proudest moments\u201d and there is no doubt that despite the suspicion of novelty that inevitably attends a one-off collaboration like this, with its cover versions and fancy-dress sleeve photo, \u2018The St Valentine\u2019s Day Massacre\u2019 is not a throwaway diversion from each band\u2019s \u2018real\u2019 output but a genuinely solid addition to any metal fan\u2019s collection that sees each band at the height of its game.\n\nOriginally released in 1959 by Johnny Kidd and the Pirates, it\u2019s not much of a surprise that \u2018Please Don\u2019t Touch\u2019 is, in essence, very much a straightforward rock\u2019n\u2019roll song, driven along by a fast, springy bass line and crisp, energetic drumming with plenty of snare and rolls. What elevates it into the realm of metal is the overhaul undertaken by the combined bands, with a raw guitar tone and harsh vocals well to the fore thanks to a hard-edged, gritty production that gives plenty of depth to the twin bass lines of Kim and Lemmy and plenty of muscle to the blistering lead guitar work from Eddie and Kelly.\n\nThe sense of enthusiasm and experiment that pervades the EP is clear in the swapping of conventional roles, Eddie providing the lead vocals on the version of \u2018Emergency\u2019 and Kelly, rather than Kim, undertaking vocal duties for the Girlschool contingent on \u2018Please Don\u2019t Touch\u2019. Indeed, the duet of Kelly and Lemmy is one of the highpoints of the track, Kelly\u2019s rasping yet soulful voice a fitting feminine complement for Lemmy\u2019s in their shared lines, and she holds her own very well in her solo verses, vibrant and powerful and perfectly fitting the track\u2019s pacey and grimey tone. Hearing Lemmy squaring up to a more melodious vocal line than a conventional Mot\u00f6rhead number is also fascinating and he nails it well, without sacrificing one iota of his characteristically hoarse snarl.\n\nThe strong production by Bronze stalwart Vic Maile is nowhere better evidenced than in the guitar solo, which is really a guitar duo, comprising a tag match between Eddie and Kelly as they swap sections between them. Each guitar is clear and distinct and tears out of the speakers with plenty of satisfying distortion, both playing with precision and pace as they try and outdo each other. Considering \u2018Fast\u2019 Eddie Clarke\u2019s status as the greatest of Mot\u00f6rhead\u2019s guitarists, Kelly more than keeps pace with him, a high-profile testament to her ability that lives on following her untimely death in 2007.\n\nAfter the merging of the two bands for \u2018Please Don\u2019t Touch\u2019 (minus the fully neck-braced Phil, of course, who provided only \u201cinsults and inspiration\u201d according to the sleeve notes), the B side sees each band separate out to cover one of the other\u2019s songs. Girlschool\u2019s take on \u2018Bomber\u2019 includes some odd whipcrack sound effects in place of cymbals but other than that is a fairly reverential facsimile of the Mot\u00f6rhead classic, with Kim\u2019s slightly tentative vocals only adding to the subdued feel. The solo again showcases Kelly\u2019s fluid style but overall the song is rather too clean and antiseptic, lacking the dirty low-end and fuzz of the original and highlighting, by its absence, that ability of Mot\u00f6rhead to commit totally to every song and simply let rip. This urge to perpetually give it 100% is perfectly illustrated by Mot\u00f6rhead\u2019s own aggressive and hyper-accelerated run through (or over) Girlschool\u2019s \u2018Emergency\u2019.\n\nGenerally, the production of the B-side tracks lacks the spark of \u2018Please Don\u2019t Touch\u2019, both songs being noticeably flatter and more anaemic, particularly Eddie\u2019s vocals on \u2018Emergency\u2019, which are perfectly decent but way too far back in the mix and swamped by Lemmy during the chorus. However, the same cannot be said of his excellent solo, which is needle-sharp and precise and complemented by some great double-kick drum work from Denise Dufort.\n\nDenise is, in many ways, the star of \u2018The St Valentine\u2019s Day Massacre\u2019, fulfilling the drumming duties on every track in Phil\u2019s absence and doing a marvellous job in a variety of styles \u2013 light and precise for the rock\u2019n\u2019roll-flavoured \u2018Please Don\u2019t Touch\u2019, solid and metronomic for \u2018Bomber\u2019 and equally as aggressive and bludgeoning as Lemmy and Eddie on \u2018Emergency\u2019. However, singling out one person for praise doesn\u2019t really fit in with the genuine sense of camaraderie that pervades this record, the feeling that everybody involved was equally important and wholly believed in it. There\u2019s no taint of a mercenary cash-in nor any suspicion that Girlschool were seeking to ride on the coat-tails of their more illustrious peers, it\u2019s just a great heavy metal EP where all concerned were palpably having a great time to such an extent that the listener can\u2019t help but be carried along.\n\nEven now, more than 25 years after the event, the mythical union that was Headgirl holds up very well and plays its part in ensuring that middle-aged English gents still want to be Lemmy (even though the only point of similarity in their lifestyles now is a love of PG Wodehouse and an early night) and, when all\u2019s said and done, Enid can still fill a pair of leather trousers better than most\u2026\n",
        "\nWhile often rightly seen as Mot\u00f6rhead\u2019s turning point away from 70s rock towards heavy metal, the true nature of \u201cOverkill\u201d should not be jaded by overstating the contrast between this and the previous album (or albums if you count \u201cOn Parole\u201d as it was recorded earlier, though released later). This is first and foremost a rock album, played with a rock guitarist who very seldom ventures outside of the blues box even during his wildest solos, and largely asserts its aggression by presenting the style in its hardest, nastiest way possible. The punk element has definitely crept its way into the mix and has given the band some broader dimensions in lyrical subject matter, though the line of succession back to the 50s and 60s format is still quite clear, in contrast to most 70s punk bands where the commonalities with Chuck Berry, Elvis, The Beatles, Cream, AC/DC and Led Zeppelin were falling away.\n\nThe major evolutionary jump that is seen here is manifest in the auspiciously fast and long title song. It doesn\u2019t really cook any faster than a few other proto-speed metal classics such as Riot\u2019s \u201cWarrior\u201d, Rainbow\u2019s \u201cKill The King\u201d or Judas Priest\u2019s \u201cExciter\u201d, but the combination of the fast paced riffing and dirty shouts definitely show an alternative template that was picked up a bit more by thrash metal bands than the others, which were a bit more consonantly tinged and power metal-like. It\u2019s more of a slowly progressing riff machine in the style of the early 80s speed outfits, and isn\u2019t quite as informed by the dark Toni Iommi sound that would later play a determining role in shaping thrash\u2019s riff character. But beyond anything else, this is a timeless song that still manages to communicate that aggravated sense of angst with a dated, 3 decades old production.\n\nPerhaps the biggest problem with this album, and one that would set a precedent for a number of bands, is that Lemmy and company let the cat out of the bag right at the beginning of the album. No matter how good the songs are on here, and there are many solid fits of rock on here, they can\u2019t measure up to the sheer speed and intensity of what can be summed up as an amazing experiment in pushing the limits of present day practices. The infectiously catchy \u201cNo Class\u201d, apart from sounding pretty damn similar to ZZ Top\u2019s \u201cTush\u201d in several parts, rocks pretty hard and showcases a pure 70s rock sound with a gravely as hell vocal display. Things get toned down a little bit and show Lemmy\u2019s somewhat more sensitive and complex side in \u201cI\u2019ll Be Your Sister\u201d, which doesn\u2019t get quite as emotionally charged as \u201cOnly Women Bleed\u201d, nor does it venture out of the up tempo pentatonic rock dogmas of the time, but is moving nonetheless.\n\nNevertheless, there some other signs of progression out of the prototypical 70s sound, manifesting primarily in how Lemmy\u2019s bass sound has evolved. While the title song is an obvious example of him showing the instrument in a more prominent function than simply supporting the drums, the really interesting stuff comes into play a little later on. Most notably on \u201cStay Clean\u201d and \u201cLimb From Limb\u201d, which generally stay relatively close to a rock format, showcase a raunchy, distorted bass sound that takes a few cues from Geezer Butler, but ups the ante as well. Bearing in mind that this was before the grand days of Joey Demaio and Cliff Burton really exploring the bass as a solo instrument, historically the contributions at work on these songs are of particular note, especially given that they occur in songs that are compact and easy to sing along to, rather than jam out epics typical to Sabbath\u2019s earlier material.\n\nAt the end of the day, the historical significance of this album is undeniable, though the staying power of some of these songs is less so. Like any album that functions in a transitional way, there is a general inconsistency that develops, and a few songs seem unwilling to conform themselves to the new approach and come off as filler. In truth, despite being one of the greatest contributors to heavy metal\u2019s glorious history, Mot\u00f6rhead has always had an issue with a few fifth wheel songs finding their way onto their studio releases, such is the case with \u201cDamage Case\u201d and \u201c(I Won\u2019t) Pay Your Price\u201d, which don\u2019t really distinguish themselves from a number of songs by Deep Purple or UFO, save the vocals. But whether treating this as a musical revolution or just another rock album with a few surprises, \u201cOverkill\u201d is definitely an essential album for the vintage metal fanatic.\n",
        "\nWhenever anyone needs a reminder that the words primitive and bad are not synonymous terms when describing a metal band, Motorhead\u2019s well known 1980 lawn killer of an album \u201cAce Of Spades\u201d is the place to send them. It\u2019s the sort of album that hearkens back to those days where the lines between hard rock, punk and metal were pretty well blurred, and there was a place for bands to play primitive pentatonic riffs and Chuck Berry inspired guitar solos yet do it in such away that rekindles the shock factor of both after about 25 years after they were introduced to a wider audience. It represents a band that is quite apt at testing the manhood of its listeners, while still keeping that non-conformist 70s punk element at the fore.\n\nWhile definitely not being the most consonant sounding band, this is the sort of sharp edged, cigarette steeped goodness that can be sung along to. Lemmy\u2019s vocals are about as gritty and gravely as they come, yet there is still a discernable melody in his minimal range. But the real winner here is the wicked combination of chunky, distorted bass work with crunchy rock guitar riffs that create an aggressive feel that is nasty enough for hardcore, yet precise enough to be mistaken for the emerging NWOBHM. A few of the band\u2019s signature live songs can be found on here, along with a tiny side order of older rock influenced numbers that could be qualified as filler, yet are still solid and fun.\n\nPerhaps the biggest flaw at play here, which is typical to most Motorhead albums, is generally a lack of variety. The songs tend to be either up tempo, or really up tempo, and consisting in a very simple yet highly energetic mixture of simplistic 70s riffs played a little too fast and dirty, and drums that get a little too happy on the double bass at times. The shorter and faster things tend to be, the better, as is the case with most 70s punk albums. Most are familiar with the wickedly gritty title song that kicks things off, though perhaps not so much with the equally energetic yet somewhat cleaner cut closer \u201cThe Hammer\u201d, but both are classic examples of the solid speedy goodness Lemmy and company have been delivering since \u201cOverkill\u201d. Other quintessential highlights include the flashy rocker \u201cFire, Fire\u201d and the sloppy little ditty \u201cBite The Bullet\u201d.\n\nPretty much everyone can have a genuine appreciation for this band, although being able to fully appreciate an entire album of their\u2019s is a different matter as they have a fair share of songs in their repertoire that rarely see the stage, and \u201cAce Of Spades\u201d isn\u2019t really an exception to the rule. There\u2019s still a lot of old school rock present in the mix here, and most people who go for heavy metal might not go for the pre-NWOBHM tendencies at work here, anymore than they might some of the lesser known early Judas Priest and Black Sabbath songs. But this is the sort of album that can be appreciated by most fans of straight up heavy metal at high tempos, and should definitely be looked into.\n",
        "\nWhen I checked out this album I expected another conservative retro rock record without any surprises as the trend heavily heads in this direction with the recent success of \"Bullet\" or \"Airbourne\" but this album blew me away in a very positive way. \n\nTen dirty rock'n'roll pearls are in this little treasure that is very well produced and sounds fresh without taking the energy and edgy style of the single songs. That is really rare to find and hear nowadays and rates this album really up.\n\nEven though this album is quite catchy and has the typical Mot\u00f6rhead trademarks, there are some bits of surprising elements in many of these songs that keep the relative diversity quite elevated. From the dark groove monster \"Brotherhood of man\" up to the punk rock smasher \"Bye bye bitch bye bye\" the band tries out many different kind of little style change gimmicks. \n\nMy favourite song is the great opener \"Born to lose\" that takes no prisoners from the beginning on and has a really amazing and memorable main riff, a really tight and energizing drumming and some surprising licks and breaks here and there. This song perfectly represents the band with all its trademarks and still sounds fresh. Lemmy is not the egocentric star in here as the other two band members rock as much and are part of this energizing and vibrating sound that dominates the whole album. Many people often forget about that and I think that the three musicians seem to have the same passion and ideology and collaborate in harmony. \n\nAll in all, this album contains forty minutes of sweat, blood and passion. This album is pure rock'n'roll and rocks more than any ambitious retro rock band out there. While songs of \"Airbourne\" or \"Bullet\" all quite the same after only two or three albums, this band is still kicking ass after twenty studio records in over thirty five years. Maybe they are following the same formula and normally this is something I rather don't like but Mot\u00f6rhead is one of the rare bands that have created a somehwat perfect brand over the years that nobody would like to get changed. This is truly legendary.\n",
        "\nThe general consensus is that Mot\u00f6rhead hit something of a slump right before revamping their lineup and cutting ties with long time guitarist Eddie Clark. A lot of it hinges on the fact that Eddie produced the album, and as a result, aided in putting forth an inferiorly realized product that sounded almost like a throwback to their 1977 sound, but with the hindsight of \u201cOverkill\u201d and \u201cAce Of Spades\u201d in the songwriting. In a sense, this is the correct way to view \u201cIron Fist\u201d, though the actual sound of this album isn\u2019t terribly out of character for Mot\u00f6rhead, nor is it something that really takes too much away from the album.\n\nFor those who might only be casually aware of how the 1977-82 era of the band sounds through the regular radio play of \u201cAce Of Spades\u201d, the format is ruggedly simple and drenched with enough attitude to tattoo the listener without need of human hands. Pile on the bluesy rock riffs, played at tempos just a tad bit too ridiculously fast for most harder edged punk rock outfits, a bass sound that is as raunchy and guitar-like as they come, and a voice loaded with rasp and cigarette tar and it all becomes crystal clear. In essence, this album offers a sense of newness only in the respect that the party has gotten just a little meaner.\n\nThe usual strong points that typified this album\u2019s immediate predecessors follow suit here in a solid collection of fast paced speed metal and slightly less speedy metal. The album just sort of starts off at a sprinting pace, slows down to a moderately fast stride from time to time, and then kicks the afterburners on yet again. The obvious favorite of the pack is the title song and the near equally intense \u201cSpeedfreak\u201d, both of which are heavily reminiscent of \u201cAce Of Spades\u201d, though loaded up with about twice as much bluesy solo guitar work and slightly more edge. \u201cSex And Outrage\u201d kicks it up to almost the same level, but just passes by a tad bit too quickly, hinting at perhaps being one of two songs that were put on the album in an unfinished state according to Lemmy.\n\nDespite generally smashing skulls with the power of a pair of tempered steel knuckles, \u201cIron Fist\u201d kind of descends into retro-rock territory on a couple songs and plays it a little too safe. Slower rock anthems like \u201cLoser\u201d and \u201cAmerica\u201d sound like they were literally lifted out of the dregs of early 70s clich\u00e9s and given a slightly rougher exterior. Likewise, the tediously repetitive \u201c(Don\u2019t Need) Religion\u201d just hangs onto this riff that sounds like it was partially lifted off of Ted Nugent for way too long. Generally Lemmy\u2019s scratchy shouts don\u2019t work well on songs like these as they have a more consonant character to them that he hasn\u2019t proven able to replicate. Essentially, these songs are not nasty enough to fit his voice, not to mention that the riffs come off as a little stagnant and recycled.\n\nAll things considered, \u201cIron Fist\u201d could be seen as something of a disappointment in that it has found itself caught between two utterly fantastic albums from two completely different eras, and as being the last offering with the guitarist that put all those signature riffs to their late 70s offerings and the rightly heralded \u201cAce Of Spades\u201d. But speaking in terms of the album in itself, it is a solid studio achievement that deserves some praise in that it shows a band capable of getting the job done without a professional producer. A few songs on here are utterly essential, and most of the rest are solidly good, so like with most of Mot\u00f6rhead\u2019s extensive library of empty beer cans and bad breath, the smart money was spent procuring this at the local music exchange.\n",
        "\n...Phil asked Howard, who was wearing a shirt that had the number 36 or something on it. \"No, why?\" \"Because I've never seen \"cunt\" spelled like that before.\" We got him twice with that and finally he started freaking out - \"Why did you hire me, then, if you don't like me!\" And Phil said, \"Well, you were the only one in our price range.\" (Lemmy: White Line Fever, p. 263 f.) Now, that has definitely changed by now...\n\nMeanwhile Howard Benson is probably one of the most expensive producers out there and a lot of his success came from producing Nu Metal- and Post-Grunge-bands and that means that he is really good at providing a band with a MASSIVE sound. Hence, he was one of the few producers Mot\u00f6rhead ever had who really made them sound just as they should, plus each of the four albums he produced sounded differently (e.g. hear the huge difference between \"Overnight Sensation\" and \"Sacrifice\")! (The four Cameron Webb-produced albums, by comparison, basically all sound the same.)\n\nProduction-wise \"Overnight Sensation\" is Howard Bensons's masterpiece for Mot\u00f6rhead and one of the best Mot\u00f6rhead albums ever - song-wise though, it is a mixed bag. The worst song is also the heaviest song on the album. With some growls \"Shake The World\" may have worked as a Death Metal song (maybe as some kind of a light version of \"God Of Emptiness\"), but it doesn't work as it is, and that's also the problem with the three mediocre songs \"Civil War\", \"Eat The Gun\" and \"Them Not Me\", which coincidentally are the fastest tracks on the album. While heavier bands can make up for a certain lack of catchiness or songwriting with heaviness or speed, it has never worked out for Mot\u00f6rhead. (Maybe this would have worked for really fast songs like \"See Me Burning\" or \"Red Raw\" on the following albums, but those are great songs anyway...)\n\nThe catchy \"Love Can't Buy You Money\" and the two uptempo songs \"Crazy Like A Fox\" (more upbeat) and \"Murder Show\" (more serious) are the three great songs on the album, which finally leaves us with the classics, which are, you may have guessed it, the slowest songs on the album: the three midtempo tracks \"Broken\", \"Overnight Sensation\" and the closer \"Listen To Your Heart\" (with acoustic guitar) and, last but not least, some kind of a Mot\u00f6rhead unicum, \"I Don't Believe A Word\" - a 6 and a half minute long, slow song - which is no blues and no ballad either.\n\nEspecially on these slower songs Howard Benson's production really comes into its own - apart from Vic Maile, for example, no other producer has yet managed to provide Lemmy with such a fantastic bass sound (Tony Platt wasn't bad either though) - and the combination of brilliant songwriting and a brilliant production results in a few of the best songs ever. The rest, i.e. the fast and heavy stuff, is not nearly as good, but in the end \"Overnight Sensation\" still provides half an hour of the best Mot\u00f6rhead you could wish for.\n",
        "\nThe year is 1982. Mot\u00f6rhead are about to record a cover of the song, Stand by Your Man. Not that surprisingly 'Fast' Eddie Clarke thinks it's bullshit and quits the band as a protest. This all happens in the middle of the tour so Lemmy and Phil are left in a bit of a bind, not having a guitarist for their live dates. Fortunately someone informs them that Brian 'Robbo' Robertson - formerly of Thin Lizzy-fame - is on tour a couple of towns over. A few phone calls later: Mot\u00f6rhead has a new guitarist. However, throwing out a raging madman like Eddie Clarke and bringing in a completely different style of guitarist has its complications. Robertson is a much more melodic guitarist, a master of the style having played it together with Scott Gorham in Thin Lizzy for five years and five albums. For this reason, Another Perfect Day was going to be a different album from the start, despite what Lemmy says. \n\n\"Fuck notes\", yet the album is chock full of them. Well, surely it fires off with a classic Mot\u00f6rhead-style rocker which could almost keep pace with the likes of the title track-trio, Overkill, Bomber and Ace of Spades, but while Lemmy's bass is rough and fast, Robbo's guitar plays a very melodic line and by the second part of his first solo he shows that he definitely is no Eddie Clarke. That is, he is a lot more versatile and interesting lead guitarist than his predecessor. Eddie was very fitting for the style of the earlier albums, but Robbo does his thing with a lot more style and class. His solos and leads take up a whole lot of space on the album and fortunately he has the chops to warrant this kind of attention. Whenever Lemmy isn't on the mic, Robbo has something going on in the melody section; a little twiddle that he repeats with a slight variation, a small lead bit, a full-on solo or something in between. This translates to a lack of rhythm guitar, but with the band in case being Mot\u00f6rhead this isn't really a problem as Lemmy's bass is cranked up loud - but not disturbingly so - and distorted with some mid-range fuzz so it can support Robbo's guitaring the back-up oomph it needs.\n\nNot that surprisingly, without Eddie there, the punk-influence on Another Perfect Day is toned down a notch or two. In its place is a lot more rock'n'roll, courtesy of Eddie's replacement. He has also brought with him long, leisurely yet fast-paced sections fitting for his extensive solos. The thing is though, where this album works is the songs that rely on Robbo's melodies. These are often the lighter songs, with a more laid back attitude to them, with riffs drenched in Robertson's melodic ideas. They're like a picnic on a sunny lazy day with a joint or two to pass around. It's like at the writing sessions Lemmy and Phil were convinced by their new guitarist to do the compositions under the effects of marijuana instead of the speed they were commonly cranking. There's a loose, bluesy feeling to the two songs of this kind, Dancing on Your Grave and the title track, especially when Robertson is given a free hand to go at it and do what he does best. At times the songs feel more like vehicles for his solos than actual songs, which is by no means a bad thing. He is just that much of a delight to listen to. A third lighter track also features on the album, but it is one that Clarke took hand in writing, even if it sounds a bit off for him. I Got Mine is a kind of a love song even if it takes a fast paced Mot\u00f6rhead-stab at the style, but the riffs are again based just on Lemmy's bass while the guitar plays vastly melodic riffs whenever it isn't a time for a lead or a solo. It makes a striking contrast to the two other songs with its faster tempo, lighter feel and very long solo sections, which are very much a treat. Imagining the sections taken over by Clarke is quite a task; they probably would've been shortened a lot if not cut out altogether. \n\nIt's not difficult to imagine why people might have scratched their heads at these songs on a Mot\u00f6rhead album and why fans might have been disappointed. It's not exactly the album to wreck things by when hyped up on crank, even if a couple of the songs on it would be fitting for that. It's an album for someone who enjoys melodic, blues and rock 'n' roll-tinged guitar playing since there's plenty of that, especially in terms of leadwork. That is by far the best part of the album and fortunately Lemmy and Phil didn't hold Robbo back on this. He has all the space he needs. Which is why it is rather lamentable that he wanted even more. Robertson's career in Mot\u00f6rhead ended after the tour for the album for he refused to play a lot of old Mot\u00f6rhead classics such as Overkill, Ace of Spades and Bomber. We are left with this one, unique piece of work, showcasing his magnificent guitaring.\n",
        "\nOpinions vary, but as far as I\u2019m concerned the greatest era of Motorhead was with the Campbell/Wurzel dual guitar era of the mid 80s to mid 90s, with their climax being at around the time \u201cOrgasmatron\u201d came out. In the midst of this glorious era, several live concerts were recorded, or which this is one of the better to get released to the masses. It features a full arrangement that fills the arena in a manner that only the likes of Manowar could ever hope to match, and Lemmy at the top of his game, slamming out those garbled, raspy shouts in a manner that has since been widely emulated, but never fully matched.\n\nIn terms of a set list, \u201cThe Birthday Party\u201d packs a pummeling iron fist (no pun intended) of vintage, fast as hell heavy metal, trading blows between speed metal classics such as \u201cIron Fist\u201d, \u201cMean Machine\u201d, \u201cThe Hammer\u201d, \u201cAce Of Spades\u201d and \u201cBomber\u201d, and a veritable legion of slightly slower, but still far too hard to handle anthems. Throw into the mix the tightness and precision of Saxon drummer Pete Gill and what emerges is a perfect storm of metallic majesty, free from the clutter that would occasionally come out in earlier live performances. In fact, among the releases from the 80s, this is among the more neatly crafted yet still gritty as hell performances out of the band, due in some part to both Campbell and Wurzel avoid getting too muddy with their guitar tone and Lemmy restraining his tendency to strum his bass like it\u2019s a guitar.\n\nPerhaps the only area where this album kind of suffers slightly is that essentially the band is going for the jugular over and over again, pumping out one speed metal song after another with little time for the listener to recover from the previous annihilation. Just about every fast song between the band\u2019s early singles up through \u201cIron Fist\u201d has been thrown into this pot, while some of the band\u2019s more mid paced classics have either been left out, or are mashed in between 2 or 3 of \u201cOverkill\u2019s\u201d many offspring. This would almost be the equivalent of Metallica doing all of their material from the first two albums but leaving out \u201cFade To Black\u201d, \u201cFor Whom The Bell Tolls\u201d, \u201cEscape\u201d, \u201cSeek And Destroy\u201d, \u201cJump In The Fire\u201d and one or two other slightly less than full out thrashers in an attempt to make their audience mosh each other to death.\n\nNevertheless, this is a solid live album that comes in pretty high on the priority list for the rank and file Motorhead fanatic. It\u2019s not quite the best one out there, and given that it was to commemorate the band being in existence for 10 years, it is understandable that Lemmy wanted to literally throw everything at the audience, starting with the kitchen sink. If you like speed, if you like plenty of dueling leads, if you like hearing Lemmy bust speakers with his gravely ravings, definitely give this a listen.\n",
        "\nSomewhere in the midst of Motorhead\u2019s glory days in the studio, between 1979 and 1981, this short little live performance managed to get recorded and put out on the market as their first live offering. Amazingly enough, in spite of the really short period of time allotted to the band, Lemmy and company pull off a hell of a set and really get the audience jazzed up in a venue which they were likely not the headlining act. Sure, the song selection may come off as archaic to most who have come to know the band since, the production quality is somewhat up close and resembles a small venue recording, but for all of the limitation this shapes up to be a fairly enjoyable listen.\n\nBeing a performance from before Motorhead\u2019s metal credentials being fully solidified in \u201cAce Of Spades\u201d, the songs found on here tend to have more of an aggressive rock character than a metal character. \u201cLeaving Here\u201d, \u201cDead Men Tell No Tales\u201d and \u201cToo Late, Too Late\u201d all more closely resemble the emergent rock/metal character of bands like Thin Lizzy and Rainbow more than anything else, barring Lemmy\u2019s raunchy vocal style, which flirts heavily with the rawness levels explored by Venom quite often. The latter of these 3 songs is a bit bass heavy and seems to be hinting at the style that Iron Maiden would adopt on their early works, which were just starting to come together at this point. The only song here that really goes off in a metallic direction is \u201cStone Dead Forever\u201d, but it is pretty tame compared to the fury achieved on \u201cOverkill\u201d.\n\nAlthough a fairly tame, restrained, more rock oriented version of the band, \u201cThe Golden Years\u201d is a worthwhile pick up for anyone who wants to delve into the earlier period of Motorhead\u2019s live escapades. At this point the arrangement has gotten a good bit tighter and more together than was the case in the late 70s, the guitar work has gotten a bit wilder and crunchy, and Lemmy\u2019s vocal style has become much more characteristic of what the band is now known for. This isn\u2019t necessarily for the newcomer to the band, but once you\u2019ve gotten most of the major live releases, this is something that could be looked at for a reasonable price.\n",
        "\nMotorhead\u2019s rather impressive collection of live offerings can be safely assessed as a mixed bag, loaded with differing flavors, and not all of them are necessarily pleasing to the taste buds. Although I\u2019d argue that there are no bad songs on this little collection from 1983, and it is quite refreshing to see a live album that doesn\u2019t have \u201cAce Of Spades\u201d or \u201cNo Class\u201d on it for a change, \u201cKing Biscuit Flower Hour\u201d does come up a bit short in the quality department. Part of it could be blamed on production, particularly the way the guitar and bass are mixed, but the truth is that everyone on here sounds like they\u2019re a little off their game.\n\nRight from the opening of \u201cBack At The Funny Farm\u201d, which is essentially a slightly more methodical rehash of the proto-speed metal work heard on \u201cAce Of Spades\u201d, Brian Robertson\u2019s guitar tone introduces itself in the typical Thin Lizzy vain, ergo just a tad to mellow and lacking in crunch to really cut it in this outfit. Naturally Motorhead is to be noted for its greater blues/rock tendencies than most other bands associated with the development of heavy metal at this juncture, but Robertson\u2019s guitar tone, soloing and general approach to riff interpretation essentially pulls back from the punk tendencies heard on their 79-82 material in favor of something more along the lines of Eric Clapton meets AC/DC, and it comes through doubly so in the live format as opposed to the studio album where most of these songs were drawn. \n\nUltimately this effects the way Lemmy\u2019s bass comes through, particularly on slower, more rock oriented songs such as \u201cI Got Mine\u201d and \u201cMarching Off To War\u201d, both of which didn\u2019t come off quite as mellow on \u201cAnother Perfect Day\u201d as they do here. Pile on top of this the use of a auto-harmonist during some of the solos and some quirky, hippie-like guitar effects here and there, and one is left to wonder whether Lemmy\u2019s sporting bell bottoms and a tie dye t-shirt while pounding out those thick bass lines and shouting into the microphone in his low tone, nicotine roughened growl.\n\nWhether or not someone will like this album has a little bit of bearing on whether he/she likes the Robertson era of the band, and I generally view this time period as among the weaker of their eras, though not necessarily an all out bad time for the band. This performance doesn\u2019t fully do justice to the album that the band was touring on, particularly insofar as capturing the tone of the guitar. There is a little bit of a silver-lining in the Lemmy interview from the mid 90s that was included on here, which features the opinionated front man setting a semi-knowledgeable interviewer straight over and over again. My only gripe about the interview is Lemmy\u2019s defense of Metallica\u2019s \u201cLoad\u201d era, but thankfully this only constitutes a small part of the interchange and usually tends to focus around peoples\u2019 obsession with image rather than the lackluster music that Hetfield and company have continually shelled out since then. This is a good collector\u2019s item for someone, but in terms of a total live album package, there\u2019s definitely better stuff out there.\n",
        "\nBack in the primordial swamps of late 70s punk rock, mid 70s hard rock, and the distant though now somewhat emergent beginnings of heavy metal lay \u201cWhat\u2019s Words Worth\u201d, the earliest of Motorhead\u2019s live offerings, built solely off the collection of songs that the band had built up between their debut, self-titled album and a few b-sides from the accompanying singles from the 1977-78 era. Although it was released in 1983 as a bone thrown to the impressive fan base that the band had built over the 79-83 time span where all of their legendary material is present, it definitely hearkens back to a different time, a time where rock and metal were only differentiated by how muddy the guitar tone was.\n\nMuch like Accept in their earliest days, Motorhead sounds like a completely different band at this point in their history, lacking the flashing speed and riffing majesty that would be ushered in with their 1978 beast of an offering to the pioneering world of speed metal in \u201cOverkill\u201d, and showcasing Lemmy in a much more restrained capacity vocally. All who know the famed bearded front man and most who barely know him can pick out that gravely, shouting tone that has been the band\u2019s staple from the beginning, but here we are only treated to trace doses of it on certain songs. Most of the time, Lemmy seems like he\u2019s content to explore the world of Joey Ramone, where occasional barks are the norm and your vocal range can consist of only 4 or 5 notes. By stark contrast, Kilmeister\u2019s bass playing is obnoxious raunchy, to the point of resembling Steve Harris circa \u201cFear Of The Dark\u201d with power chords banging out even louder than the guitar player.\n\nAs far as the songs go, for those not familiar with the band\u2019s debut, they\u2019re a fun collection of just a little too fast punk rock with a good smattering of earlier rock influences. There are usually 2 or 3 riffs per song, a few trace guitar solos that draw heavily from Chuck Berry and Jimi Hendrix, and a constant upper tempo feel that falls just a tad bit short of where the band would end up a few years later. \u201cCity Kids\u201d and \u201cLeaving Here\u201d are the hardest and fastest rockers to be found on here, and even at this end of the late 70s spectrum we have yet to hit the territory that would be explored on \u201cExciter\u201d, \u201cKill The King\u201d, \u201cWarrior\u201d, and this band\u2019s own offering to the too fast for rock category \u201cOverkill\u201d. Nevertheless, considering the time period, this is pretty hard hitting, if not quite as ahead of its time as the aforementioned speed metal offerings of this band and others would be.\n\nThis doesn\u2019t quite qualify as essential listening for most of Motorhead\u2019s principle fan base, but it is a curious offering, particularly those who might be interested in the roots of the metal genre as a whole, and specifically where the groundwork would be laid for all the faster players from Accept to Metallica. It\u2019s more sloppy and gritty than it is heavy; at times Lemmy sounds light and a tiny bit timid compared to what he\u2019d sound like soon after, but \u201cWhat\u2019s Words Worth\u201d rocks pretty hard and will probably sit well with most rock and early metal fans. It doesn\u2019t quite have the metal sound, but it is definitely on to something insofar as attitude goes, and that is essentially half the battle.\n",
        "\nMotorhead have not had a problem remaining relevant through a long period of time, seeing the rise and fall of every scene from the mid 70s until now, playing basically the same brand of raunchy, ugly, fist pumping rock music with a speed metal edge to it. In the midst of the late 80s craze of either hair metal crowd pleasing or technique driven Bay Area thrash, Lemmy and company took their show on the road yet again and provided the same line of older, stripped down, nasty good times to said generation. The resulting \u201cNo Sleep At All\u201d sees the band in Finland, which would later become a hotbed for all things metal, and essentially at the top of their game, despite the heavy collection of well known songs on their set list.\n\nUnlike \u201cLive At Brixton \u201887\u2019, which essentially had the same set list, the pacing and production quality here is about as good as they come. There were literally patches on said album where you couldn\u2019t find Lemmy\u2019s bass, and sometimes it was difficult to even hear the 2nd guitar, but here the dimensions are perfectly balanced like four clenched knuckles ready to bash a person\u2019s school in. The heaviness quality on \u201cDeaf Forever\u201d is so high, and the arrangement so tight that it rivals anything heard off of Accept\u2019s heaviest studio releases. The performance of \u201cAce Of Spades\u201d on here is actually better than the studio version, with about twice the attitude out of Lemmy\u2019s gritty voice and three times the guitar power out of both Campbell and Wurzel, who pull of a lethal dueling version of the guitar solo that would make Tipton and Downing proud.\n\nBut the most appealing aspect of this album, particularly given the heavy collection of classic fanfare that could and often does end up in the band\u2019s set list to this day, is the freshness of the performance practices. The versions of \u201cOverkill\u201d, \u201cDoctor Rock\u201d and \u201cEat The Rich\u201d are pretty well spiced up with an enthusiastic guitar performance and couple of interesting additives, particularly the passage of chaotic feedback and electronic noise at the end of \u201cOverkill\u201d. Even plainer sounding, rocking songs like \u201cStay Clean\u201d and \u201cTraitor\u201d are so well performed that I end up liking them more on here than I did when they were first committed to recording in the studio.\n\nAlthough there is a rather large collection of worthy pickups in Motorhead\u2019s catalog as it pertains to live releases, this is arguably the best one to get as a representative of the band\u2019s two guitarist era of the mid 80s to early 90s. They didn\u2019t jump on the bandwagon that had started up among band\u2019s they\u2019d influenced in the thrash scene completely, but there is something of a reaction to what was going on there is the way they approach their own format, particularly as it pertains to guitar soloing and hardness.\n",
        "\nMotorhead\u2019s lengthy career has had its fair share of ebbs and flows, although their version of ebbing is a fair bit ahead of what most bands would consider their version of free flowing greatness. The most extreme examples of both ends of the spectrum of greatness to simply cutting it minimally can be found in the band\u2019s impressive collection of live releases, of which \u201cLive At Brixton \u201887\u201d cuts towards the bottom end of the band\u2019s abilities. While none would think to question the live credentials of the almighty Lemmy Kilmeister and his band of outlaws, I find myself in that awkward position for the same reasons that I did for Sabbath\u2019s \u201cLive Evil\u201d.\n\nThis album could be summed up as an average performance of the obligatory classics, coming up short in the raw energy usually expected out of these mainstays. With heavily recognizable classics fit for the live venue such as \u201cEat The Rich\u201d, \u201cDr. Rock\u201d and \u201cBuilt For Speed\u201d, all of them essentially grittier throwbacks to the days of the 70s when some were revisiting the earlier roots of rock music via Muddy Waters, Chuck Berry, and several others, surprises are few and a superior performance becomes essential. Sadly, apart from Lemmy being as viciously hoarse as can be and Phil Campbell essentially pulling out a solid lead guitar slot here and there, things just seem to squeak by without hitting the overdrive button too often.\n\nThe biggest let down on this album, and it could be largely to do with the fact that it\u2019s the original 1994 release of this album, is the less than stellar production. Between the very distant sound of the entire band, and the fact that the bass and guitar almost turn into mush for all the lack of balance between the arrangements that it all comes off like a legitimized bootleg album. There are points in some of the songs where it\u2019s difficult to hear Lemmy\u2019s vocals and even more difficult to hear the bass, particularly on the faster songs like \u201cRock N\u2019 Roll\u201d and \u201cAce Of Spades\u201d where the drums get too loud and only seem to back off when Campbell\u2019s solos chime in.\n\nBarring some radical differences in the production quality on the rerelease that was put out in 2005, this is one of those few skip worthy out of Motorhead. Even with a better production, these songs can be found on other live releases, performed with much more enthusiasm. Completists and other worshipers of all things Lemmy might want to seek this out at discount price, but speaking for myself, I\u2019ve had this for about 2 years and I\u2019ve listened to it a couple times, and each time I\u2019m left wanting for something with more punch, clearer dimensions, and a set of songs that I haven\u2019t heard more than 30 times.\n",
        "\nIn a year which produced such albums as Master of Puppets and Reign of Blood which were carrying metal music into its bold and aggressive future, the 7th studio album from legends Mot\u00f6rhead served as a beloved contrast, a study in the rock and roll fury of the medium's past. From its iconic hellish train cover image, Barbarella inspired title to the steady distorted thrum of Lemmy's bass, it's yet another of the band's myriad classics.\n\n\"Deaf Forever\" makes for a nice lead-in with its steady rocking rhythm, dominating bass and shouting samples. The lyrics are also pretty serious business here as evident in the chorus:\n\n'Sword and shield\nBone and steel\nRictus grin\nDeaf forever to the battles din'\n\n\"Nothing Up My Sleeve\" follows the \"Ace of Spades\" format of fast and fun, shuffling blues metal with big chords below Lemmy's blue collar poetics. \"Ain't My Crime\" rocks the hell out, with a noisy guitar strumming above its chords. \"Claw\" is lowdown, dirty and mean and sexy. He just don't understand the power of the claw! \"Mean Machine\" is perfect Mot\u00f6rhead, raw and powerful metal blues performed like no other band. One of the best tracks on the album. \"Built for Speed\" is a mid-paced tribute to the rock and roll lifestyle. \"Ridin' With the Driver\" delivers a punk edge and \"Doctor Rock\" is a corny classic.\n\nThis is the same song in which Lemmy tells some lucky female inspiration she's got a body like a Marshall Stack. Grrowwrr! The title track \"Orgasmatron\" ends the album with its very simple rhythm and some of Lemmy's most gnarled and brutal vocals ever, despite the lack of many notes in the riffs it's almost hypnotic and another of the band's classics.\n\nThe entire album is slathered in a rotten, dirty production. You feel like you've just strolled into a bar in HELL and Mot\u00f6rhead is the house band. Expect some fightin' and at least one bottle broken over your head. Also expect not to be my friend if you don't like this, poseur!\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\n2004's \"Inferno\" wasn't exactly a mainstream breakthrough but it did seem to give the band a bit of exposure that it hadn't seen in a while. It was the first Motorhead album that I'd ever heard and left me along with many other fans curious to see what the band would follow it up with. Thankfully this 2006 effort manages to provide another batch of material.\n\nWhile \"Inferno\" may be the heaviest album that Motorhead has ever put out, this album seems to have more in common with \"Overkill\" and reflects some particularly bluesy influences. The riffs still kick a good deal of ass and Lemmy's vocals are as excellent as always, but there is a somewhat lazy feel to the band's execution and song structures. This album also features cameos by Poison guitarist CC Deville and Alice In Chains/Ozzy Osbourne bassist Michael Inez, though they're not that noticeable...\n\nThe songs are also pretty diverse for a band that is accused of having written the same album eighteen times. You've got some faster anthems (\"Sucker,\" \"Trigger,\" \"Sword of Glory\"), upbeat rockers (\"One Night Stand,\" \"Devil I Know,\" \"Christine,\" etc.), mid-tempo tracks (\"Under The Gun,\" \"Living In The Past,\" \"Kingdom of the Worm,\" etc.), and a rare acoustic ballad (\"God Was Never On Your Side\"). The latter track definitely stands out for its uniqueness and the sweet vocal performance but there's something to be said for the pummeling \"Sucker,\" the humorous \"One Night Stand,\" and the interestingly sequenced \"Trigger.\"\n\nLyrically, this album covers the same set of Motorhead subjects but it seems to serve as sorts to \"Orgasmatron.\" \"Devil I Know\" and \"Under the Gun\" both make references to \"Claw\" while \"Going Down\" frequently makes mention to a certain \"Dr. Rock.\" That and \"Kingdom Of The Worm\" seems to be one of Lemmy's attempts to rewrite that album's legendary title track...\n\nAll in all, this is a pretty good album though a noticeable step down from the awesomeness that was \"Inferno.\" The band does seem to be on autopilot at times, but the songs are pretty solid and prove that Lemmy and his crew truly can piss excellence...\n\nMy Current Favorites:\n\"Sucker,\" \"One Night Stand,\" \"Trigger,\" \"God Was Never On Your Side,\" and \"Be My Baby\"\n",
        "\nAs with covering \"Snake Bite Love,\" the 1990's material of Motorhead is generally met with mixed reactions from fans. This is understandable, considering Motorhead is a classic band and classic bands are generally best known for the material they did early on, or at least the albums that made them famous. From there, its a slew of notable albums that usually don't get talked about that much. Yet after the rather mediocre \"March or Die,\" anything would have been a nice change of pace, and the shifting back to attitude-driven metal/punk madness in \"Bastards\" is just what the doctor ordered.\n\n\"Bastards\" seems to fire out more unapologetic, straight-forward heavy metal than previous releases, not to mention dropping some of the punk influence to greater emphasize the metal aspect. The opener in \"On Your Feet or On Your Knees\" is a perfect example of this, and a very good peek into what lies in store for the listener. \"Born to Raise Hell\" gets even better, and with a powerful and catchy chorus, is sure to be a barnburner wherever it gets played. \"I'm the Man\" is also a worthy headbanger, more remembrances of the classic Motorhead design. \n\nNow some songs also deviate from the standard Motorhead sound, but are nonetheless good mentions. \"Death and Glory\" is a powerful number, infusing more of the punk influences with the general heavy metal approach found elsewhere on this listen. \"Bad Woman\" is a favorite of mine, which comes with some heaping helpings of Southern influence which makes for an interesting and unique listen on this album. Campbell and Wurzel also spice up things here with some nice solo work, something that is seemingly lacking as a whole on this album.\n\nUnfortunately, not everything is great about \"Bastards,\" despite the good things going for it. \"Don't Let Daddy Kiss Me\" is an acoustic misfire, not to mention being totally out of place in the track listing. \"We Bring the Shake\" isn't that notable, though not necessarily bad, but ultimately a throwaway. In addition to this, as I mentioned in the previous paragraph, the soloing isn't that commendable here. There are a few good ones here and there, but overall not that impressive which is not what I was expecting out of this band and the talent present.\n\n\"Bastards\" isn't an album that Motorhead fans will likely be celebrating, but its still a fine testament to this band's ability to carry on regardless of time frame. Keep in mind that it was 1993, the golden age of the musical wasteland known as grunge and the \"alt\" rock explosion of that era, but by the sounds of Motorhead, you wouldn't guess it. If \"Bastards\" teaches us nothing else, its that even in one of the most trendy eras in music history, when everyone and their mother starting adorning tattered flannel and half-ass musical abilities, Motorhead carried on in reliable fashion. \"Bastards\" isn't an exceptional release, but even compared to some finer Motorhead albums, its definitely a respectable release in an era when piss poor excuses for music were running rampant and out of control.\n",
        "\nIn the world of classic metal (or any genre, for that matter,) its usually safe to say that fans will always stick with the classic albums. Fans of groups like Black Sabbath usually stick to the early to mid 1970's material, looking down on the \"Technical Ecstasy\" and \"Never Say Die\" records and perhaps even cutting off the band after the departure of Dio. In some bands, this is rather acceptable, the most obvious example being Metallica who hasn't managed to pull off a truly remarkable album since 1988. All of this aside, one band whose more recent catalog is wrongly shunned is no doubt Motorhead, a band whose very legacy is one that embodies consistency and quality.\n\nAfter a string of successful releases in the 1980's, it appears that Motorhead slipped a little bit on \"March or Die.\" The albums that followed were met with more or less of a mixed reaction, and probably the album most affected by this is \"Snake Bite Love.\" Now, to say Motorhead have never changed as a band is quite untrue, as this album proves. To these ears, I hear some slabs of their usual metal/punk hybrid with boatloads of attitude, but also going off into some stoner territory on occasion. Of course, Motorhead doesn't run off and join the cult of Kyuss clones, but the influence can still be heard here and there.\n\nIts none too difficult to gather that Motorhead hasn't really changed, despite the sometimes mixed bag of influences present here. \"Love for Sale\" is an excellent reminder of who Motorhead is, with their usual speed metal approach about some erotic lyrical topics that will likely get a smile from several. The title track is similiar in nature, and probably the song that is the most true to this band's classic style. \"Take the Blame,\" \"Don't Lie to Me,\" and \"Desperate for You\" are all tracks that work in the same manner, establishing further that Motorhead have not conformed to any new musical styles. In some other areas, the band injects some blues influence on \"Joy of Labour,\" which something to be heard in the bars. It isn't quite as clich\u00e9d as \"You Better Run\" off \"March or Die,\" and is more enjoyable altogether. \"Dogs of War\" is a little more complex, but nothing very noteworthy as a whole. \n\nNow the controversy surrounding this album is generally that the songs aren't as strong as classic Motorhead. Well, no, they aren't considering \"Ace of Spades\" was 18 years prior to this, a rather long time to be competing with one or two albums. Also, there are a number of skippable to downright silly tracks on this record. \"Assassin\" is a perfect example of this, which includes some tribal sounding sections in the mix which sounds a little too close to the tribal tendencies of mallcore acts of the time. \"Dead and Gone\" is half balladic, half usual Motorhead that isn't all that interesting. They did a much better halfway country tune on \"Whorehouse Blues\" a few years later. \"Night Side\" is probably the worst offender of these, whose musical composition sounds decent enough but is ruined by that silly chorus. I realize with a band like Motorhead that a few gimmicks might occur here and there, but that song is a little hard to stomach, not to mention a complete throwaway.\n\nConsidering Motorhead's entire catalog, this one might actually rank as their lowest. Its still rather noteworthy, as it contains some good songs but there is alot of unmemorable and goofy things going on here. The late 90's were a terrible time for heavy music, so the fact that \"Snake Bite Love\" manages to eek out over most everything else of the time is saying something. However, its still a decent record for what it is and certainly something the average Motorhead diehard might be interested in seeking. I wouldn't plan on paying alot for it, however, as it doesn't contain enough quality material to warrant a brand new price tag.\n",
        "\nSome of my earliest experiences with metal came from a cassette version of \"Bomber,\" which I particularly liked very well growing up. As time as moved on, my love for this album and the band that brought it into being has not softened, though I have branched out into other genres of the metal universe. \nIt comes odd to me that an album like \"Bomber,\" when propped up next to \"Overkill\" and \"Ace of Spades\" in the trilogy of \"classic\" Motorhead, this album always takes last place. Reasons for this are strange to me, especially after hearing both of the supposed superior efforts.\n\nThe only reason that I can gather from hearing these three albums for a good number of years now is its because \"Overkill\" and \"Ace of Spades\" are generally better known. The title tracks to those albums are better known than the title track in \"Bomber,\" not to mention the song \"Ace of Spades\" is THE calling card of this band. Rightfully so, as its a timeless speed metal track (a term Lemmy despises, preferring to be known as a rock 'n roll band with attitude.) In reality, taking these three albums as a whole, its impossible to pick a bad one of the three as they're all great listens but \"Bomber\" always pulls itself ahead of the game. It achieves this by remaining consistent (as opposed to \"Overkill,\" which had a disrupted flow at times) but its songs have individualistic character (exactly where \"Ace of Spades\" went wrong.) At the end of the listen, you can recall these ten songs and you don't feel the need to replay it to make sure you caught everything. Easily digested gritty biker bar rock, exactly what Motorhead excelled in on this album.\n\nYou kick this album off in a great way, with the Motorhead classic \"Dead Men Tell No Tales\" and it never lets up from there. It runs through a series of different but similiar styles like the kicked back bluesy middle finger to authority on \"Lawman\" or the speed metal style of \"Sharpshooter.\" This continues on \"All the Aces\" and the incredible \"Stone Dead Forever.\" If Motorhead could do anything right at this point in their career, it was an early draft of speed metal. We top everything off with the title track as the closer, which is definitely one of the best songs here alongside \"Stone Dead Forever\" and \"Dead Men Tell No Tales.\" The only song I thought wasn't as good as the others is \"Step Down,\" with \"Fast\" Eddie Clarke performing on the vocal front. Its not that its a bad song, other than the voice thats leading the way, everything else works just the same as anything else on this album.\n\nAny fan of Motorhead is certainly encouraged to seek this out. Don't let the general opinion lead you astray, this album's title track might be a hair below \"Overkill\" or \"Ace of Spades,\" but taking the entire album for a spin gives way to realization. Realization in that \"Bomber\" successfully pulled off being a more consistent album but giving each song characteristic. It remains one of my absolute favorite Motorhead albums and ranks in my top 10 favorite albums. The best thing for you to do is to check it out for yourself and see exactly what I mean. This is the sort of thing to be present in the jukebox of all smoke layered pool halls after nine o' clock.\n",
        "\nDoes a Mot\u00f6rhead album even require a review anymore? Isn't this a band above and beyond the criticism of mortals? I mean, this is a band whose legacy is just as reliable as any religion on earth. Maybe for some this band IS a religion. The religion of REAL heavy fucking metal, without any regard for trends or any sort of acceptance. The band does what it does, and survives entirely on the merits of that. Mot\u00f6rizer is no exception to the rule. No exception to their rule. The Iron Fist is 20 studio albums deep with this, and there is no sign of slowing or pissing off.\n\nThank fuck.\n\nLemmy and crew lay down the dirty from the very opening grit of the \"Runaround Man\". Then, in true tradition, you get the mid-paced, total fucking rock out \"Teach You How to Sing the Blues\" that makes beer bottles go flying through the air to smash into the nearest hard surface, whether that's a street, a wall, or a person's head. It's all fair in love and war.\n\n'Can you still get it up,\nOr are we pushing too hard,\nIf you wanna get your hands on a beautiful girl,\nYou gotta use a Mastercard.'\n\nI mean, seriously, that's awesome. These guys aren't fools, they've seen a lot over the years. They are old men, and they know it. It doesn't stop the \"Rock Out\", with its \"Ace of Spades\" vibe. The bad ass blues of \"One Short Life\". Or the total kick ass \"English Rose\". Ladies and bangers, money can still buy you happiness, and that usually comes in the form of a Mot\u00f6rhead record. Don't miss out.\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nHow do you follow an album as career defining as 1991's awesome \"1916\"? While that album did feel a bit Americanised and commercial in places, it was so colourful and a complete delight to listen to. The songwriting was top notch, and the band were really on top form with that album. 1992's follow up, \"March Or Die\" in the main, sounds less Americanised than \"1916\". Even though for the most part, the mainstream sound remained. However, it still sounds very much like Motorhead, and still features many cuts of classic rock n' roll delivered in the way only Motorhead can!\n\nOpener \"Stand\" is great anthemic song, with a very catchy vocal refrain in the verses, and an awesome solo. The main riff reminds me a bit of Overkill's \"Hello From The Gutter\", and the whole song kicks the album off to a great start. The second song, is a cover. Ted Nugent's \"Cat Scratch Fever\". I've never been a fan of bands putting covers on their studio albums, and this one doesnt subvert that trend. It's not a great song anyway, and Motorhead just seem to be going through the motions with it. Having it so early on in the album also isnt a good sign. This track should definitely have been left for a b side or something. A mistake, to put it politely. Thankfully, \"Bad Religion\" helps get things back on track. This is a fantastic track, pure rock n' roll, complete with a fist pumping section that would surely get the crowd going if it was played in concert. \"Jack The Ripper\" is a monstrous track, and the best on here. The main riff is a sinister swagger, which perfectly accompanies the chilling lyrics. Which comes as a refreshing change from the booze, women and rock n' roll that is usually the trademark for Motorhead lyrics. There is also some great pounding drumming here from session drummer Tommy Aldridge. The chaotic first solo is great, and the slow breakdown adds even more menace to the song. This is definitely one of the band's best ever, and should have become a setlist staple. Rock n' roll is known for its upbeat sound, but the dark images conjured up by this track makes it sound creepy and evil instead. The ending fade out of a distorted voice saying \"Jacky\" just adds a final sinister touch to an amazing song. Its a shame Motorhead didn't make more songs like this as it shows a different side to them, and gives them and even meaner edge than they already had. \n\n2 of the songs on this album have a connection to Ozzy Osbourne. \"I Ain't No Nice Guy\", and \"Hellraiser\". The former is a ballad where Ozzy duets with Lemmy. This is actually a great ballad, with a piano adding to the feeling. The lyrics, and almost \"down and out\", back alley sound gives it a very Motorhead feel, despite being a ballad. It also features a guitar solo by Slash. I love this song a lot, definitely another highlight of this album. The latter of the Ozzy connected songs does not feature his vocals, but it was on his \"No More Tears\" album. However, seeing as Lemmy co-wrote this song, it's not really a cover. Motorhead's version is more stripped down than Ozzy's, though it still has a very Americanised sound. However, the chorus remains a huge anthem to the rock lifestyle, and it is a great song for Motorhead, just as it was Ozzy. \n\n\"Asylum Choir\" is more standard Motorhead fair, than the previous 2 songs. The melodic chorus brings to mind the experimental \"Another Perfect Day\" album. The solo on this one is great, and elevates the song from being merely \"good\". Another top track! \"Too Good To Be True\" is a return to the lighter edged rock n' roll that featured on parts of \"1916\". This is a very sombre tune, with Lemmy showing his emotional side which he rarely does. This is an amazing song, the fact it reminds of the previous album is a definite plus. Some might not like the lighter side of Motorhead, but if like me, you love it, then this song will be a favourite. Sadly, the album takes a dip with \"You Better Run\". Its not really a bad song, but it uses THAT bluesy rock riff which has been played to death by countless bands, including Motorhead themselves! Forgettable. \"Name In Vain\" is another return to the \"1916\" sound, but this time, to the heavier rock edge of that album's sound, unlike \"Too Good To Be True\". Anyone who likes Motorhead should like this song. Classic ass kicking rock n' roll done by the masters! The closing title track is really just a spoken word rant by Lemmy, over a sparse musical backing. With a constant \"death march-like\" drum beat. It's more like a dark outro for the album than an actual song. And in that respect, it works well.\n\nTo sum up, this is one of Motorhead's most awkward albums, (and underrated) but also one of the most rewarding. A couple of poor track choices really hurt this album for me, and is what is preventing me from awarding this album a 90+ rating. There is a lack of speed on the album, which some fans might not like, but by and large, I think the album works. And what it does, it does well. It is a slight step down from \"1916\", but there's no shame in that! Overall, I would definitely recommend this album to any Motorhead fan, or anyone who just loves good ol' heavy rock n' roll.\n\nBuy or die!\n",
        "\nAll readers of this review will I'm sure accept that Lemmy is the one true King of all that is rock n' roll and so not require me to sell his virtues, but just to do so anyway, here again is the King with his long-time backers Phil Campbell and Mikkey Dee on what is now the 20th studio album of the quintessential Mot\u00f6rhead. Quite understandably for a band as experienced as Mot\u00f6rhead, their form has come and gone since 1977's self-titled debut LP but the last few releases have seen a renaissance of the band if such a thing can be said, resulting in yet another hard-rocking belter in \"Mot\u00f6rizer\" that belies Mr. Kilmister's 63 years (!) and adds another reason for their God-like status.\n\nJust consider the fact that in tunes like the body-shaking \"English Rose\", the down'n'out punk/speed metal of \"Rock Out\" and the sleaze of \"Runaround Man\", Mot\u00f6rhead have penned more fantastic anthems of rock whilst having barely altered from the rigid formula perfected in over 30 years of music-making is a huge achievement. In a world where countless styles have come and gone in such a time to have one band steadfastly walking their own path and ignoring everything else is an astounding testament to Mot\u00f6rhead and is the main reason why \"Mot\u00f6rizer\" rocks harder than anything released today by guys a third of Lemmy's age. Little differs in the make-up of \"Mot\u00f6rizer\" against albums such as \"Ace Of Spades\" where the same gravel-throated Lemmy curdles out his tales of rock, love and personal pride except for a sharper tone from Campbell's guitar that serves to add extra grit and spite to \"Heroes\" and \"Teach You How To Sing The Blues\". Drummer Mikkey Dee, perhaps less influential in the momentum of the band these days than Phil \"Philthy Animal\" Taylor of the classic Mot\u00f6rhead period, is however so solid that one barely notices him pummeling away in the background, providing the backbone upon which Campbell and Kilmister's riffs clatter along.\n\nBy virtue of their recording in a distant era, the likes of \"Ace Of Spades\" and \"Killed By Death\" will never be equaled, leaving Mot\u00f6rhead to carry on penning an album of tunes in the name of \"Mot\u00f6rizer\" that possess more than enough strength to hold their own against such rock landmarks. There is no need for a scrupulous study on the finer points of any Mot\u00f6rhead record but rest assured that if you are reading this as a diehard Mot\u00f6rfreak or a convert-in-waiting, there is no way you will be let down by \"Mot\u00f6rizer\". Long live the King. \n\nOriginally written for Rockfreaks.net\n",
        "\nMotorhead enters the 1990s, and releases what was to hold up as, arguably, their best work for the whole decade. Very impressive, as Motorhead at their worst still makes Judas Priest sound like Stryper.\n\nRock \u2018n roll attitude is embodied without a wasted note or breath. Sadness (and other powerful emotions that testosterone buries deep within most mens\u2019 out of shape figures) is displayed in not too many and not too few songs tremendously and with little to no cheese. Punk is heard both evenly throughout the album as well as overtly on the obvious track. Thrash and speed metal elements are strong, and puts bands of those genres absolutely to shame. Doom and gloom is bookended by catchy, energetic tracks, yet nothing is out of place. The production is crisp and clean (as far as Motorhead goes I mean), but in no way soft or weak. Everything is surely unique to the band (which puts them out of the simple dimensions of their genre) and continues their legacy. If they hadn\u2019t already done everything by the legendary Ace of Spades, this would be a major evolutionary step; a testament to Motorhead\u2019s sheer genius.\n\nThat\u2019s 1916 in a nutshell. If I had to explain to someone how incredibly awesome Motorhead is any more, I\u2019d end up pontificating like a lunatic. But, it\u2019s true! They\u2019re amazing. This was released 18 years ago as of this time of writing, and while its style is rooted in the \u201870s and even earlier than that, it still holds up. In fact, for albums over 10 years old, this might be Motorhead\u2019s album that holds up best.\n\nMake My Day is probably my favourite track on here. The lyrics are great, it sounds spontaneous every time I listen to it, and the riffs... shit. Just listen to it. Remember the first time you listened to something like Holy Wars or Raining Blood? The riffs were lightning-fast and heavy but still got stuck in your head, prompting you replay it as soon as it was over. If you don\u2019t fall into that category, I... I don\u2019t know. As mentioned by another reviewer, this is a lost classic. I mean, every Motorhead song is good, but this is special even to them. I don\u2019t think you can find this one on a live album, unfortunately.\n\nOf course there\u2019s the title track, which is of course at unlike anything they\u2019ve ever done. I don\u2019t care what great vocalists in metal and rock you can name, Lemmy is right up there as far as having soul in what\u2019s sung. I can\u2019t name many songs sadder than this. For me, the contrast between this and the rest of the album kind of enhances everything; you go through a great little journey, and it ends in tragic sadness. Oh, man.\n\nFor new Motorhead listeners this would ideally be the fifth or sixth album you have to listen to, and by the time you\u2019re a fanatic this will probably be the one you\u2019ll perhaps notice isn\u2019t in as constant rotation as others, but very well may shine brightest and be saved for special occasions.\n",
        "\n\u201cAce of Spades\u201d is not your usual approach to creating heavy metal music. What Lemmy does here is crank up a bunch of modestly composed Little Richard songs to full gear. He gives them distorted guitars, wailing solos, gruff vocals, and a biker attitude that couple with some of the most sexually promiscuous and boozing lyrics you can imagine.\n\nWhen the title track opens the album, you are immediately sucked into the galloping speed metal riffs. This song is dirty but catchy, and it\u2019s no wonder that it\u2019s remembered today as a rock classic. Motorhead got lucky with the breakthrough success of this song, and it\u2019s no surprise that the others stayed only within the grasp of real metalheads (and punks). Songs like \u201cJailbait\u201d are sleazy and in bad taste, but Motorhead are intended to be an advanced case of halitosis; that\u2019s their purpose. They are the filthy scoundrels of hard rock and roll, and downright proud of it.\n\nThe faults of this album are rather apparent, though. There is little variety; there are no ballads, no instrumentals, or any sort of variation in songwriting. They are verse-chorus numbers that are not as aggressive as they could be. It seems that bands like Venom needed to kick Motorhead up a notch, because Lemmy and the guys are at their best during the real speed metallers like \u201cThe Hammer.\u201d If every song were like this, or even like \u201cWe are the Road Crew,\u201d this album would be a masterpiece. Unfortunately, while punkish speed metal may be my favorite style of music, it\u2019s one of the most difficult to compose in because things get monotonous fast. There are very few classic full-lengths to be found in this niche style, and Ace of Spades isn\u2019t quite a classic either. Well, the song is, just not the album.\n\nIf you don\u2019t know what Motorhead sound like, get out from under your rock and listen to Ace of Spades. Or, if you\u2019re curious about what Lemmy\u2019s voice sounds like, you can just record a running chainsaw and put it down in a pitch shifter. Seriously though, he has quite the gravely voice and it comes to him all too naturally.\n\nMy conclusion is that this is a bit too light for my tastes in speed metal, but when it\u2019s at its speediest it is indeed something to bang your head for.\n",
        "\nCertainly one of the band\u2019s defining moments, Overkill marks when Lemmy Kilminster stepped out of the shadow of the good ship Hawkwind into a rock \u2019n\u2019 roll legend of his own. Gone is the confused and poorly produced scrabble of the debut, gone are the days of the Nm-fucking-E having the gall to label them bad, and gone is any doubt that this isn\u2019t the greatest the real beginning of the world\u2019s greatest rock \u2019n\u2019 roll band (Rolling what?). \n\nMake no mistake about it, folks, this isn\u2019t the screaming, blazing heavy metal juggernaut you wanted; it\u2019s still a bluesy rock \u2019n\u2019 roll record at heart, from well back in the day when I was naught but a twinkle in my father\u2019s eye. It\u2019s a time when wearing a leather jacket meant you had all three MC5 records and you, rightfully so, fucking loved them. Honestly, as much as Overkill marks a rather sizable step forward for rock music in a lot of respects (read: intensity) it\u2019s still got a lot of the past hammered into its grooves*. I hear touches of Eric Clapton\u2019s playing in Eddie\u2019s style here; it\u2019s got a lot of that old slow-hand feel, and unlike your Blackmores, Roths, Downings and Tiptons he\u2019s got absolutely no classical influence to his playing. It\u2019s no wonder everyone has such a difficult time trying to pigeonhole Mot\u00f6rhead. Is it rock \u2019n\u2019 roll? Is it heavy metal? Do large carnivorous vegetables make it? All of the above? \n\nWell, I don\u2019t have the answers, do I? We\u2019d probably just be better off in saying this shares more common ground with Damned Damned Damned and Blood Brothers than it does Stained Class and leave it at that. All we can truly be certain of in our studies of the almighty \u2018head is that it\u2019s the coolest thing you\u2019ve ever heard in both qualitative and quantitative terms. The evidence is right in front of you, and it\u2019s called \u2018Stay Clean\u2019: the evergreen second track in the band\u2019s set and coincidently this album. \u2018Stay Clean\u2019 is not an anti-drug hymn, it\u2019s not about finding salvation through Jesus and abstinence, in fact it\u2019s about how the humble rock \u2019n\u2019 roller \u2013 every WI mother\u2019s worst nightmare \u2013 occupies a higher moral ground than the politician and the preacher. I know, difficult to believe, right? But yes, there\u2019s certainly something cool here we\u2019re talking Italian American jumps shark levels of cool here: the way Lemmy ends almost every line by inhaling very audibly, the simple dynamic alteration between wah pedal on and wah pedal off, and the song\u2019s absolute climax in which the searing bass overtakes Eddie\u2019s guitar and burns so bright with that simple melodic solo that\u2019s effortlessly memorable. It\u2019s over in just less than three minutes, but then again so are a lot of things, Jane Austen\u2019s Northanger Abbey, for instance. \n\nI know what you\u2019re thinking; you\u2019re going to complain about the lack variation, subtle nuances and shifting textures, right? C\u2019mon now, this is Mot\u00f6rhead and it\u2019s all about those things! No, really. \u2018I\u2019ll Be Your Sister\u2019 is something very unusual for the band; it has a good-time feel to it that\u2019s certainly nothing too special for the band. It\u2019s a strangely feminine song, just read the lyrics \u2013 it may well be played at the same volume as the rest of the album but it\u2019s such an oddity in the Mot\u00f6rhead canon. Apparently people need variation spelt out in a very obvious rocker/ballad format with MASSIVE CAPITAL LETTERS or they completely miss it. Honestly, next time you think Mot\u00f6rhead think subtle variation\u2026 maybe it\u2019ll get through. But then that\u2019s the problem with your favourite bands, right? When other people listen to them they have the habit of getting it wrong and you have to go \u201cYou\u2019re doing it wrong!\u201d whilst screwing your face up like a small child who\u2019s just fell off his bike.\n\u2018Capricorn\u2019 is another one of the band\u2019s strangest numbers; all mystical, astrological and spacey. It\u2019s another one of Lemmy\u2019s \u201cI\u2019m this, I act like this and you\u2019re fucking against me\u201d songs. He does them well. Mot\u00f6rhead really shed off most of this experimentation after a couple of ill-fated moments on Bomber (though they certainly reared their head in rather striking form on Another Perfect Day). Maybe it\u2019s because passing Mot\u00f6rhead fans only really listen to Ace of Spades, which is one of the band\u2019s more straight-ahead records, that they miss out on this weird side. But anyway, a great song, one of many; personally, I wish they\u2019d put it back in the set, it would be cool to hear fucking 63 year old Lemmy singing \u2018but they could never last this long!\u2019 He wrote that in 1979, he\u2019d been in the business for well over ten years by then \u2013 I guess he\u2019s in some sort of a phase\u2026 he\u2019ll surely grow out of it. \n\nThen, of course, you get the title track. This song makes me really happy. Honestly, I don\u2019t think I could be any happier than this. The only person in the world happier than me when this song\u2019s playing would be \u2013 hypothetically, at least \u2013 your standard \u201cINGURLAND\u201d football hooligan if he were given a lifetime supply of the Daily Star and shite lager. But in addition to this the said hooligan would be given a solution to the \u2018immigration problem\u2019, all his feral children would be taken into care by the RSPCA, and Jade Goody would be his own personal guardian angel. I\u2019m that happy when this song is playing. Not just happy, but full-on dribble on myself happy. You could put it in layman\u2019s terms and explain how false endings are fantastic and continuous double bass was certainly very exciting back in 1979, but you wouldn\u2019t really be doing it any justice. Honestly, if there\u2019s a song that sums up what rock music\u2019s all about it\u2019s been hiding itself pretty well. \n\nWhat more could you possibly ask for? Another apologetic score-settling fanboy review, perchance? Well, to round up all the odds and sods: this is the first truly classic Mot\u00f6rhead record \u2013 it\u2019s still a very bluesy animal, but you know there are only some many notes, and this album features a lot of blue ones. You could learn to love this or work around it, do so or you\u2019re probably listening to the wrong style of music. Again. \n\n* I\u2019m not talking about the cover of \u2018Louie Louie\u2019 here, although I do love that song. I guess I\u2019d have to with the amount of gigs I\u2019ve played that end in a 15 minute \u2018Louie Louie\u2019/ \u2018Wild Thing\u2019 medley. Again, it\u2019s all about subtle variation.\n",
        "\nAs one of the most celebrated and long-lasting metal bands around, Motorhead has an extensive discography. Not counting the unofficial first album and the eccentric Another Perfect Day, there are primarily three eras ofMotorhead: the '76-'82 Eddie Clarke era, the '84-'95 W\u00fcrzel/Phil Campbell era and the '95-current day solo Phil Campbell era. Most tend to associate the Clarke era as \"classic Motorhead\" due to albums such as Ace of Spades, who's title track may be the most well-known Motorhead song there is, and Overkill. All of the albums are well-regarded metal classics to most while some involving Campbell can be be a bit hit or miss though Clarke's 6 year tenure is short compared to his (sort of) successor's 25 year long stint. Iron Fist is the end of Clarke's time in the band and he'd depart soon not doing much of note afterwards. While Iron Fist is regarded as one of the weaker albums of the Clarke period, I still find it to be very good.\n\nBearing a lot of similarity to it's predecessor two years earlier, it's typical Motorhead rock 'n rollish metal. Lemmy rumbles along on his bass and spits out lyrics on various subjects with his usual rasp. Eddie blazes on his guitar with bluesy solos and leads while Phil accompanies Lemmy on rhythm and pounds his drums into the ground. Production-wise, the album is clean and clear, a much better job than the following album with Robbo, but the guitar is a bit thin compared to earlier records. Not to say it vanishes like on Orgasmatron, but a crunchier sound probably would have helped it retain a fonder memory in fan's heads. The songwriting is similar in approach to Ace of Spades, but I feel is better done. I never could get into that album for reasons beyond me. It's enjoyable, but I'd much rather listen to almost any other Motorhead album released before or after. Iron Fist improves almost in all areas and is a much more enjoyable ride.\n",
        "\nOn Parole is the first Motorhead album ever to be recorded, though if you\u2019ve been paying attention, you\u2019ll notice that it was not the first to be released (it came something like fourth). This is because the record labels rejected it, resulting in the tracklist getting re-tooled and many of the songs re-recorded for the eponymous Motorhead, the band\u2019s first official album. After getting picked up by a label and gaining a little notoriety with albums like Overkill, the label decides to release On Parole anyway to cash in on the band\u2019s success. \n\nBut there\u2019s a reason the labels hadn\u2019t released the album from the get go: it\u2019s pretty rough. Having recently been ousted from space rock pioneers Hawkwind, Lemmy Kilmister\u2019s new outfit sounds exactly like what you\u2019d think the drunken-70\u2019s-psych-rock-reject-turned-power-trio-leader would offer. There\u2019s a heavy blues sound on many tracks, particularly \u201cIron Horse/Born to Lose,\u201d but there\u2019s also traces of Pink Floyd in some of the sonic experimentation and the vocal harmonies. There\u2019s also a little proto-punk with the raucous \u201cMotorhead\u201d and the hilarious \u201cVibrator.\u201d Lemmy\u2019s vocals are the cleanest I\u2019ve ever heard them on this album and original guitarist Larry Wallis has a different style of playing that fans might grow fond of. The roughness occurs in the stripped-down production which differs greatly from the sleazy sound they\u2019d pioneer with Bomber and Ace of Spades. It\u2019s likeable though: it\u2019s the most 70\u2019s-sounding Motorhead album (\u201cFools\u201d is a prime example). Those of us that dig that sound should be able to find value in On Parole, with the only real annoyance being the overabundance of weird studio gimmickry that the band employs, such as the end thing of \u201cCity Kids\u201d and some of the weird shit near the end of \u201cThe Watcher.\u201d Probably sounded great when the band was wasted in the recording studio, but the end result is one of confusion: what the hell were they thinking?\n\nMy opinion might be a bit biased, as I\u2019ve spent a lot of time listening to this album on the road, but I believe the strength of the songs justifies this release. Okay, so most of them appear on their debut and the sound isn\u2019t the ideal for Motorhead, but come on, v-v-v-v-v-v-vibrator, man! The old versions are just as cool as the later ones; in fact, there are plenty of differences in the arrangements, melodies, and solos for those that have already played through the Motorhead album a bunch of times. And there is a pair of exclusive tracks (might be covers, I\u2019m not sure) for On Parole. Worth checking out, at the least.\n",
        "\nFeaturing Brian Robertson of Thin Lizzy fame, and mind you I like Thin Lizzy, this album is very different from any other Motorhead album. It's much softer and melody driven than anything I've heard from Motorhead, while this works on some tracks, it sounds very out of place on others.\n\nWith Phil Lynott's emotional delivery and poetic songwriting, Robbo's idea of rock based on sweet melodies worked well, but Lemmy has a different kind of emotion to his voice, and a different ideology behind his band, one of \"Turn it up loud and smash everything\". Being the ultimate pub band, Motorhead rock hard, everyone in the band putting 110% of their energy together through the song, let the guitar man rip out some blazing biker solo once in a while, and keep going. There's rarely space in a Motorhead song for massive lead breaks and \"Raise your lighters\" anthemic melodies, sticking those just for the sake of it only brings down the intensity which makes Motorhead what they are.\n\nAnyways, on to the songs. Back at the Funny Farm is the first one, and it is one of the songs which work rather well here, it has a nice and catchy melody and sounds just like that, Thin Lizzy's driving melodies with Motorhead's energy, very nice. Shine is another one of that style, only a bit weaker, it also sounds very vintage rock n roll for some reason.\n\nDancing on Your Grave is where the clash of styles is the most problematic to my ears, it is driven by a very sugary-poppy melody which sounds like it could of been on a Poison song. This doesn't sound good at all, especially with Lemmy singing over it. One of the few Motorhead songs I can't listen to.\n\nOne Track Mind also suffers from the problem of an overly sappy lead melody, it's also too damn long. Yeah, Robbo wanks a lot on this one, but that doesn't justify dragging it on for 6 minutes with that uninspired chorus, neither does it save it from being sleep inducingly boring. Motorhead's longer songs usually rely on some fast part somewhere that comes out of nowhere and kicks you just when you've been nodding off, here they tried to make it work by sticking some massive solo, and it doesn't work. Motorhead should not be sleeping music!\n\nI Got Mine is one of the better results of the experimentation on this album. It starts off very poppy and melodic, and just as you're about to say fuck off and skip it turns cool and mean. It keeps on alternating between the poppy part and the heavy part just so the poppy part gets its hooks in you, but the song altogether doesn't come off as too poppy. Interesting, although a bit overlong.\n\nTales of Glory - typical speedy Motorhead. This song is actually not that notable, but these are the type of songs that should of been on the album, blunt, powerful and undeniably Motorhead, with a little touch of melody and some noodling from Robbo. Die You Bastard is similar, only the melodies on the chorus sound a little awkward.\n\nRecommended tracks : Back at the Funny Farm, Shine, I Got Mine.\n\nAverage release, lots of failed experiments.\n",
        "\nThe institution that is Mot\u00f6rhead is one that never fails to please. They're the Old Faithful of Heavy Metal, never releasing anything sub-par and never faltering in their one-track minded formula to deliver some of the best Rock music on this whole fucking planet. Lemmy has gone through three decades of his craft, and he has perfected it to a fine sheen, having gone through several dozens of band members and experiments to figure out what worked for him. While the exact number of this new album in their discography is unknown (experts are currently sifting their way through the catacombs of the Temple of Mot\u00f6rhead, avidly searching for it), any hesitant listeners can be assured that Lemmy and his Mot\u00f6rhead crew have delivered another winner with their tried-and-true formula on Mot\u00f6rizer.\n\nLike every Mot\u00f6rhead album, Mot\u00f6rizer features a different mood and attitude than the last one. The attitude is always present and obtuse in its carefree, blunt nature, but it takes on new forms with each album. I missed the previous album Kiss of Death, but Mot\u00f6rizer is a more catchy, upbeat affair marked by a pummeling, cut-throat guitar tone, a heavy, hooky batch of riffs, and the catchiest bunch of choruses on this side of Tinnitus Sanctus. People will tell you that this is too simple and too straightforward, but the songwriting here is actually spot-on. There is, after all, an art to simplicity, as well, and how can anyone not love songs like \"English Rose,\" \"Runaround Man,\" \"The Thousand Names of God\" or \"Back on the Chain\" after hearing Lemmy's unforgettable charismatic tone meshing in with the grooving, gritty riffage and rock-solid back beats? It's pure magic, and extremely refreshing in its familiarity, at that.\n\nThis is just balls-out, no-frills rock music the way it was meant to be played, and Lemmy never stops delivering throughout the album's entire 40 minute duration. There aren't really any darker or moodier tunes here, with every song generally sticking to a more uplifting and happy sort of tone that I just dig. We need more music like this these days, and less of Opeth, Biomechanical and Human Fortress. Mot\u00f6rizer is a feel-good album for the ages, boasting commendable power and a set of eleven solid, wickedly good tunes that you won't be able to get out of your head any time soon. May Mot\u00f6rhead live long and keep rocking all the way. Definitely one of my favorite albums of 2008.\n\nOriginally written for http://www.metalcrypt.com\n",
        "\nAh, \u2018Another Perfect Day\u2019 you odd and glimmering beast, Mot\u00f6rhead\u2019s strangest and most unique album. \u2018Another Perfect Day\u2019 has all the drunken fury of Mot\u00f6rhead with a glowing melodic twist, complete with all sorts of shiny melodic twiddling from Robbo, \u2018Another Perfect Day\u2019 bursts forth with a vitality and vigour that was often missing in \u2018Iron Fist\u2019. Misunderstood and oft neglected, it was the ugly duckling of \u2018head albums. The critics deemed it a \u201cfinal nail in Mot\u00f6rhead\u2019s coffin\u201d and Robbo proceeded to act like a complete cunt on the following tour\u2026 but to the knowing, it\u2019s one of the highpoints of their career. \n\nOne thing I must stress about \u2018Another Perfect Day\u2019 is that it has lots and lots of guitar solos. Each of them is absolutely phenomenal and despite their length and frequency they never outstay their welcome. It\u2019s the musical equivalent of Mr. Creosote, Robbo leaves you absolutely stuffed\u2026 it\u2019s the famed Mot\u00f6rhead overkill albeit in a different way.\n\n\u201cAnd finally, monsieur, a wafer-thin solo\u201d.\n\n\u201cNo, fuck-off I\u2019m full\u201d.\n\nThat\u2019s the effect \u2018Another Perfect Day\u2019 has on some. One of humanities many quirks, I can\u2019t really understand why anyone wouldn\u2019t want Robbo flailing away on every album is beyond me. This isn\u2019t a faceless Iced Earth lead guitarist hammering up and down his scales on a death metal album, this is Brian Fucking Robertson, and his guitar is a weapon. Actually putting just how great he is on this album is difficult, I simply find myself uttering phrases such as \u201cvaguely chorused melodic flail of psychedelic wisdom\u201d, \u201ccanyon wide vibrato\u201d, \u201cwhiskey drenched impending sonic hard-on\u201d and generally dwelling on the sad fact that Robbo cut his lovely curly hair\u2026 but it seems he was no Samson. As a Lizzy fan I appreciate this album on another level too, it\u2019s Robbo\u2019s \u2018Bad Reputation\u2019 in which he gets to prove that he can go solo by, ahem, soloing (though Robbo did contribute some guitar to the aforementioned Lizzy album, see \u2018Opium Trail\u2019 for another blazing solo, you know you want to!) \n\n\u2018Another Perfect Day\u2019 sees Mot\u00f6rhead branching out into more melodic territory and in stunning fashion too. The title track is a weirdly beautiful song, with an almost delicate guitar intro. Using my acute sense of listening I can get a really strong ZZ Top vibe here. That opening strange guitar tone? Go listen to \u2018Deg\u00fcello\u2019 to see where they nicked it from. But better still is that Robbo actually outdoes Billy Gibbons with his slow burning bluesy solos. Lemmy\u2019s lyrics are absolutely phenomenal, but that really isn\u2019t much of a surprise given it\u2019s Lemmy of a certain vintage. But still it\u2019s one of his best sets ever, really giving a certain booze-soaked beauty to the whole thing. A unique Mot\u00f6rhead song and something special on a very special album. This is one of the things that persistently pisses me off about Mot\u00f6rhead, when a clueless prick and possible Opeth fan says \u201cMot\u00f6rhead? It all sounds the same to me\u201d. By God, listen to this song and then say \u2018Orgasmatron\u2019 and tell me it\u2019s all the same. Don\u2019t make me beat you with the CD case. \n\nIt\u2019s perhaps the fantastic Joe Pentagno artwork that exemplifies the stylistic change on \u2018Another Perfect Day\u2019 best; it\u2019s the same beast just more colourful. A song like \u2018Back at the Funny Farm\u2019 shows this wonderfully, it\u2019s a Mot\u00f6rhead rocker \u2013 tried and true \u2013 but the execution is somewhat different. Surely you can guess something different is going on when we get that little guitar twiddle before the well-worn opening bass salvo. I suppose in a way \u2018Back at the Funny Farm\u2019 harkens back to Lemmy\u2019s Hawkwind days *make sure to insert witty daze joke for final review* it\u2019s strangely psychedelic and Robbo\u2019s solos take on a Hendrixy vibe, which is fucking excellent. I could actually hum you each of the solos in this song, as they\u2019re all immensely memorable, for the purposes of this review however, I won\u2019t. Again it\u2019s that sublime melodic craft, with a really racy feel that just sucks me in. Robbo really uses effects pedals as an extension of his playing rather than an \u201cI bought a multi-effects pedal, look at it improve my playing!\u201d sort of thing. Guess who else did that? No not, Vim Fuego\u2026Hendrix! That\u2019s right, turns out if you want to capture the actually feeling of a player you have to use your imagination rather than just bash away. Sorry John Mayer, the results are in and you fucking suck. \n\nWhat with my persistent banging-on about the solos you could be forgiven for thinking that \u2018Another Perfect Day\u2019 isn\u2019t a song-centric record, as per usual, you\u2019d be wrong. If anything \u2018Another Perfect Day\u2019 is a more commercially minded Mot\u00f6rhead record than anything that preceded it. \u2018I Got Mine\u2019 exemplifies this perfectly; it\u2019s a strident and melodic number with a gorgeous hooky chorus. It moves forward at a wonderful pace, the key and tempo change give a great sense of dynamics. That\u2019s right, pop song writing it just happens to be very loud pop\u2026 which in an onomatopoeic sense sounds about right. Did someone say nominal solo analysis? Ok, if I must. Robbo pulls out some wonderful honky slide guitar on this one and at 2:30 we get an accent that sounds like a tweeting bird! Ace!\n\nGiven the lighter feel of this record Philthy \u2013 in his last ever truly great performance \u2013 adapts his playing. He doesn\u2019t play as heavily as he did on the previous albums and this lighter touch works fine. Philthy\u2019s performance is still a very energetic one and he\u2019s doing what all great drummers do \u2013 adapting his style to fit the music. Remember how you\u2019re playing together not against one another? \n\nInterestingly enough, there is some other material that is unreleased from this era. I heard a bootleg from Switzerland from the arse-end of the \u2018Iron Fist\u2019 tour in 1982, and it featured another Robbo era track that I can\u2019t remember the name of. It wasn\u2019t up to the standard of the stuff on here but still an interesting listen for the obsessive compulsive Mot\u00f6rhead fan\u2026 I wonder what W\u00fcrzel is doing right now? \n\nA lot of bands with long careers have their bizarre wild-card albums a lot of them are absolute stinkers, Mot\u00f6rhead being Mot\u00f6rhead have a fucking fantastic one. It seems \u2018Another Perfect Day\u2019 is another one of those fan-favourite underdogs that \u201983 seemed to have a lot of. You know, the ones spoken of in the dingiest corner of the dingiest hairy pubs in your town. Certainly don\u2019t hesitate in picking this one up, I did and it was the stupidest fifteen minutes of my life. Honestly, I considered buying a Zakk Wylde era Ozzy album instead! Ha.\n",
        "\nSo this is what the 70s sounded like, at least in the rock'n'roll scene. My first encounter with Mot\u00f6rhead was their later and more well known work, such as Bastards or Ace of Spades a few years ago. Mot\u00f6rhead is apparently a band that needs no introduction, since they have been around longer than most of the people in the heavy metal scene today. Heck, they even could be the grandparents of most of them. On this record, Lemmy was 32 years old, which is a hard thing to imagine anyway. Listening to this album is pretty much like digging up an old time capsule. The content surprises you as much as it baffles you.\n\nBack in the old days, Mot\u00f6rhead played fusion of fast paced punk music and dirty bar rock'n'roll. I'm still trying to imagine sitting in a bar, with a whiskey in my hand, talking to the barkeeper, talking with a pretty girl. But this illusion fades pretty fast, since this album is not really that groundbreaking as one would hope it to be. This is by far never Mot\u00f6rhead's legacy. This is flawed.\n\nNow, I may not know how this sounded back in the days, since I only dug up the remastered version with the mediocre bonus tracks. But the \"enhanced\" version doesn't improve anything on this album - in fact, it even destroys what the late seventies were supposed to be: dirty. The sound on this record is, for that matter, not dirty, it's far more thin. The way Lemmy plays his guitars really is a trademark itself, but they don't save any single aspect on this album. In fact, this sounds like Elvis on really bad drugs (which can be a cool thing to imagine), but not really breathtaking. You see, the problem is not in the age of the record, but in its execution, which makes this album a sore to listen to. Needless effects in both guitar and voice shriek out of the speakers without capturing one's attention very well. The song structure is boring, but has good moments here and there, but without climaxing in any way. One can see a few parallels between Black Sabbath's debut and Mot\u00f6rhead's first album in form on vocals on occasion, which are neither sung at an impressively trained level nor distorted enough to make you want to spit on everything that's a thorn in your life, due to the high level of self-expression. Take Lemmy's vocals on later albums, for example. If that guy doesn't want to make you drive down a highway with a toothpick in your mouth and a pair of nicely polished sunglasses, then I give up. At least Lemmy's vocals are much better and tolerable than Ozzy's back in the days, no doubt.\n\nThe cool material made on this album exists in the form of the snappy bass and grooving drums. You really get a nice 70s groove feel out of that (and not to mention from the soli, that are amazing on occasion). Songs \"Keep us on the road\" or \"Iron Horse/Born to Lose\" are some of the better ones on the album, succeeding where other songs on the album fail. For instance the mood is a little bit more doomy than on the others and has a melancholic feel to it. Fits the term \"biker rock\" well. The atmosphere you get from the jumpy drum patterns and mid paced, cheeky guitar riffs can get you going, if you are in the mood for it. Taking a closer look, one realizes that this album has its own good metal/rock'n'roll parts, as well as a lot of noisy punk garbage that is even obsolete for that particullar period of time.\n\nConclusion: For die hard fans of Mot\u00f6rhead, surely a nice cd/tape to have in your collection, but will not get as many spins as other Mot\u00f6rhead stuff.\n",
        "\nJust like \"Kiss Of Death\"...\n...this album starts off with 3 really good songs, but the first true highlight is song number four. I have to say though that the KOD - songs are just a little stronger, which also means that although \"Rock Out\" (including a (probably copyrighted) bass - intro by Mr. Kilmister) is a fantastic song, it's not quite an all-time classic like KOD's \"Trigger\".\n\nJust like on \"Kiss Of Death\"...\n...the fifth song is probably the weakest track on the album. Although \"One Short Life\" (which even sounds like \"Under The Gun\") is an above average song, it's still the low point of \"Mot\u00f6rizer\".\n\nUnlike \"Kiss Of Death\"...\n...this album doesn't include a ballad, which, considering my affinity for Mot\u00f6rhead - ballads, is more than sad.\n\nUnlike \"Kiss Of Death\"...\n...the second half of \"Mot\u00f6rizer\" basically consists of hits only: \"Time Is Right\", the driving \"Buried Alive\", which sounds like a slightly slowed down version of \"Red Raw\" (from 2002's \"Hammered\"), the \"Damage Case\"-like \"Back On The Chain\", the anti-war hymn \"Heroes\" (which could become Saxon's second \"Crusader\", in case they should ever decide to cover it...) and, finally, Lemmy's favourite \"The Thousand Names Of God\".\n\nJust like on \"Kiss Of Death\"...\n...the most melodic track is not only one of the best tracks on the album, it's one of the best Mot\u00f6rhead tracks ever, plus (see the above-mentioned similarities between \"Under The Gun\" and \"One Short Life\") \"English Rose\" is highly reminiscent of its KOD - counterpart \"Christine\".\n\nJust like on \"Kiss Of Death\"...\n...(and \"Inferno\") this album was produced by Cameron Webb, which is great, because he did a fantastic job again, but on the other hand the charm and the uniqueness of each Mot\u00f6rhead album is also very much due to the different producers who have worked for Lemmy & Co. over the years. Therefore I think my favourite three-piece should consider a change of producers for the next album before they are in danger of becoming too predictable.\n\n\"Mot\u00f6rizer\" is not quite the milestone that \"Inferno\" was, but it is better than its (doubtless good) predecessor \"Kiss Of Death\" (especially the second half of the album is exceptionally strong) and shows this band in impressive form - on their twentieth studio album! I'm impressed!\n",
        "\nAhh, where do I start? Do I start with the obvious \"This is Mot\u00c3\u00b6rhead, and they will kick your ass\"? Or do I go in a bit of a different, yet still extremely generic \"You've heard of Mot\u00c3\u00b6rhead, and so they need no introduction\" path to introducing this album? Decisions, decisions. While I'm deciding, I'm going to put on Mot\u00c3\u00b6rhead's 1916, so that all of you wonderful listeners can be floored by the hammering, electric-power-drill-esque opening riffs of \"The One To Sing the Blues.\" Relish in its simplicity, and the way it bombards you with riff after riff, all the while with Lemmy Kilmister, the mastermind behind the whole thing, belting out his trademark gruff, down-and-dirty style rock vocals with even more energy and charisma than usual.\n\n...is it over yet? [ ] Yes. [ ] No.\n\nIf you marked \"yes,\" then move on to the next paragraph. If you marked \"no,\" then go back and listen again.\n\nAfter \"The One to Sing the Blues\" ends, you'll end up hearing the even better \"I'm So Bad (Baby I Don't Care),\" with its screaming, out-of-this-world solo work and a great performance from Lemmy, and you may share the reaction that I had - \"holy fuck, this kicks ass!\". We also have such displays of youthful bravado as the singalong arena punk anthem \"No Voices in the Sky,\" the hard-hitting \"Going to Brazil,\" and the obligatory Mot\u00c3\u00b6rhead rock n' roll anthem \"Angel City,\" which is catchy, dirty and classy all at once. Just keep listening to these songs. I'm almost ready to start the review this time. Honestly. Just give me a few more minutes.\n\nYou've probably noticed at this point that 1916 is not just another fast Mot\u00c3\u00b6rhead romp, and that it has some of the most beautiful and stirring tracks that the band has produced to date. You've noticed those dissonant, dreamy chords on \"Nightmare/The Dreamtime,\" and heard Lemmy's gritty croon. You've been floored by my personal favorite song here, the epic, pounding flare of \"Love Me Forever,\" which carries a majestic element that I never used to associate with these guys. And after a few more heavy and fast songs, which have promptly ripped your face off by now, you will have likely reached...well, fuck, I'm not too good at pacing these things, am I? We've reached the VERY LAST SONG, and I still haven't figured out a decent enough opening statement for this review. We've reached the soft, melodic and poignant last stand of the title track, and you've probably got tears in your eyes. And if you don't, then you at least feel satisfactory at having listened to one of the most consistently awesome albums this great band has ever put out.\n\nAnd as for my opening statement? Well, I'll just say that this is timeless fucking music. Metal, rock, punk, whatever you want to call it; it's timeless, enduring music that I will come back and enjoy on many a day. Long live Mot\u00c3\u00b6rhead.\n\nOriginally written for http://www.metalcrypt.com\n",
        "\nAlright pals, grab some beer and gather: Mot\u00f6rhead has returned with a striking vengeance. \u201cMot\u00f6rizer\u201d stands as the group\u2019s umpteenth production after three decades of relentlessly rocking against norms naysayers tried to impose, providing classic albums and years of consistency, but these aged individuals have no trouble stomping their competition into dust once again. Gimmicks are deceased while chaos runs amok, yet standards are encumbered beneath Mot\u00f6rhead\u2019s stellar form not looking to push limits, but striving for hard rock/heavy metal that sings of steel credibility as you\u2019d expect. Lemmy and his gang of leather-dressed rockers are once again hailed kings of hard rock, but after all, Lemmy IS God, correct?\n\nWhat\u2019s there to foresee? Come on, you know exactly what: ripping heavy metal like Lemmy and the gang always conjure up. With fast and crushing numbers like \u201cRunaround Man,\u201d Mot\u00f6rhead delivers wonderfully diversified compositions stretching into rabid collections of bass-thumping madness. As usual, Phil Campbell effortlessly shreds his guitar in two while Mikkey Dee blunders his percussion set into oblivion; however, \u201cMot\u00f6rizer\u201d is not a typical release in terms of blatant quality, because its whole experience takes Mot\u00f6rhead\u2019s usual accommodations beyond ballsy rock. To think of how aged this band is, and how they can maintain core writing abilities is simply amazing. Truly, Mot\u00f6rhead is a polite faction in a not-so-polite world.\n\nOh Lemmy, why can you do no wrong? Your rusty yelps are impeccable again, even at the age of sixty three! His bass licks also represent timeless functions applying rapid stints upon classic speed-ridden tunes like \u201cRock Out,\u201d that are essentially just what you\u2019d expect from these guys: heavy, loud, and stuffed with girth. Formally, things also lean into new directions musically, such as epic slabs demonstrated on the godly \u201cHeroes\u201d or \u201cWhen the Eagle Screams.\u201d Still, slower, blues-influenced tracks like \u201cOne Short Life\u201d don\u2019t let up on entwining Mot\u00f6rhead\u2019s genius with overt worshiping of genres obscure to metal, yet that doesn\u2019t stop the anthem from becoming a fine slab of mid-paced rock. They just aren\u2019t back, they\u2019ve returned to their glory days!\n\nFeaturing heavy guitars and a few large moles, \u201cMot\u00f6rizer\u201d stomps the balls off of many old-timers still forcing records due to their previous status. Mot\u00f6rhead, on the other hand, knows how to make magic happen, thus enchanting this effort way beyond expectations. So in conclusion, we have another Mot\u00f6rhead diamond after years of suicidal activity, and the thought of a well-aged band contributing consistent tunes makes \u201cMot\u00f6rizer\u201d more than an album; it\u2019s conceptually fantastic regardless of tone, albeit diversely powerful. Only fools will neglect what this timeless squad has offered upon the year 2008, so grab a beer, pick up some smokes, and idolize what Lemmy\u2019s billionth brainchild of unprecedented fitness accurately delivers: unbreakable heavy metal. \n\nThis review was written for: www.Thrashpit.com\n",
        "\nBecause you bought yet another Mot\u00f6rhead album! Another \u00a310 pound safely into Mr Kilmister's pocket, which he can spend on sherbet lemons, wagon wheels and whatever else the kids are into these days. You could have bought that copy of Benny Hill's Guide to Exotic Spiders you've been hankering for, but another forty minutes of rock 'n' roll from the masters just caught your evil eye. You knew Mot\u00f6rizer wouldn't offer much new or anything that has the band branching out like a shrubbery fueled by Special Brew and fags... but faithfully, you fed the money to the spotty and impressively fringed youth and subsequently got your rocks off, because at heart you're just a geriatric grebo trapped inside the body of an 300 year old hermaphrodite.\n\nI have one bone to pick with Mot\u00f6rizer; the guitar sound is often a bit plain. Kiss of Death, though not perfectly produced, had a great mid-range crunch to the guitars but here things are just a little too drab in the rhythm sound. Phil Campbell has a great guitar sound live and on previous records (1916 and even the otherwise ropey Snakebite Love spring to mind) he sounded huge, but this is quite flat sounding. Not a horrid guitar sound by any means, just when you've got a guitarist with a killer signature sound why not let him shine? It's pretty clear that Cameron Webb is no Vic Maile, I for one would like a change in producer for next album, though the boys are probably set in their ways and probably don't want a change... I mean Phil taking his hat off last year was quite enough of a shock. Still the bass and drums sound pretty good on this one. Mikkey has never quite captured his live sound but recording at Dave 'No More Mr Nice Guy' Grohl's studio gives him a clear and round tub thumping sound. Thankfully, Lem's Stuka bass drone is still intact and he certainly hasn't had a change of heart and decided playing fretless slap bass is cool too - the Rickenbacker of Doom still slaughters its competition... not that it ever had any. \n\nThings are kicked off with a bit of nonsensical, babbling fun in 'Runaround Man'. We get the same sort of riffs that Phil has been churning out since 'Sacrifice', but invigorated and the end result is immensely infectious. The first thing that struck me is that Lemmy's lyrics are a lot sharper here, he seems to recovered a lot of his deft wit. I've listened to this album quite a few times now and I can't find the words monkey and funky in a rhyming couplet anywhere, so that's a certain bonus. 'Teach You How to Sing the Blues' is a fairly quirky number for the band, something about it just feels a little different. I'm sure if Queens of the Stone Age put this one out and had that tall ginger fellow who used to be good drawl over it, it'd be a massive hit... but this is Mot\u00f6rhead, you know, that band that does 'Ace of Spades' and hasn't put out an album since. But, ginger tall fellows sell and the NME is my Qur'an and is placed higher than all other literature on my shelf, except my copy of Harry Potter signed by Dio. But yes, back to the album at hand, 'Teach You How...' is an insanely catchy low-end drone. If I was to notice a theme running through this album it would be the sheer level of catchy choruses. Lemmy has really outdone himself here. 'Kiss of Death' was no slouch for sing-along rockers, but Mot\u00f6rizer just seems more assured. It's almost poppy - albeit in a cunning way - but what else would you expect from a bloke who actually remembers rock 'n' roll? \n\nYou can't really accuse Mot\u00f6rhead of stagnating and repeating a winning formula with a song like 'Rock Out', I mean I've never heard anything quite like it. But then again my dementia is getting pretty bad. Ok, it's a blatant retreat of the 'Mot\u00f6rhead'/'Ace of Spades'/'Iron Fist'/'We are Mot\u00f6rhead' formula, but I like those songs and being a stupid brain-dead hairy I lap this sort of thing up. But here's the ground-breaking part; the opening bass part is only part is only played once before the guitar comes in... talk about pushing the boat out! But hey, this is rock 'n' roll; it doesn't need an alternative, you can't replace it and it doesn't need fucking angst and seven string guitars... you don't play Linkin Park at parties, do ya? Well, if you do I'm coming round to be sick in your bed. 'Buried Alive' is the fastest song here and though it doesn't quite cause internal bleeding like 'Sacrifice' did, it's a gem. You've got to admire the band for getting such a strong melody going at high velocity. It's actually similar to the excellent 'Down On Me' from Inferno, so another enjoyable retread with bounding riffs, but of a more subtle variety. 'The Thousand Names of God' actually is something a little different from the band, not that it's a disco song by any means. We haven't had any slide guitar from the band since the Rock 'N' Roll album (If my memory is correct) so that's a nice touch. It's one of Lemmy's more wordy exercises, in the vain of 'Orgasmatron' or 'Sacrifice', a great continuation of a theme. But these are just the standouts, Mot\u00f6rizer is a very solid album and enjoyable from start to finish. \n\nSo another great Mot\u00f6rhead record. Mot\u00f6rizer stays mean, stays clean and you certainly don't ask it where it's been. This is the best new record I've heard all year, no fucking two disc abominations or \"Hey, they turned the snare back on\" moments here. Mot\u00f6rizer gets better with each subsequent listen and has that hungry vitality that so many bands lack... if the new Metallica is this good, then I will actually refund everyone of you the hard-earned pocket money you spent on this.\n",
        "\nTwo years after Kiss of Death, and Mot\u00f6rhead are back like clockwork to unleash another slab of kick ass heavy metal: Mot\u00f6rizer.\n\nThe problem when reviewing a Mot\u00f6rhead album is that you have to state the obvious a lot. So here\u2019s an early example: this album sounds very similar to the rest of their catalogue and makes no major departures from their signature sound. However, this album is more diverse than much of their recent output. The songs range from classic Mot\u00f6rheadbanging anthems (see Rock Out) to boot-stomping rock \u2018n\u2019 roll tunes (see English Rose, sister track to Kiss of Death\u2019s Christine) to more grooving bluesy tracks (see One Short Life). These styles are all very similar and all something Mot\u00f6rhead has been doing for a while, but here they\u2019ve collected all them all together and it works excellently.\n\nNow as I said before, there are no major changes to the Mot\u00f6rhead sound. This is true; however, there are some minor ones. Mot\u00f6rizer is more melodic than some of their previous releases, but the added melody isn\u2019t overbearing, or even that noticeable. All it serves to do is add an air of maturity to the album that shows that, even though they can and will behave like a bunch of wankers, they actually know what the fuck they\u2019re doing on their instruments.\n\nSpeaking of which, the performances on Mot\u00f6rizer are phenomenal, as usual. What do you expect? Mot\u00f6rhead is a tight band that, and, while they have slowed down a bit (in tempo) with age, they\u2019ve only become a tighter and all around better band as time goes on. Lemmy\u2019s voice sounds better here than it ever has as he croaks lyrics that range from the perverse (Buried Alive) to the thought provoking (The Thousand Names of God) to the nonsensical (Runaround Man). His bass works fantastically well under Phil\u2019s guitar. Listen closely and you\u2019ll here that classic rumbling bass of his doing some interesting and slightly unorthodox things (one of the benefits of having Lemmy\u2019s unique style and sound). Phil Campbell really stands out on this album, more so than he usual. He has a few solos that really showcase how good of a guitar player he actually is. He is the strong backbone of the band, and should be credited as such. Mikkey Dee sounds a bit different here than he has in the past; his style seems slightly simpler and generally less flashy. This does not, however, cause his performance lose any of its trademarked intensity. He is still \u201cthe best drummer in the world\u201d as Lemmy likes to put it.\n\nCameron Webb is back as producer for the third [LOOK THIS UP] time and he does an excellent job, as usual. Inferno and Kiss of Death sounded virtually identical, but Mot\u00f6rizer sounds a bit different to my ears. It\u2019s obvious it\u2019s the same producer, but Phil\u2019s guitar and Lemmy\u2019s bass are more distinguished from eachother, rather than being one blurred noise as on a few tracks from the previous two albums. Lemmy\u2019s bass is more prominent this time around, giving the guitar and bass equal roles in the mix.\n\nThis album defiantly rocks. All the tracks are stand out tracks, althoug the weakest link of the bunch is probably Heroes, which overstays its welcome by about 45 seconds. Additionally, didn\u2019t love a few the first couple times I spun the album. Tracks like Back on the Chain or The Time is Right I considered to be just filler on the way to better tracks like The Thousand Names of God (excellent fucking song by the way, strongest Mot\u00f6rhead album closer in years), but after a while they grew on me quite a bit. Back on the Chain is actually one of my favorites these days. To me this album sounds like Kiss of Death meets Overnight Sensation meets Bastards. Enjoy metalheads and rejoice. The new Mot\u00f6rhead has finally arrived, and it is one of their most satisfying to date.\n",
        "\nWell, Motorhead has done it again (like there was any doubt). This album is stock-full of old and new Motorhead alike; with lyrics that only Lemmy can make work. If you like Motorhead, you are going to fucking love this album and if you haven't really picked up a Motorhead album in awhile (or ever), then I suggest you fucking do so. You will not be disappointed.\n\nAs for the album, the production is top notch, Lemmy's voice feels fresh and unstoppable, the guitars and bass are perfect, and what can I say about Mikkey...this guy is fucking awesome; perfect for Motorhead. As usual, there is some heavy bass influence here (shocking, I know), especially on Teach You How To Sing The Blues. Most of the guitar work is actually done by Lemmy on the bass. There is even some old school shit in here (for you guys that love Overkill, etc.). Rock Out is the perfect example of this. Also, the choruses are classic Motorhead sing-along choruses. They are strong and each track on this disc has a memorable one. What can I say? They're perfect.\n\nThis album is quite diverse, as well. With songs like English Rose (that reminds me of the Another Perfect Day album), Heroes, The Time Is Right, and The Thousand Names Of God (all which remind me of the newer albums like Hammered and We Are Motorhead). There are some heavy tracks here (like the opening track) but nothing too intense like the guys did on the Inferno album.\n\nI'm not going to lie here, this album has given me a new boost for Motorhead. There is not a single weak track here and the lyrical content is the usual feel-good sex, booze, ladies, and rock-n-roll that you expect from Lemmy. Of course, there is the occasional war/soldier song (the track Heroes fits in this category). Overall, this album fucking rocks. Leave a permanent spot open in your CD player and keep your IPod on Motorizer, because if you're a die-hard Motorhead like me, this baby's going to be spining for awhile.\n",
        "\nMot\u00f6rhead probably are the metal equivalent of AC/DC: years pass, and they insist to release albums that follow the same structure. While AC/DC deliver bluesy hard rock albums after bluesy hard rock albums, Mot\u00f6rhead deliver straight forward heavy metal albums after straight forward heavy metal albums. That's what you can expect from \u201cOverkill\u201d: a nice straight forward metal album, but nothing more.\n\nThe first really distinctive characteristic of Mot\u00f6rhead's sound is the voice of the band's leader, the legendary Lemmy Kilmister. On this album he reaches his peak, vocals-wise, his raw voice fitting the atmosphere of the record very well. His bass playing is also very present here, he even plays a soft but delicious bass solo on the amazing \u201cStay Clean\u201d. The guitar playing is very aggressive too, expect great catchy riffs and such. The drumming is pretty decent too, but nothing more.\n\nAs for the songs, all of them are pretty damn catchy (I can remember the choruses of EVERY tune of this album, and I haven't to it for months!), and that's a good but, at the same time, bad thing. Good because memorability and catchiness are essential for a record. Bad because since all the songs follow the same structure and are focused on the choruses, the record turns out not to be that varied. This lack of variety really is the biggest flaw of \u201cOverkill\u201d, unfortunately.\n\nHighlights? The title track is a classic, an amazing opener, with some nice double bass parts and raw riffage. \u201cStay Clean\u201d probably is my personal favourite though, got to love that chorus and the little and tasteful bass solo. \u201cCapricorn\u201d is not as fast as the other songs of the album but still is another highlight. \u201cNo Class\u201d is good too and so is \u201cDamage Case\u201d, probably the heaviest song of the bunch. Finally \u201cLimb from Limb\u201d closes the album and it is another fine tune. All the other songs are just average, my least favourite of all the tunes is \u201cI'll be your Sister\u201d, I just hate that stupid chorus and lyrics.\n\nAnyways, if you like your metal memorable, straight forward and relatively fast, get this record. The durability and variety of it are big problems though, and those are the reasons why I don't give it a better rating. A competent catchy metal album, after all.\n\nBest Moments of the CD:\n-the beginning of \u201cOverkill\u201d.\n-the bass solo on \u201cStay Clean\u201d.\n",
        "\nBecause this is a organic, corn fed, plucked and stuffed Mot\u00f6rturkey! Gobble, Gobble, Gobble! It\u2019s generally said that Mot\u00f6rhead never released a bad album, and fair enough if say Metallica released this it would be \u201cOMG 100%\u201d and \u201ca stunning return to former glories\u201d. But by Mot\u00f6rhead standards this is a bad album. \n\nA major problem here is the generally uninspired riff work. Now, don\u2019t get me wrong Phil Campbell is a great guitar player, especially in a live setting where he constantly surprises me by just how good he can be. But after W\u00fcrzel\u2019s departure following \u2018Sacrifice\u2019 (he was unhappy with some of the bands direction, a supposed lack of arse kicking, not seeing his dog grow up and financial and wiminiz trouble) he went through a bit of a rough patch. Phil seems a little bemused and seems to looking to his left hoping to find his guitar spurring partner of eleven years to give him a hand with the riffs. Of course, Phil finds W\u00fcrzel isn\u2019t there and as such writes a 3rd rate \u2018Sacrifice\u2019 rip-off. Although, his leads are still good\u2026but I can\u2019t help but miss the madcap, squealing guitar histrionics of W\u00fcrzel, ever the underrated member of Mot\u00f6rhead. \n\nBut fret not boys and girls, \u2018Snake Bite Love\u2019 isn\u2019t a total waste of time. \u2018Love for Sale\u2019, good golly Miss Molly, what a corker. This is why we listen to Mot\u00f6rhead ! Good time rock \u2019n\u2019 roll delivered at 130db that makes you feel ten feet tall and encourages periods of very heavy drinking. Lyrically, the song is a rather clever way of describing the physical effects of Viagra and as such is perhaps the most apt song by a bunch of hoary old rockers ever. After all, if old Percy isn\u2019t saying hello what\u2019s wrong with a little encouragement? It\u2019s the kind of thing Mot\u00f6rhead does so well, that being erm Mot\u00f6rhead music. You may not need an airplane (grammar Lem!) to get you through the night, but this song is a perfect way of sending yourself out for a night, mandatory Saturday night listening. \n\nBut elsewhere it\u2019s a pretty dire state of affairs. Although there\u2019s nothing really horrid here, neither is there anything that rivals the tongue in cheek brilliance of \u2018Love for Sale\u2019. There are not one, not two, but three straight up rip offs of \u2018Sacrifice\u2019 songs here; \u2018Dogs of War\u2019 is another \u2018Over your Shoulder\u2019 with those riffs Slash heard and went \u201cThere\u2019s a stupid radio rock song to be had from these!\u201d, \u2018Assassin\u2019 is actually just \u2018Sacrifice\u2019 but slowed down and with nowhere near the same menace, still it\u2019s one of the albums better songs and \u2018Desperate for You\u2019 starts exactly the same as \u2018Sex & Death\u2019. Taking the piss? Just a little! Mikkey, admits that this album was rushed and it really shows, he states given more time \u2018Snake Bite Love\u2019 could have been a classic. Well, it\u2019s certainly worth taking the extra time as albums, as you may or may have not noticed, are eternal documents and can\u2019t simply disappear\u2026no matter how much an artist may wish, so regardless of prior commitments it\u2019s always worth that little extra time to make something worthwhile.\n\nThe late 90s and earlier part of this decade were a scrappy patch for the greatest rock band in the world ever (no, not Dumpy\u2019s Rusty Nuts you moron!). The albums were workman like rather than inspiring as say the late 70s, 80s and early 90s were for the band. Overall, it\u2019s not horrific but it\u2019s by some distance the worst Mot\u00f6rhead album in the world\u2026Ever!\n",
        "\n\u2018Bastards\u2019 is Mikkey Dee\u2019s first and W\u00fcrzel\u2019s last proper Mot\u00f6rhead album, so that\u2019s the nominal line up changes out of the way, so now for the important stuff. What exactly did Phil and Lemmy have for breakfast during the recording? Respectfully, Cider and Jack Daniels. Erm yeah. Anyway, \u2018Bastards\u2019 is another brilliantly monikered album, somewhat of a lost classic for the band, not because the fans have forgotten it or the band just the standard record company bullshit. Honestly, Mot\u00f6rhead should have been bigger than Metallica (mainly due to more quality songs, musicianship and live performances) but they had a insanely high amount of record company and managerial bullshit to deal with instead, just typical!\n\n\u2018Bastards\u2019 is an album of two half\u2019s, I know all albums have two sides but this has somewhat of a clear divide in terms of musical direction. The A side is frighteningly good, the first 5 songs are just balls to the wall, be that balls to the wall speed metal or rock \u2019n\u2019 roll, its achingly heavy (barring the ballad \u2018Don\u2019t Let Daddy Kiss Me\u2019 which is tender but I could be a prat and argue that lyrically it\u2019s still heavy). The second side still rocks but displays the bands more experimental side, and although less successful than the frankly stellar A side, its still rather good. The AC/DC of erm rock \u2019n\u2019 roll? (I was going to say metal but that\u2019s not strictly the case)\u2026hardly. \u2018Liar\u2019 displays a new sort of groove for the band, all mid tempo and angry! \u2018Lost in the Ozone\u2019 is a power ballad (two ballads on a Mot\u00f6ralbum? It\u2019ll be MTV unplugged next!). \u2018I\u2019m the Man\u2019 is a weird sort of bluesy grunge that doesn\u2019t actually work, but it\u2019s the only one on the album, so we can overlook that. Oh crikey it\u2019s all experimental! But doth it rock? Aye, indeed. \n\nIndividual life affirming, hell raising and rocking tracks include. \u2018On Your Feet Or On Your Knees\u2019 (which isn\u2019t about oral sex don\u2019t worry!) which is a riff onslaught with a nice foot stomping pace, a definite underrated Mot\u00f6rhead classic on a underrated Mot\u00f6rhead classic\u2026bizarre that! \u2018Burner\u2019 along with \u2018Sacrifice\u2019 is as close to thrash metal as the band got. It\u2019s short, sharp and prickly (much like a hedgehog) with some eerie wahed guitar from Phil and one of his most unique solos. The lyrics here are particularly harrowing \u2018I don\u2019t think you know your future yet\u2026\u2019 well Mystic Meg does.\n\u2018Death or Glory\u2019 is the customary war themed song that has Lemmy indulging in one of his favourite past times, military history (well he\u2019s not saving the Nazi memorabilia for a rainy day or the second coming of the forth Reich). It features W\u00fcrzel and Phil at their most ferocious and insane; frantic (not the Metallica song!) riff work ahoy, and Mikkey shows he\u2019s not been hired just for his uncanny resemblance to Joey from Friends. \u2018I Am the Sword\u2019 again has some brilliant spidery riffs and Lemmy\u2019s most disturbing and vicious vocals ever. \u2018Born to Raise Hell\u2019 again continues the theme of having loads of great songs all stuck together (which isn\u2019t actually a theme, but it feels like one). Now, if you don\u2019t like rock \u2019n\u2019 roll you won\u2019t like this, but this begs a bigger question\u2026what the sweet baby Jesus were you listening to Mot\u00f6rhead for if you didn\u2019t like rock \u2019n\u2019 roll!? Did you want jazz? Eleven finger tapping? \u201cProto-speed-thrash-metal?\u201d\u2026I despair of you and if this album wasn\u2019t so good I\u2019d take your life and mine! Anyway, \u2018We Bring the Shake\u2019 is the best of the more experimental numbers here. It\u2019s quite reminiscent of Hawkwind, which is no bad thing. The verses have an ethereal droning quality to them which would fit just perfectly on \u2018Space Ritual\u2019 and the chorus well rocks\u2026I feel I need more adjectives to describe rocking. So all in all an excellent bunch of tightly crafted songs. \n\nProduction and performance wise, this is the band displaying their most aggressive tendencies which were somewhat lacking on \u2018March or Die\u2019 (although that album is nowhere near the abomination others have made it out to be). The guitar sound is immense and everything\u2019s definitely in the red. Mikkey, as the new boy has something to prove and he does it in style. The drums on the album are killer especially in contrast to the drab and straight sounding Tommy Aldridge (who is good for Ozzy and Whitesnake but not Motorhead). Lyrically, Lemmy combines his typical rock \u2019n\u2019 roller themes with a more grizzly outlook on humanity and he does it with the class and flair of a man who\u2019s done it all, well by it all I mean your mum and sister (hell, he chatted up my mum when she was fourteen too\u2026and that\u2019s all she disclosed, Jailbait?). W\u00fcrzel and Phil deliver the goods once again on guitar, with some memorable moments. \n\n\u2018Bastards\u2019 is another masterpiece from the band who won\u2019t or more likely can\u2019t die. Ignore the negative review, the band and fans alike recognise \u2018Bastards\u2019 as one of the bands finest and it\u2019s the best to feature Mikkey so far. Just another great album from an Englishman, Welshman, Scarecrow and a Swede.\n",
        "\n\u2018Orgasmatron\u2019 was the first Mot\u00f6rhead album in three years after the excellent but largely misunderstood \u2018Another Perfect Day\u2019. A completely new line up (with the exception of Lemmy of course) and years of record company troubles meant the band really had something to prove and \u2018Orgasmatron\u2019 not only proved this point but it forced your brains through your nose in the process. \n\n\u2018Orgasmatron\u2019 shows a healthy balance of the bands signature rock \u2019n\u2019 roll swagger with more experimental touches, as such this may be more preferable to fans who found \n\u2018Another Perfect Day\u2019 too far removed from the \u2018Fast\u2019 Eddie era. I do however have one point of contention with \u2018Orgasmatron\u2019, its mix is pretty bizarre. At times the guitars seem to disappear from the mix completely which is especially odd considering that what was then a newly twin guitar band should surely have more guitar, right? The actual production sound itself is fine with a particularly excellent drum sound\u2026but the mix is as iffy as four week old seafood.\n\nPerformance wise the band play with a youthful exuberance of a band who know they can rock like bastards, but just haven\u2019t been able to put it down to record yet. As such the \u2018Orgasmatron\u2019 displays a vitality and hunger that is essential to a great Mot\u00f6rhead record. Guitarist\u2019s W\u00fcrzel and Phil Campbell have distinctive yet complementary styles fitting within the established Mot\u00f6rhead mould but instantly recognisable. W\u00fcrzel (along with being a scarecrow) is the more off the wall of the two relying on over the top bends, trills and even his fairly distinctive take on tapping, in all it makes for a great fun listen. Phil on the other hand is more reserved in his style, being more of a traditional blues rock base with a definite touch of class. In addition to this the pair fit in with the general tradition of Mot\u00f6rhead hell raising for instance Phil drank two bottles of vodka a day in the mid 80\u2019s and W\u00fcrzel listed his ambitions as getting up in the morning and drinking as much as he could\u2026Gentlemen, I salute you! Other new boy here is Pete Gill ,of Saxon fame (or not), who is a great drummer with a pounding double bass sound. However, Pete proved to be a bit of an odd character (even by Mot\u00f6rhead standards!) who kept a note book with all kinds of bizarre things like \u2018Phil Campbell owes me 50p\u2019 and apparently enjoyed flashing himself in public. Lem, as always sounds like a plane taking off. But lyrically he puts down some truly excellent work, even by his own lofty standards. The title track happens to be everyone\u2019s favourite set of Mot\u00f6rhead lyrics, focusing on the macabre side of organised religion which a finesse and elegance that few could match. But lyrical themes are varied and interesting from more darkness and horror in say \u2018Deaf Forever\u2019 to classy double entendres (no really, stay with me!) such as \u2018Your magic circle ain't where's its at\u2019 the circle would be the physiological effect of girls on men\u2026women are sorcerers because they can give men an erection from a distance, magical prick teasers don\u2019t y\u2019know! Splendid, learn along with Lem. \n\n\u2018Orgasmatron\u2019 does featuring some new ideas for Mot\u00f6rhead. First of all they open with a mid paced number, eschewing the often used ploy (not only by Mot\u00f6rhead) of opening with a bit of speed metal. \u2018Deaf Forever\u2019 however is rather excellent number driven along by some deliciously simple riffs and rudimentary drum work (bare a few killer fills). The chorus is ridiculously catchy and I like the little shouty thing at the end of each line. The title track itself is built around a bass drone and although cut from the same cloth as \u2018Deaf Forever\u2019 it\u2019s heavier, morbid and menacing. A truly haunting song condensing all the horror of thousands of years of plebiscite misery into\u2026oh, about five and a half minutes. It\u2019s written from an interesting perspective too, from kind of religion as a omnipresent and prevalent being looking at all the suffering its caused in glee. This is anti-organised religion lyrics done exceptionally well; eloquent and poetic without \u201cGod is gay, hail Satan!\u201d Kerry Kingism\u2019s.\n\nBut as always we do get are beloved straight-forward rockers and gee whiz aunt Mary aren\u2019t their some corkers! \u2018Dr Rock\u2019 is a lively and bouncy number and a stalwart of their live set to this day. It\u2019s got some nice lead bass work and doesn\u2019t have a proper guitar solo but rather a noise that sounds like a helicopter\u2026Jawsome! \u2018Built For Speed\u2019 is shining example of one of Lemmy\u2019s many odes to the power, splendour and majesty of rock (which in fact is so majestic that one can use heroic diction). Musically, its got a drum intro to die for, some simply divine riffs (as in their simple and divine) and a nice trade off section, which Phil comes out trumps in by making a noise that goes like this *naw naw naw naw* , not that W\u00fcrzel is slacking either. On the rest of the album we get lots of lovely straight forward loud, fast and furious rock \u2019n\u2019 roll, all which are catchy. So it\u2019s pretty clear \u2018Orgasmatron\u2019 is all out arse kicking rock album. \n\n1986 may have been the year of thrash, but once again Mot\u00f6rhead proved there just isn\u2019t a substitute for the new religion, the electric church\u2026rock \u2019n\u2019 roll. Let it live, let it live. Somewhat of an overlooked classic by the music press and some more casual Mot\u00f6rhead fans, \u2018Orgasmatron\u2019 is worthy of a place in any rock fans collection.\n",
        "\n\u2018Iron Fist\u2019 was and is all things considered a bit of a let down. The previous 3 Mot\u00f6rhead records were thoroughly excellent, particularly \u2018Overkill\u2019 and \u2018Ace of Spades\u2019 which set a new standard for loud, fast and Philthy rock \u2018n\u2019 roll. Lemmy admits that the band got way too complacent after the success of \u2018No Sleep Till Hammersmith\u2019 which to this day remains the bands only number 1 album, well in the UK at least. As such \u2018Iron Fist\u2019 is a weaker album, directionless and features a couple of unfinished songs. But as it's Mot\u00f6rhead its still quite good. \n\n\u2018Fast\u2019 Eddie Clarke handles production on what is his last Mot\u00f6rhead album. This has been a point of contention for many fans, people absolutely despise this production. However, a slightly thinner sound is not \u2018Iron Fist\u2019s real problem and in actual fact this \u201craw as a badgers arse\u201d sound is very much suited to Mot\u00f6rhead. Although many the line up of Eddie, Phil and Lemmy is widely recognised as the classic Mot\u00f6rhead line up from the sheer lack of development (yes, Mot\u00f6rhead do actually change and develop just their too good at it, so you don\u2019t really realise) and sonic stagnation on display here I feel it was a necessary step for Eddie to leave. \n\n\u2018Iron Fist\u2019 does despite my criticism feature some awe inspiring songs and these make more than essential listening for Mot\u00f6rhead fans. The title track occupies a place in the bands encores to this day, simply because it\u2019s a classic, too fast, dangerous and brimming with a rock \u2018n\u2019 roll attitude sadly lacking in a lot of today\u2019s\u2026um rock \u2018n\u2019 roll. The lyrics happen to be some of Lemmy\u2019s finest too with a menace and darkness he rarely displays, \u2018Sacrifice\u2019 is another example of this. \u2018Go to Hell\u2019 in my mind is a Mot\u00f6rhead classic, some very memorable riffs from Eddie and good-love-gone-bad type lyrics\u2026because remember children, women are bad and should not be trusted. \u2018Loser\u2019 is one of the more interesting songs on \u2018Iron Fist\u2019, the sliding riffs aren\u2019t typically Mot\u00f6rhead by numbers and the song catchy on the whole. \u2018(Don't Let 'Em) Grind You Down\u2019 is a more mid paced number at which the band excel (Mot\u00f6rhead never really get any recognition for doing a lot of mid paced numbers\u2026which probably felt like funeral dirges to a band who did so much speed, the drug not the tempo...but probably the tempo too).\n\nSadly the much of \u2018Iron Fist\u2019 is forgettable and often comes across as with a feeling of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu\u2026as the band had done it before and better. \u2018Heart of Stone\u2019 is perhaps the worst example of this, Lemmy says \u2018Iron Fist\u2019 features two unfinished songs and I\u2019m guessing this is one of them as I\u2019d like to believe Lem wouldn\u2019t submit such a mediocre exercise in speed as a finished product. \u2018(Don\u2019t Need) Religion\u2019 isn\u2019t bad per se its just a blatant rip off of Ted Nugent\u2019s \u2018Cat Scratch Fever\u2019 and no where near as good, Mot\u00f6rhead seem to have a thing for Special Ted as they covered the aforementioned track (badly might I add) on \u2018March or Die\u2019. There are some other good songs on \u2018Iron Fist\u2019 namely \u2018Speedfreak\u2019 but much of it descends into a bland Mot\u00f6rheady mush and that\u2019s not something I\u2019d like to say about one of my favourite bands.\n\nSomewhat surprising on such a comparatively weak album (Mot\u00f6rhead don\u2019t do real stinkers\u2026well maybe \u2018Snake Bite Love\u2019) is that the performances are great and energetic. \u2018Fast, but probably the slowest guitarist in Mot\u00f6rhead\u2019 Eddie Clarke is a magical player, he\u2019s so simple yet effective, Eddie generally only uses simple chords and as such when he puts an extra 5th in a power chord he sounds immense\u2026even more so than usual. Eddie\u2019s playing shows economic guitar playing at its best; no bollocks but all balls. Philthy Animal pre \u2018Rock \u2018n\u2019 Roll\u2019 as always is a great drummer the logical successor to the unrestrained energy of the late great Keith Moon. Lemmy is well just Lemmy, no surprises\u2026everything you want.\n\n\u2018Iron Fist\u2019 is a weaker album from the band and is in the unenviable position of being sandwiched in between many superior albums, its sad that Eddie\u2019s swansong in Mot\u00f6rhead is a tad patchy, ending the era with a whimper.\n",
        "\nThis review is for the 2003 release of \u201cLive At Brixton\u201d. I will use a gauge for which all live Motorhead albums will be measured, \u201cNo Sleep Till Hammersmith\u201d. The first thing that makes this album better than Hammersmith is the luxury of having many more years of great music to choose tracks from. They have 25 years of the most face melting rock and roll ever to be played by anyone. This release is also superior in the fact that it is two discs. Sometimes when bands put out double disc releases, such as live and best of comps, there tends to be several filler songs. That\u2019s because a lot of bands don\u2019t have enough quality songs to fill two discs. With Motorhead you could fill five discs and still probably think of a couple that you left off. That\u2019s not to say that I am totally happy with every song that they chose to do in this set. I would say one area where Hammersmith is superior is that it have a couple of old songs that I would have liked to see on this release. Most noticeably is the omission of the song \u201cMotorhead\u201d. The hyper version on Hammersmith is more superior than even the original. The other point where this one lacks is the sound quality. Don\u2019t get me wrong here as far as live albums are concerned this one kills many others in sound and mix. But with regards to Hammersmith it does not have the power that release has. The music sounds a little thinner and the vocals are a little bit too up front in the mix. But hey, it is live! Most all of the classics that you know and love are here with some between songs banter with Lemmy. Including an almost never ending seven minute version of Overkill. \n\nThe bottom line is that this is a quality release from a band that deserves all the respect it gets. Regardless of the few minor complaints I had, you could do a lot worse by picking up someone else\u2019s live record instead. This release is a good sampling of songs from 25 years of Motorhead. I give this album 90% rating and I feel that Hammersmith deserves a slightly higher rating of 95%. So either one you choose to get you will, as with most Motorhead albums, be picking up a quality release.\n",
        "\n1987\u2019s \u2018Rock \u2019n\u2019 Roll\u2019 album is considered by Lemmy as one of the bands weaker albums, and I\u2019d have to agree. After the excellent \u2018Orgasmatron\u2019, the band rushed back into the studio and seemed to spent even less time on the production of the album. Whereas \u2018Orgasmatron\u2019 was weirdly lacking in guitars in places (especially considering that it was the bands first twin guitar album) the bass and drums still sounded excellent, but \u2018Rock \u2019n\u2019 Roll\u2019 sounds just thin and in places unbearably weedy. Oh well, you know the general pattern of Mot\u00f6rhead albums, a weak one then a strong one.\n\nThe song writing on \u2018Rock \u2019n\u2019 Roll\u2019 seems stagnant in comparison to the fresh and daring ideas on \u2018Another Perfect Day\u2019 and \u2018Orgasmatron\u2019, the riffs and song structures seem a little too predictable. Ok, past works such as \u2018No Class\u2019 or \u2018Jailbait\u2019 were predictable but some of the songs on \u2018Rock \u2019n\u2019 Roll\u2019 are lacking in that certain class (see what I did there?). However, it\u2019s of note that there are some classic Mot\u00f6rhead anthems on this album\u2026.just as any other Mot\u00f6rhead album. Two of these are actually b-sides (if you own the re-mastered version, which I can recommend as its got two songs on it that are better than most of the album), these being \u2018Cradle to the Grave\u2019 which is simple but very well done, a underrated and overlooked song and \u2018Just 'Cos You Got The Power\u2019 which has been in the live set for the past 20 years and although this version is not the best, it\u2019s still a corker, slow and bluesy with some great defiant lyrics from Lem. On the actual album itself the title track stands out as a immediate winner, the sort of thing Mot\u00f6rhead have done over and over again. It\u2019s so bloody simple but it works right from the opening line of \u2018Well here, babe, look at you, in love with someone else\u2019 (as if Lemmy\u2019s ever got hung up on a girl leaving him, he\u2019d surely just sleep with their sister), to the great bow-now-now riff, a simple message of how Rock \u2019n\u2019 Roll can save your soul and one of Phil\u2019s best solos its an instant classic, something which this album is a little thin on. \u2018Eat the Rich\u2019 is one of the albums better known tracks and it\u2019s a fun enough romp, but the lyrics although light hearted are pretty damn cheesy at times, still fun though. The line \u2018Shetland Pony, extra pepperoni\u2019 is one of Lem\u2019s best ever quips . \n\n\u2018Blackheart\u2019 is the kind of thing we\u2019ve heard from Mot\u00f6rhead before, a bit of a throw-back to the \u2018Overkill\u2019 days, and the verses are excellent but I don\u2019t care for the chorus much, it just seems a tad uninspired. \u2018Stone Deaf in the USA\u2019 exemplifies just how thin the guitar on this album is, but the song although not a classic is good fun and one of the albums better numbers, catchy and fun. \u2018The Wolf\u2019 kicks off this albums second side and it\u2019s a seriously dull piece of speed, ok chorus but it\u2019s nothing a song like \u2018Mean Machine\u2019 already did better. \u2018Traitor\u2019 again is pretty standard Mot\u00f6rhead fare and although not offensive, its forgettable. It had been done before, and it was done better. \u2018Dogs\u2019 is clunky and like most of this albums second side features sections which work better than others. The verses are boring and Philthy\u2019s drums give it a boring groove but the chorus\u2019 are better. \u2018All For You\u2019 sounds like a song that wasn\u2019t quite good enough to be on \u2018Another Perfect Day\u2019, a bit similar to \u2018Shine\u2019 but nowhere near as good. But at least it\u2019s something a little different on the album, hell it\u2019s a Mot\u00f6rhead love song! \u2018Boogeyman\u2019 also sounds like a second rate \u2018Shine\u2019, ha well it\u2019s ok, but can we try a little harder please?\n\nSo it\u2019s another Mot\u00f6rhead album and another line up change, Pete Gill is gone and Philthy Animal Taylor\u2019s back. Good right? Nope, Philthy\u2019s decided to play fairly boringly now and even fucks up on record, listen to that uneven and pathetic sounding double bass at the beginning of \u2018The Wolf\u2019, shocking! This is the same drummer who destroyed on \u2018Overkill\u2019, the man who was perhaps the most insane and non-drummerery (if you know what I mean) drummer since Keith Moon, and by 1987 he\u2019s average. What a crying shame. This must of rubbed off on the rest of the band as W\u00fcrzel and Phil\u2019s guitars are often workmanlike and lacking in inspiration, although there are flashes of brilliant from both (mainly in the solos, the riffs are often quite dull on this album). Notably the solos sound far more vibrant that the rhythm as they were recorded in a different studio. Lemmy\u2019s bass is the same as ever, which is a good thing but the sound is too thin in places. Lemmy\u2019s vocals are strained in places which he put down the very hurried pace at which this album was recorded (and then back on the road again, no doubt, oh well can\u2019t blame ya!). Overall, it seems that if a little more time had been taken on the vocals, guitars and production and if they\u2019d got a drummer who actually cared to play on the album \u2018Rock \u2019n\u2019 Roll\u2019 would have been a great Mot\u00f6rhead album rather than an average one (Mot\u00f6rhead don\u2019t do bad albums). \n\nIt\u2019s a bit of an odd one this \u2018un, by no means bad, just hardly a stone-cold, killed by booze and speed Mot\u00f6rclassic. There are about three versions of this album in circulation at the moment. All I know is avoid the original, it\u2019s missing two of the best songs from this era. Apparently the recently released double disc version is the best by far, it features a rather sterling live set from Donnington 1986. \n\nCouple of bits changed, grammar, paragraphing and title.\n",
        "\nAh yes, 1916 widely recognised as a damn fine Mot\u00f6rhead album and a terrible year for war. One could of perhaps feared that 1916 would be a bit of a sell-out, all the signs indicated that; Lemmy moves to LA and the band to a major label\u2026..could we expect power ballads and Tawny Kitaen? Well no, although 1916 was a bit of a departure from the tried and tested Mot\u00f6rhead sound in places (which frankly was needed after the stagnant \u2018Rock and Roll\u2019) it still rocks like a bastard.\n\n1916 finds Mot\u00f6rhead in a experimental mood but unlike previous experimentation\u2019s (on the \u2018Bomber\u2019 album for instance) 1916\u2019s quirks and experimentations don\u2019t sound contrived or as some of the experiments on \u2018Bomber\u2019 did, shit. No, as it turns out \u2018Nightmare/The Dreamtime\u2019 and \u2018Love Me Forever\u2019 are quite good Mot\u00f6rsongs, hardly show stoppers but worthy nonetheless. But this experimentation shouldn\u2019t come completely as a surprise as lest we forget that Mot\u00f6rhead have actually changed their sound over the years. Despite this experimentation, the real killers on 1916 are the balls out rockers which come complete with Lem\u2019s wonderful \u2018I\u2019ve spent the past 20 years drinking and shagging\u2019 swagger. \u2018I\u2019m So Bad (Baby I Don\u2019t Care)\u2019 is one of my absolute favourite Mot\u00f6rhead songs with a rather splendid riff and some of Lemmy\u2019s best lyrics. It\u2019s a corker, with all the swagger and attitude you could possibly ask for\u2026.listen to it and reaffirm your faith in Rock and Roll. \u2018One to Sing the Blues\u2019 is a simple yet effective song, effortlessly catchy and a nice way to start the album. \u2018No Voices in The Sky\u2019 was sent up wonderfully by Beavis and Butthead (eye for eye, tooth for tooth!) and is a melodic, lightening fast and almost poppy number, albeit still heavy. \u2018Going to Brazil\u2019 is just plain old Rock and Roll, its stayed in the set ever since although because of this songs success with have had to put up with a few second rate copies of it on subsequent albums\u2026.but I won\u2019t hold it against the original. \u2018Make My Day\u2019 is perhaps my personal favourite and a forgotten Mot\u00f6rhead classic featuring some characteristically brilliantly lyrics, these being my personal favourite; \n\u2018Dream lover, head to tail, coulda put a lot of boys in jail\u2019, Ah Jailbait\u2026\u2026A rhyming couplet that would of done William G Shakespeare proud\u2026\n\u2018R.A.M.O.N.E.S\u2019 is unsurprisingly a tribute to that great Rock \u2018N\u2019 Roll band, The Ramones (but doesn\u2019t all that punk shit belong on Mars?) and this too is a great lively number that sounds just like classic 70\u2019s Ramones. Even thought some tracks stand out from the rest 1916 is a consistent piece of work and ranks among the bands best.\n\nPerformance wise, even thought this isn\u2019t the most celebrated line up Mot\u00f6rhead ever had, its generally good performances all round. Philthy Animal although he wasn\u2019t half the player he was when he came back after leaving in 1984, puts in a good performance here although he apparently had trouble with some of the timings in the studio. But you can\u2019t really tell here as they managed to coax a good performance out of him. Guitarist\u2019s Phil Campbell and Wurzel do a fine job here, with razor sharp riffing and good old balls out rock solos throughout. I\u2019m quite fond of Mot\u00f6rhead\u2019s twin guitar line up, I find it ultimately more interesting sonically than the current line up (although that said the current line up is still fantastic live and the guitar sound on \u2018Inferno\u2019 and \u2018Kiss of Death\u2019 is much improved from say \u2018Overnight Sensation\u2019, \u2018Snakebite Love\u2019, \u2018We Are Mot\u00f6rhead\u2019 etc). Lemmy of course plays some damn fine bass with his signature \u2018plane taking off\u2019 sound and sings (note sings not shouts) as well as ever. The production on \u20181916\u2019 is greatly improved over \u2018Rock \u2018n\u2019 Roll\u2019 and \u2018Orgasmatron\u2019, the guitars less thin and the vocal performance better. \n\nSo as with about eight over Mot\u00f6rhead albums, \u20181916\u2019 is a essential classic\u2026\u2026and please Lemmy put \u2018I\u2019m So Bad (Baby I Don\u2019t Care)\u2019 back in the set list. Perhaps in keeping with tradition \u20181916\u2019 was followed by the much weaker \u2018March or Die\u2019 (Mot\u00f6rhead albums go in a pattern of weak/strong, usually- except Mot\u00f6rhead don\u2019t actually do bad albums, just lesser ones).\n",
        "\nMot\u00c3\u00b6rhead need no introductions. They've been chugging out pummeling, riff-heavy rock music for the better part of the last 30 years, and they show no sign of stopping soon. This was their 8th full length offering, Orgasmatron, and it's exactly what you'd expect from these dinosaurs of rock - Lemmy Kilmister's charismatic gritty snarl layered over a jubilantly energetic bucketful of grooving hard rock riffs and juicy, luscious classic metal solos. Mot\u00c3\u00b6rhead have always stuck to this formula, and it's a much-needed breath of fresh air when you consider the ridiculous levels that some bands take their \"progressions\" to these days. People always cite repetition as a drawback to music, but that is a flawed generalization - this, while sticking to the same formula throughout, kicks a lot of ass.\n\nEvery song here is very good, with the best probably being the title track, which is a slower, grinding number with cool lyrics and an excellent groove, with a vocal performance that will send chills down your spine, followed closely by the opening ass-stomper \"Deaf Forever,\" which will never come out of your head, no matter how much you try. \"The Claw\" is another awesome song, pretty typical for Mot\u00c3\u00b6rhead, except with a better chorus then usual, and perhaps a bit more speed too. But fuck, every single track smokes, and this is the album you want to put on for a good time. This is the same formula they've always used, and why mess with success? Who really needs a bunch of flashy bells-and-whistles \"progressions\" to such a great Metal backbone in the first place? Orgasmatron rocks, and Mot\u00c3\u00b6rhead rocks, and if you just want something that rocks without any semblance of pretension or artistry, then turn to this. That's all that needs to be said.\n\nOriginally written for http://www.metalcrypt.com\n",
        "\nOf all the early Motorhead albums, I\u2019d have to elevate Bomber as the best of the bunch. Sporting the thickest, meanest production of the pre-Orgasmatron albums and a nice sampling of the band\u2019s classic songwriting prowess, Bomber is as varied as it is entertaining and is a sure bet for Motorhead faithful.\n\nLemmy and the boys aren\u2019t yet playing any Ace of Spades style speed rockers, so the tracklist is notoriously bluesier than their following endeavors. Not that there aren\u2019t any up-tempo numbers; tracks like \u201cStone Dead Forever\u201d and \u201cDead Men Tell No Tales\u201d prove otherwise. But everything is firmly planted in the blues. No more Capricorn-style psychedelic numbers either. Just straight up blues \u2018n\u2019 roll. Rockers like the driving title track and the swaggering \u201cLawman\u201d coexist with the smoky bar ballad \u201cStep Down\u201d (sung by Eddie Clark) and the deadly down-tempo \u201cSweet Revenge,\u201d highlighted by that sliding chorus riff. Eddie and Lemmy rock as hard as ever on here, swapping leads and melodic fills like old stories across a beer-stained poker table in a seedy pub, with Phil Taylor providing the backbone. Speaking of pubs, it sounds like Lemmy went through a few pitchers before recording his vocals; they\u2019re as raspy as ever. Expect plenty of quick wit and rabid wordplay from him on this one, he\u2019s at his best. \n\nMy final compliment to this album is the production. Raw and thick, Bomber is the last album that would get this kind of treatment before the band smoothed out the sound for the legendary Ace of Spades. It sounds like it was recorded in one take in the basement of a noisy bar (probably was, too). Personally, I prefer this grungy, dirty Motorhead sound over the cleaner sound of future albums, but alas, it was not to be. Ace of Spades, Iron Fist, and so on are noticeably cleaned up.\n\nSo yeah, if you dig Motorhead, you\u2019ll dig this record. More no-nonsense old-school heavy metal from the masters of it, Bomber could even challenge George Thorogood in the best-drinking-music department. Bottoms up.\n",
        "\nMotorhead\u2019s celebrated Overkill album is not only one of the best records they\u2019ve put out, but one of the most influential records to the early thrash scene. Sure, bands like Iron Maiden, Judas Priest, Diamond Head, Angel Witch, Scorpions, and Accept all had roles in elevating early heavy metal to new heights of speed and intensity, but it was Overkill that really showed the first shades of thrash. Listen to early Metallica and try to deny the influence. This is 70\u2019s rock kicked up a few dozen notches and a heavy metal favorite.\n\nBut influence means nothing if the product doesn\u2019t stand up after all these years (early Kiss was influential, but still sucks). This is where Motorhead truly shines, as this album is just as rad as it was back in the day, despite the fact that Lemmy and Co. have been doing pretty much the same thing ever since. Expect lots of quick, sleazy rock \u2018n\u2019 roll, outfitted with lots of lead guitar, double bass, distorted bass guitar solos, a nasty swagger and a pocket full of attitude. Lemmy\u2019s voice is in peak form: gruff and rough as one would suspect. The production is also uniquely raw and features a very bass-heavy mix, so that even the slower, laid-back bluesy numbers are still pretty damn heavy. \n\nSong selection on this album is a bit varied, despite being in the same vein as just about everything the band has ever done. The classic title track kicks things off in an unstoppable hail of heavy metal noise and the unrelenting double pedal assault of Phil Taylor. Eddie Clark solos all over this song, to good measure of course. \u201cStay Clean,\u201d while not matching the pace of the former, reeks of classic Motorhead with a slightly hypocritical twist and a bass solo from Lemmy. The up-tempo blues rock continues up until \u201cCapricorn,\u201d which adds a subdued psychedelic flavor to the sound. Think Hendrix. Then it\u2019s back to band staples like \u201cNo Class\u201d and \u201cDamage Case\u201d for the duration of the album, with another psychedelic diversion in \u201cMetropolis.\u201d Most of these tracks are among the band\u2019s finest tunes and are likely to be heard live even today.\n\nThe original album is classic, but considering that most of the band\u2019s early discography has been re-released with a second disc of bonus material, chances are that the version you find in stores will be packed to the brim with B-sides, live tracks, and a half-dozen versions of \u201cLouie, Louie,\u201d the Kingsmen classic that upped their punk cred (punks love \u201cLouie, Louie.\u201d Ask one next time you see one). Either way, Overkill is a rock and roll classic and an essential Motorhead record.\n",
        "\nWho could have possibly thought that after the brutality left by their previous album OVAHKILL (or Overkill to you \"Metal-impaired\"), Mot\u00f6rhead had enough in them to release an even more brutal album later on that year. This is... BOMBAH! (or Bomber to you \"Metal-impaired\").\n\nFrom start to finish this album is a beast with Philthy Animal Taylor having a seizure inducing performance on the drums that would be near the fastest for it's time, Fast Eddie redefining shredding on a guitar and finally Lemmy showing us why he's the biggest bad-ass in metal with his performance on the Bass/Vocals.\n\nWe start off with the fast and angry \"Dead Men Tell No Tales\", this is your typical Mot\u00f6rhead opening track that is simply there to let you know that these guys are better than you and would kick your ass if you feel otherwise, definately a high point on this album. The next two songs are much slower and bluesier, \"Lawman\" and \"Sweet Revenge\". Now these are nowhere near as good as the opener, but these songs are songs that are made to headbang to... the reason us humans have necks is so we can headbang to songs like these, although the former does drag on a bit.\n\nThe speed gradually builds up with \"Sharpshooter\", which is simply enough, about a Sharpshooter. This song is much faster than the two that came before it, but it doesn't really live up to \"Dead Man Tell No Tales\", still a pretty strong song.\n\nThen comes \"Poison\", or as I like to call it \"FUCKING THRASH!\", from the second this song begins you're in for one of the fastest songs for it's time, this is one of the greatest examples of Thrash meets Punk up until Overkill's \"Feel the Fire\". The song might go for less than three minutes, but if it were any longer you'd have neck problems.\n\nThe greatness continues with \"Stone Dead Forever\", the longest song on this and one of the heaviest. This song is a classic and still receives concert play to this day, one of Mot\u00f6rhead's best here. \"All the Aces\" is another fast ditty, but it's still rather forgettable. \"Step Down\" is something different, it's Fast Eddie's shot at vocals, it sounds more \"Paranoid\"-era Black Sabbath than it does Mot\u00f6rhead, this is a good song, but is more or less filler. \"Talking Head\" is a mid paced song with pretty fun Bass licks during the solo section, but that's all it has really. Then we get...\n\nIZZEH BOMBAH! IZZEH BOMBAHAHAH!\n\nYou guessed it, the title track \"Bomber\". Now remember the stuff I said about \"Dead Men Tell No Tales\", \"Poison\" and \"Stone Dead Forever\" (sans the longest song part), add all of that together, then turn it up to fucking 11 and we get one of the greatest anthems to come out of heavy metal. From the fast and furious riffage and verses, to the melody bridge or to the onslaught that is the chorus, this song fucking owns and I couldn't think of a better way to close this album.\n\nSo there you have it, an album that is the definition of Mot\u00f6rhead, the definition of Metal, the definition of headbanging and the definition of turning it to 11.\n\nSadly pretty much ever Mot\u00f6rhead studio release that follows this fails to live up to the aggression and all round awesomeness displayed here, probably the only Mot\u00f6rhead that can top this would be their legendary \"No Sleep 'Til Hammersmith\", but that's for another review.\n\nIt's a Bomber!\n",
        "\nOnce upon a time, in a land across the sea, a young man was struggling to find his way. He was named Ian Fraiser Kilmister. Now, this young boy wasn't the best looking dude in school, and what's on every guy's minds? Girls. But how to get them? He just couldn't figure that one out. Poor Ian. Till one day he noticed another young lad surrounded by girls. He looked at him and tried to figure out what was so special about him, and then it hit him: That smart-boy had brought a guitar school! So the next day, Ian borrowed his mother's guitar and took it to school, and he was also surrounded by girls.\n\nSo began the story of the legend; Lemmy Kilmister and his infamous band, Motorhead.\n\n\"In those days just having a guitar was enough....that was it\". - Lemmy\n\nThe rest...well, I highly doubt little Ian could've foreseen it. Devoted fans. Nearly 20 albums. Sold out shows. And for little Ian's own pleasure, a never ending amount of groupies. Yes, this is Motorhead, the band that dressed up in Santa Clause outfits, got piss drunk, and flicked people off. The same band that's been called \"The loudest loons in the universe!\" (Guinness Book of World Records). And while they've had their dips here and there, like with the album \"Sacrifice\", these bad boys have been able to stick true to their roots of being rude, fast, and heavy. They've been handed the medal for inventing 'Speed Metal', and they're some of the founding fathers of the 'Hard Rock' genre. And throughout constant line-up changes, one man has been through it all: Lemmy. He's been there since the beginning. From the 4-man, to 3-man, back to 4-man, and back to 3-man line-ups, Lemmy has never abandoned his spot as the distortion loving bassist and the primitive sounding vocalist. So it should only be far to say that this is HIS band, for without Lemmy, Motorhead wouldn't be who they are today. \n\nAnd what could've been a better possible way for these fellows to kick start the new millennium with some good ole fashioned dirty Rock 'N' Roll? This is \"We Are Motorhead\", and it sums up their career this far as being one of the premiere names in the Rock industry and proves to the world that they can expect to see Motorhead drinking beer and playing loud in the coming years.\n\nKicking off with the un relentless \"See Me Burning\", Lemmy and co. are out to show us that they have no intention of going into a retirement home anytime soon. Mikey Dee's drum solo/intro is incredible, as it features some blasting double bass patterns. The song is crunched-heavy, featuring mainly thick palm mutes and flowing guitars during the bridge. It's urgent right from the beginning, and never lets up the feeling that it wants to get somewhere fast. \"Slow Dance\" takes the exact opposite approach, as it is what the name implies. A chugging, head banging rhythm section dominates the song with Mikey D sealing it all with some tight-nit drumming. The song is noticeably slower than \"See Me Burning\", but it's a definite thrasher all around. \"Stay Out of Jail\" brings back in the speed element, with an opening riff that seems to have been injected with a shot of 'Blues' before it cuts itself off to flow right into a straight-up punk-esque verse. It's got the most melody out of all the songs so far, courtesy of Phil's unique guitar playing. Now, if Motorhead was gonna do a cover, it better be good, cause I don't think I could ever see them working out something other than their own. Well, I was kinda wrong. \"God Save the Queen\" is a cover of a Sex Pistols song, and all that punk-anarchy energy is transferred perfectly over. It's also one of the best songs of the album...ironic, huh?\n\nGroove era Motorhead has always contained some of my favorite songs, like \"One to Sing the Blues\", so when I heard \"Out to Lunch\", I knew I was in for a treat. It's got that old-school 80's rock vibe just screaming out about it, with a slightly banshee-screeching guitar. The next song is the only one that I don't really care for on this album, \"Wake the Dead\". It's undeniably heavy, but it doesn't seem to want to take off in any direction other than that. It just pounds away, and there's no sense of power or anything throughout which makes it stick out like a sore thumb in the 'sub-par' category. Lemmy does have a kickin' bass lick that he throws in every now and then as some sort of redeeming factor. And as a staple with later releases, they've got a balled-type song. And just like all of the others, this one is a gem. \"One More F*cking Time\". It features a serene guitar that floats all over the song, and during the chorus the distortion is kicked up to make it into more of a Power-Ballad. It's a wonderful change of pace. And then coming straight out of the undisturbed atmosphere set by \"One More F*cking Time\", \"Stagefright/Crash and Burn\" comes blasting away with a blasting guitar and Mikey Dee giving his bass drum a complete workout. The same intensity is featured throughout the album, making it one hell of a thrasher. \"(Wearing Your) Heart On Your Sleeve\" is virtually the same way, which makes the two great to listen to together for a quick one-two punch of power. The final song, and also the title track, is also the best on the album. \"We Are Motorhead\" sounds like something that could've been straight off of \"Ace of Spades\". Lemmy's plugging bass intro is almost virtually the same as on the song \"Ace of Spades\", and it's more punk-feel gives it that true old-school Motorhead feel. It's the shortest song on the album, but it's also the one that'll get your blood pumping faster than anything else featured on this album. A perfect way to close the album.\n\nNow, Phil Campbell is a talented guitarist. His solos off of albums (combined with Wurzel's) like \"1916\" and \"Rock 'N' Roll\" were downright sick. So when he got into a slump on \"Sacrifice\" and put out horrible ones, and even songs that didn't have them, I became to doubt him. And sure enough, after \"Sacrifice\", the sub-par playing was carried over to \"Overnight Sensation\". But not on here. On this album, Phil unleashes his talent, flinging off some of his best work. Most of these solos here are your typical 'shred-till-you-drop' type solos, with no thought on melody. Tracks like \"See Me Burning\" and especially \"Stagefright/Crash and Burn\" feature long-drawn out insane solos from Phil's fingertips. And when they do get melodic, like on \"One More F*cking Time\", it's just sheer beauty mixed with aggression. The only track that really doesn't feature a solo would be \"Wake the Dead\", but I already wasn't too fond of the riffs to begin with so it doesn't bother me that much.\n\nAnd Lemmy...ohhh Lemmy. How you haven't changed. Nor has his band. His voice is still as rash and self-confident sounding as ever. His throaty shout dominates this album more so than in the past, since most of these songs have a bit more grit to them. One listen to the opener, \"See Me Burning\", and you know Lemmy is back in business. There's hardly any melody here, just Lemmy clearing out the old-vocal pipes. And when he does actually sing on \"One More F*cking Time\", the result is a more than just average; it's near perfect. Believe it or not, the guy has a very calm, low-keyed singing voice that perfectly matches Phil's guitar. And his lyrics are still as rip-roaring as ever. \"See Me Burning\" has Lemmy proudly exclaim \"Come on over later, bring your sister, I swear to you she won't be in the way\". One can only wonder what Lemmy wants to do with those two girls. But the absolute best lyrics, and possibly of all time for Lemmy (maybe tied with \"Brave New World\") are off the title track. They're self-loathing, egotistical, and just openly blatant. \"We bring you attitude and razor teeth to bite, We bring machine gun law and we're the ones to blame. We are the ones you need, the ones that you despise. We are the ones who wanna poke you in the eye.\".\n\n\"We Are Motorhead\" rushed these guys straight into the new millennium with no signs of slowing down. Phil's riffs and solos are great, Mikey Dee's drum work is fantastic, and Lemmy shows that not even age can suppress him. And with only one weak track (\"Wake the Dead\"), it's not hard to recommend this album to any fan of Hard Rock/Metal.\n\nOverall Rating - 4/5 (80)\n\n\nOh yes, I saved the best lyrics for last from the title track, it seems up Motorhead's career brilliantly:\n\n\"We are Motorhead...Born to kick your a*s!\"\n\nTracks to check out\nSee Me Burning\nOne More F*cking Time\nWe Are Motorhead\n",
        "\nHere it is, the brain child of metal legends Lemmy and Ozzy... Before this song was release, Ozzy Osbourne released his own version of it which was nice and catchy and all... but really lacked the balls to make it a headbanger, especially a Mot\u00f6rheadbanger... so now Lemmy's having a crack at it.\n\nFrom the verry beginning of that awesome, heavy, bassline you know that your head is in for some banging over the next 4 and a half minutes. Ozzy's voice in his version is very high and whiny and really tends to get on my nerves, but Lemmy's gruff voice in the verses really back up the heavy bassline that carries the song.\n\nDuring the chorus the vocals become melodic and really sound weird at first with Lemmy's voice, and at first I actually preffered Ozzy singing the chorus but over time 'Head's version grew on me and I completely blocked Ozzy's version out of my life.\n\nNow, enough about the Mot\u00f6rhead vs Ozzy comparison, onto the song itself:\n\nAs I already mentioned, the opening treats us to a really powerful bassline that lets you know it's about time to bang your head. Lemmy's vocals are as gruff and angry as ever at some points but occasionally it gets weirdly higher pitched which does tend to get annoying, the chorus is pretty melodic and very unMot\u00f6rhead (again, this once an Ozzy song) but Lemmy's voice still kicks ass here, so still a winner. But my favourite aspect of the song here is the guitaring, it's not very prominant in the song, but the solo section and the breaks inbetween the verses and chorus are pretty basic but still kick ass.\n\nAll round a good song, far better than the original, but still not a Mot\u00f6rhead classic.\n",
        "\nOriginally recorded in 1976, Mot\u00f6rhead's 'On Parole' shows a band that is more relaxed and brooding compared to what they would later become. This is their real debut album, but due to record company problems the album was shelved until three years later, where it was released to try and cash in on the bands new found success. Mot\u00f6rhead was originally founded as a result of Lemmy's beliefs that the Metal scene losing it's popularity and intensity as a result to the explosion of the punk scene, and having just left Hawkwind it seemed a perfect opportunity to make a band which would bring the Metal genre back to where it was before.\n\nWith that said however, 'On Parole' has it's roots first and foremost in classic rock. The music on here is a far cry from the speed/heavy metal they would later play. The riffing is still very bluesy and midpaced, and the songs which would later make it onto their self titled album are slower and more relaxed than their later day counterparts. The ones which didn't get included had the most prominent blues influence, from the classic rock riffage of 'On Parole' to the pure rock 'n' roll track 'Leaving Here'. Listening to them now it is easy to see why they didn't make it onto the debut, not because they weren't enjoyable but more because they aren't as heavy as the rest of the tracks and therefore would seem out of place on later records. There is even a song on here which sounds a lot like old school punk rock , that being 'City Kids'.\n\nLemmy's voice is a lot less harsher than it would later become, and sometimes he doesn't sound anything like he later would. His vocals are more smoother and melodic before, which suits the riffing well. The production is what you would expect from Mot\u00f6rhead; raw and unpolished.\n\nWhen you put all this together you get a fairly competent classic rock album. While not being anything near the heaviness of their later songs, it is still enjoyable, and if nothing else it is recommended for the historical value behind it.\n",
        "\n\"Another Perfect Day\" is considered somewhat of an \"odd\" album in the Motorhead discography. The sole studio album to feature ex-Thin Lizzy guitarist Brian Robertson, APD was condemned by critics at the time of it's release as a \"sellout.\" Nothing could be farther from the truth, as the album is a mix of very heavy material, excellent musicianship and an unusual (for Motorhead) melodic twist.\n\n\nNow I'll admit that the album cover art is not the best rendering of Snaggletooth, but musically this album has a lot of diversity to offer.\nOn the rockier side of things is album opener \"Back at the Funny Farm,\" showing off a bit of the punk side of Motorhead. \"One Track Mind\" is a slow groover, similar in style to \"Metropolis.\" Single \"Shine\" is a classic track and shows off Robertson's playing style well. \n\n\n\"I've Got Mine\" is the true treasure from this album. I hesitate to call any Motorhead song \"beautiful\" but dammit, this is just a wonderful song. If you ever had any feelings for a woman you've got to relate to this. A very well-written song with great melodic riff, this is Robbo's moment to shred, and the extended solo at the end of the song shows the exceptional talent of this rather unstable guitarist. I love this song, but if anyone wanted to condemn the album as \"AOR\" this one would probably be their focal point. Personally I think a bit of melody in heavy metal, as long as it's not overdone, is a good thing. \n\n\nAnd if anybody wants to say this album is not heavy I've got three words for them, \"Die you Bastard!\" This album-closer has the 'evil' Motorhead sound we all love, Lemmy cranks out the bass on this one. \"Marching Off To War.\" is also on the heavier end of the spectrum here. \n\n\nIf you're a hardcore Motorbanger you already have this. If you've passed it up, don't be put off any longer by the criticisms you may have heard about this album or lineup. Enjoy this unusual but very exciting album album by the might Motorhead. I've got mine, now you go and get yours!\n",
        "\nMotorhead's last album with Fast Eddie Clarke on guitars is an alcohol drenched, speed-fueled rampage of sex and fast living. Iron Fist my all-time favorite album by the band. And let's face it, after more than 30 years Motorhead is more than just a band: it's a way of life and I've got the tattoo to prove it. \n\n\nIt seems that the band itself doesn't regard the album as highly as some fans do:Iron Fist has been called \"subpar\" in comparison with the others. And internal relationships were strained by the time of the album's release. This is the only reason I deducted a point from my score. You simply can't go wrong with any of these songs, all of them are the classic Motorhead sound, catchy as hell and all of them kick like a mule. This is down-and-dirty heavy metal the way it was meant to be played. Songs range from midpaced heavy rockers (\"America\") to full-on speed assaults such as the title track and \"Speed Freak,\" which has some awesome ovedubbed guitar work courtesy of Fast Eddie. Although the guitar riff to \"(Don't Need) Religion\" has been compared to \"Cat Scratch Fever,\" the lyrics are hilarious and sum up Lemmy's (as well as my own) feelings on the subject. Make sure to get the re-release which has some essential bonus tracks and alternate versions. \n\n\nMotorhead is one of the essential groups in Heavy Metal history, niched comfortably between Judas Priest and Venom in the historical scheme of things. They combined metal, punk and the blues in a way that no other band could possibly imagine, and they're still rocking today. You owe it to yourself to get this album and bang that head like a maniac. \"Devils grip, the Iron Fist!,\" Hell yeah!\n",
        "\nYou don't have to be ground-breaking, sophisticated, or even sober to record a classic heavy metal album. All you need to do is rock really fucking hard and have the balls to back it up. Such is the case with Motorhead, one of the grimiest, energetic, most badass bands to ever kick some ass and play some tunes. Ace of Spades isn't necessarily the best thing they've ever cranked out, but it's certainly their most well known and easily one of their most memorable. \n\nThis is not an album you'll have to relisten to several times to catch all the subtleties. This is as straightforward and accessible as they come. Whether Motorhead is ripping through some intense speed metal (\"Ace of Spades,\" \"The Hammer\") or laying down a dose of laid-back, bluesy rock and roll (\"Fast and Loose,\" \"The Chase is Better Than the Catch\"), Lemmy and the boys keep it heavy and they keep it catchy. Great riffing, tight rhythm section, lots of lead, and lyrics you can't help but sing-along to. The ever rough and gruff Lemmy Kilmister delivers some great lines on this one, hitting up all the band's usually subject matter. Songs about drinking, songs about gambling, songs about fornication, songs about writing songs about said topics, it's all here, delivered with a great sense of songwriting and tons of attitude. Motorhead fans pretty much need to own this one. \n\nIf there's one thing that holds this release back, it's that it suffers from the same problem as most of Motorhead's discography, that being repetitiveness. About half-way into this album, you'll start to wonder if you're hearing the same riffs, leads, and vocal melodies from earlier songs. This isn't exactly the case, but there isn't a lot of variety on here (an effect that's furthered by the inclusion of the bonus tracks). Ace of Spades is just straightforward, ballbusting heavy metal. The repetitive nature of their albums does hinder some of their later releases, but here it's still quite fresh and easy to listen to whether you're new to the band or if you own all their albums. Recommended if you want to have a good time.\n",
        "\nThere are times when you just gotta go with what's tried and true to get yourself off, and what better way to do it than a slice of patented Manic Motorheadbanging Mania? The opening track of this album alone will get you up and running in the morning as a prime example of that, but in classic Lemmy fashion I'm getting ahead of myself.\n\nThis, contrary to what the last reviewer said, is just as good as \"Inferno\" in my opinion. It has a similar clear and room-filling production job and musically, wellll...it's Motorhead! If you are at all familiar with them, you know what you're getting; a bludgeoning hodgepodge of chundering speed metal (\"Sucker\", \"Trigger\"), heavy raunchy blues (\"One Night Stand\", \"Christine\"), straight ahead pounding rock n' roll ( \"Devil I Know\"), and even a mellow ballad--mellow by 'Head standards anyway--called \"God Was Never On Your Side\". These songs are, incidentally, my favorites so far on the album.\n\nThe latter song surprised me not because of it starting with soft acoustic guitar jangling, but because Lemmy weighs in with a heartfelt vocal performance that is a subdued croon as opposed to his customary grizzled growl (though he gets in plenty of that on the choruses) . And the tune is still mighty heavy, it's just different, and they pull it off well. The rest of this album is rib-sticking fare, with Mikkey Dee battering his drums like they done him wrong, lots of Phil Campbell's fine bluesy guitar work and thick riffs, and that inimitable trademark chainsaw bass massacre and lycanthropic throat warble that can only issue from the legendary Lemmy Kilmister. But \"Sucker\"...whew! That is one of the best album openers I've heard in some time, with its relentless drive and thundering roar of riffs and jackhammer drums. \n\nThere are the usual jabs at organized religion lyrically, as well as life's struggles, woman troubles and the joy of women as well (\"Christine\" has a downright playful feel)--you were expecting Lemmy to write about the plight of Tibet or something? It does dip a little at the end, hence the less than perfect rating, but even that is not so bad; the less than perfect fare on this album is still head and shoulders above the best that many bands can offer. And Phil Campbell's son, Todd, even gets a writing credit on the last song, \"Going Down\", as he had originally written it for his band, Skawd. Dad nicked it for this album, though, and the kid has a future if this is anything to go by. \n\nLast thing you need to know? It's fuckin' Motorhead, man! Of course it's going to be good. And that's my final word.\n",
        "\nWhen it comes to \"best of\" collections, Motorhead are just as guilty as Black Sabbath of putting out retarded amounts of compilations including remixes of singles, B-sides, cover songs, and some general unreleased tracks. This certain collection has everything I've just mentioned, but thank God that the majority of material found here is pure classic metal. \n\nThis 2000 \"Best of Motorhead\" release contains all of the band's classics, (\"Ace of Spades,\" \"Overkill,\" \"Killed by Death,\" etc.) but this compilation is a gem because it successfully throws in newer material from the lesser known albums of the 90's. Old-schoolers may scoff at this notion, but songs like \"Sacrifice\" and \"Snake Bite Love\" are just as filthy and lovable as the likes of \"Orgasmatron.\" Also included are some unreleased live tracks, long-lost B-sides, and cover songs. (Included a sweet-ass rendition of The Sex Pistols' \"God Save the Queen.\") It's a perfect blending of Motorhead material for the novice who's looking for a fresh start with the band's sound.\n\nOne more great thing about this release is the extensive liner notes detailing the inner aspects of the band's existence, such as line-up changes, recording sessions, and tours. Lemmy goes into great detail about the band's classic line-up and why it had to change, and gives the history of things with the present band roster. The booklet also includes plenty of classic pictures of the band, from the earliest time they formed to present-day.\n\nI do have one complaint, though; The focus strays from Motorhead at certain points through the collection's duration, such as Girlschool's cover of \"Bomber\" and Hawkwind's version of \"Motorhead.\" (The latter of which is actually really weird. There are fucking saxophones in the song, I shit you not.) I understand the effects some of these things had on Motorhead musically and historically; but for someone who is just looking to get into the band on a casual level, those things could be viewed as pretty worthless. However, I will say that these things are probably a huge bonus for long-time fans of the band, and at worst they do no harm.\n\nIf you're looking to get into the dirty world of Motorhead and don't have the dough for the \"Stone Deaf Forever\" collection, this compilation is an excellent starting point.\n",
        "\nMot\u00f6rhead's \u201cNo Sleep 'til Hammersmith\u201d is quite simply, amazing. At the height of the live album movement in the late 1970\u2019s the market was saturated with them, some good, some not so good, and the occasional great one. Well \u201cNo Sleep \u2018til Hammersmith\u201d falls under that great category.\n\nSo what makes it so great? Well there\u2019s something special about a live album when a band connects with the energy of the crowd and uses it to play more ferocious and vigorous than ever before. Well sometimes this happens on individual songs for certain bands such as \u201cDo You Feel Like I Do\u201d with Peter Frampton on \u201cFrampton Comes Alive\u201d, or for a majority of the album, as with AC/DC\u2019s \u201cIf You Want Blood\u2026\u201d does. But with \u201cNo Sleep \u2018til Hammersmith\u201d this connection happens when the first note of \u201cAce of Spades\u201d is struck and doesn\u2019t give up until the last note of \u201cMot\u00f6rhead\u201d subsides. This makes for one of the most awesome performances recorded for a live album.\n\nAnother merit of this album is the production. It is near perfect for what the band is going for. It possesses enough crowd noise to sound raw, but never becoming a nuisance. And each instrument sounds clear and crisp, and none ever gets muffled. To put it in simple terms, the production is raw without sounding bad, in other-words, great live production!\n\nAnd as for song quality, this delivers with wall to wall hits! This includes of requisite favorites (most coming from \u201cBomber\u201d, \u201cOverkill\u201d, and \u201cAce of Spades\u201d, but also includes two from their self titled debut.). Another smart move on their behalf is putting \u201cAce of Spades\u201d up first instead of packing it in the middle. Why is this such a smart move? Simple, it grabs your attention and doesn\u2019t let go. All these songs on here are worthy inclusions and none will have you scratching your head as to why it was on here. Another note, is the performance: in a word, it's breakneck. \n\nSo, as you can clearly see, Mot\u00f6rhead's \u201cNo Sleep 'til Hammersmith\u201d, is, with no overstatement, one of the greatest live albums ever. Period. Not only is this an essential for their fans, but listening to it will make you become one. You can\u2019t go wrong with Mot\u00f6rhead's \u201cNo Sleep 'til Hammersmith\u201d.\n",
        "\nMot\u00f6rhead have never been able to record two good albums back-to-back (the only exception being 1983\u2019s \u201cAnother Perfect Day\u201d and 1986\u2019s \u201cOrgasmatron\u201d). Maybe the reason for this \u201canomaly\u201d was the fact that these were the only two consecutive Mot\u00f6rhead - albums that were recorded by two completely different line-ups (apart from Lemmy, of course).\n\nOn the basis of this theory after 2004\u2019s fantastic \u201cInferno\u201d it was time for a \u201cbad\u201d album. Of course this is pretty misleading as this is a really good album, but compared to the 93% I would have given \u201cInferno\u201d there is a difference of 11%, and this is quite a lot in that high range.\n\nTherefore I have to say that Lemmy is wrong when he claims that \"It's better than 'Inferno'\u2026 It's better songs, better arrangements and a better performance from me vocally, and a better performance from Phil Campbell on the guitar; he plays great on the songs.\"\n\nIt\u2019s true, however, that Phil\u2019s guitar playing and Lemmy\u2019s vocal performance are great, but I don\u2019t think they are better than their work on \u201cInferno\u201d. The Cameron Webb - production of \u201cKiss Of Death\u201d is not even similar to the production on \u201cInferno\u201d but it\u2019s identical, and therefore the only difference between these two albums is the quality of the songs.\n\n\u201cKiss Of Death\u201d is full of good songs, but if you compare both albums as a whole \u201cInferno\u201d always seems to be one step ahead, as the songs seem to be that little bit stronger, plus \u201cInferno\u201d did not contain even one filler, while \u201cKiss Of Death\u201d contains a few songs I usually skip, e.g. \u201cUnder The Gun\u201d (good pre-chorus though) or the \u201cSacrifice\u201d-styled \u201cKingdom Of The Worm\u201d.\n\nOf course \u201cKiss Of Death\u201d has its share of potential classics, just listen to the choruses of \u201cTrigger\u201d and \u201cChristine\u201d (you can\u2019t get any better than that) or \u201cGod Was Never On Your Side\u201d - Mot\u00f6rhead-ballad number 8, and a masterpiece just like the previous 7!\n\nLast but not least, I will never understand Mot\u00f6rhead\u2019s criteria for choosing a particular song for a video. \u201cLife\u2019s A Bitch\u201d was an odd choice, to say the least (this would actually have been the last song I would have chosen from \u201cInferno\u201d), and this time they did it again by choosing \u201cBe My Baby\u201d for the video.\n\n\u201cKiss Of Death\u201d is so similar to \u201cInferno\u201d that it can be seen as a sequel. So if you liked \u201cInferno\u201d you can\u2019t do anything wrong by purchasing this one as well, but if you have to choose only one of them \u201cInferno\u201d is the one to get!\n",
        "\nHow do you write a review for a 5-CD box that that contains 99 songs or over 6 hours of music? I think such a collection should be pretty comprehensive and therefore I will concentrate on the songs or versions of songs\n1. that should be on here but aren\u2019t and\n2. that need not necessarily be on here but are.\n\nThe early years (1975 - 1977) are covered pretty well, including the far superior (Single-) versions of \u201cCity Kids\u201d and \u201cWhite Line Fever\u201d. However, I would have included the \u201cultimate\u201d versions of \u201cLeavin\u2019 Here\u201d (from the \u201cGolden Years\u201d EP) \u201cMotorhead\u201d (from \u201cNo Sleep \u2018Til Hammersmith\u201d). \n\nThe Bronze years (1979 - 1982):\nHello? Where is \u201cDamage Case\u201d? WHERE THE FUCK IS \u201cDAMAGE CASE\u201d?\nIf I had to pick a few songs from \u201cOverkill\u201d that must not be left out, it would be the title track, \u201cDamage Case\u201d, \u201cStay Clean\u201d and \u201cNo Class\u201d. If absolutely necessary, I could even live without the last two, but there is no excuse for leaving out one of the other two, especially when you include 9 of the 10 songs of that album!\nOf the \u201cIron Fist\u201d tracks I would have replaced \u201cDon\u2019t Need Religion\u201d by e.g. \u201cSpeedfreak\u201d plus I think \u201cJailbait\u201d and even more so \u201cThe Hammer\u201d (both from \u201cAce Of Spades\u201d) should have found their way on this compilation. It\u2019s, however, justifiable to leave them out, but I will never understand the motives for including one of two (!) HEADGIRL - songs, namely \u201cPlease Don\u2019t Touch\u201d and leaving out the fuckin\u2019 brilliant \u201cEmergency\u201d.\nOn a positive note, they included the Hammersmith - version of \u201cWe Are The Roadcrew\u201d and the MOT\u00d6RDAMN - version of \u201cOver The Top\u201d.\n\nThe Eighties (without Eddie Clarke) (1983 - 1989):\nWith only 3 songs the fantastic \u201cAnother Perfect Day\u201d is a little underrepresented, plus there is no excuse for ignoring such standout - tracks as \u201cBack At The Funny Farm\u201d and \u201cDancing On Your Grave\u201d.\nFor the \u201cNo Remorse\u201d compilation Mot\u00f6rhead recorded 4 new tracks. Again, if you include 3 of 4 songs, don\u2019t leave off something like the blistering \u201cLocomotive\u201d, plus \u201cKilled By Death\u201d, like \u201cAce Of Spades\u201d, is just one of those classics that must be included in its original incarnation, no matter how good any other version might be.\nThe same goes basically for the complete \u201cOrgasmatron\u201d album. (If you wanna know why, just read my review for that album)\nThe song-selection from \u201cRock 'n' Roll\u201d is great, but \u201cAll For You\u201d (if only for the chorus) shouldn\u2019t be missing.\nEXCLUSIVE! If there has ever been a song that fits that definition it\u2019s \u201cBlack Leather Jacket\u201d. Never released anywhere, this unknown song is so good, that even the guys at Allmusic marked it as one of the highlights. (Don\u2019t get me wrong, I love this site, but when it comes to Metal they often seem to have not the slightest idea what they\u2019re talking about.)\n\nThe later years (1991 - 2002): \n\u201cThe One To Sing The Blues\u201d was good enough to be lifted from 1991\u2019s masterpiece \u201c1916\u201d, but not to make it on this compilation? Moreover, if the haunting title track wasn\u2019t a milestone in the evolution of this band I don\u2019t know which song was!\nJust like \u201cAll For You\u201d (from \u201cRock \u2018n\u2019 Roll\u201d) \u201cToo Good To Be True\u201d (from \u201cMarch \u00d6r Die\u201d) may not be a fan-favourite, but it gives me the creeps every time I listen to it. The other song from \u201cMarch \u00d6r Die\u201d I\u2019m missing is \u201cHellraiser\u201d (another single), although, frankly, it can\u2019t quite compete with Ozzy\u2019s version.\n\u201cBastards\u201d should have gotten an extra paragraph, because what happened here borders on sabotage! I think there is no justification whatsoever for leaving off only one of the first 9 songs of this album. But what really bothers me is the fact that the mind-blowing \u201cDeath Or Glory\u201d AND \u201cLiar\u201d AND the brilliant ballads \u201cLost In The Ozone\u201d AND \u201cDon\u2019t Let Daddy Kiss Me\u201d (another disregarded single) are missing, while \u201cDevils\u201d can be found on here!\nFrom \u201cSacrifice\u201d to \u201cHammered\u201d only the album tracks were taken for this compilation, so there is no risk of getting the \u201cwrong\u201d versions.\nJust like \u201cAnother Perfect Day\u201d \u201cSacrifice\u201d is pretty underrepresented, as there are missing fantastic songs like \u201cAll Gone To Hell\u201d, \u201cDon\u2019t Waste Your Time\u201d and \u201cIn Another Time\u201d.\nThe same goes for \u201cSnake Bite Love\u201d, as \u201cDead And Gone\u201d, \u201cDon\u2019t Lie To Me\u201d or \u201cDesperate For You\u201d were not included.\nThe catchy \u201cOut To Lunch\u201d and, especially, the atypical (or even unique) \u201cWake The Dead\u201d from \u201cWe Are Mot\u00f6rhead\u201d should have found their way on this album as well.\nFinally, if I had to pick one song from the \u201cHammered\u201d album to be included here, it would be the (at least by Mot\u00f6rhead standards) insanely fast \u201cRed Raw\u201d. This song is certainly not representative for the album (it actually doesn\u2019t even fit on the album at all), but it\u2019s one of the fastest and heaviest Mot\u00f6rhead - tracks of all time, and if that doesn\u2019t qualify for a Best of-compilation, what does?\n\nConclusion:\nThis is a pretty good box-set, although 5 CDs are probably far too much for the casual listener, while the hardcore fan probably owns their regular albums anyway. For the people in-between, however, this might be the perfect choice.\n\nThe early years and a few albums, like \u201cBomber\u201d or \u201cOvernight Sensation\u201d are covered pretty completely and, apart from the \u201cDamage Case\u201d disaster, the best songs from the Bronze years are included as well. By purchasing this box-set you may also abandon other albums, such as \u201cRock \u2018n\u2019 Roll\u201d, \u201cMarch \u00d6r Die\u201d, \u201cWe Are Mot\u00f6rhead\u201d or \u201cHammered\u201d.\n\nOn the other hand, I think there are a few albums that are masterpieces in themselves and should be owned and heard in their entirety, like \u201c1916\u201d and \u201cOrgasmatron\u201d. However, if you don\u2019t share my opinion, then this box-set should be sufficient for you, as these albums are very well represented.\n\nEspecially in combination with other compilations (e.g. the Lemmy - Anthology \u201cDamage Case\u201d would be a great supplement) or certain live albums (e.g. the fantastic \u201cEverything Louder\u2026\u201d from \u201998 or THE classic live album \u201cNo Sleep \u2018Til Hammersmith\u201d - you must have that one anyway, even if you hate this band!) \u201cStone Deaf Forever\u201d could be the focal point of a pretty exhaustive collection although a few albums, like \u201cAnother Perfect Day\u201d, \u201cBastards\u201d, \u201cSacrifice\u201d and \u201cSnakebite Love\u201d are just underrepresented.\n\nThe missing must-have songs diminish the score to about 75%, but the combination of \u201cStone Deaf Forever\u201d with one or another studio album, compilation or live album could make this box-set the perfect choice for you and lift the score to even 95%, which results in an average of 85%.\n",
        "\nMot\u00f6rhead have never made a \u201cbad\u201d studio album, but they have never made a \u201cperfect\u201d studio album either. However, between 1986 and 1993 they came pretty close three times: with \u201c1991\u201d, (the first 3 quarters of) \u201cBastards\u201d and \u201cOrgasmatron\u201d. (see my profile for a complete list of my ratings for all Mot\u00f6rhead albums)\n\nIn 1982 \u201cFast\u201d Eddie Clarke gave way to new guitarist Brian Robertson, who played on 1983\u2019s fantastic \u201cAnother Perfect Day\u201d. Although he didn\u2019t fit the band attitude-wise, to say the least, he added a new dimension to Mot\u00f6rhead\u2019s sound. It was however the introduction of Phil Campbell and Wurzel in 1984, that enabled the band to record a few of their best albums. And this line-up started off with a bang, \u2018cause the first thing the world heard of them was the single for one of the true Metal anthems of all time: \u201cKilled By Death\u201d.\n\nI got to know this band in 1985 or 1986 and I think it was the video for this song that introduced me to them. (You know, Lemmy jumping out of a grave on a bike\u2026) That was just the right time to come into touch with Mot\u00f6rhead, because they were just about to release their true masterpiece!\n\nMany people seem to have a problem with the sound, but I still can\u2019t relate to this. Yes, this is certainly no 80\u2019s-Mutt-Lange-Million-Dollar-production, and maybe Bill Laswell didn\u2019t even know how to produce that kind of music (even my 1997 reissue CD version has a few dropouts at the beginning of a few songs), but in the end, he managed to get a sound, that was raw as fuck - the kind of sound that, I guess, a lot of punk bands would kill for - plus he added a few small but effective details that put the finishing touches on a few songs, e.g. the drum sound before the chorus in \u201cClaw\u201d or at the beginning of \u201cMean Machine\u201d.\n\nThis album shows Mot\u00f6rhead at their fiercest: Just listen to the completely out-of-time drumming at the beginning and at the end of the afore-mentioned \u201cMean Machine\u201d, which sounds like Pete Gill running amok, or Lemmy\u2019s insane screaming at the end of \u201cClaw\u201d, and you know what I mean.\n\nFrom the 9 songs found on here, \u201cDoctor Rock\u201d is the only \u201clighter\u201d one. The rest is fast or anthemic mid-tempo stuff. Mot\u00f6rhead seemed to have counted more on the mid-tempo tracks, as they took \u201cDeaf Forever\u201d and \u201cBuilt For Speed\u201d (renamed \u201cOn The Road\u201d) for the single. The third slower one is the well-known title track; a song that, in my opinion, no band should ever try to cover. Although I don\u2019t think that it\u2019s better than the other tracks on here, it seems to be perfect as it is, as proven by all the bands that have tried to cover it (including Sepultura), but didn\u2019t even come close to the intensity of the original.\n\nThis is basically a perfect album, and the only thing that prevents this album from getting a 100% rating is the (good, but not quite perfect) chorus of \u201cMean Machine\u201d.\n\nI\u2019ve just realized that this album has recently been released as a double CD (2006), including a shitload of live tracks plus the songs that have already been on the 1997 re-release, i.e. the b-sides of the \u201cDeaf Forever\u201d 12\u201d and an alternative version of \u201cClaw\u201d.\n\nI\u2019ve listened to this album many, many, many times during the past 20 years, but it just won\u2019t wear out. \u201cOrgasmatron\u201d will always be one of the most important albums of my life, needless to say that it stands as one of the best albums ever made!\n",
        "\nMotorhead returned to form with their last masterpiece Inferno, while Hammered was a heavy record, the songwriting and riffs just weren\u2019t as strong as on previous efforts. Seemed to me like Lemmy spent most of his energy for the track \u201cThe Game\u201d which was good, but when linked to television stunt man Triple H I just found it unlistenable. Inferno kicked some life into the band which could have easily continued down the path of Hammered and began their downward spiral as has happened with many a metal band. So pumped were Lemmy and company that it spawned a dvd from the tour and it doesn\u2019t take a genius to see that Motorhead are still having a blast on stage after all these years.\nWhich brings us to the new album entitled Kiss of Death again a vintage Lemmy Kilmister tongue in cheek and memorable like always. Kiss of Death features a bakers\u2019 dozen of fast, pummeling, driving rock \u2018n\u2019 roll that we have come to expect and that has earned Motorhead their notorious reputation as the #1 road band in the world. One thing though, while this record is outstanding, you might not really think so at first listen. On Kiss of Death Motorhead incoporate contemporary rock elements, which caught me off guard, no they didn\u2019t rid themselves of their gritty sound. However they have proven that they can hang with the young guns. Which if done right doesn\u2019t embarrass the old timers.\nKiss of Death features some impressive moments, my favorite tracks on this album are; \u201cGod Was Never On Your Side,\u201d another example of the genius of Lemmy Kilmister, he is one of the best songwriters that the mainstream media doesn\u2019t know about. I also enjoy \u201cUnder the Gun,\u201d which if you fancy \u201cYou Better Run,\u201d or their blues stuff like \u201cHoochie Koochie Man,\u201d you\u2019ll just devour this track! And there\u2019s the straight up rocker entitled \u201cChristine\u201d this one is no doubt influence by Lemmy\u2019s love of Rockabilly music and Little Richard, it\u2019s just so evident. And the closer on Kiss of Death find Motorhead revisiting a number from 1918 \u201cR.A.M.O.N.E.S.\u201d which makes it\u2019s return as a tribute to the fallen Ramones members. Motorhead has been around for 30 plus years and Kiss of Death is an example of a band\u2019s ability to buck trends and keep it fresh despite being locked into their signature sound.\n",
        "\nThis boxset includes the most successful albums of the classic Mot\u00c3\u00b6rhead line-up: Overkill, Bomber, Ace of spades, Iron fist. For some reason their debut is missing. With the music itself is great but I will devote this small review only to the package, the albums would better be reviewed separately. \n\nThe albums come in a little carton box with an all right cover, the back lists all the albums with tracklists. It also says that Iron first is exclusive to this re-lease, funny... The cds are packed in thin paper LP imitations, with a paper sleeve (without pressings except for Iron Fist). Very fragile and looking cheep. Also included are little booklet without lyrics that gives a lame introduction to band and a sticker (!).\nDon't expect the bonus tracks of the regular 'New Castle' releases here only the original songs are included.\n\nThis boxset was a disappointment due to it's cheap design, even more because the 'New Castle' re-releases are much better and not much more expensive when bought separately. This review server therefore as a warning for anyone who wants to buy this.\n\nI have to give this boxset a 20% rating, and that's only for the sticker.\n",
        "\nAs a Motorheadbanger for over 20 years on my end, I guess I am biased in giving this such a high review. But so what? This DVD is positively incredible on all levels, and I am in love with it. \n\nIt reflects a healthy cross section of Lemmy & the boys' output through the years, and quite a few songs are unearthed, dusted off, and put through their paces that haven't been heard in ages as of these days. We're talking the likes of \"Metropolis\" and \"Dancing on Your Grave\" here, and a couple other songs from \"Another Perfect Day\", one of Lemmy's least favorite (and ironically one of my favorite) 'Head albums, \"Going To Brazil\" and the like. A very good selection of new and less known tracks alongside the usual suspects makes the track selection alone a keeper. \n\nLemmy...aside from his pronounced bald spot you get to see because of the excellent camera work, the man doesn't seem to age at all. He looms behind his trademark upraised microphone spitting out his lyrics with the same conviction as ever, mauling his signature Rickenbacker bass to death as his (older than me) Marshalls roar like beasts of prey. In fact, he drowns out Phil Campbell's guitar for a good third of the set, which is OK with me! Phil, however, makes up for this with no less than three wailing, searing extended solos at the beginning, middle, and end of one of my all time anthems of theirs, \"Just Cos You Got The Power\". His bluesy stringbending and raunchy riffing bravely stands up to Lemmy's deafening sawed-off shotgun barrage. And Mikkey Dee...how does the man do it? He keeps up the tempos perfectly with unearthly stamina, best demonstrated by his crazed drum solo in \"Sacrifice\" where he keeps both kick drums going furiously for at least the first two minutes of it nonstop. Motorhead are not spring chickens, so to see them putting on such a tight, overwhelming, and high-energy show is inspiring to an old fart like me.\n\nAs mentioned, all the classics are covered (I need not name them), and other newer numbers like \"R.A.M.O.N.E.S.\", \"Going To Brazil\", \"Just Cos You Got The Power\", and new songs from \"Inferno\" like the thundering \"In The Name of Tragedy\" (where Mikkey really shines) get equal treatment, which is to say they surge forth with devastating power and throat-ripping intensity. I say that partly because even with puny TV speaker this will skin your ears. The 2.0 and 5.1 stereo sound mixes are KILLER to say the least--I didn't even have this on that loud and my wife could hear it loud and clear on the other side of the house! \n\nOther than Lemmy drowning out Phil a good part of the time the sound and mix are perfect, giving you a taster of what they're like live. The key word is taster, as seeing them live is the only way to experience the full 'Head treatment. The camera work is for the most part pretty straightforward, with some wacky pixillation effects thrown in for good measure that actually add an interesting feel to the show on display. Very col and tastefully done, these effects are, only occasionally popping up to throw your head for a loop now and again.\n\nThe extra features are amusing enough, with a lengthy roadie documentary showing how efficient and dedicated their crew are to their jobs being the centerpiece. Their thick Scots and British accents are subtitled! In fact, an odd feature that pops up is the band's commentary in subtitle form as you watch the concert...and the subtitles that pop up as the interview segments with the band commence. I can understand them perfectly well, but maybe this is for non-English-speaking fans or something? Whatever, it's a minimal annoyance at best.\n\nIf you are any kind of headbanger at all, this needs to be in your collection. Period paragraph.\n",
        "\n\u201cWe\u2019re Mot\u00f6rhead. We\u2019re gonna kick your ass.\u201d When Lemmy addresses the audience with these words, you know this is going to be one hell of a live album \u2013 even before the opener \u201cIron Fist\u201d comes blasting through your speakers. Mot\u00f6rhead have a well-deserved reputation as outstanding live performers, so there shouldn\u2019t be any doubt the guys will thoroughly deliver the goods on this one.\n\nIn fact, their performance on Everything Louder than Everyone Else is so good you have a hard time believing the band actually consists of only three people. Never during the course of the entire album, for instance, do you miss the presence of second guitarist \u2013 Lemmy and the boys play together so well that another six-stringer is simply not needed. Moreover, Lemmy uses his bass much like a rhythm guitar, effectively stuffing any \u201choles\u201d in the band\u2019s sound that would otherwise result from their only being a three-piece. Add the more than capable play of Phil Campbell, the jaw-dropping performance of drummer Mikkey Dee, who at one point during the show is referred to by Lemmy as \u201cthe best drummer in the world\u201d (a statement that doesn\u2019t seem pretentious at all), the great sound quality of the recording, and the smart song selection and you have all the pieces in place for a great live album.\n\nSpeaking of the recording quality, this sure isn\u2019t another one of those fake \u201cUnleashed in the Studio\u201d deals, so if you want everything to sound as clean and perfect as on a studio recording, this probably isn\u2019t your cup of tea. The sound on Everything Louder is, well, loud and quite raw, but it\u2019s not in the least indistinct, i.e. you can still hear every instrument very clearly. All in all the sound quality is almost perfect for a Mot\u00f6rhead live album, and the fact that some minor on-stage screwups weren\u2019t subsequently eliminated in the studio only adds to the authenticity that is so characteristic of this record. Just listen to Lemmy as his singing voice is gradually deserting him during \u201cKilled by Death\u201d\u2026 priceless!\n\nAnother plus is the way Lemmy\u2019s interaction with the audience is captured on the live recording \u2013 there\u2019s enough of it to convey an authentic concert atmosphere, yet it\u2019s never overdone to a point where it would disturb the flow of the music. It also helps the atmosphere of the album that it was recorded entirely at the same venue in Hamburg, Germany, whereas many bands put out live albums consisting of songs that were recorded at lots of different venues. More often than not, such albums seem disjointed and artificial.\n\nFinally, the song selection on Everything Louder leaves nothing to be desired, thanks to a very shrewd mix of older and newer songs (Snake Bite Love was their most recent studio album at the time). The great classics such as \u201cIron Fist,\u201d \u201cBomber,\u201d \u201cKilled by Death,\u201d \u201cOrgasmatron,\u201d or \u201cAce of Spades\u201d are all here, as are lesser-known but equally amazing songs like \u201cBurner\u201d (now that\u2019s what I call fast!), \u201cLost in the Ozone\u201d (underrated semi-ballad featuring Lemmy trying to actually sing), \u201cNothing up My Sleeve,\u201d or \u201cLove for Sale.\u201d Lemmy and the boys even play the songs with an extra amount of energy and speed as compared to their studio versions, which aren\u2019t exactly slow either\u2026 It\u2019s quite a blast to listen to them shredding through the set at light speed while still retaining flawless precision!\n\nMot\u00f6rhead were truly born to raise hell, and it shows on Everything Louder than Everyone Else. This is definitely worth your hard-earned money, so you\u2019d better drag your butt to the nearest record store and get this, especially since it should be available at a very reasonable price.\n\nChoicest cuts: Are you kidding me? All of them of course!\n",
        "\nMy fellow Motorhead fans often evince scorn and derision for this album, wringing their hands at the new improved sound the band brought forth with then new and expanded line up. But when a band has a catalog as deep as this and generally of superior consistent quality, opinions are sure to be passionate and obstinate. To bring the reader up to speed history wise, this album was Motorhead\u2019s first after the general membership disintegration of \u201984. Following the cliff notes version of the band\u2019s past that was No Remorse, the band got into major legal scrapes with Bronze records, and found themselves unemployed soon after. However GWR records signed the band and dropkicked them into the studio will NYC dance and hip hop producer supreme Bill Laswell. An odd choice, sure, but the sonic evidence is what should be considered, not the guy\u2019s past.\n\n\nAnd so, on to Orgasmatron\u2026it\u2019s undeniably a \u201cdifferent\u201d entry in the band\u2019s work, and for a few reasons. Firstly, two of it\u2019s best tracks (both musically and lyrically, Lemmy\u2019s poetry had taken on superior quality by this time) sounded much better when played live then in their somewhat squashed versions here. Said cuts, \u201cBuilt For Speed\u201d and the titanic \u201cDead Forever\u201d would come across much finer backed with the full concert battery of the band\u2019s legendary concert volume, as here they sound a touch sonically compressed. Some thrashy quickies are also along for the ride, both of them uniformly fine, if not exactly legendary (\u201cRidin\u2019 With The Driver,\u201d \u201cMean Machine\u201d) and \u201cDoctor Rock\u201d is a fine fall to your knees and repent if you please sermon of metal intent from king Lem. Both Wurzel and Campbell give good accounts of themselves as the new guitars on hand, and the drum production is thunder, pure and simple (what did you expect from a hip hop producer). \n\n\nBut the true monolith here is the title song, a stomping, cavernous diatribe about world control systems, delivered by Lemmy in a nearly monotone croak that would make it\u2019s intended targets crap their bloomers if they ever got to lend ears to it. Playing the roles of Preacher, Politician and War itself, Lemmy let\u2019s us know that obedience is death, the bastards are all out to grind us down, and unless we wise the hell up, we\u2019re all doomed. But never mind my less that astute assessment of this. Let\u2019s let Lemmy speak for himself:\n\nI am the one, Orgasmatron, the outstretched grasping hand\nMy image is of agony, my servants rape the land\nObsequious and arrogant, clandestine and vain\nTwo thousand years of misery, of torture in my name\nHypocrisy made paramount, paranoia the law\nMy name is called religion, sadistic, sacred whore.\n\nI twist the truth, I rule the world, my crown is called deceit\nI am the emperor of lies, you grovel at my feet\nI rob and I slaughter you, your downfall is my gain\nAnd still you play the sycophant and revel in your pain\nAnd all my promises are lies, all my love is hate\nI am the politician, and I decide your fate\n\nI march before a martyred world, an army for the fight\nI speak of great heroic days, of victory and might\nI hold a banner drenched in blood, I urge you to be brave\nI lead you to your destiny, I lead you to your grave\nYour bones will built my palaces, your eyes will stud my crown\nFor I am Mars, the god of war, and I will cut you down.\n\n\nMy friends, it just does not get any heavier than that. A side note: this album came out in 1986, two years after Bronze records had written the band off as a spent force. It\u2019s 20 plus years later as I write this, and the band have two more decades of strong, possibly even better material behind them. Nothing like hindsight, eh?\n",
        "\nYou may have noticed by now (or not, doesn\u2019t matter) that there are damn few compilation records rated on this site, also known as Greatest Hits and/or Best Of collections. That\u2019s because most of them suck. No seriously, most of \u2018em are redundant, repetitive, and hardly revelatory and often contain material the band in question wouldn\u2019t have released if the record company heads had their family members at gunpoint. But as in most other ways, Motorhead is a different story, and No Remorse is not your average \u201cas seen on TV\u201d product. \n\n\nQuick background. As 1984 dawned, Brian Robertson was dishonorably discharged from the Motor-ranks, being a gent of vast talent but sporadic execution. Thus, Field Marshall Lemmy recruited two new and generally unknown guitarists to replace him, ex-Persian Risk man Phil Campbell and totally out of the blue character Mick \u201cWurzel\u201d Burston. This decision made, Philthy Animal Taylor quit the band, leaving Lemmy in the lurch (kind of appropriate; he was nicknamed \u201cthe lurch\" in Hawkwind days). And so as a sort of re-assessment of Motor-history and preparation for it\u2019s future, a weapons and artillery check was ordered, bolstered by new material as well as dusted-off rarities. \n\n\nThus No Remorse is the perfect Motor-course into the band\u2019s early daze, collecting some of the finest hours of their initial thrust (Motorhead, Overkill, Bomber, Ace Of Spades, No Sleep Til Hammersmith, Iron Fist and Another Perfect Day). Sure, these albums are (almost) all stone cold classics unto themselves and feature plenty of material not on hand here, but the cuts that are be dead on, matey. Of the four new cuts, featuring the aforementioned guitar guys and ex-Saxon drummer Pete Gill, \u201cKilled By Death\u201d stands tallest, featuring not only a foundation rattling drum sound, but a heavier, deeper Motor-sound overall (what a difference an extra guitar makes). Also present are cuts from the legendary EP Saint Valentines Day Massacre, the band recorded with fellow Brits Girlschool, the finest number being a cover version of Johnny Kidd and The Pirates oldie \u201cPlease Don\u2019t Touch.\u201d \n\n\nThus this is the right place to enter the vast and somewhat intimidating Motor-archive, and I must say it was very useful to those of us in the USA at the time of issue, cuz Motorhead stuff was moderately rare to come by here despite the band being huge in England (and Japan and Germany, by the way). Release notes: if you were lucky (and had a full wallet) you could have found a leather bound edition of this collection (seen it, couldn\u2019t afford it). Also I am relatively certain that initial super snazzy CD versions of this release had to edit a few tracks off of the original 2 record set due to running time constraints. And this was the format of the future, eh? A vinyl head like myself cannot help but snicker ruefully at such an ironic turn of events.\n",
        "\nFrom the beginning of this Motorhead album, On Parole, we see on the first place that this is really different from the more common \"agression\" that symbolizes the rock based speed metal practiced by this unique band.\n\nYes, this is not as fast paced or speedy like some previews Motorhead albuns such as Ace of Spades, and the genre of music here practiced its much more softer, it is not speed n'or heavy metal, Mot\u00f6rhead went to the roots of rock and blues and use them to build this great album, with excellent solos and guitar riffs (with the best inspiration that we can find on the preview album, Overkill), and a acceptable drum, soft as well and with great skills. \n\nThe voice is different as well, Lemmy left those rough vocalizations, using this \"drunked based\" clean singing, which is very enjoyable.\n\nThere is also a track, City Kids, that, we could say, its kind of punk/punk Oi! oriented, it sounds like the music from those suburban bands that were playing with no commitments at all, just for the love of music.\n\nSo, this is a very relaxed album, sounding like some friends that gathered on a garage to play some blues and rock tunes, with lots of alcohol on their heads and a great passion for rock n' roll, which is great!\n",
        "\nIf you can stomach almost 2 hours of live Motorhead, you'll respect this record. From Lemmy's opening prophecy \"We are Motorhead, we're gonna kick your arse\" to the final false ending to \"Overkill\", this album sizzles. Lemmy, Phil Campbell and Micky Dee had been playing together over 15 years at this point and it shows. If you turn it up loud enough, everything swirls together and the music envelopes you.\n\nIt's all here, representing all the recognised and forgotten classics in the Motorhead arsenal - and there are many. Most bands would kill to call \"Iron Fist\" their song, Motorhead only get better from there, representing all their best tracks. If anything is truely representitive of the band, an album with the aforementioned tracks and \"Stay Clean\", \"Civil War\", \"Burner\", \"Metropolis\", \"The Chase Is Better Than The Catch\", \"No Class\", \"Sacrifice\", \"Going to Brazil\" and \"Ace Of Spades\" is the best way to introduce someone to the band.\n\n...And a live album shows them that Lemmy speaks in his singing voice! No way!\n",
        "\nHow do you review a Motorhead album? They all tear the guts out of rock and roll getting better the louder they're played\n\nThe opener \"The One to Sing the Blues\" owns, but \"I'm So Bad\" is really where the album starts, fast and loud and everything in between a Motorhead song needs to be. We don't even have to wait long for the next monsters \"Going to Brazil\" a live staple for a reason, \"RAMONES\" and \"Shut You Down\"...fuck I don't know what to say, two in a row.\n\nBut there's a little *gasp* variation here amid these songs. A song like \"1916\" doesn't exist anywhere else in the Motorhead catalogue, some organs and solemn lyrics lamenting war and death. \"Nightmare/Dreamtime\" is an interesting little track carried by Lemmy's vocal presence.\n\nWhile the casual Motorhead fan really only need \"Ace of Spades\" and \"Overkill\" (perhaps \"Hammersmith\" too), the forgotten classic is \"1916\", a fucking beasts so what more is there to say? The band that strings a few chords together and makes a song as fresh as the most inventive prog.\n",
        "\nIf you don\u2019t own a home theater yet, buy, beg, borrow, steal but whatever you do, GET ONE FOR THIS DVD! Quite possibly one of the top 3 concert videos I own and certainly the best camera work that has ever been incorporated in a concert. I was really, really surprised by the quality of every aspect of this release. But let me analyze on each of the aspects:\n\n-Band Performance: Excellent. The band is on fire. A near flawless show; Lemmy is an old wolf but shows his sharp false teeth with a fantastic performance. Phil is fantastic and has managed to incorporate his style on the old songs in a way that the fans love and support. Mickey Dee lives up to the title \u201cthe best drummer in the world\u201d (check out the \u201csacrifice\u201d drum solo). He also plays acoustic guitar on \u201cWhorehouse blues\u201d, a site to see, not only for this but also to finally see what Lemmy looks like on stage singing without playing his bass!\n\n-Setlist: The setlist is very rewarding and contains some awesome surprises for the Motorhead fan that has bought other concert DVDs on this band, which can serve as a lesson to other bands that like issuing multiple DVDs, what do you say Steve?\n\n-Crowd: awkwardly enough, the front 2-3 lines are full of dorks who just nod their heads and smile to Lemmy\u2019s between-song philosophizing. The rest of the place is reacting satisfactory. Nowhere near the levels Mediterranean or N. American fans would reach but certainly better than the dead trout on the 25th anniversary DVD.\n\n-Sound: At first I though it was a bit muddy but after the first song everything becomes crystal clear. As far as the DD 5.1 mix is concerned, the truth is I would have preferred Lemmy\u2019s vocals coming only from the center front speaker and not through all 3 front speakers but everything else is as I like it, including some cool effects during Phil\u2019s solos with the rear speakers. I think Phil\u2019s guitar gets a bit buried in the stereo mix though, so tough luck for you people with only two speakers, or even worse listening through TV speakers.\n\n-Video: Quite easily the best concert footage these eyeballs have ever stumbled across! The lightning rig is amazing, on some old songs the band look like a faded color photograph, on others they look something like the coach leading Antichrist\u2019s arrival. Truly innovative, almost as much as the video directing, which, aside from the few \u201cepilepsy\u201d camera changes incorporates Matrix-like effects in the gig. YES, you read right and if you haven\u2019t seen it you wont realize how ultimately cool it is. PERFECT.\n\n-Extras: The gig commentary on disk one is, as expected, quite boring, although classic lines are included (Lemmy to Phil: \u201cYou look like royalty!\u201d, Phil: \u201cI look like a bum!\u201d). There\u2019s a three quarter documentary on the road crew which is nice and features some other concert footage intersected between interviews (not whole songs, bootleg quality) and some other small neat pieces. Also subtitled in a few languages. \n\n-Packaging. Good artwork, nice, steady digipack case.\n\nVerdict: A million times better than the 25th Anniversary DVD. Buy Or Wither And Die!\n",
        "\n\"March \u00d6r Die\" is one of the releases that usually doesn't get much mention when talking about Mot\u00f6rhead, and indeed, it's quite far from the neck-ripping and rib-crushing classics like \"Overkill\", \"Bomber\" and \"Ace of Spades\", but it's definitely not a downer of an album. The album is somewhat slower than you'd usually expect from the band, more ear-friendly and melody-centered, even on faster songs like \"Name In Vain\" and \"Asylum Choir\". But the badass attitude is still there, and they come up with some sinister riffs to go along with the melody.\nOne thing that this album does better than their earlier material is the variety - there's the mainly acoustic ballad \"I Ain't No Nice Guy\", there's the classic catchy rock n' roll numbers like \"Stand\", \"Jack The Ripper\" and \"You Better Run\" (which features the classic old blues riff from Muddy Waters' \"Mannish Boy\", or more famously from the George Thorogood And The Destroyers track \"Bad To The Bone\"), the midpaced bass-driven fistpumping anthem \"Hellraiser\" and a couple of fast numbers laced with fine melodies.\n\nMot\u00f6rhead was, not too uncommonly, going through some instabilities in the lineup at this time. But for this album, they did find the drummer they've played the longest with - Greek/Swede Mikkey Dee, who seems to be intending to stay in the band for the remaindeer of it's career. Though he only played on one song on this album, namely \"Hellraiser\", but he proved himself there to be clearly Mot\u00f6rhead-worthy by giving the strongest drumtrack on the album right there. Before they found him, Phil \"Philthy Animal\" Taylor played drums on the song \"I Ain't No Nice Guy\" before he got booted out of the band, and session musician Tommy Aldrige played on the rest, doing an ok job, but lacking the power necessary to back up this legendary band quite properly.\nGuitarwise, we have Mick \"W\u00fcrzel\" Burston and some fellow in the bookletcalled \"Z\u00f6\u00f6m\", and they definitely do the trick here. Both work well together to write some catchy melody-infused power chord riffs with a nice mood all over, and there's surely some kickass solos to be found in the album. On the ever-so-loud bass, Lemmy tears shit up and remains a heavier element when the guitars turn more melodic, and of course his wonderful voice spawned by Jack Daniels and Marlboro is just as fucking Heavy with a capital H as ever, and even works perfectly well on the more emotional numbers.\nThere's the previously mentioned \"I Ain't No Nice Guy\", which is mainly acoustic except for the solo, and has some nice piano parts. A mellow but happy mood, which coupled with brilliant lyrics and excellent vocal work by both Lemmy and a certain guesting Ozzy Osbourne, works really well and is hell of a fun listen to. Another more emotional track is \"Too Good To Be True\", one of the definite highlights on here - it's fast, and built around a simple, melodic progression of power chord riffage and works incredibly well. Coupled with strong vocal lines and a superb chorus that sticks in your head, this song apparently about lost love is not quite what you'd expect from the band that wrote \"Love Me Like A Reptile\" but goddamn does it work!\n\nOther highlights include the classic bass-driven \"Hellraiser\" which is ten times heavier than the Ozzy Osbourne version, the upbeat, inspiring and quite simple opening track \"Stand\", the sinister \"You Better Run\" - almost as hardass as \"Bad To The Bone\" - which features some excellent drumming and subtle bluesy piano lines - \"Jack The Ripper\" with the killer blues-but-heavier-and-faster main riff and completely sinister, bluesy breakdown, and not to forget the excellent cover of Ted Nugent's \"Cat Scratch Fever\", which they execute perfectly.\nThe other songs are not quite as outstanding but the only really downer on here is the closing title track, which seems to go on forever without getting anywhere. But aside from that, there's good stuff everywhere, and this should definitely not be lacking in the collection of any Mot\u00f6rhead fanatic. From the faster, melodic numbers to the slower bluesy rockers, this is clearly worth your time and money.\n",
        "\nHere we have a worthy artifact to take with you to the next life. Looking over the tracklist and the box, Motorhead throw in everything and the kitchen sink. \n\nPick your poison! The live disc is the one you are probably going to reach for first when you get this, if you are anything like me. Interesting tracks are Silver Machine - a song from Hawkwind days and Chuck Berry cover Nadine ( a \"french name\" - what the fuck?). The best performances and sound quality are Everything Louder as can be expected. As for bootleg quality tracks, there are a couple, they have their own charm of a rusty razor and audible enough to kick your ass, nekro style! The best of the 5 discs right here. \n\nThe other 4 discs mix studio versions with alternative takes, and BBC recordings. The track list is comprehensive, you get the good, the bad and the ugly. Just kidding, it's all good. Except for the Hawkwind stuff, which is a lot more tame and the contrast is startling at how big of a change a few years and new line up can make for Lemmy. \n\nNow to the trimmings. The booklet is more like a book in content with insightful bio of Motorhead history and a crapload of album, singles and best-ofs covers, along with brief notes on the singles. Every studio and live album gets a more comprehensive treatment with tracklist and line-up, re-release info and even newspaper review articles (\"gnarly!\" reads one of the headlines haha). There are also promotional posters, pictures and articles on the band, hand -written setlists and even a family tree. It is a crapload of what you ever wanted to know, and a heap on top of that of what you didn't. There is also a lame poster included in the box. The individual discs' covers are a surprise of sorts and I won't ruin it for you. \n\nThis box is a speed metalhead's dream, it is 6 hr 18 mins of sonic (and spinal) pleasure and torture at once. It is done in true Motorhead style, meaning crammed to the brim. Stop drooling over it, get it if you haven't already.\n",
        "\nMotorhead basically invented thrash metal, and, this record, which originally came out in 1980, played a large part in that. This rerelease, which comes with 3 bonus tracks, clocks in at just over 46 minutes, which, for 15 tracks, averages out to a little over 3 minutes per track.\n\nWhile the title track is probably Motorhead's most well known song, it actually doesn't stand out too much here, as all of these songs are equally good really. Of course, they aren't radically different, either, but that's not really a bad thing.\n\nIn fact, the standout track for me on this one was bonus track Please Don't Touch, a Johnny Kidd and the Pirates cover done in collaboration with then labelmates Girlschool. While I'm not too familiar with the original, which came out in 1959, after all, the cover version is excellent, and perhaps the catchiest song on the whole album. Makes the CD version worth buying even if you own it on vinyl, unless, of course, you own the St. Valentine's Day Massacre EP as well...\n\nThe one thing that strikes me about this record is the amount of energy the music has. You really get the impression that the band is giving it all they got, and the energy given off is infectious. Ace Of Spades wouldn't be a good album to put you asleep, although it would provide an adequate soundtrack for a high speed car chase!\n\nThe production on this record is far from pristine, although all the instruments can be quite clearly heard, providing that you can tell Lemmy's bass from a guitar, which, with his playing style, isn't always too easy. These guys might not be virtuosos, but they're perhaps the greatest three piece band ever (at least until they became a four piece, anyways). Motorhead has done for thrash what Black Sabbath did for stoner rock/doom metal, and this is essential listening for all speed metal heads.\n",
        "\nThe third (real) live-album from our still rocking Mot\u00f6rheadbangers, and another masterpiece! \u2018No sleep \u2018till Hammersmith\u2019 and \u2018No sleep at all\u2019 already made a lot of impression on me and a lot of other fans, but this double CD may even surpass that high level. \n\nWhat does Mot\u00f6rhead give us this time? The usual and even more: a high-quality live 2CD. The sound quality is most of the time pretty good and Lemmy\u2019s voice and also the music are great, as we are used to of their live concerts.\n\nIf you are looking for a fast, hard and mercilessly rocking live masterpiece, then this is what you\u2019re looking for. Mot\u00f6rhead shows a GREAT performance and I envy Hamburg for not having missed that concert. This is a must-have for all true Mot\u00f6rheadbangers and fully worth its 100 %, because it blows you away from beginning to end with no interruptions! Two final words: BUY NOW!\n\nTips: Everything, but especially \u2018Lost in the Ozone\u2019 and \u2018Orgasmatron\u2019\n",
        "\nWhat we have here is the 6th offering from Mot\u00f6rhead. Following the extreme success of two milestones of the Mot\u00f6rsound (Overkill, Bomber) we are kicked in the face with Ace Of Spades, full of adrenaline album that delivers the goods exactly to what the fans wanted after the previous bombs.\nReally we'll have to say that ALL mot\u00f6rmusic is the same, if we are going to prejudge the album by further stablishing and popularizing too (since it's THE best selling Mot\u00f6rhead album) then we are missing exactly what this album is.\n\nThis album sank the knife deeper into our souls of what Mot\u00f6rhead is supposed to be and to sound like.\nThis is why I say the album is heavily underated, the songs in here are ripping drunkfests for Mot\u00f6rbangers. Every single one. Maybe you'll find a filler or two, I give you that for Fire, Fire and Dance. But what band has not done that?\n\nI'll have to disect this album into a song-by-song description so I can proove my point that you can't mistake Ace Of Spades with Fast And Loose or The Chase is Better Than The Catch...\n\n\nAce Of Spades - This is the wild as fuck intro to a great album, particulary, the title track. We are given an bass line by Lemmy \"God\" Kilmister that lasts aproximately 6 seconds before Fast Eddie kicks us in our nuts with the unmistakable riff, flowing nicely from drunk bass lines to wild riffs, this song doesn't let us breath for a second. Of course who can forget the wild, out of this world solo? This is a straight forward, no wankery solo to keep the pace of the song. And it sure works. \n\nLove Me Like A Reptile - Keeping the line with the \"don't let us breathe please\" Mot\u00f6rhead philosophy, we are quickly introduced to Love Me Like A Reptile. Another fast paced, straight forward song with funny lyrics. This song is more based on the guitars and haves more of a Rock (or old school Metal if you will) feeling to it, unlike the previous song which's riff was (to me) a bit influenced by a Bluesy feel , especialy in the last notes of the main riff.\n\nAnyway, concerning the album in general, we can feel a variation of guitar distortions and the bass being mudder or cleaner in each song. In what respects to the present song (LMLaR), the bass works more in the back, though we have to acnlowledge that this is a band that normaly concentrates into writtiing music for the stand out of the Bass guitar.\n\nShoot You In The Back - The guitar riffing beggining to this song is what the bass line beggining is to Ace Of Spades. Fast Eddy Clark lays an impecable main riff line so the song can explode into what it will be the whole performance of the band. It also lasts about 6 seconds to do that.\nLemmy sings as always, I don't need to mention that. \nThe riffing combined with the choruses, unlike the previous songs, features a groovieness feel that makes it particulary catchy, with a clean guitar sound.\n\nLive To Win - This song again makes it's way with a bass intro.. similar formula that utilized Ace Of Spades? Yes. The same? No... This song is kind of a mixture in between Ace Of Spades for the speed and the ominous presence of the bass, and Shoot You In The Back, for the clean guitars, which delivers a cleaner solo, equaly wild but less drunkier than AoS, and the catchy choruses. This song actualy gives us 2 solos to bang at, the second being my favourite since it's longer and gives me a feeling that it's more complete than the previous one, but not diminishing the other in any sense.\n\nFast And Loose - Live to Win fades to present us with the bluesy directed riff of Fast And Loose. This song, without ever moving away from the classic Mot\u00f6rhead sound, vibes as a Blues influentied song as a whole, not only the guitar. But it is easier to note this on the guitar than on the other instruments. \nThis song is as catchy as the previous, and the bass is again working behind the guitar. (If you don't remember that was featured in Love Me Like A Reptile but not in the other two).\n\n(We Are) The Road Crew - This is a tribute song to the Mot\u00f6rhead Road Crew though the lyrics are not particulary invasive to the particular lives of the actual \"Mot\u00f6rcrew\" and can be taked as an anthem for any Road Crew in the world. Which is a good thing, since this is a fun song and can be played with indefinetely.\nThis song, musicaly, is very variated. We have a bigger presence of the bass which slowly drags itself into the back but never quite like in the second song and it haves a muddier sound. The guitar is also wilder and drunker and features a rock/punk crossover melody which gives this song the wilderness it should have.\n\nFire, Fire - It can be considered a filler song since it had not reach the popularity as ALL the 6 songs that precede it. But nonetheless this is a great song (quality over quantity). This song works with the bass hand to hand with the guitar, but the guitar is cleaner and the bass is dirtier and more in the front. We have a particular riff in here that sounds similar to Ace Of Spades, same? Nope, not at all. Anyway, as I was saying, the bass gains much more notoriety in the song because the guitar is not layed over it, but Lemmy gives the right place to Fast Eddie so he can deliver us the great, very clean soloing. I feel this equaly as a more fun song for the band.\n\nJailbait - This song follows pretty much the same formula than Fire, Fire and it's not ALL THAT memorable. But it sure haves the Mot\u00f6rhead landmark on it's front. The difference with this song and the previous is that the bass is less dirtier and less in the front of the mix.\nI can't say much about this, the guitar riffing and \"kerrangs\" are those of classic Mot\u00f6rhead. Particulary, the solo for this song is the first presented in the album to lay the same note played 5 or 6 times and then continues down the notes to the rest of the soloing (much like Morbid Angel or Sodom) (the first one) the second one is more on the classic vein of Mot\u00f6rhead, though Fast Eddie Clark also plays the same note a couple of times in a row. \n\nDance - I don't need to say that this is another fast paced song from the UK Mot\u00f6rbangers. The main riff to this song is played faster than the previous, and we can also hear the bass in the front, though with a perfectly clean sound. So is the guitar, this song is much like Fire, Fire, in the sense that bass and guitars work almost hand to hand.. almost, because the bass is wilder here than the guitar. Not as it was featured before.\nThe solos are also perfectly delivered and the bass goes into it's right place so it doesn't disturbs the quality of the soloing.\n\nBite The Bullet - This is the shortest song in the album; again a song written by Lemmy that features funny lyrics. About the music of the song, the intro is delivered by the drums and the guitars (no bass) and then it kicks right into our face with the inclusion of the bass which completely dominates this song and it's alway in front of the mix. Punk influented by Lemmy's singing pace, this song doesn't give us a rest for it's shortness, and I repeat, the bass is right there in the front row slaming your head even during the duration of the solo.\n\nThe Chase Is Better Than The Catch - The previous song doesn't get to an end for it is interrupted (while slowing down, of course, no production error..) by the classic epic TCIBTTC. This is a very \"Dance\" song, because as this previous song, this one haves the sound that Mot\u00f6rhead would define forever in the next releases. The bass guitar variates it's domination of the song, but for the majority of it, you can clearly hear the bass right infront of the mix and the guitar in the back, more distorted than the bass, to give it a more present feeling so the bass doesn't get to opaque the rest of the musicians' performance.\nThe solo is quite mudded and still the bass guitar is present during it.\nThis song is a classic epique which I prefer live because of it's rawness and it's obvious existance ment to be played in front of an audience, as the majority of Mot\u00f6rhead songs.\n\nThe Hammer - What a way to close a fast paced rock/metal album than this song. This song is quite unique, because of it's uber fast pace. This one is one of the fastest songs in this album. The riffing is unstopable and the guitar is mixed at the same level than the bass guitar, being the first again muddier and more distorted than the last. So you can hear both present in almost a fight to be the loudest on the mix. Drums aren't left behind in the whole album, always getting the pace of the two main instruments and delivering it's quote of excitement and precious speed to each song. This doesn't fails us in The Hammer, the drums are wild, exciting and keeps in pace with the wilderness of the whole song.\n\nWell, there you have it; I think I have proved myself stating that this album features quite a variation of songs and styles, but close attention must be payed, and of course, truthful enjoyment.\n",
        "\nOhh, hell yes! Lemmy is older than my Dad and he is still the High Priest of the Church of Motorhead, Keeper of the Sacred Rickenbacker 4001 Bass of Destruction and the Sanctified Marshall Bass Stacks of DOOM!!! This CD shows proof positive that he is not growing mellow with age--in fact, he is still spitting venom with fire blazing in his eyes and beating holy hell out of his bass. Liberal injections of punk and speed metal-influenced riffing plus a staggering Steve Vai solo on the opening track (\"The Terminal Show\", and since when does Vai never play less than brilliantly?) insure that this album will crush your skull into pulp with every listen and you will come back for more every time. \n\n\"Fight\", \"The Terminal Show\", \"Killers\" and \"In The Name Of Tragedy\" are especially ass-whomping tracks on a seriously murderous album. The production is perfect, also, not as cloudy as it was on \"Hammered\" ( a great album regardless of popular opinion); the crunching guitar is perfectly balanced against the bass, which sounds like an amped-up Harley motorcycle as always, and Mikkey Dee's drums boom and crack with thunderous power under it all. And I love the ending track, an acoustic country blues tune with witty and droll lyrics as only Lemmy can write. He's been around long enough that he can do whatever he wants, right? Right, and it still works and has integrity because of its rootsy feel and downhome sensibility--this is no cheesey acoustic ballad. This is a Motorhead album, you do not buy it for clean and clear cookie cutter shite; you get it for ultra-scuzzy bluesy boogie on speed, which is the majority of this album anyway other than the aforementioned speed metal & punk influences (and Motorhead are acknowledged universally as the spiritual fathers of speed metal and a major influence on second wave UK punk anyway, so why not include the styles that they pioneered and add their own little twist to it!)\n\nThese guys are tight, they're veterans, and if you don't know what to expect by now, what kind of metalhead are you? Get this and learn that growing old does not mean losing your edge!\n",
        "\nIt's a typical Motorhead album. The sound is a little more polished, but other than that it sounds very similar to every other Motorhead album out there. Which is okay, they're one of the few bands that can actually get away with releasing the same album over and over again and yet still have something new to offer with each album. The first song to play on the album, \"Terminal Show\" is quite possibly my new favourite Motorhead track. The jaw-dropping solo during this song is performed by none other than guitar legend Steve Vai. Apparently Lemmy had run into him at a bar, and Vai decided to play on a couple songs. If you listen closely, you can notice Lemmy drop references to other classic Motorhead tracks, including \"Stay Clean\", \"Eat the Rich\" and the immortal \"Ace of Spades\", and the acoustic \"Whorehouse Blues\" at the end is very reminiscent of the track \"1916\". If you're a Motorhead fan, you should definitely check this out. In my opinion it's their best album yet.\n",
        "\nMotorhead comes back with a fucking vengeance here... after the so-so efforts on the last few albums, THIS one is just a fucking destroyer of worlds. From the get-go, you hear that this one is for real. Time to get down to business, let us prey!! The riff of Terminal Show kicks in immediately, and the album just does not fucking let up with the thrash/speed madness through the extended solo, and then the song Killers, and then... what's this, a raging THRASHER??? That's right, In the Name of Tragedy is a punk/thrash number with a bit of Laaz power, but with Lemmy and Motorhead doing their thing as only Lemmy and Motorhead can. Gang choruses and all, THIS is just about the best Motorhead song since the Sacrifice LP and the underrated \"Dog Faced Boy\". Extremely catchy, like nothing else can be.\n\nSuicide's a six minute epic slow-burn, and then \"Life's a Bitch\" starts off with a blues-punk lick before going into - what's this, more fucking speed metal? Lemmy is approximately 82 years old at this point, and here his testicles have grown large enough to be qualified for statehood as set forth in the United States Constitution. No small feat, given that this is LEMMY, and his testicles were never a question. \n\nJust remember... Life's a Bitch! \n\nDown on Me comes back with the guitar/bass tuneage sounding like Motorhead of old... on a lot of the songs the production is a lot more guitar-oriented than some of the previous Motorhead works. It's certainly not a bad thing, but here is what we have been expecting - a song like this. Ten songs like this would make a competent Motorhead album, but the thing with Motorhead is that despite the fact that all their songs are instantly recognisable as Motorhead, they don't pull an AC/DC and sound all the same - this one sounds more like something off Sacrifice or Burner, and that is the contribution to the album. \n\nIn the Black - the complex chorus (!), and yet again another song instantly identifiable as Motorhead, and throw in another simple-but-oh-so-effective thrash riff. HEAR ME TALKIN!! Like that old Anthrax song, except this is Motorhead... one would be tempted to think of Motorhead falling behind the bandwagon - releasing something that sounds 1986, when they've been releasing stuff that sounds 1986 since oh about 1979... it is tempting to think that they sold out, pussied out, and made generic shit metal like so many power/speed/thrash bands of the mid-80s, each more generic than the last. Somehow, this is not the case. Somehow, this is refreshing - and not quite in that retro sense like a band like Dekapitator... this is Motorhead, and Motorhead are fucking eternal, and they can play whatever the fuck that they want, and they'll always be fucken Motorhead.\n\nFight... \"Turn the bass up, will ya?\" Another speedy burner... then the last few songs are a bit slower, but still effective. They're not QUITE the one-two-three punch of the opening trilogy (which may be the best opening trilogy of any Motorhead studio album!)... still, they are excellent. Year of the Wolf is melodic speed metal, but still sufficiently aggressive to not be mistaken for Stratovarius. A simple, catchy melody line, accentuated by riffs and vocals. The classic Motorhead formula. Then, throw in Keys to the Kingdom, which is a midpaced blues-metal number that somehow reminds me of Saxon... a triumph of midpaced crunch.\n\nSmiling Like a Killer is one final blast of hyperspeed, though more simplistic and punkish than previous speed-burners on the album. Chorus with a drum fill, simple riff pattern... yeah, this song probably took about five minutes to write, but ya know what, it fucken works, because this ain't Dream Theater and this ain't rocket science... if they can crank out the filler material, and even the filler material is pretty fucken good, more power to 'em. Motorhead caught a blast of inspiration, and rode it all the way to the bloody end.\n\nThe bloody end? Heh, sounds like a Johnny Cash song more than anything else... you'd think it makes no sense, but here it is another tribute to the absolute BRILLIANCE of Lemmy and pals. They've been punk, they've been rock 'n roll... they've been speed fucken metal, and now they're clean-picked acoustic guitar, sounding like a dark country song... not fucken Shania Twain, I mean real tr00 country, with shootin' men in Reno (just to watch them die). I have no idea if this was an intentional tribute to Johnny Cash, but it totally sounds like it. Throw in the harmonica, and the reflective lyrics (ya know, life's full of surprises... you know, we do that too) and one comes up with one Hell of an enjoyable song. This isn't the song that'll make your lawn die, but this is still completely as MOTORHEAD as it gets. Excellent closer.\n\nWhen all is said and done - this is a very good Motorhead album. It starts with an all-killer bang, and even after 12 songs doesn't get tired. It's not quite as consistent as \"Sacrifice\", or as historically completely over the fucking top as \"No Sleep 'til Hammersmith\", but it goes to show that Motorhead are completely fucking immortal.\n",
        "\nThis is probably the first ESSENTIAL Motorhead album. The thing with Motorhead is that sometimes they are a bit too filler and a bit too inconsistent - one gets that when they release two albums of 10 songs each a year... when they are dead on, they are a fierce mix of punk, metal, and rock 'n roll, with all three aspects of the band coming on strong, with each song combining all three in some proportion or another. \n\nTHIS is an album that is fierce and dead FUCKING on. Combine basher anthems like \"Lawman\" and \"Sweet Revenge\", which are monstrosities of Sabbath meets old-school riff rock like Hendrix or the Kinks. Then other songs are pure Motorhead riffage, that NO other band sounds like - the MC5 wish they were this heavy, Judas Priest wish they were this pissed off, the Sex Pistols wish they were this coherent... All the Aces, Talking Head... the simple speed stuff, half guitar, half bass, all power all the time.\n\nThis is their second LP of 1979 (third, if you count the initial release of the 1975 recording, On Parole) - and a far more violent release than the previous offering, OVAHKILL. What the title track of that album brought into full force, THIS album continues on. The guitar and bass tones are much more similar here than there to The Masterw\u00f6rk, No Sleep 'til Hammersmith of course. \n\nWith the opener, \"Dead Men Tell No Tales\", and the album kicks on a high note, and never stops. The epic madcap soloing of \"Sharpshooter\", combined with that absurdly heavy bass backing - shades of Ace of Spades and Overkill - and the simple Priest-ish riffs... I hear \"Delivering the Goods\" and even \"Island of Domination\" in the gallop. The more melodic, punk work \"Poison\", with the gang choruses a la the Ramones... \"Step Down\" with Fast Eddie taking on the vocals, and the whole thing comes out like a late 60s burner a la a much more violent The Doors... \n\nthese guys were ALL. These guys weren't afraid to wear all their influences on their sleeves, and come up with a sound that is unmistakeably their own nonetheless... the loud destructive bass, the shrieking guitars, the LOUDEST BAND IN THE WORLD of course... the epic (yes, even in under five minutes, this song is a complete masterwork) \"Stone Dead Forever\" with its glorious intro licks leading into the awesome speed metal riffage (and the random feedback at 2:48 - something tells me they left it in) and the solo that's all Ten Years After, Times One Hundred... and of course the final track.\n\nTHE TITLE TRACK!! THE TITLE TRACK!! THE BOMBER!! THE BOMBER!!\n\nWell worth it. Well fucken worth it. First there is Sabbath. Then there is Priest. Then there is Motorhead. With these three bands, and NOTHING else, you can take over the world.\n\nYes, pretty sad that in the two years of this site, there's been two reviews for this LP.\n\n(Oh yeah, my CD comes with a few live bonus tracks... not sure when they were recorded, but they sound completely fucking competent, though not QUITE as vicious as No Sleep.)\n",
        "\nNow this friends, is a damn good compilation. There's no cheesing out, no singleminded focus on the early years. No, this is a hand-crafted selection of gems, a one stop shop of really, really nice Mot\u00f6rhead songs. I'm not saying that there aren't a few things missing (\"Stone Dead Forever\", anything from Bastards), but all in all this comp represents virtually every Mot\u00f6rhead release, a really sterling catalogue that extends from the early spark of On Parole (the first 'Head recordings) through the classic Overkill and Ace of Spades, and beyond to the forgotten or underappreciated 80's discs (Another Perfect Day and Orgasmatron) and into the pummeling 90's (Sacrifice, Overnight Sensation). This double disc set puts to shame the cheapy cash-in single sets, and also provides a more cost-effective intro to the band than one of the price-y boxes. This is the evolution of the No Remorse hits set.\n\nThe disc one is pretty obvious, tracks from On Parole, Mot\u00f6rhead, Overkill, Bomber, St. Valentine's Day Massacre (split EP with Girlschool) and Ace of Spades, as well as some deserving singles like \"Too Late Too Late\". It's really cool how the comp gives tons of deep album cuts and some interesting live tracks (slightly low quality though) right off the bat, as well as a hypnotic Hawkwind trip (pun intended) through \"Mot\u00f6rhead\", but it's disc 2 that many casual 'Head fans (i.e. only bought the early stuff). It's an excellent Cliff's Notes of the rest of the catalogue.\n\nThe crunching industrial death of Orgasmatron is well represented by the title track and \"Deaf Forever\", while the melodic (yet oh so heavy) \"Another Perfect Day\" slams home the crunching \"Shine\" and the more mid-tempo \"I Got Mine\". This is really an underrated album because these songs have more bite than the toothless Iron Fist or 1916. A crunchy Ace of Spades cut (\"The Chase is Better Than the Catch\") actually throws things off a bit, but the funky (!) \"Ain't My Crime\" and \"Dogs\", as well as the Pantera-like sledge of \"Sacrifice\". As I said earlier, the lack of tracks from Bastards is odd, \"Burner\" or \"I Am the Sword\" would've been perfect, but I digress.\n\nAlso, the packaging is quite nice, cinematic black and white throughout the thick liner booklet, with an erudite and often humours turn of phrase from the writer of the thing. All in all, big round of applause for this, a rarity amongst the general sludge to be found in this category of any discography.\n\nStand-Outs: Ummm... \"Shine\", \"I Got Mine\", and \"Tear Ya Down\"... first three to come to mind\n",
        "\nI've never really understood why Mot\u00f6rhead's Ace of Spades record is so well-regarded. I mean it's good, but... you know, sloppy and inconsistent. That album has been called one of the most influential in all of metal, but honestly by Overkill Lemmy and Co. had their shit together, and their shit was much tighter and hard-hitting than anything else they'd release until Another Perfect Day or Orgasmatron. This album includes a bevy of 'Head classics, truly unparelleled in the catalogue for longevity and early metal punch.\n\nIn fact, there are no less than six songs on here that are stilled played today, and all of these tracks wind up on the majority of 'Head compilation records. I mean man, you can't argue with gems like the piercing near-epic sprawl of \"Metropolis\", a concert fav that forecasts the even better \"Dead Men Tell No Tales\" one record forward. On the other side of the metal table you have a raucous re-shred of ZZ Top's \"Tush\" recast in molton metal and spewed out as the lead-guitar overkill (no pun intended) of \"No Class\". This was a Mot\u00f6rhead functioning on a whole 'nother level, manic punkified speed clashing with crushing electric blues metal and tasty southern rock.\n\n\"Damage Case\" pounds like nothing else, a true blues riff shocked into modern times by one seriously powerful power trio, the feel and heart of that near-dead form given a way to persist and proliferate in a new era. All of that basically means that \"Damage Case\" is an instant classic, full of Lemmy's comic come-ons and hammering bass, that stuttering intro (you know, 'dun-dan, dun-dan, dun-dan, dun-dan na na') taking hold of the spine and shaking it 'til you're head is banging and your metal hunger's fed.\n\nIt's strange that with such dark, glaring metal there can also be happy-go-punky fun like \"Tear Ya Down\", infectiously catchy, lyrically genius (much like spiritual brethren \"Mot\u00f6rhead\"), really one of my favourite 'Head songs, and including one of my fav Lemmy bass performances. Simple, clean fun.\n\nThe title track of course is the most enduring song on an album that endures on so many levels, in my opinion better than \"Ace of Spades\", the band telling us 'just don't sweat it/we'll give it back to you', listener caught up and feeding kinetic energy back to the band as it rumbles along. Really, the false endings on this thing almost tag it as the original \"Painkiller\", the long version moving on and on through cool, slow solo to whining high-register one-note barrage while Lemmy croaks and smokes on the stick.\n\nThis is amazing, high-intensity metal, an energy and violence that punk had and metal was looking to acquire, a bridge that Mot\u00f6rhead became between the two worlds. Mot\u00f6rhead, everything louder than everyone else, and Overkill, their first true behemoth milestone.\n\nStand-Outs: \"Overkill\", \"Tear Ya Down\", \"Damage Case\"\n",
        "\n... just listening to it will drive you to a life of alcoholism! Another heapin' helping of Mot\u00f6rhead's brand of thick, meaty metal. This puppy begs to be cranked as you speed down the highway in a nice '82 Trans Am. \n\nSo let's get right down to the bad part before I launch into what makes this album kick ass. The first four songs made me cream my pants in a metalgasm of unheard of proportions. But after that the album lost me. The songs all have awesome titles like \"Life's a Bitch\" and \"Whorehouse Blues\". But both these songs are pretty average, along with a lot of the other ones.\n\nOkay, now why I like this beast. First of all, LEMMY! Duh. I love his voice, I can't get enough of it, all gravely and such. The vocals are well done, and there's plenty of subtle harmony to thicken the vocals and bring them out without making them too loud. Oh yeah, speaking of loudness, I'd just like to comment on the production real quick. I really like it. Not too overproduced. Lemmy's bass sounds a little cleaner that usual. The drum tone is \"big\" without drowning everything the fuck out. The guitar tone is sludgy and tasty. All the levels are perfect.\n\nLemmys bass work is pretty standard \"play along with the guitar\" stuff, which is for the best since Mot\u00f6rhead plays as a three piece. The bass just needs to \"fill things out\". Speaking of fills, Lemmy throws some nice little bass fills in, especially in \"Killers\". Good touch.\n\nGuitar riffs are at best catchy as hell and at worst slightly annoying. None of the solos are anything to write home about but they're generally short and don't really get in the way.\n\nThe drumming is solid. Nothing you wouldn't expect on a Mot\u00f6rhead album. There's really not much else to say.\n\nOverall, this album would be purely average were it not for \"Terminal Show\", \"Killers\", \"In the Name of Tragedy\" and \"Suicide\", which are not only heavy and blisteringly fast, but catchy and well-written. Oh yeah, but the lyrics for \"In the Name of Tragedy\" are a little dumb (but hearing Lemmy rhyme \"funky\" and \"monkey\" is kind of funny). These aforementioned songs bring this album up from average to solid. So it gets a solid 75.\n",
        "\nWell, Lemmy and crew have released their most recent effort, Inferno. And despite what some naysayer may claim this album is just as good, if not better, than their so called classics. Motorhead, like many other bands that have lasted as long, are often accused of becoming stale or washed up. And while this is often true of lesser bands, Motorhead have proven again and again why they deserve to be among the ranks of the metal gods.\nThe CD is far from experimental or original but is a typical dose of Kilmister glory. The songs hit you hard and fast and keep up the catchy hooks and riffs through their entirety. The blues influence does show through a bit more than on past releases but that actually adds to the album, giving it more depth than would possibly be expected on a Motorhead release. Songs like \u201cKeys to the Kingdom\u201d emphasize this strengthening of the blues influence more than any others (except for track 12, more on that later). While Keys isn\u2019t as fast a song as the typical Motorhead tune it is catchy and well crafted. You cant help but start bobbing your head in approval. The rest of the album truly moves at breakneck speeds and overshadows many of Motorheads past accomplishments. \u201cTerminal Show\u201d ( with accompanying guitars by Steve Vai) and \u201cIn the Name of Tragedy\u201d could easily have become the songs most associated with this band if they were on earlier albums instead of \u201cAce of Spades\u201d. In my opinion they are easily that songs\u2019 equal. The CD follows the standard Motorhead format by adding a few songs here and there that slow the tempo and break the atmosphere created by the constant wailing guitar and raspy vocals but not to the point that the mood of the album departs from riotous and raucous, but just enough to give the listener a pause and anticipate the next full on audio assault.. This is truly a marvelous album and should be put on the \u201cmust buy\u201d list of any Motorhead fan.\nNow on to the rumored \u201cblues\u201d song that was supposedly on Inferno. Well, it was more than a rumor. The album ends with \u201cWhorehouse Blues\u201d, a touching song about life and sex that would sound more fitting on a Johnny Cash CD. Despite this radical departure of style the song fits in strangely well. It keeps a fast pace (for blues inspired country) and light attitude and has an unmistakably Motorhead feel to the lyrics with a chorus that proudly declares that \u201cYou know we aint too good looking/But We are satisfied/No we aint never been good looking/But we are satisfied/We shoulda opened a little whorehouse honey/get a little booty on the side\u201d.\n",
        "\nWell, my tape version (manufactured circa 1994 at the latest, since that's when I got it) has 12 tracks on it, but I downloaded some mp3s that comprise a total of fifteen tracks. I'm not sure what the origin is of that release, but the first 12 are the Ace of Spades LP and the last three are apparently the collaboration with Girlschool that came out around the same time. I distinctly hear the female vox on \"Please Don't Touch\", and I have no idea about the nature of the other two - is that Lemmy, poorly mixed, or some other dude? It sounds like a dude - backup vox? \n\nAnyway... it's good stuff, though it lacks the awesome bite that the live album No Sleep 'til Hammersmith has. I'm not sure quite what it is. Maybe it's the production, maybe the songwriting, maybe the fact that I heard the live album first, so I'm thinking that songs like Road Crew, the Hammer, and Ace of Spades, are meant to be played live, with that particular blend of slightly sloppy, slightly drunk, and completely fucking insane sounds that live Motorhead are known for.\n\nAnd yes, there does remain the question of if there really are fifteen distinct songs on here... Motorhead is kinda like AC/DC in that they put out basically the same songs over and over again. They're very entertaining for the most part, but of the hundreds of Motorhead songs I've heard, I'd be hard-pressed to identify more than about thirty without the vocals. The riffs are very similar, and the songs run together. At times, this leads to a very pleasing effect - the fast, under-two-minute Bite the Bullet immediately leads into the slower, more groovy The Chase is Better than the Catch, and the whole thing sounds like a perfectly executed thrash break. I get the distinct feeling that Sodom came to this conclusion too, and exploited it to good use!\n\nHighlights... the opener is legendary, a hyperspeed blast of punkish metal... self-destructive in lyrical approach, throwing in a chaotic solo, and of course that whackjob riffage coming on both guitar and bass at the same. On the live album, it is ridiculously godly - here it is quite good as well. Other higlights include the original closing track, The Hammer, which forms an excellent bookend to Ace of Spades, given the riff similarity. Then, Please Don't Touch is a very old-school rock 'n roll number (by old school I mean OLD school, like the early Beatles or even before that), and it's executed very well by the combination of Motorhead and Girlschool. Usually bonus tracks are worthless, but this is a highlight.\n\nWorth getting? Certainly. It is a bit overrated as an album (especially compared to the very underrated followup: No Sleep 'til Hammersmith) but still quite decent. Just don't expect a whole fuckload of variety!\n",
        "\nIt's tough to classify what exactly Motorhead is - at the same time, they are both one of THE most over-the-top bands out there, but their metalness is sometimes borderline. Their formula seems to be one-half metal, one-half punk, one-half rock 'n roll, and yes, that does indeed add up to three-halves of a band, and that's a conservative estimate for their sheer raw power.\n\nThat said, this is one of Motorhead's most unequivocally METAL albums. Lots of nifty riffage, ranging from midpaced headbanger stuffs to all-out speed metal. While the album isn't quite as much a kick to the face as their absurdly cool live albums (especially No Sleep 'til Hammersmith), it is quite possibly their heaviest studio album. \n\nHighlights... probably Order/Fade to Black, with its alternation of midpaced and fast sections, or the uncommonly catchy Dog Faced Boy. Silly song title, but what a great song. The opener, Sacrifice, is an excellent mood setter... usually if you have any claim whatsoever to being a speed metal band, then it's the opener that's the fastest, loudest, heaviest, most over-the-top song on the album, but in this case, the opener is a midpaced basher, and the over-the-topness is distributed evenly throughout the whole album.\n\nDon't Waste Your Time is another excellent song; one that sums up their three aspects as mentioned before... metal, punk, and rock 'n roll. The basic melody and rhythm could be Chuck Berry, circa 1958. The rough attitude could be the Ramones, circa 1976. Then the distortion and heaviness could be Overkill, circa 1984. Motorhead are the masters of taking good old rock 'n roll, and supercharging it to absurd amounts of intensity. Lemmy's been around forever, and he certainly wears his influences on his sleeve. Motorhead is timeless music; they mercifully don't feel the need to evolve or downtune or wear baggy pants. They struck gold once, so why unstrike it? \n\nThe album really finishes on a Hell of a bang: In Another Time is a fast, hard, loud, punkish speed metal number, and Out of the Sun starts off with a little bass-driven section, and then goes into another fast wrecker with a killer solo, then a little interlude, and then, like the second coming of Overkill, it comes back to life with ANOTHER set of solos - first bass, then one more guitar shredder.\n\nSpeaking of the bass, this being Lemmy, it's always very prominent. Since Lemmy was a guitarist the first howevermany years of his career, the bass has always been used as either a riff monster or the occasional lead instrument, as opposed to the traditional low-end. There isn't very much low-end here, with most of the sound being saturated in the middle frequencies. Lemmy's vocals are an acquired taste - I for one think they're a brilliant tribute to nicotine. The production is very clear, the distortion very much over the top, just like it should be, and of course the whole thing just fucking rocks.\n",
        "\nSometime musicians have a great misconception about their own albums or songs, and Mikkey Dee seems to be no exception, as he recently called this album in an interview \"a little weaker\". Well, Mr. Dee... I beg to differ!\n\nThe low points:\n\n\u201cNight Side\u201d (Mikkey Dee: \"Our worst song ever\") and \u201cDogs Of War\u201d (best described as \u201cOver Your Shoulder Pt.II\u201d - I didn\u2019t like the \u201coriginal\u201d and I don\u2019t like the \u201csequel\u201d).\n\nThe good ones: \n\n\u201cBetter Off Dead\u201d (a fast one and the closer of the album), \u201cSnake Bite Love\u201d (I love the \u201cDon\u2019t tread on him when he\u2019s around\u201d-part) and \u201cAssassin\u201d: This is \u201cSacrifice Pt.II\u201d, and although the differences between those two songs are marginal, \u201cSacrifice\u201d probably would have made it into the next category, simply because I listen to it more often. Note: I think Lemmy has never sounded more pissed than when he shouts \u201cAssassin! Assassin! Assassin! Assassin!\u201d\n\nThe highlights:\n\n\u201cLove For Sale\u201d: Just a great mid-tempo track and probably the perfect opener to get into gear.\n\n\u201cTake The Blame\u201d: A double-bass monster with mid-tempo break and ending, and I think the only time Mot\u00f6rhead made use of a Hammond organ. One of my all-time Mot\u00f6rhead favourites (but there are still a few more to come).\n\n\u201cDead And Gone\u201d: Mot\u00f6rhead haven\u2019t done many ballads, but when they do they are nearly unbeatable - and this track is no exception. I\u2019ve listened to this song MANY times and it still gives me the creeps.\n\n\u201cDon't Lie To Me\u201d: One of the best Mot\u00f6rhead-\u201cBoogies\u201d ever (and most reminiscent of \"Don't Waste Your Time\" and \u201cGoing To Brazil\u201d).\n\n\u201cJoy Of Labour\u201d: It seems that I am one of the very few who like this song. This is definitely not a typical Mot\u00f6rhead tune, and although it\u2019s heavy as fuck, the pre-chorus adds a little sadness to it and changes the mood of the whole song - and that mixture is what makes this track a masterpiece. Note: Although Lemmy frequently uses his bass like a rhythm guitar it has never been more noticeable than here.\n\n\u201cDesperate For You\u201d: Another quite fast one. I just realized that Mot\u00f6rhead really hit the gas on this album, i.e. if you\u2019re into their fast songs, you\u2019ll certainly get your money worth.\n\n\nThis album is actually something like Sacrifice Part II, not just because of the similarity of a few songs, but also the (raw) production, so if you liked Sacrifice (or Mot\u00f6rhead in general, of course) I think you must have this one!\n",
        "\nWell, if this isn't a nice little curiosity. This was what started it all for Motorhead back in '75, with Lemmy's butt still sore from being kicked out of Hawkwind. Although most of the tracks on this album have since been re-recorded elsewhere, 'On Parole' is an interesting document, being the only recorded output of the nascent prototype version of the band - Lemmy on bass and vocals, supported by Larry Wallis (from the unfortunately-named Pink Fairies, and fresh out of a short stint in UFO) on guitar, and by Lucas Fox on drums.\n\nThe latter didn't make it all the way through the recordings, as he was replaced by Phil\"thy Animal\" Taylor just after laying down the drum tracks. Fox's talents must have been questionable - you know you suck when you're kicked out to be replaced by your bassist/singer's drug dealer. Taylor (who had absolutely zero professional experience) had to record all the drum tracks from scratch; he almost made it, too, but was then faced with the unfortunate necessity of swallowing a few pills he had on him to avoid being busted. When he woke up in jail three days later, the studio time had run out, which is why one track ('Lost Johnny') still features Fox's drumwork. Gotta love the cops.\n\nSo, what do you get out of a band that aspires to be so dirty and loud that \"if we moved in next to you, your lawn would die\" (according to Lemmy), when you throw them into a studio with a pop producer, after only a few months together and some really ill-received and un-together gigs? The opener - 'Motorhead', a remnant from the Hawkwind days - manages to deliver, and then some. Far removed from the midpaced, psychedelic Hawkwind version (suffice to say there's no violin solo to be found here), it promptly rips your fucking face off with brutal ferocity and unbridled speed that were quite unheard of in '75! An ass-kicker of a speed metal track, it is, and the performance here may very well be the best studio version of this song - it just manages to beat the one re-recorded later on the proper debut.\n\nUnfortunately, the rest falls short... what we get here is a mild affair overall, a rather quirky collection of songs that, moreover, cannot be called \"metal\" in any way, except for the aforementioned first track. The production is rather polished, by later Motorhead standards; there are vocal and guitar overdubs all over the place, an interesting approach for Motorhead (Wallis joins Lemmy on lead vocals, and in fact, the abundance of guitar overdubbing on here was what later prompted the band to bring in \"Fast\" Eddie, initially as a second live guitarist). The guitar tone is rather tame, and that goes for the bass as well - lacks the distorted, patented \"Lemmy sound\" of later works. Lemmy's vocals, too, might come as a bit of a surprise to those used to his trademark gravel-throated snarl.\n\nThe material is a potpourri of songs culled from the members' ex-bands, covers, and a few originals; it can be described as '70s hard rock with the emphasis alternating between basic rock stylings and remnants of proggy psychedelia, only beginning to showcase the same stripped-down approach that at the time was pregnant with the primordial versions of punk rock and NWOBHM. Indeed, 'Vibrator' is completely punk, from the simple 3-chord hooks down to the snide, heavily-accented vocal delivery (done by Larry Wallis, by the way). 'City Kids' - a song \"borrowed\" from Wallis' old band the Pink Fairies - is somewhere in that general territory as well. 'On Parole' and the old Motown cover 'Leaving Here' exhibit the basic rock'n'roll side of things, which gets pretty insipid. The psych leftovers can be felt most strongly in 'The Watcher', another old Hawkwind song, and in 'Fools' (\"this is a song for all you managers and agents out there\"), another one sung by Wallis, which has that typical odd '70s vibe about it - think 'Am I Going Insane' by Sabbath. \n\nThe most striking example of the contrast between this album and later Motorhead would probably be the version of 'Iron Horse/Born To Lose' that's to be found here. Quiet, bluesy, laid back... pretty much a different song altogether when compared with the riff-monster that the later versions will mutate into.\n\nThis is what Motorhead emerged with from the studio and delivered to their label. Of course, the time-honored Motorhead tradition of being royally shat upon by record companies had to start somewhere, and United Artists provided a brilliant kick-start by promptly proceeding to toss the album into their vaults and keeping it unreleased. Predictably, it was suddenly issued four years later, when the band started getting places, and then reissued over and over ad nauseam. This particular version, though, has something new to offer - 4 bonus tracks that actually predate the rest of the album, basically alternate demo takes with a different producer ('On Parole', 'City Kids', 'Motorhead' and 'Leaving Here'). Taylor was not involved yet, so all 4 tracks have Lucas Fox on drums, which is pretty much the only possible point of interest they offer.\n\nWhen this album finally DID see the light of day Motorhead was already a different beast... but fans should still find this interesting, for its historical curiosity value, if not for the excellent first track.\n",
        "\nFor some reason, Motorhead's '79-'81 output gets all the praise, yet this album seems to go unmentioned. Exactly why is anyone's guess - the songwriting here stands very nicely on its own. This album may not be a constant stream of well-known tracks, or a steady succession of signature NWOBHM/speed metal moments, like 'Ace of Spades' for instance; in actuality it has more in common, perhaps, with the primal form of traditional heavy metal, as some of these songs would have been quite at home on one of Black Sabbath's (or even Judas Priest's) '70s efforts. Lemmy may not consider Motorhead to be part of the \"metal movement\", but the fact remains that Motorhead and heavy metal in general were products of the same process with the same source materials: the proggy, quasi-epic remnants of acid rock, streamlined and solidified into a loud, lumbering and archetypal style of expression.\n\nIt is a bit unfortunate that the album-opening title track does not quite live up to its promise here - the mix isn't the best, the vocals sound strained and the drums are somewhat ham-handed. Nevertheless, 'Motorhead' is a fitting introduction to the band, with its vigorous speed, its opening distorted bassline, and the lyrical subject matter which quite literally gave birth to the definition \"speed metal\", although the ill-fated 'On Parole' album features a more interesting version (and, of course, there's always the definitive live one, off 'No Sleep Til Hammersmith').\n\n'Lost Johnny' (which like 'Motorhead' used to be a Hawkwind song) has metamorphosed here into a red-blooded traditional metal tune - perhaps more melodic than the usual Motorhead fare - which could have appeared on any of the seminal albums by other '70s metal pioneers, and brings to mind a few successors as well, what with the same characteristic rhythm pattern which later propelled such songs as Maiden's 'Wrathchild' and Venom's 'In League With Satan'. The heavy, almost Sabbath-like 'Iron Horse/Born To Lose' and the frenetic, agitated 'White Line Fever' are other highpoints, as is the midpaced, quasi-epic amphetamine hymn 'Keep Us On The Road', featuring an excellent little bass solo. 'The Watcher' - yet another redone Hawkwind song - has also gone far since the original acoustic version, presented here as a somewhat understated but creepy tune that sounds straight out of something like 'Sin After Sin' with its vague psychedelic overtones and reverberating guitar.\n\nThe Yardbirds cover 'The Train Kept A Rollin' and the closing track 'City Kids' could have been dispensed with; the CD version also adds the contents of the 'Beer Drinkers' EP - recorded at the same sessions - which is mostly disposable material as well; a ZZ Top cover, a plaintive and uninteresting rock'n'roll song, an instrumental, and another vapid cover (of the Bluesbreakers this time). Nevertheless, the main segment of the album stands very nicely on its own alongside the next three albums and solidifies Motorhead's position in the '70s metal/NWOBHM hierarchy; and considering that most of the material here was recorded in two days, that is no small feat.\n",
        "\nI remember meeting a fellow in my high school in the fall of 1983, who was the first real headbanger I'd ever met at the time. he was the first fan of this band I'd ever met also, and after hanging out with him for a while, being the impressionable geek I was at the time, I inevitably ended up wanting to enmulate him. So one day, I took my entire allowance to the record store and dropped it all on ths original leather sleeve version of this double album--an unheard of thing for me back then. Rushing home, I ripped off the plastic wrap, threw it on my turntable...and was completely devastated. I had never heard a bass guitar sound that mean and nasty before, and it made my jaw hang in disbelief! From that point onward, after my initial dabblings into the hard rock realm, like Quiet Riot, WASP, and Motley Crue, as well as Iron Maiden, I knew what I wanted from music and it was MORE of this wildly fast, manic buzz bomb roar! My descent into the realms of real metal began with Motorhead on that very day, and I remember it most fondly--like a guy remembers losing his virginity. \n\nThis is the most crucial Motorhead ever, because for newbies it will do just what it did for me--help them understand how long 'Head have been around and just how extensive their recorded legacy is. Not to mention it will serve as a gateway for heavier and better music as opposed to what kids listen to these days. Not to mention it will hip them to some of the best metal music ever recorded. EVER. Lemmy is GOD, and the more folks understand that, the better! You need this album, just as you need...hell, ANY Motorhead, really. Preferably the older stuff, of course...\n",
        "\nI am totally surprised that nobody has reviewed this album on this site! This was one of the albums that really got me going over Motorhead, along with \"No Remorse\" among many others. It has everything you could ever want from Lemmy AKA \"God\" & Co.; loose, bluesy, Bo Diddley-inspired riffing (most of Lemmy's riffs are variants on that classic syncopated 4/4 rhythm), devastating crunch and wailing solos from the dual guitar tandem of Phil Campbell and Wurzel, Pete Gill's thundering double kick drumming, Lemmy's utterly unique vocals snarling out lyrics of violence and mayhem..what's there not to like? \n\nThe only reason this did not get 100 is the production, as Bill Laswell didn't quite have the right idea as to how to capture this raging locomotive (to coin one of their best tunes with this lineup)of a band. As a result, the sound is thinner than I prefer, but you can still hear everything perfectly well, especially Lemmy's trademark Texas chainsaw bass massacre! \n\n Standout tracks...umm, the whole album? OK, my faves: \"Deaf Forever\", \"Claw\", \"Mean Machine\" (total speed metal madness!), \"Riding With The Driver\", \"Doctor Rock\", and naturally the monolithic title track, which rides in on an ominous, spine-chilling wave of feedback and noise and segues into one of the best songs Lemmy has ever written, with that ultra-heavy bass riff anchoring the tune, and some of his best lyrics concerning war and politics: \"I hold a banner drenched in blood, I urge you to be brave/I lead you to your destiny, I lead you to your grave\" Evocative and shiver-inducing, this one is.\n\nAn unsung classic, is \"Orgasmatron\", and you need it, plain and simple.\n",
        "\nAnother Perfect Day was recorded in between line up changes. This was a step into a softer and more artistic sound, but this is not Hair Rock we are talking about, this is Motorhead! Fear not, it has no chance of being confused with Helloween's \u201cChameleon\u201d. It resembles one of Deep Purple\u2019s albums a lot more. The speed is still there. \u201cShine\u201d is one of the fastest tracks Motorhead have recorded. \n\n\u201cDancing on your Grave\u201d and \u201cOne Track Mind\u201d have a slower bluesy feel. \u201cRock it\u201c is my favourite track, it is straight ahead rock n roll in the vein of \u201cGoing to Brazil\u201d. The rest, while not as memorable are no filler and worth a listen.\n\nAs every Motorhead album, this has bonus songs. Mine has \u201cTurn you round again\u201d \u2013 the best of these, \u201c I\u2019m your hoochie coochie man\u201d, and \u201cDon\u2019t need religion\u201d. They add to the length, but the quality is in the main album songs. \n\nThe title of the review comes from a quote in the liner notes about the album and the following tour. Apparently some fans at the time thought Motorhead have sold out!!! If only Metallica would put out an album of this quality every time they decide to experiment. As far as the album sleeve it has the works \u2013 photos, lyrics, notes and a comic. \n\nIf you want to check out the more diverse side of Motorhead pick this up. If you are looking for something to go nuts to, or to kill the neighbours lawn and to give their cat a social disorder look elsewhere.\n",
        "\nAs most of you probably know, Mot\u00f6rhead plays quite raw and rocky heavy metal, sometimes bordering on speed metal. We Are Mot\u00f6rhead is not different. All of the songs are straightforward rockers except for two tracks. God Save the Queen is a Sex Pistols cover but it is a lackluster version of an average song. The only not-straightforward song of the album is One More Fucking Time which is a ballady tune that sticks up best from the crowd but in the end it turns out to be quite boring a song. The song just drones on for much too long though it clocks in at 6:46.\n\nOf the rockers Out To Lunch and Wake the Dead are the two best cuts of the bunch. They just flow much better than the rest of the songs. The first two songs See Me Burning and Slow Dance on the other hand are the weakest with See Me Burning not flowing at all and Slow Dance being one of the most boring songs by Mot\u00f6rhead.\n\nThe weakest point of the whole album is plainly that the material just doesn't cut it on the long run. All of the songs sound fine the first couple of spins but after that you realize how shoddily they are built and get bored with them. We Are Mot\u00f6rhead is an entertaining album but on the long run it is useless.\n",
        "\nI picked this album for one reason and one reason only: BURNER!! Masterful, tight, speed/thrash metal. Easily one of the best Motorhead songs from the 90s. 2 minutes and 52 seconds of pure fucking destruction you just can't live without. \n\nWith Motorhead having such a good streak of killer songs on the albums I heard before this, I thought the rest would be on par with the aforementioned song/slab of punishment.\n\nBut no.....\n\nThe problem of this album can be summed up in:\n\n1) Lemmy's voice. It sounds just too jolly and happy for my taste, and with a gruff voice like his the last thing you wanna hear is THAT.\n\n2) The songwriting itself. To name a few examples: \"On your Feet on your knees\" is just mediocre speed metal, \"I'm your Man\" almost sound like Soundgarden with grunted vocals, \"Lost in the Ozone\" begins like a Guns 'n Roses ballad and \"Don't let Daddy Kiss me\" is just an abomination of the worst nature. Not much like Ozzy's \"So Tired\", but, damn me, it pulled it's biggest effort to get on that sucking level.\n\n\"Born to Raise Hell\". With such a title I thought \"man, this is going to kick my ass bigtime\". But no. Is just a rock 'n roll-ish number that, in itself, isn't bad, but is very lacky in terms of aggression.\n\nAnd what the hell is up with \"Devils\"? I swear, the part at the end sounds EXACTLY like a song from the 80s I just can't remember from where it came. Sting? Beats me.\n\nBut the guitar tone kills. Too bad it can't save this album from total mediocrity. \n\nOne kickass song. The rest is either VERY mediocre, or just shite. Approach with caution.\n",
        "\nMot\u00f6rhead is a damn cool band. Their music is also cool. But I have one problem with them. Many of their songs sound so alike. Which is why I can't give \"Ace of Spades\" a higher score. \n\nThe album opens with the title track, which is simply blinding! It's my favourite song of theirs, and I'm sure many others feel the same way. The riffs and the lyrics are just insanely cool. Love Me Like a Reptile is also a good song, with a nice riff. Nothing compared to the title track, though. Shoot You in the Back follows the same style as the previous two, only slightly more laidback. And this is where you begin to realize that Mot\u00f6rhead isn't exactly the most varied band out there. Still, it's a good song. Live to Win and Fast and Loose are next, and although they certainly don't stink, the fact that they come after the previous songs makes them a bit tiring. But then, track number six arrives. (We Are) The Road Crew is an excellent song, with an awesome riff and some seriously badass lyrics. Suddenly there is hope for this album! That is, until Fire Fire is played, and the album goes back into a-good-song-but-why-bother mode. \n\nJailbait stands out a little, luckily, but by now you understand that you're not gonna be surprised by the tracks that comes after. And you don't. Dance is average, Bite the Bullet is more than long enough, despite clocking in at only 1:38, and The Chase is Better Than the Catch is just boring. The album ends with The Hammer, which is only a variation of what has gone before. Good, but unneccesary. The three bonus tracks, Dirty Love, Please Don't Touch and Emergency, give me nothing, and are therefore useless filler material.\n\nI should also mention that the production is very raw, which suits the music, but doesn't add anything special. For all the coolness this band radiates, it can't hide the fact that they write the same songs again and again and again. They almost make AC/DC seem varied. Only almost, though, since that's impossible, haha. As this is by very many considered Mot\u00f6rhead's finest album, I should probably not buy anything else by them. At least I tried.\n",
        "\n\"We are Motorhead ... and we are gonna kick your ass!\" First of all a warning to people new to Motorhead. If you are thinking of buying your first record, after listening to this you will be disappointed with studio versions of the songs. The songs on this album are performed much faster than originals. The sound quality of recording is crisp and clear. It is slightly better quality than previous two live albums. The songs are reproduced perfectly without a glitch. The crowd noise is minimal. When the crowd can be heard it gives off an impression of a collective German headbanging orgy. The band is at their explosive best, they don't take a breather and just keep rolling accelerating as the concert progresses. \n\nThere are no bullshit 10 minute solos, no wankery, no medley's (Fuck you Metallica!). Just the songs as they were in the studio atr twice the speed and with an extra kick in the nuts in the form the sheer loudness of the recording. The track selection is right on the money, the selection is made for speed, for adrenaline, for all things Motorhead are famous for. More on selection a little later. \n\nMotorhead explodes onto the stage with \"Iron Fist\". Somewhere in the middle of CD 1 the breaks are cut and just as you thought it cannot get any faster it blitzes past you in a roar of Heavy Metal frenzy. This stuff is pure VIAGRA for your ears, you cannot help yourself as your heart accelerates as your brain is pounded into little pieces by precision metal riffs. Your ears are going to orgasm, you are going to headbang and then your brain is going to cum again and again for the whole TWO FUCKING HOURS. Standouts on CD 1 - whole fucking thing. \n\nThe selection on both disks is smart as it gives listener exposure to a lot of new live material. It covers the two decades in good balance without favouring earlier or later released material. Some of the tracks that did not sound too well in the studio here come out as totally new material. Case being \"Take the Blame\", \"Going to Brazil\" and a few others. The only ballad on here \"Lost in the Ozone\", on this one Lemmy actually sings (!), and it feels like a cigarette after a mind-blowing fuck. \"Lost in the Ozone\" is the emotional side of Lemmy and the song just rips through your heart. Standouts on CD 2 - whole fucking thing. \n\nAs far as the score it is 99/100, only because it is \"theoretically\" possible to make a better live album although I have yet to hear one that tops this.\n",
        "\nOverkill...several things come to mind when you hear this word. A band? More than likely. Stupid $40 pants at Hot Topic? Perhaps. But, when I hear this word, this album is the first thing that pops into mind. This album is a landmark, a beginning, and a revolution all in a nice little package! Out of all the \"Eddie albums,\" this one is my favorite. The album is so great, Lemmy could've only put out the title-track and it probably would've sold just as well. IT'S THAT DAMN GOOD! \n\n\"Overkill\" -Like I said...(side note: the \"third solo-ending\" is my favorite out of the three.) \n\n\"Stay Clean\" -I really like the Hammersmith version more, mainly because this one seems slower. \n\n\"Pay Your Price\" -Personal favorite for some reason. I just really like the grooviness of it, not to mention the lyrics are enjoyable :) \n\"I'll Be Your Sister\" -I laughed just at the title! The whole song sounds like Lemmy trying anything to get some (and if you listen closely, it also sounds like a rough version of \"Shoot You in the Back\"). \n\n\"Capricorn\" -Kinda bluesy, and one of the many songs that tell the story of Lemmy's life. \n\n\"No Class\" -Unlike \"Stay Clean,\" I like this studio version more than the Hammersmith one. This version sounds heavier and the guitar isn't half as sloppy as it is live. \n\n\"Damage Case\" -Like \"Pay Your Price,\" I like this one mainly for the groovish-feel it has throughout the whole song. At least one of them is still a live staple. \n\n\"Tear Ya Down\" -For some reason, this is one of those songs you want to listen to while on the road at night. It's very energetic and has that \"crash into your front door\" feeling to it. \n\n\"Metropolis\" -This song just doesn't give me the same sense of enjoyment as the others. At least they sped it up on Hammersmith. \n\n\"Limb from Limb\" -For the first part of the song it sounds like just another bleuser you hear while drinking in some dusty ol' bar. But by the 2:12 mark, BAM! we're getting somewhere! This is raw energy and fun for everyone! I love this song, but it's one of those where you have to be patient and wait for the good stuff.\n",
        "\nThis album, like Lemmy says himself, is a classic. The album itself is musically satisfying, and the songs individually could survive on their own as a single. \"The One to Sing the Blues\" is a most excellent way to start 1916. \"I'm So Bad\" is a fun, fast-paced song that plays in the background while you tip your hat to your one-night stand. \"No Voices In the Sky,\" another fun 'n fast one, could be considered a heavy punk song, what with it's anti-wealth/religion/politics message. \"Going to Brazil\" definitely reflects Lemmy's love for good ol rock 'n' roll, with it's 50/60's era piano and guitar playing. \"Nightmare/The Dreamtime\" is a nice soothing (one of the few times \"soothing\" can describe a Motorhead song) and a nice one to listen to if you're having problems sleeping, as long as you can ignore Lemmy's creepy little gnome grumbles. \"Love Me Forever\" is a nice little ballad, though not one of Lemmy's lyrically strongest. Being a resident of SoCal, I love Lemmy's lyrics to \"Angel City,\" but I also enjoy it because I can't listen to it without thinking of a lounge-like version of it. \"Make My Day\" is another classic, and i personally enjoy it's ever so catchy chorus. You better focus real hard or you'll miss \"RAMONES,\" which took me a total of two minutes to learn it on guitar. \"Shut You Down\" doesn't really have anything special to it, but it's still a catchy and groove-like, so I don't skip it. Then, finally, we have the actual song \"1916.\" This song will not only make you choke on your tears, make you want to celebrate Memorial Day early and wonder why it wasn't on the credits to Saving Private Ryan. So cheers Lemmy! This is probably the best album the four peice Motorhead ever made (unless you count Sacrifice since Wurzel left after the recording).\n",
        "\nPretty much every metal band out there does the obligatory \"live album\" thingie, but only a small fraction of them comes right out of it in flying colors, Motorhead being one of them.\n\nNow, there are two kind of live albums: a) The \"live\" ones, which need to be overdubbed because of bad interpretations and/or need to make them sound as close as the studio versions as possible and b) The REAL live ones, the kind that makes you feel you're right there between the audience, living the concert experience to the fullest. Needless to say, \"No Sleep 'till Hammersmith\" belongs to the last cathegory, and that's why is so fucking cool in the first place.\n\nI mean, you can tell by listening to this that Motorhead was (still is?) a very competent live band, there are no major flaws in the execution of the songs except on \"We are the Road Crew\" were Eddie's guitar fucks up during the solo. But that's a minimum complain, after all, if you want a REAL live album you should cope with the fact that there are gonna be some mistakes. This isn't Dream Theater, this is fucking Motorhead, the fastest, ugliest rock 'n roll band in the world.\n\nObligatory highlights: \"Overkill\" slays. Pure and simple. Just listen to the solo, the absolute peak of this album. Good old Eddie is flaming, someone bring the fire extinguisher!!! Negative, just let him burn 'till the song finishes. \"Ace of Spades\", which doesn't come too different compared to the studio version, but rules, nonetheless. It is \"Ace of Spades\" i said, it is supposed to fucking rock. \"The Hammer\", also the two finishers \"Bomber\" and \"Motorhead\". You'll enjoy this album, in fact, you're gonna love it. Motorhead owns your soul. \n\n(Special mention goes to the band themselves, for being so fucking intense on stage, but also to \"the rawest voice...in any road crew\". Hahahaha, you'll know it when you hear it :)\n",
        "\nI got this album way back in the day for twenty cents. I am not making this up... it was on tape, and I wore it right the fuck out after a few years. Yes, it is that good. Imagine the typical Motorhead sound, with all the nice melodies combined with Lemmy's gruff vocals, all played at a reasonably fast pace, just like it should... now, add \"one more\". Yes, this Motorhead goes to eleven.\n\nThere's just something to be said about an album being live - when the crowd gets into it, and the band feeds off that, it's so much more interesting than sitting in a studio and hoping that the engineer is rocking out and having a good time spinning the dials. This is a pretty good quality recording - a bit on the raw side, but hey, it's Motorhead, not Sonata Craptica. \n\nWe have here most every Motorhead you would need to hear... it's a very good introduction to the early years of the band. \"Ace of Spades\" is their ubiquitous opener, that everyone knows, and then we get into the headbanger \"Stay Clean\", the slightly slower and thrashier \"Metropolis\", and then \"The Hammer\", \"Iron Horse\" all classics. \n\n\"No Class\" is pretty nice, and then we have the awesome \"Overkill\", which named a band that spawned an entire genre... fuck yeah! And yes, that's the BASS that's playing that burner of a main riff. And then the song ends, and no it doesn't, and it ends, and NO IT'S BACK FOR MORE!!! Overkill indeed!\n\n\"We Are the Road Crew\" is blazing fast, and \"Capricorn\" a bit slower but... Lemmy introduces it as a nice slow song, yeah right. \"Bomber\" and \"Motorhead\" close the album - all done excellently well, with great raw energy. \n\nHighlights... Fucken \"Overkill\" and \"The Hammer\" are my faves, but pretty much everything on here is indispensable... Ready! Set! Bang! You need this one!\n",
        "\nSacrifice is one of my favorites, if not THE favorite album. The sound is quite special, at first I didn't like it, the guitars sounded a bit \"wooly\", but it took me a couple of years to discover what a great album this is.\n\nThe titelcut, 'Sacrifice' is like being hit by a freigth train. Mikkey Dee's awesome drumming just nails you to the wall, it's aggressive and right in your face. I think this is one of the albums that really emphasize Mikkey's drumming. \n\nThe songs on this album varies a bit on this one too, while 'Sacrifice' is brutal, 'Over Your Shoulder' is mid-tempo and heavy. All in all this is quite a heavy album. LIke many of the other albums Motorhead have released, it shows good quality songs. Well written lyrics, often with a war-theme, unjustice and free speech.\n\n'Make 'em Blind' is also one of my favorites, again I have to mention Mikkey's drums, they're so fascinating and is an important part of this song.\n\n'Don't Waste Your Time' stands out as a real rock'n'roll song with a boogie guitar, saxophone and piano. But it sounds quite heavy regardless of these not-so-metal instruments.\n\nThe last song on this album 'Out Of The Sun' is a killer too, melodic and strong, it opens a bit discreet and then suddenly the amps are turned to 11. \nAs already stated I like the whole album, but the songs that I've mentioned here are my favorites.\n\nBuy this album if you don't have it. It'll raise your roof, mine is gone.....\n",
        "\nBizarrely lauded as a return to a form which they\u2019d never really lost (unless you count 1992\u2019s slightly below par \u201cMarch Or Die\u201d), \u201cWe Are Motorhead\u201d is, in the opinion of this reviewer, one of Motorhead\u2019s weaker albums. The two opening tracks, \u201cSee Me Burning\u201d and \u201cSlow Dance\u201d are among the worst the lads have ever recorded, especially the latter. The lyrics to these tracks are truly awful by Lemmy\u2019s standards. Things pick up after these tracks with great songs like \u201cStay Out of Jail\u201d, \u201cStagefright/Crash and Burn\u201d and the title track but there are still songs that don\u2019t quite hit the mark. \u201cWake the Dead\u201d and \u201c(Wearing Your) Heart on Your Sleeve\u201d are both decent tracks but they are missing that extra ingredient that would make them more enjoyable. The undoubted highlight of the album has to be the ballad \u201cOne More Fucking Time\u201d, which is an all time great Motorhead song, but unfortunately there are just too many less impressive tracks on the album. \n\nNot a bad album but not up to the usual standard.\n",
        "\nMotorhead marched on through the 90s releasing yet another ripsnorter of a long player in 1996. Top quality rockin' tunes abound in this ferocious assault on the senses. \"Civil War\" kicks off the procedings and in usual Motorhead style the opening track is heavy as hell. For me though, the album truly comes to life with the 2nd song, the bluesy \"Crazy Like A Fox\" complete with furious Phil Campbell riffs and an all too brief Lemmy harmonica solo. He really should play that thing more on their CDs. Next up is \"I Don't Believe A Word\" which contains arguably Lemmy's greatest and deepest lyrics. It's a slow pased number with haunting vocals and a powerful chorus, not forgetting the doomy bass solo intro.\n\"Eat The Gun\" is a sarcastic rant against America's mental gun laws and the title track is now a live staple and a bonafide Motorhead classic. \"Love Can't Buy You Money\" deals with the issue of greedy fuckers pretending to be your friend to get in on your cash . \"Broken\" is another popular live tune, \"Them Not Me\" is a very funny dig at those who gain pleasure from the misfortune of others and \"Murder Show\" deals with pretty much the same subject but without the humour.\nThe last two songs are among the best on the album \"Shake The World\" is one of the heaviest tracks you'll hear. Reminiscent of \"Orgasmatron\" and easily as good. The album then closes with the excellent \"Listen To Your Heart\". It's quite a poppy tune by Motorhead's standards but that shouldn't put you off. It's almost as if this track is the answer to the problems described through most of the other songs. \n\nA masterpiece. Almost as good as \"Bastards\" but not quite.\n",
        "\nDespite an undeserved reputation for otherwise, Motorhead continue to surprise and delight with every release. Their latest offering is no different, kicking off as it does with the stupendously rifftastic, melodic rocker \"Walk a Crooked Mile\". This track is truly Motorhead at their finest. The chorus is so melodic it defies belief, yet it still rocks like fuck with an phenomenally groovy bassline. This track alone is worth owning the CD for, although as luck would have it the rest of the CD is damn good too. \"Brave New World\" has Lemmy berating society and it's ill placed values in his usual inimitable style while \"Voices From The War\" has the gnarled rocker lamenting wasted lives on the battlefield. There's plenty of the traditional Motorhead swing here too in the shape of \"Mine All Mine\" and \"Dr Love\".\n\nThe album closes with the furiously paced \"Red Raw\" followed by the spoken word piece \"Serial Killer\". The previous reviewer commented that \"Serial Killer\" was Lemmy talking about how evil he is. That is of course complete cobblers. No one familiar with Lemmy's work could possibly believe Lemmy to be an evil man. The song is in fact a poem describing what might make a killer tick. Lemmy apparently had these lyrics for years but never put them to music.\n\nA great album though and a definite improvement on the disapointing \"We Are Motorhead\" album.\n\n8\u00bd/10\n",
        "\nThe band that can crush all \"brutal\" bands out there with their sheer badassity has returned! Motorhead are gods, plain and simple. \"Hammered\" lives up to its name as the band hammers out song after song that will hammer your ear drums into the center of your skull. The album starts off with one of the more melodic songs on the album, \"Walk a Crooked Mile.\" It is still centered around a heavy riff, but the chorus is pure Lemmelody. By the second song I'm already enjoying this more than the last two, and that opinion will still hold by the end; even though \"One More Fucking Time\" from \"We Are Motorhead\" is my favorite ballad by any band. The pace picks up a bit on the third song, \"Brave New World.\" It is a great song about how terrible the world would be without smoke, drink, and porn. I hope like hell they play this song on the tour, because it's one of those that forces you to shout along. But what am I saying? Every song on here does this! You gotta love a line like \"if Jesus showed up now, he'd be in jail by next week.\" There are several of the boogying rock 'n' roll metal songs we have all come to expect from the band: \"Down the Line\", \"Mine All Mine\", \"Dr. Love\", and more, as well as the heavy thrashier songs. The production is clear but not over done, and does well in capturing the energy of the band. The final track, \"Serial Killer\", is a dark spoken piece where Lemmy is talking about how evil he is. It makes for a nice closer. There are also a couple of bonus tracks on some versions album. I'm not sure who will be getting the bonus tracks, though, because the album has not been officially released yet at the time of this review. \"The Game\" is a rather unspectacular song from some WWF compilation, but the live version of \"Overnight Sensation\" is definitely worth the listen. There are not exactly miles of new ground covered here, but Motorhead sounds as vital and alive as ever. You may hear things you've heard before, but that does not make it any less entertaining and fresh. Motorhead age like a fine wine of destruction.\n"
