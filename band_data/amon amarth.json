        "\nAfter the somehow mediocre albums like Deceiver of the Gods, Jomsviking and Berserker, The Great Heathen Army has been the biggest surprise in a long time for me. I did not expect anything, actually I was pretty let down by their latest albums, so I was expecting just a standard Amon Amarth stuff that I\u00b4d forget right after the last song had ended.\n\nA mistake. The Great Heaten Army is a fucking KILLLER!!\n\nWhat a great time I had listening to the album. Amon Amarth has taken a new breath of quality of composition, melodies and ideas. To be honest, from my perspective it came to Once Sent from the Golden Hall\u00b4s brilliance closer than any other Amon Amarth album they had released. Amon Amarth released several music videos that, to be honest, did not fit the mood of the album. They were weird and that is why the music itself felt somehow weak. However, listening the full album without any video distraction, the songs can finally breath and they make a sense in the album\u00b4s perspective. Just like Darkthrone\u00b4s single Hate Cloak was not too exciting when the music video was released, however after the full ablum was released Hate Cloak showed its full strength and its rightful place on the album.\n\nThere are fast and brutal songs like Get in the Ring or Oden Owns You All, there are moody songs like Dawn of Norsemen or the ending The Serpent's Trail and there are very melodic songs like catchy Heidrun or Find a Way or Make One. None of the song is a filler, every song has its sense and reason why is on the album. Though don\u00b4t expect any surprising experiments, we are talking about Amon Amarth here and they are not known by their experimentation at all. Except one piece - the brilliant Saxons and Vikings. In the song Amon Amarth is accompanied by the band Saxon itself. Not only that the vocals of the both vocalists serve like an exciting battle between a Viking and a Saxon, but the song also contains a brilliant long heavy metal solo.\n\nWhat I don\u00b4t really like about the album is not anything on the album, it is the thing coming from the outside. For example, the song Get in the Ring does not get enough credits as due to the stupid music video many associated the song with an entrance theme for a wrestler. In reality this song has nothing to do with wrestling, nor it is aimed to be a theme for a wrestler. That\u00b4s totally nonsense. The song is about a Viking challening an enemy for a fight one on one. In reality there is no ring, no ropes, no... wrestling. I think Amon Amarth should stop making videos like this because the message of such videos is completely different from the message of the songs themselves. The same applies for the song Find a Way or Make One. In the video we can see the members of the band in suits and offices. I mean... Yeah, there is a metaphor behind it, of course I get it, however it does not fit the mood of the song. Such a metaphor is totally unnecessary. The song is about a Viking trying to survive his battle in battlefield with his axe and thoughts of his Gods he believes in. Really, these videos harmed the album in my opinion.\n\nBut back to the album. Get in the Ring is a fantastic opening. Brutal, yet melodic. The title song The Great Heathen Army is a hymnic song that was definitely written to be sing along with the crowd during concerts. I can imagine this song being the last in the set. Nothing wrong about it but regarding the writing itself it is not as spectacular as the rest of the album. The most funny song is the third one, the supermelodic Heidrun. Heidrun is a goat that produces mead for the einherjar, so regarding this theme nobody could really expect a serious song with grimmy melodies. That is why the song is so catchy and it does not take itself too seriously. Despite its relaxing atmosphere it does not subvert the album, not at all. This just proves how good Amon Amarth is at mixing melodies with death metal. Oden Owns You All is the next song and it serves as an eye-opening song after the catchy song before. As if it says \"Hey, we\u00b4re still Amon Amarth. We love to jest, but we\u00b4re still the brutal band.\" This is the heaviest and fastest song on the album, a song where death metal meets groove metal. The first half of the album is closed by the already mentioned Find a Way or Make One. It is a good Amon Amarth song, amongst the most melodic on the album, though definitely not as \"free-thinking\" as Heidrun.\n\nThe second half of the album is much darker. The fifth song Dawn of Norsemen brings memories of Once Sent from the Golden Hall with its rainy mood and the lyrics serving as a story about Vikings appearing at the shores of England and spreading fear amongst its inhabitants. Very nice! Now it is time for the already mentioned Saxons and Vikings. Indeed a brilliant song with an unexpected twist. The last two songs on the album are Skagul Rides with Me and The Serpent's Trail. The two are the slowest songs on The Great Heathen Army and also the most atmospheric. They have nice compositions, grizzly harmonies and they force listeners to think about what they have experienced during listening this album. Of these two I prefer the last one as Skagul Rides with Me seems to me a bit underdeveloped, it\u00b4s missing a strong middle section and variabilities at its end.\n\nThe Great Heathen Army is full of epic and beautiful melodies that are a trademark of their first albums. What a welcome return to form! I am really happy that Amon Amarth was finally able to compose an album with qualities that can be found on their early material. Thank you Amon Amarth for this album! I will remember it as one of your best work ever.\n\nPros\n- no filler, every song is interesting in its own way\n- grimmy atmosphere \n- sad yet beautiful melodies\n- Saxons and Vikings is a very well done experiment\n- brutal vocals\n- nice compositions\n\nCons\n- The Great Heathen Army and Skagul Rides with Me needed a bit more time in the oven IMHO\n",
        "\nAfter the monolithic With Oden on Our Side and Twilight of the Thunder God duology, Amon Amarth found themselves on an auto-pilot-induced decline. The band had admitted a few years back in an interview that getting out new albums are a\u2026 necessary evil for them to tour. As long as they put together something good and familiar enough to keep people coming back, they can keep putting on a hell of a show. Not to mention, Amon Amarth at least do have a style that they could call their own. Like, you hear something from The Avenger, With Oden on Our Side or even Deceiver of the Gods, and immediately think \u201cyep, that\u2019s Amon Amarth alright\u201d. You get Johan Hegg\u2019s signature viking growls atop melodic Swedeath riffs none too dissimilar from Unleashed\u2019s debut but with an even more straightforward approach. As was in the excellent The Avenger, as was in the fun but flawed Surtur Rising, as was also in the lethargic Jomsviking...\n\n...and yeah, The Great Heathen Army sure maintains that sound. Granted, \u201cHeidrun\u201d couldn\u2019t be any bouncier without actually being a bouncy castle, and songs like \u201cFind a Way or Make One\u201d, \u201cDawn of Norsemen\u201d and \u201cSkagul Rides with Me\u201d sound more like they were left on the cutting room floor of the Surtur Rising recording sessions. There are many of the right ideas behind them to potentially make them good Amon Amarth songs \u2013 like, you get some hummable leads and riffs in spurts, particularly the lead and riff combo in \u201cDawn of Norsemen\u201d \u2013 but when stacked up against their former repute, these songs don\u2019t quite stack up. There isn\u2019t as much energy to the riffs, which are a bit simpler and thus the rhythms are even more straightforward, which leave less room for any truly memorable hits. Considering Amon Amarth\u2019s strengths include anthemic hooks, this does leave The Great Heathen Army behind a fair bit. Still ahead of the last two albums and a fair chunk of Deceiver of the Gods, yes, but it does lend credence to what the band had said about them making new albums these days.\n\nThankfully, it\u2019s not doomed to just be a lesser retread of previous albums, because songs like \u201cGet in the Ring\u201d and \u201cSaxons and Vikings\u201d \u2013 the latter featuring Saxon vocalist Biff Byford\u2019s still-stellar pipes \u2013 show them still having it where it counts. An invigorating rhythm section generating these simple yet effective cholera-catchy grooves \u2013 I mean this shit is Amon Amarth\u2019s bread and butter! Even for as much shit as I gave it above, \u201cHeidrun\u201d is a pretty fun song nonetheless, honestly due to how dumb it is. Just got a soft spot for those stupidly catchy, bouncy songs. Although I have to say, \u201cThe Serpent\u2019s Trail\u201d does well to have quieter, spoken-word-esque verses build up to a momentous mid-paced chorus, and its ending third sends the album off on a higher note of faster, harder riffing before disappearing into the night sky. I wouldn\u2019t put these songs as high as, say, \u201cTwilight of the Thunder God\u201d or \u201cBleed for Ancient Gods\u201d. However, I would certainly say that they have many of the usual Amon Amarth qualities that do make them such a fun band to listen to that it\u2019s hard to take any real issue with these songs. Can\u2019t wait to hear these live!\n\nI get that any Amon Amarth album could be somebody\u2019s first, but I do have some complaints about the album just on its own terms. In general, the production doesn\u2019t have a ton of punch, which pulls back some of the impact of the songs throughout. \u201cThe Great Heathen Army\u201d and \u201cOden Owns You All\u201d drag their feet with a stodgier riffset, attempting to be mid-paced anthems but plod far too much to really hit that note. \u201cThe Serpent\u2019s Trail\u201d avoids this pitfall due to its aforementioned finale-esque qualities. \u201cDawn of Norsemen\u201d has some cool melodic bits, like its leads that keep you hooked in, and it\u2019s got an overall peppy rhythm that would\u2019ve made it one of the better songs on the album. But it just fucking drags - like it could\u2019ve ended either at or right after the quiet bit in the middle, because basically having the song again as a refrain definitely shows its shallower qualities. Amon Amarth stick to a very straightforward style that leaves not very much room for nuance, and with a simpler batch of riffs, well, let\u2019s just say \u201cDawn of Norsemen\u201d is a bit too long.\n\nA few songs on here are still good and \u2013 a couple of songs aside \u2013 The Great Heathen Army is an improvement over their last couple of albums. I doubt we\u2019ll ever get something like With Oden on Our Side or even Surtur Rising again, but as long as they bring out the hits and don\u2019t degenerate into dull background noise like their last two albums, there\u2019ll at least be some new tracks to look forward to during the inevitable tour that follows.\n",
        "\nFor the better part of 30 years, the metal institution that is Amon Amarth has been a stalwart standard bearer for the Swedish melodic death metal movement. Originally cutting their teeth as part of the old school death metal scene in Stockholm under the moniker Scum, they would join the likes of Unleashed in promoting the historic exploits of the Viking Age within said stylistic niche, but also strike pay dirt in the broader scene by discovering a perfect middle ground between the brutality of the older style with the melodic consonance and atmospheric nuance that would be popularized by the then newer Gothenburg melodeath sound. In the years since they\u2019ve been a pinnacle of consistency in the recording studio, churning out classic albums one after the next from the late 90s to the present, and also proving a colossal force of nature on the touring front. Now following the scourge of worldwide lockdowns, these five Nordic bards of brutality have returned to raise the bar yet again with The Great Heathen Army, the band\u2019s twelfth album to date.\n\nThough never a band to sacrifice aggression for the sake of commercial viability, one could maybe argue that this outfit\u2019s stylistic evolution since 2008\u2019s Twilight Of The Thunder God has been towards a more structurally accessible and slicker niche. But for those who might have grumbled a bit about the unfettered fire after the spirit of Bolt Thrower that the band had emitted from their primordial beginnings up until 2002\u2019s Versus The World, their concerns likely began to subside with the release of the music video for this album\u2019s leading single \u201cGet In The Ring\u201d in early June. Taking the band\u2019s gritty Viking image and superimposing it into an apocalyptic future setting more befitting the Mad Max universe, it would subsequently garner over a million views on YouTube and rave reviews among the fans on the platform, with comparable numbers materializing on various streaming platforms. But more so than the cinematic visuals was the combination of haunting, Slayer-like dueling guitar harmonies and the pummeling battery of the surrounding music that would sell the fact that this band is still as in tune with their old school death metal roots as ever to any naysayers.\n\nSuffice it to say, the aforementioned leadoff single and opening track of this album is just the tip of an iceberg massive enough to sink an entire fleet of Titanic-like vessels. The ground-shaking stomp of the groovy title anthem \u201cThe Great Heathen Army\u201d further displays a rediscovered affinity with the darker echelon of the death metal sound circa the early 1990s (particularly The IVth Crusade), spearheaded by the guttural berserker growls of vocalist Johan Hegg, who continues to match forbidding displays of animalistic aggression with the biggest names of the death metal spectrum. Subsequent crushers like \u201cHeidrun\u201d and \u201cDawn Of Norsemen\u201d prove no less gigantic in stature, but lean a bit heavier on the Gothenburg side of the coin with greater melodic guitar hooks that take on a more folksy character and further vivify the explicit Viking themes being communicated, the latter even taking a few cues from the likes of Insomnium and Omnium Gatherum with a brilliant atmospheric bridge at the song\u2019s center, conjuring up the image of a roaring campfire in the frostbitten north to go with the relentless bombardment of riffs and fury.\n\nThere is pretty much a bit of everything concerning death metal to be found on here, which has basically been the case for most of Amon Amarth\u2019s output since the early 2010s, but the level of refinement has been ratcheted up something fierce. Arguably the most intense and definitely the most rapid-paced of the mix is the thrashing beast dubbed \u201cOden Owns You All\u201d, which could double as one of the more insane cookers off a recent Cannibal Corpse album, yet still makes time for occasional streams of melodic splendor to keep it from sounding like a more amped-up copy of said band\u2019s sound. \u201cFind A Way Of Make One\u201d hits all the marks of a mid-paced banger that also showcases one of the more involved lead guitar displays out of Johan Soderberg and Olavi Mikkonen in a while. But the offering that ultimately steals the show is the brilliant crusher \u201cSaxons And Vikings\u201d, which in addition to hitting all the right musical notes reprises the band\u2019s semi-recent practice of bringing in iconic guest vocal talent to complement the arrangement and sees a truly unforgettable interchange between Saxon\u2019s own Biff Byford with Hegg to bring home the corresponding bygone rivalry of the Norse and Britons.\n\nWhether one takes more to the nastier sound that originally carried this outfit to prominence at the turn of the millennium or the more polished one that has kept them a household name since the late 2000s, the latest opus bearing the Amon Amarth seal is the triumphant return that all can get behind. It matches the melodic pizzazz of Surtur Rising and rivals the thunderous power of Versus The World, and one might even venture that it\u2019s the best showing that this quintet of melodeath mainstays have put forth since the latter, though even a conservative estimation of it would put it a rung above the past three LPs. There isn\u2019t a dull point to be found in the gargantuan battle axe that is The Great Heathen Army, and though a few scattered scoffers might remark that it is simply more of the same, it\u2019s a safe bet that the medieval lords who fought to repel the original Viking raiders might have remarked similarly while still being in utter terror of such an unrelenting foe.\n\nOriginally written for Sonic Perspectives (www.sonicperspectives.com)\n",
        "\nAn unbridled passion exudes from the first few seconds barely; an energy that remains throughout the journey. Without a hint of forced technicality anywhere, a natural momentum lives in this album. It's a relentless series of inspired parts, all musical and organic, with an emphasis on composition that reaches deep to pull out moments of sheer emotional climax. There's a genuine sense of dignity and honor oozing out of this, profusely and without warning as it grabs the listener time and time again by the gut and never lets go. It's as vibrant and beautiful, after all these years. The song-writing is of a more ripe brand here than on the previous (and exceptional) 'Versus the World', that had sublime parts but generally a rather straightforward presentation and development of those parts. Here, the band produces verses and main riffs of a comparable excellence only now organized with more elegance and nuance. \n\nTaking the very first track here; that in a very appreciable simplicity goes straight into the action avoiding the predictable and quasi-pompous preamble; the main theme strikes dramatically to seize the unprepared listener, but before any development is made on that, another section quickly interrupts to contrast the epic drama of the main theme with its own ominousness, and the two parts work perfectly together as rather than being remote conjunctions they feed off each other and describe opposing sides of the same coin. As will become the recurring methodology on this, the tremolo picking in full flight takes off as the verse finally arrives. That trademark Amon Amarth duo of the rhythm guitar tremolo picking the root/bass notes on one hand, with on the other the complementary tremolo-lead on top, that feels more efficient here being utilized as the weapon of choice for full instrumental culmination. A song like the second one, 'Where Death Seems to Dwell', builds on a strong foundation of a quiet unrest before the tremolos come on and it's like ecstasy running through the veins of all the musicians playing, like ecstasy igniting the spirit of the archetypal hero at war, which is of course the fundamental axis on which this music is built and thrives on. \n\nThe beautifully touching 'Fate of Norns' comes next, and again that riper structure can be appreciated, with towards the middle/end a darker part like shadow to the glowing daylight of the final chorus. That chorus is animated by a rare melancholy, somewhere between totally uplifting and also deeply sad. The story told of a man who loses his young son coupled with the weighty atmosphere surely aren't uplifting, but then the musical tone of it is like sadness in the light of day, in the greater context of life as a whole rather than a obstinate blackness of the moment. Close to a celebration of life through the tragic pain. The lyrics read: \"The fate of Norns awaits us all - There is no way to escape - The day to answer Oden\u2019s call - Or walk through Hel\u2019s gate\". There's a nice complexity in the nuanced color of it, and it's a fairly unassuming chorus but it's rather special when given closer attention. 'Pursuit of the Vikings' reintroduces the oomph and the lyrics return to the central matter of mastering one's destiny through martial force, later with the tremolo-laden sorrow there always; while 'Valkyries Ride' takes the album into a different direction with a sound more akin to original death metal with its progressions and overall texture. Melody is still very much there but not as the driving force, taking a step back behind the purely epic heaviness of it as it explores the more obscure corners of the Amon Amarth sound. It's got this all-conquering, ominous edge.\n\nAs is customary, the band once again on this album confers to the tracks the essential quality of distinct identity. There isn't one track that'll remind the listener of another. It's clear each song was worked on as an individual entity, separate from the others. Even picking a random one on this, say Track 6 'The Beheading of a King', not nearly an iconic or well known track from the band, and that quality is again obvious. It shouldn't take more than a couple days' listens for the discovering novice to start humming it. All in all, an argument could be made this album despite its advancements in structure, pacing or song-writing in general, might not be as powerful as the previous 'Versus' record, potentially deeper and more atmospheric. For all its strengths, this album may not have a track as emblematic as 'Death in Fire', or as heart-wrenching as 'Thousand Years of Oppression'. It's a tad cleaner, when the darker 'Versus' had that more underground intensity and authenticity to it.\n",
        "\nIt would be tempting to dismiss this album as faux epic candy metal. The album title \"versus the world\" or the cover art, some Norse mythology type protagonist in a defiant posture amidst the flames... those alone might put a potential listener off. The reality of it though, is as much as there's always an element of cheesiness in such artistic endeavors dealing with heroism, the music is simply some of the best; from track one to the very last; that one would find in that general area of melodic extreme metal, if we would just call it that for the sake of this review.\n\nIt appears every single section here from song to song is ripely wrought, carefully thought out and meaningful pieces of melodic heavy music. Every song has that strong backbone of either a basic chord progression or more articulate riff sections, intuitively crafted and resonant with sheer efficiency, spotlighting the immediately recognizable melodies this album is brimming with. Nothing on here, quite literally not one second of playtime, is superfluous or material gone self-indulgent and naively trying itself at experimental developments. There's no extra fat. It is all trimmed down to the very essential. Not every moment over these forty-eight minutes is utter brilliance, but the distribution per song between the more standard verses and the more unique melodies, is just as judiciously balanced as everything else on here. \n\nThe band makes it a point to endow every song with at least one signature stamp: the anthemic 'Death in Fire' has the tapping section, Track 2 has the tubular bells, the fantastical title-track has that four-stroke 'Ver-sus-the-world' tail to the chorus, Track 5 has that watery/chorus effect on the vocals (\"Set me free\"), 'Thousand years of oppression' shows off excellent maturity in the song structure with a rare spoken word sequence from vocalist Johan Hegg building into a climax, the unmistakable and rousing chorus on 'Bloodshed' or finally the absolutely sticky melody on that wistful last track... the album is far from standard linearity.\n\nWhat's lovely about it is, because every song is so strongly distinct and the melodies so palpable, with every new track starting it feels like a whole new world is opening up to us as the listener. It's like being a guest invited at a dinner table with every course being outstanding cuisine, and just being fed exactly the right portion for each dish, from the entr\u00e9e to the dessert, and not feeling replete at the end and with each concoction adding a worthy dynamic between them.\n\nA word on the production, which was paid close attention to: the guitars are perfectly detailed on the articulated faster picking action and wide on the power chords, the bass sounds deliciously full and aggressively present, the drums are tangible and the vocals feel at the heart of the mix without being protuberant over the rest.\n\nSo what about the music itself, in its guts ? It's might and fire on the heavier movements, and then it's the heart-wrenching sorrow that Swedish metal is so at ease with that leads the show. The melodies seem to always offer that perfect marriage between the epic warlike dimension, and unadulterated, pure sorrow. It always felt like \"Sorrow through the nine worlds\", the band's debut title, was the perfect slogan for their music. The grandeur and adrenaline of honor-based warfare, and the sorrowful scenes of tragedy, as if forever intertwined to form and lend a very lyrical meaning to the music. That duality and competition between these two overarching forces in the songs is what makes this music viable: all of just one, or the other, would quickly turn unsavory.\n",
        "\nWhat Amon Amarth was at the beginning of the century is far cry from what they are now. Their interestingly named debut Once Sent from the Golden Hall captures the aura of Vikings' times in an exceptional way which unfortunately they have not been able to imitate again.\n\nOnce Sent from the Golden Hall is a brutal and bestial viking black death metal with a breathtaking sound wall destroying everything in its way. Remember the Tunguska event? It was no meteorite or UFO but Amon Amarth's guitars! If proud battles of Vikings ever had a sound, they must have sounded just like this album.\n\nThe album begins with the song called Ride for Vengeance which gives the listeners a perfect example of what is about to come in the next songs. A \"buzzing\" guitar sound so typical for black metal but heavy enough for death metal ehnahnced with catchy melancholic melodies and especially story-like lyrics which are no metaphors but an actuall story. In this case the song follows a mournful nordic dad who holding his dead son who has been slewn by several Christians promises vengeance. And he sets out for the vengeance. How it ends, however the song does not tell.\n\nBasically every song is like Ride for Vengeance. The songs are brutally fast, uncompromising and straight to the point. It is amazing how this album is able to draw such an unique atmosphere of cloudy rainy days with the smell of death all around. Kill or be killed. Only the strongest will survive. The weaklings have no chance. There are just Vikings, their philosophy of life and their pagan gods. If you happen to believe in something else, you will know their blades and wrath! This is basically the main lyrical theme of the whole album. No, it was definitely no fun facing an angry Viking in war.\n\nAmon Amarth describes the hard times of Vikings without any embellishments. Proud men die, proud warriors perish in battles, christian women are raped and christian churches are burnt. You will not find any choruses here, every song has beautifully straightforward lyrics. The Dragons' Flight Across the Waves tells a story of a good father who looking at the horizon goes to war while his family is still sleeping, Abandoned, on the other hand, follows a Nord who had betrayed his pagan gods and became a christian. He is killed and in the moment of his death he realises that his new god is nowhere to be found and he dies alone full of shame.\n\nActually I cannot imagine this album being released in the present for the first time as our times are known for their political correctness. Yes, sometimes lyrics on this album are, well let's say, not very political correctness-friendly. Victorious March tells an explicit story of five vikings who destroy everything in their path and they... Just read it below.\n\n\"All sorrow is left for the women to bare,\nthe children cries, they live in fear.\nNo man was spared, no house or farm remains,\nno christian woman unraped!\"\n\nYes, this is the early Amon Amarth at the peak of their bestiality.\n\nThere is eight songs and every one is a perfectly crafted death metal art. Riffs and melodies create a bestial atmosphere full of tears, hopelessness and blood and guitar solos add to the songs even another level of melancholy. Johan Heggnon's way of singning is variable - growls, black metal shrieking or a drunken roar. Sometimes his voice sounds unseasonably or inexperienced but this is not a complain as it adds to the overall rawness and that\u00b4s definitely good. The music is melodic but its melodicity does not betray its rawness and cruelty. It stands like a sword of a Viking proudly stabbed to the chest of his enemy. \n\nThe times of Vikings are raw and brutal and so is the music on Once Sent from the Golden Hall. An exceptional album that provides with an exceptional experience.\n",
        "\nThe often overlooked The Avenger lives in the shadow Amon Amarth\u2019s superb debut. It doesn\u2019t help that it was released during an incredibly stacked year for melodic death. Too late to garner the acclaim of a first outing and too early to bask in the success of the mid-era\u2019s mainstream appeal, it needs some attention thrown in its direction. You could say they replicated the formula of Once Sent\u2026, but this was way, way before they were rehashing stale, watered-down ideas. Back then this was the beginning of a long-lasting line-up, the consolidation of their identity, and a mentality that capitalized on spirited momentum to explode onto a burgeoning Swedish scene. \n\nThese days Johan Hegg lost that authentic rage behind his voice, so hearing him during a time when he still had fire in his throat is so refreshing. It helps that he\u2019s not growling to feeble heavy metal riffs, but what feels like an unstoppable force of flaming hot, Nordic-themed melodic death metal. This was a time when that familiar Abyss Studio magic graced the riffs with callous, cutting distortion. It gives a nice blare to the guitars, beef to the bass, and suits Hegg\u2019s barbaric delivery. No clean singing, no gaps in the mix, no disingenuous performances; this absolutely rips. Lyrics, as detailed as they sometimes are, tend to be fairly predictable given the content \u2013 but there\u2019s enough heart (\u201cMetalwrath\u201d aside) to compel you to vibe with it.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to get swept up in the blend of (a lighter variation of) Swedish death metal\u2019s ferocity and the elegant melodies that made Amon Amarth so pleasing to hear. Unfortunately, no songs match the peaks of Once Sent\u2026, but the bar remains a constant high throughout The Avengers\u2019 short runtime. You have the blazing opener confidently showing off the fervent drumming, the catchy \u201cNorth Sea Storm\u201d, the anguished title-track, and even the devastating \u201cThor Arise\u201d brought back from the bygone era of OSDM. \u201cThe Last with Pagan Blood\u201d sounds both scornful and tunefully reminiscent of later albums (even parts of the verse sound similar to the future \u201cPrediction of Warfare\u201d). The proper closer, \u201cLegend of a Banished Man\u201d, is a total pulverizer and shows off a little more bass supplementing the leads to evoke that epic flavor.\n\nIt\u2019s tough being the second child (third if you count \u2026Nine Worlds), but The Avenger is a satisfying, solid second shot after a successful start. It does lack the refinement and memorability of later works, which partially explains why it gets glossed over in favor of those albums that provide instant gratification. But in the end, those later ones can\u2019t match the primal power of this.\n",
        "\nAmon Amarth are difficult to label with just one term. There's a definite element of death metal in the music, yet simply calling them \"death metal\" would be terribly misleading as they sound nothing like, say, Morbid Angel, a typical death metal band. They're not 'melodic death metal' either as they're technically, musically and even thematically very different from the early wave of Swedish bands (Inflames, Dark Tranquility etc) and their overflowing of riffy melodies and brighter musical airs. The tone here is a lot more grave.\n\nSo instead of spending time thinking of the right label, it seems wiser to break down what their sound is made up of. On their first studio full length here, they use a death metal rhythm section of rapid fire drum kicks, heavy overheads, forceful toms, backed by a prominent bass presence, and for the guitars a heavy use of tremolo picking with the band's trademark system of one dynamic lead tremolo riff conducting the melody on a higher pitch, over the steadier rhythm tremolo riff acting like the bass root-note and chord progression motor. \n\nThe vocals, by viking giant Johan Hegg, consisting of growls, loud shouts and screams contribute rhythmic patterns rather than melody although they are not monotonic. They bring the melodic guitar work to life with their foreground presence, injecting an enormous rush of energy necessary to fully animate the surrounding instrumental. So despite being technically similar to death metal the music at its core actually is anything but death metal in what it conveys. It is deeply sorrowful and has a penchant for suspended power chords with reverby leads playing on top, making it powerfully atmospheric and emotionally evocative. In this sense, it is vibrant with life and passion and over-the-surface versus the typical death metal band more focused on producing bleak, atonal and underground music. It should really be emphasized just how much the focus is on sheer, heart-wrenching sorrow; a Swedish specialty, but potently accomplished here in particular.\n\nEvery song offers a new aspect of the same album concept. No song repeats the same formula without supplying a fresh idea at the heart of it each time. Some are defiantly epic, others focus more on the profound sadness aspect while some even bring a bit of brightness to the mix ('Friends of the Suncross'). But they're all animated by a relentless vivid passion that never lets down and among the many things that could be said about the album, questioning its intensity is arguably not an option.\n\nLastly, the first verse riff to the track 'Amon Amarth' towards the end of the record is possibly THE most exceptional melody this reviewer has ever heard. Which sounds absurd, that a single melody could even receive such a distinction, but that's how strongly it might resonate with whoever listens. It sounds primordial and ancient, like it came out of some forgotten moment of human history. It's as invigorating as it is moving on a profound level. It remarkably depicts epic tragedy, with a hint of darkness, and it's almost got that feel of mythical tale/legend to it, like it illustrates musically an old fable from Norse mythology. An absolute hair-raising moment. Most of the time, to achieve such a result bands would resort to gaudy guitar work and overly dramatic and ultimately superfluous ways to produce emotionally intense music; but this instead is just so very plain and unassuming. It is so much the real thing rather than a cheap forced imitation of it. \n\nThis debut album was a sign of great things to come, albeit a little raw compared to the later works, and it helped set this band apart forever. How many bands in the field of melodic sounding death metal are instantaneously recognizable the way Amon Amarth are ?\n\nAnnable Courts - http://antichristmagazine.com/review-amon-amarth-once-sent-from-the-golden-hall-metal-blade-records/\n",
        "\nEver since their third album Amon Amarth strayed further away from what made them unique in the first place. Those first two albums are fantastic and \"The Crusher\" had some interesting ideas. Over time the band became really watered down and way too catchy for their own good. Amon Amarth went from telling these intriguing stories to just repeating the same verses until the song ended. It's frustrating because this is such a good idea for a band, with tons of real life stories that they could be singing about. Even the music itself has been pretty thin when it comes to \"death metal\". On paper this is what I wanted Amon Amarth to become for some time now. A band that focuses on story telling and to incorporate some solos that, strangely, have been missing depending on the album in their disco that you listen to. Unfortunately, \"Surtur Rising\" is the Great Value brand of death metal and Amon Amarth.\n\nRight off the bat I am going to say that this album is by far their most tedious. Amon Amarth is no longer filled with any surprises and at this point you know what you're going to expect. The only difference is that some albums have solos and long tales for lyrics and others are more by the numbers. \"Twilight of the Thunder God\" had horrible song writing with only the closing track having any true Amon Amarth feel to it. With \"Surtur Rising\" the story-driven lyrics come back, but they are shockingly mediocre. Most songs in this album have a quick start only to go painfully slow with their tempo, to pick up again by the end of the song. This means that if you're jamming to a song, say \"Wrath of the Norsemen\", then at some point a slow section will randomly pop up and it immediately ruins the momentum for that song. It seems like a small nitpick, but a lot of the songs have pretty slow tempo and if you combine that with the uninteresting lyrics then it becomes a real slog. When there is a slow section you kind of wonder why it's even in there. For their entire career they have thrown in these slower sections in their songs. Most of the time it doesn't add anything besides pad the run time. \"T\u00f6ck's Taunt - Loke's Treachery Part II\" is an example of a song that just will not end. \n\nDon't get me wrong, I'm glad the solos have returned. Almost every song on here has a great solo performed by Olavi Mikkonen. They are distinct and exactly what I wanted in Amon Amarth's past albums. I have 0 complaints with any of the guitar work, drumming or vocals. Johan Hegg's voice has gone deeper in tone in the past few records, but it gives it a more death metal feel. If he wasn't so deep then I'd question why this was considered death metal in the first place. The intro to \"Doom Over Dead Man\" is so god damn good. I wish more of the album had that unique feel to it. It doesn't sound like anything else on the album and is probably the only song I could pick out of a lineup besides \"Destroyer of the Universe\" due to THAT song being a single. I love when Amon Amarth experiments, but for one song on the album? Come on. \"Twilight of the Thunder God\" was the same way. Most songs were very mediocre, besides the excellent \"Embrace of the Endless Ocean\". Do these guys have one good song idea that they use for the last tune? \n\nIt's a shame that Amon Amarth ran out of steam. The album isn't awful by any means, but you already know what you're going to get here. Every album after \"With Oden On Our Side\" sounds so watered down and familiar. \"Surtur Rising\" could have been thrown onto \"Twilight of the Thunder God\" and no one would have batted an eye. These are extremely strong musicians playing in their comfort level. They are great at what they do and are obviously very talented. These guys just do not know how to put it on paper and utilize their skills. Solos are great, but that song writing is awful and that makes this album the worst in their career up until this point.\n\nRecs: \"Destroyer of the Universe\" and \"Doom Over Dead Man\"\n",
        "\nI get \"With Oden On Our Side\" would be a hard album to follow up to. That album was a combination of what made Amon Amarth popular at the start of their career and what was popular at the time for mainstream metal. They had songs that broke typical song structure and just told stories. The band even incorporated solos back into their music. It was a great album for them and showed an upswing on what Amon Amarth was capable of. Two years later they create \"Twilight of the Thundergod\". An amazingly mediocre album that sounds like it was made by an idea of what Amon Amarth is instead of what they could be. \n\nFor starters, the title track is really great. I jammed it back in the day and it still holds up now. The buildup to \n\n\"Mighty Thor, grabs the snake\nfirmly by its tongue\nlifts his hammer high to strike\nsoon his work is done\"\n\nis fucking killer. It's one of the few songs I pit to when I see Amon Amarth in concert. With that being said, the rest of the album is pretty soulless. \"Twilight of the Thunder God\" is not a bad album, but compared to their past work it doesn't even come close. If we just talk about the lyric structure, then it's exactly what you get with any other paint-by-numbers melodeath. Most songs stop trying to tell stories and just repeat the same chorus until the song ends. \"Tattered Banners and Bloody Flags\" has a decent enough story only for it to end midway through the song. There is no conclusion for each individual story. At least in the title track Thor accomplishes something. In \"Tattered Banners and Bloody Flags\" you have this guy called Lopt, the Treacherous. He has a fucking army of zombies behind him heading towards Midgaard. Their faces are pale and are yelling out in random tongues because they're dead. So far, it's a great description. Okay, so there is no where left to run and the ground quakes. Midgaard is on fire and Heimdal sounds this battle horn so Valkyries can assist. Even Oden himself rides out. You know how the song concludes? That's it. It cuts off right there. What happens? Beats me, beats Amon Amarth. Next song.\n\nOne of the sole things I loved about Amon Amarth is the way they told a story. This is still evident on the title track and the fantastic finale, \"Embrace of the Endless Ocean\". That song is so simple and it reminded me of a way better time where Amon Amarth could write solid songs. It's about a slave that was freed and is heading home. He recalls all the things he missed from home since he's been away. Then a storm comes and he realizes that he won't be heading home. He was freed and then he will be killed before he could even get there. It's a very sad song that is pure Amon Amarth. This could have been placed on \"The Avenger\". It's really too bad no other song has a solid tale like that. \n\nWhat sort of makes up for the lack of song writing are the instrumentals. Johan Hegg sounds decent here with his deeper growls than high screams. I kind of miss when he was go a little higher, but that's more of a nitpick than anything. Unfortunately nothing else really stands out. Sure, you get some typical Amon Amarth melodies and a few solos thrown in, but not as many as I would like. I honestly didn't even notice Fredrik Andersson's playing on this release and he is one of my favorite members of the band. The solo on the title track sounds fantastic and then you kind of get random solos placed in the exact same spots in songs throughout the rest of the album. It's really hard for Amon Amarth to sound shitty though. As I said in another review, they are pretty consistent with their playing.\n\nOverall, \"Twilight of the Thunder God\" is not the worst album I have heard. For Amon Amarth, it's their worst album since \"Verses the World\". A mediocre album for Amon Amarth is still better than most. There is no denying that these guys have a ton of passion for the band, but I think they needed more time from 'Oden' to write a new album. The title track is very catchy and there is still some fire left in the lyrics as heard on \"Embrace of the Endless Ocean\". At the end of the day, this was the beginning of Amon Amarth's downfall. \n\nRecs: \"Twilight of the Thunder God\" and \"Embrace of the Endless Ocean\"\n",
        "\nAmon Amarth surprised me with \"Fate of Norns\". I honestly didn't think they could come back from \"Verses the World\". It seems that the same improvements there were put into \"With Oden On Our Side\" because this is a really good album. Most of the problems I had with \"Fate of Norns\", like the vocal quality and lack of solos, has been improved here. There are some characteristics that make me think that \"Fate of Norns\" is an ultimately superior album, but the positives of 'Oden' are better than the positives of 'Norns'.\n\nUnfortunately the album starts off with \"Valhall Awaits Me\". As soon as I listened to this, I kind of knew what Amon Amarth did. They went back to the repetitive and more traditional song structure. However, as the album went on I realized that it was only on certain songs that they ditched the long tales. It actually works here too. A song like \"Asator\" is written with intensity and the song length in mind. I admit, it's a bit simple for an Amon Amarth track, but \n\n\"Son Of Oden\nThundergod\nMaster of War\nAsator!\"\n\nis a really badass verse. The song is over before you know it and it opened my eyes to how Amon Amarth can perform a song with traditional structure but still own it. There are a couple songs that go on way longer than they should. Both six minute tracks: \"Gods of War Arise\" and \"Prediction of Warfare\" do not do well being so long. There is a bunch of filler on those tracks. This is a very passionate and emotional album, but they were hard to get through in parts. Then the opposite occurs with \"Hermod's Ride to Hel\". The song switches back to story form and I didn't want it to end. It's a beautiful song and probably the best on the album.\n\nWhat Amon Amarth is fantastic at are melodies. This album is filled with beautiful leads and is performed much better than on \"Fate of Norns\". I feel like the emotion is amplified here despite the lyrics being mostly about battles and death. It's a wonder what a couple solos would do. That's right, Amon Amarth are back to performing solos again. The only aspect of \"Valhall Awaits Me\" that I did enjoy was the solo in the end. These guys can write fantastic riffs and they left them out of the last album. These solos aren't melt-your-face-off intense or anything, but they are very fitting for each track.\n\nAlso gone are the very hoarse vocals of Johan Hegg. On 'Norns' it sounded like his voice was going out, but it's back to normal on this album. The band isn't as raw sounding as they used to be. The production is extremely polished on this record. In some ways I don't mind super polished albums, but I feel that the raw intensity really worked for Amon Amarth. It's all too perfect and takes away some of the emotion during the battle lyrics. Another thing I am surprised is gone is the bass. Maybe it just didn't stick out to me, but the bass was pretty absent on many tracks. They did this earlier on in their career and then the bass kind of made a comeback and then it went back to just normal bass lines that match up to the rhythm. I mean it's okay, but I'm a little disappointed by that. Fredrik Andersson once again rocks it with the complex drums. On the slower tunes, like \"Hermod's Ride to Hel\", he still puts on an amazing performance. He can easily perform a simple beat, but adds technicality and it's always much appreciated.\n\nAlso, as a small nitpick, I feel like \"Under the Northern Star\" should have been the last song on the album. It's a slower song that is incredibly emotional and ends with the warriors waiting for the winter to pass so they can continue traveling. It has these fantastic melodies that would be perfect for an outro. Instead, the song leads into \"Prediction of Warfare\". That song is about a warrior having dreams of a serpent on a ship, but then wakes up and fights the Irish. This isn't a huge deal to me, but I can't get it out of my head.\n\nI liked almost every song on this album. Despite the more traditional song structure, I feel that this is somewhat superior than \"Fate of Norns\". The good songs are great and the bad songs are still okay. There is a problem with song length and a couple tracks overstay their welcome, but overall it's not a huge problem. \"With Oden On Our Side\" is an extremely emotional album filled with lyrics of battle and pillaging. The lyrics aren't written as complex as I wanted them to be, but I still found satisfaction here. There are implements of classic Amon Amarth combined with better instrumental song writing. It's a very tight and polished album.\n\nRecs: \"Asator\", \"Hermod's Ride to Hel\", \"Under the Northern Star\",\n",
        "\nIt's been a while since I have listened to \"Fate of Norns\". From what I remember, Amon Amarth created another album of by-the-numbers death metal to appeal to a simpler audience, me included. I loved this album back in the day, but as I grew older I craved more. I eventually stopped caring about this band and moved onto other avenues. Reviewing Amon Amarth's disco really opened my eyes on how the band started out and had their rough patches. This includes the last two albums: \"The Crusher\" and \"Verses the World\". Before listening to \"Fate of Norns\" again, I was convinced that this band would never redeem themselves. Even though I loved this album so much when I was younger, I kept telling myself that it probably didn't age well. To my surprise, Amon Amarth comes through. They created not only a super solid record, but have the best lyrics since \"The Avenger\".\n\nWhat hooked me on early Amon Amarth was their storytelling. Their use of detail had me enamored with every track. They gave respect to the vikings and didn't make them out to be mindless killing machines. They had families and honor. The first two albums are excellent examples of Amon Amarth in their prime. \"Verses the World\" was the complete opposite of that and that's when I gave up on this band ever being good again. \"Fate of Norns\" changed my thoughts completely. This album has fantastic tales and beautiful riffs. Both of which were lacking on the previous effort. \n\nFor starters, each song is written extremely well. Both musically and lyrically I am once again paying attention to Amon Amarth. There are tracks about dying sons, the afterlife, naval battles, and revenge. What I really enjoyed is that the songs are told in story form again. There are sections where the lyrics repeat some, but it's done with extremely catchy and heavy hooks. For example, in the song \"The Pursuit of Vikings\", they repeat, \n\n\"Oden! Guide our ships\nOur axes, spears and swords\nGuide us through storms that whip\nAnd in brutal war\"\n\nIt repeats some, but you're not going to mind in the slightest. This changes from \"Verses the World\" where they had very weak choruses that didn't hype you up as much as this song. Every other song that utilizes a chorus, besides the very monotone \"Valkyries Ride\", does so in an appropriate manner. They never overstay their welcome. Most tracks don't have a chorus and is just a straight up story with gorgeous riffing. \n\nAmon Amarth began their signature sound on this record. If you heard Amon Amarth before, you know what you're in for. Songs like, \"An Ancient Sign of Coming Storm\" and \"The Beheading of a King\" have these great riffs that make you feel like you're sailing with vikings. They are on the simple side, but it works for this band. Unfortunately that's as much as I can say for the riffage because there isn't much going on besides that.\n\nOne of the major faults of \"Fate of Norns\" is the lack of solo work. There are no solos on this entire album. I know this was in 2004 where solos in mainstream metal weren't top priority. It does hurt this record quite a bit though. There are sections where a solo could really have been utilized. Instead, Amon Amarth slows the song down and then fires back with the chorus two more times. It happens to most of the songs that are a bit on the catchy side. I don't entirely mind because the choruses are so good, but songs like \"Valkyries Ride\" and \"Where Death Seems to Dwell\" would have been amplified ten fold with a proper solo section. \n\nI know these guys are capable of it. Once again the performances are reliable. Amon Amarth is extremely consistent with quality playing. It's a bit on the over produced side, but there is technicality there, especially from Fredrik Andersson on drums. For the first time, Johan Hegg's voice sounds a little tired. On the past four releases he has been my favorite part of the band. However, on this album it sounds like he is really struggling. His long growls sound extremely hoarse, even for him. \n\nOverall, I'm surprised that Amon Amarth came back the way they did. These guys made five albums in six years. It's not going to be easy to create fresh ideas. \"Fate of Norns\" is not going to compare to the first two albums, but it is a step in the right direction. They return with great story telling and those signature viking riffs that made Amon Amarth popular. Sure, it could have used some solos, but I feel like the good outweighs the bad here. It's their best album in a while and I don't feel guilty for going back to revisit it from time to time. \n\nRecs: \"An Ancient Sign of Coming Storm\", \"Where Death Seems to Dwell\", \"Fate of Norns\", \"The Pursuit of Vikings\", and \"Arson\"\n",
        "\nAmon Amarth put out three solid albums. The first two were filled with fantastic stories and memorable melodies. Their third record, \"The Crusher\", had the band experimenting with a more straight forward approach, but didn't tarnish what made the band great to begin with. Unfortunately, \"Verses the World\" doesn't push any boundaries whatsoever. Amon Amarth went from being masters at writing lyrics and interesting riffs to this overly mediocre viking metal band. \"Verses the World\" is an amalgamation of songs that could be written by anyone. There are some interesting leads here and there, but they are extremely few and far between. Most songs have a similar structure and that leads to straight up boredom. For the first time I am bored with an Amon Amarth record. It's a shame because this was my first Amon Amarth album I listened to growing up and I used to love it. Maybe hearing their first three albums had me expecting more when I revisited this.\n\nThe album opens with \"Death in Fire\". It's arguably Amon Amarth's most popular song and it is definitely a banger. You get these thunderous bass drums, a solid bass line and that typical Amon Amarth melody. Johan Hegg is once again giving his all. It's one of the few things about this band that is consistent. After \"Death in Fire\" though, you get [insert viking song here]. No songs really stand out from one another as the solos, lead work and any inclination of deviation is non-existent. There are far more choruses on these songs than in previous albums. When the band does have a good story to tell, \"Where Silent Gods Stand Guard\",it is approached with an extremely slow tempo. I'm unsure if it's the lyrics that make the song uninteresting or if the album just drags in certain spots. I could think of most of the stories Amon Amarth has written on past endeavors, but drawing a complete blank, save one song, right after listening to this album.\n\nThere is maybe one time where I kind of perked up and that is on the song, \"Across the Rainbow Bridge\". It's one of the few examples of decent writing on this record. It's about an older man who feels like he has been denied a true warriors death. He goes into detail about his past actions, almost like he's telling the gods why he should be granted a death. He puts on his battle clothes and sets off into the winter snow. His vision gets blurred and he knows it's his final ride. He wants to meet his family at the golden hall. That is some cool ass writing that I definitely needed more of here. It has the copy/paste instrumentals the rest of the songs have, but it stands out due to their ability to write great songs. \n\nIt's not even that this album is bad that it is just average. By now you know what Amon Amarth is all about and they do not bring anything new to the table. Every member of this band plays extremely well. At the same time, Amon Amarth has two guitarists and they don't do a thing with it. They have proved to be fantastic writers and their melodies were always top notch. \"Verses the World\" feels like it was made for an \"Intro to Death Metal\" class at the local community college. Maybe it's why I enjoyed it so much as a teenager. It's definitely not terrible, but besides \"Death in Fire\" I struggle to find anything worthwhile. \n\nRecs: \"Death in Fire\", \"For the Stabwounds in Our Backs\", \"Vs the World\", \"Across the Rainbow Bridge\" and \"...And Soon the World Will Cease to Be\".\n",
        "\nAmon Amarth's third release, \"The Crusher\" is probably the most straight forward album they released so far. Past releases had the band writing these long and beautiful stories that could paint a very detailed picture of battle and honor. Their melodeath style was perfect for the time. They could make a man drowning into a five minute song and have it be extremely interesting. Unfortunately, there aren't too many thought provoking songs on this release. Every song is mainly about bashing Christianity or making it seem that Christianity is the evil religion. On paper, it would be a tremendous path for Amon Amarth to take. Unfortunately, the album doesn't really have the complex lyrics past releases had. So, some songs come across as a bit too edgy.\n\nThese guys can write one hell of an album. Their detailed look at men from thousands of years ago intrigued me to no end. The thought of Amon Amarth writing an album based on the religion of these guys would have me hooked. It's a shame that the lyrics took a huge down turn here. For example, the song \"As Long as the Raven Flies\" is the most useless on this album. It's four minutes of two different verses being repeated. Lyrically, it seems like the shortest song Amon Amarth has written. On the other hand, \"The Sound of Eight Hooves\" is more what I wanted out of an album like this. A detailed story of a preacher running for his life in the woods. Eventually, the people chasing him catch up and he hangs from a tree. As he's dying he sees a light and realizes that it's not his God coming down to save him. It's a perfectly written song and made me crave more. The lyrics on the rest of the album aren't horrible, but none of them are as inspired as \"The Sound of Eight Hooves\". \n\nThere are some interesting ideas like \"The Fall Through Ginnungagap\" and \"Annihilation of Hammerfest\". \"The Fall Through Ginnungagap\" seems that a soldier that was once dead is being resurrected to fight once again. \"Annihilation of \"Hammerfest\" is about the temple where Mjolner is kept is under siege by \"unbearded men\". These types of songs are fun, but ultimately don't provide anything you haven't heard from these guys before.\n\nIt sucks because the music is performed very well here. Johan Hegg sounds as good as ever and still has that strong melodeath voice. He really gives it his all every release. The guitars provide some outstanding riffs. \"Bastards of a Lying Breed\" has that distinct Amon Amarth sound. Their melodies are perfect and the drums are thunderous. Musically, everything is still top notch. The only thing I would change is the addition of more or longer solos. The riffing is still great here, but if the band added some more sections showing off Olavi Mikkonen and Johan S\u00f6derberg then the more simple approach of the lyrics could have been forgiven a bit. \n\nAll in all, \"The Crusher\" is a good album. It provides some fantastic melodies while simultaneously offering that Johan Hegg melodeath vocal style. The stories from: \"The Sound of Eight Hooves\", \"Annihilation of Hammerfest\" and \"The Fall Through Ginnungagap\" are what classic Amon Amarth lovers will probably gravitate to. The filler from songs like \"As Long as the Raven Flies\" just prolongs this record and does nothing to make it stand out from its predecessors. Most of the songs seem to be bashing Christianity, but offering little insight on their own religion. It's a great concept for an album by Amon Amarth. It just wasn't executed the way I thought it would have.\n\nRecs: \"The Sound of Eight Hooves\", \"Bastards of a Lying Breed\", \"A Fury Divine\", and \"Annihilation of Hammerfest\"\n",
        "\nA year after \"Once Sent from the Golden Hall\" comes \"The Avenger\". It seems Amon Amarth had a boat load of ideas before their first album. This and 'Once Sent' could have been combined into one album and no one would bat an eye. \"The Avenger\" has extremely powerful lyrics and backs them all up by intense instrumentals that make you feel like you're in the song. Amon Amarth can paint one hell of a picture. \n\nThe best part about early Amon Amarth is their ability to write these interesting songs. The songs themselves can be pretty long, but the story will have you sitting there in anticipation. The title track, \"The Avenger\" is seven minutes long and about revenge. It tells of a man who creates a sword and inserts a magical rune for it to glow blue. A year later, he finds the person he is tracking to kill and decapitates him. The sword loses its glow and the rune. He then turns the sword around and stabs himself in the stomach. It's a kick ass song that shows the impeccable song writing skills of this band. Another great example is \"North Sea Storm\". It paints a grisly picture of a man drowning in the ocean due to his harness being too heavy. He describes what he sees as he drowns and explains how his brothers are fighting. It's these kinds of details that not only engages you with the music, but has you sitting down reading the lyric sheet as well. It's brilliant. \n\nThe first album had Amon Amarth telling these long stories and had lyrics rarely repeat themselves. Amon Amarth took a bit more of a musical approach here and added some choruses to certain songs. Not all songs have choruses, but I like this decision by the band. We know Amon Amarth can write a great story, but having some sections to go back to and head bang is always an added plus. Hearing,\n\n\"War to us is holy\nWe sacrifice our blood\nWar to us is holy\nWe bleed for ancient Gods\"\n\nmakes the song stand out and get stuck in my head. As much as I love the title track, I won't be going back to it regularly or if I'm not in the mood to pay attention. Those are both my favorite songs on this record, but the addition to choruses on certain tunes was very much needed. \n\nThe instrumentals are about the same as their debut album, except the bass is a little more present. Everything is still very much raw and under produced. It adds to the gruesome lyrics and gives the album a very dark tone. Johan Hegg's vocals are either disgustingly high, where you feel like he's really straining himself, or very low and in tune to where modern day Amon Amarth is. He performs both styles of vocals well. The lead guitars still make this band pop and has some of the most gorgeous riffs I have ever heard in a band. The album starts out with \"Bleed for Ancient Gods\" and the leads are insane. It's easily a 10/10 song because of that. Amon Amarth are also not afraid to speed things up. \"God, His Son, and Holy Whore\" shows off the band's intensity and goes into the equally quick, \"Metalwrath\". There is a little bit of a Manowar tone to the song lyrically where they talk about false metal, but talking about actual metal instead of the genre. \n\nThere aren't too many negatives to this album. I gave the same score to \"Once Sent from the Golden Hall\", but I think that's a better overall album. As much as I praised the lyrics above, \"North Sea Storm\" is otherwise a pretty weak song musically. I was also a bit disappointed with the last track as it doesn't add anything to the album. They can't all be perfect and even though there are two weak tracks, you have five others that will put you in the mood for pillaging. \n\nOverall, it's another home run for Amon Amarth. For the band to create a fantastic debut album and then follow it up with \"The Avenger\" is very impressive. The song writing is absolutely incredible. Amon Amarth can paint a picture in your head with their detail and then make a great death metal song out of it. This album is both gorgeous and raw sounding. I look forward to listening to more of their catalogue.\n\nRecs: \"Bleed for Ancient Gods\", \"The Avenger\", \"The Last with Pagan Blood\", \"God, His Son, and Holy Whore\", and \"Metalwrath\"\n",
        "\n\"Once Sent from the Golden Hall\" is the first album from Amon Amarth and easily one of their best. I was never a huge fan of this band, but that was before I listened to this album. The writing on this debut release is stunning and the riffs are beautiful. This is a very raw Amon Amarth and it actually makes you feel like you're in battle with the band. This is pure 90s melodeath and I love almost every minute of it. \n\nWhat makes Amon Amarth stand out from other bands is definitely the subject matter. This album is filled with tales about war and family. It goes into detail about the emotions of vikings and their mentality besides lyrics that just focus on pure blood and guts. Although, there are many lyrics going over the specifics of war, my favorite parts are when you get to analyze the person doing the killing. For example, the first track, \"Ride for Vengeance\" is about a man who just lost his son and is riding into battle for revenge. The writing is so damn good that it makes you want to ride with that guy to kill the ones who murdered his son. The drums pick up and the bass imitates riding a horse through the woods at an incredible speed. That pretty much sums up the entire album because the lyrics and instruments are in perfect sync with one another. Say what you will about Amon Amarth, but they can make the listener feel emotions about people that haven't existed for over a thousand years. Another well written track is \"The Dragons' Flight Across the Waves\". It's about a man who must say goodbye to his family before he leaves for battle. The lyrics don't portray these guys as blind killing machines. A section I enjoyed is, \n\n\"He returns to his bed\nkissing his sleeping wife goodbye,\nand as he leaves his youngest son\na tear rolls from his eye.\"\n\nIt's important because it shows humanity from these people. Amon Amarth had an opportunity to come across as complete savages. Instead, these vikings are classy and focus a lot on emotions. Each track is a story within itself. The lyrics rarely repeat themselves and even the long songs don't feel as they are close to eight minutes. It feels like a story I am eager to know the ending to. It is masterfully done.\n\nThe guitar work on this record is really good. There are songs like \"Without Fear\" and \"Amon Amarth\" that are down right gorgeous. The solos are okay, but I feel like the rhythm guitar is where it's at. It's constantly building atmosphere and most songs sound completely different than the track before it. That is something Amon Amarth has almost always excelled in, even to this day. Since the production is so raw on this release, I feel like the feelings are amplified ten fold. When a beautiful section comes into play, it means so much more than it would if this had pristine production. The vocals are another thing I loved. Johan Hegg sounds fantastic and he has that distinct 90s melodeath vocal style. Compare that to any other vocalist at the time and he fits right in. As Amon Amarth's career went on he becomes far too polished. Here though? Well, I am convinced he's a fucking viking ready to face off in front of Mount Doom.\n\nThis album does have a few down sides. On \"Friends of the Suncross\" there are a couple times where the drums have very odd timing. You'll be grooving with the song and the drums kind of do their own thing and it takes you out of it. Also, the bass takes a huge back seat to the rest of the music. I understand that there are already two guitarists here, but I think the songs could have used that added bass. There aren't too many negatives, but this album can't be perfect. \n\nOverall, this is a fantastic 90s melodeath release. It has almost everything you want out of a band that is regarded as \"viking metal\". The lyrics give a lot of respect to these men without coming across as too edgy. The music fits right with the lyrics like a puzzle piece. Each section goes hand in hand with the lyrics and it's done super well. The guitar work and vocals are all top notch. You actually believe these guys are vikings. That sense in Amon Amarth has been lost over time, but this release is something special. \n\nRecs: \"Amon Amarth\", \"Abandoned\", \"Victorious March\", \"The Dragons' Flight Across the Waves\", and \"Ride for Vengeance\"\n",
        "\nGetting into metal in the 2000s, you were bound to stumble upon Amon Amarth, and probably like them unless you were particularly offended by melodic death metal or the viking theme.\n\nLong gone are the nods to old school (actual) death metal that the bands debut had while maintaining their original viking twist on the sound. Long gone is the inspiration, long gone is the intensity, long gone are the riffs that take more than 1 minute to write. The same could probably be said about their last few releases (or the last 20 years, hah), but for some reason this one was particularly offensive to me when I stumbled upon it.\n\nMany riffs follow the same exact concept - mildly catchy simple single note hooks repeated constantly. Simplicity in itself isn't always bad or even a point of criticism but there is something offensive about this sort of simplicity. You know this was just mass produced pop metal due to contractual obligations, there is zero sincerity here, as further showcased by the absurdly generic lyrics (VIKANGS SHIELD WALL!!!! THOR RAISE YOUR HAMMER). Amon Amarth was never technical or complex but this sort of formula started really showing itself since I heard Guardians of Asgard from the 2008 release - it's such a simple fucking riff that it just feels really fucking arrogant to release that. Again, simplicity in itself isn't what makes it shit, but everything about it from the inception to the execution. \n\nSongs keep repeating themselves, Crack the Sky has the same short little melody constantly repeating, literally throughout both verse and chorus. There seem to be much less tremelo riffs than in older releases of Amon Amarth. Not sure if this is entirely due to lazyness or just a change of sound, as simple melodic tremelo riffs aren't exactly time consuming to write. Besides the short cute melody riffs there are generic chugging riffs that make you sigh and cringe, and the drums beat at a war-like pace which does fit the album I suppose. \n\nThe lyrics are particularly uninspired. It couldn't have taken more than a couple hours to write the entire thing lyrically, and it could have been written by someone who watched 3 episodes of Vikings as their only exposure to viking history ever. \n\nIt's been obvious for a long time the band was never going to repeat their debut (which in itself isn't a masterpiece but is quite competent at what it set out to do), but this album is a particular testament to laziness.\n",
        "\nAlthough death metal is usually not a particularly popular genre among those who begin to approach metal, there is a solution to this. And it's called melodic death metal. Much less heavy than the subgenre itself, it can serve as a swing to switch from lighter metal to extreme metal. If done well, it combines the aggressiveness of death metal with the emotionality of power metal and is energetic and exciting. If done wrong, that is, too soft, it becomes pathetic and boring.\n\nFortunately, Amon Amarth manage to do their job well, and it is no coincidence that they are one of the first, most influential and most popular melodeath groups around. But even before being famous, they produced good music, as can be seen from their first album, Once sent from the golden hall, dating back to 1998.\n\nAs it can be understood by the title, one of the themes the band loves and exploits the most are Vikings, and this is also reflected in the music itself. There is not a moment of peace: songs are generally aggressive and fast, and quickly alternate heavy and melodic parts (the latter in particular are very evocative), unified by almost perfect growls. However, there are a few moments where the change in time and melody are akward and inconsistent (for instance, Abandoned), and sometimes the guitars and drums are not perfectly synchronized. Luckily, the majestic and expressive parts are much more. Also, Johan Hegg's roar is almost always perfectly fierce, but his attempts to use a slightly cleaner voice don't get the same good result. Some songs hold a bit of melancholy or darkness as well, such as Without fear or Once sent from the golden hall, while others (Victorious march is the best example) are somehow catchy. The most important thing is that, most of the time, listening to this album really feels like being on a ship in the middle of a storm, looking for lands to conquer. The battle noises that appear in the middle of Amon Amarth really show this, as they are really suggestive. \n\nThis record is slightly heavier than the others of Amon Amarth and has more flaws, but it is still more than pleasant listening to listen to and a milestone of its genre. Consequently, it must be heard at least once in a lifetime.\n\nBest tracks: Amon Amarth, Friends of the suncross, Without fear\n",
        "\nWell, they\u2019ve done it again. I\u2019ve had a rocky past with this band. \u201cThe pursuit of Vikings\u201d was one of the first songs I learned on guitar and then two albums later released Twilight of The Thunder God which was absolutely killer! Surtur Rising was a big step down, and Deceiver of the Gods was hot trash. Jomsviking was a quite a bit better and with Berserker now out, they\u2019re on a slight upswing. It stands nowhere near their best albums but I feel a little better about their prospects. Here\u2019s hoping they can keep the momentum going again!\n\nThe first thing that stood out to me was that the song writing is getting better again. Not compared to their mid-00\u2019s run, but compared to recent releases. It really feels like the next natural album from their previous release, so if you didn\u2019t like that, you probably won\u2019t like this. The riffs are almost as catchy as what made them popular like on the opening track, \u201cRaven\u2019s Flight\u201d, and \u201cIronside\u201d, which are some of my favorite tracks. Coincidence? They know what they do best is to write slamming, infectious, melodic, fist-pumping, riding-a-steed-into-battle-axe-in-hand metal. The problem with this album, and the two prior, is that there are plenty of lulls that are boring to get through. There\u2019s a complacency felt on all releases after Twilight of the Thunder Gods. They need their fire back. It feel like they\u2019ve \u201cmade it\u201d and are resting on the laurels. There are new elements here, like the clean vocals on \u201cIronside\u201d, but overall is mostly more of the same. It\u2019s a long album and that does them no favors with how generic some of the songs are.\n\nAs mentioned, there are some clean vocals here, which is fine because it fits the mood and tone of the whole. Other than that, it\u2019s more of the same in the vocal department. There\u2019s a little more ferocity I feel than their last release. The guitars chug and harmonize well, as usual. I don\u2019t enjoy the tone as much because it\u2019s so clear and crisp that it seems too sterile for another album about dirty Norsemen. It would do well to be a little rougher around the edges. The drums are standard heavy metal drumming. Let\u2019s be real, no one really listens to Amon Amarth for the drums... They listen for the rage, which is tamed.\n\nFavorite Tracks:\n--Raven\u2019s Flight\n--Ironside\n--Valkyria\n\nTechnical skill: 46% Originality: 48% Song writing: 67% Accessibility: 83% Production: 50%\n",
        "\nI desperately wanted to like this more than the majority of critics. After all, I hate any insinuation that a band is 'stagnating' when simply doing what they're best at. However, even I, the constant optimist, had to admit that there was more than a hint of stagnation about Berserker, the newest full-length from Viking veterans Amon Amarth. Up until 2016, the Swedish legends flew the flag for mythological melodeath done the way only a Swedish band know how. But previous effort Jomsviking left a sour taste in many mouths (not mine!) and the direction the pessimists predicted has unfortunately been followed. Berserker is not a bad album but it betrays AA's inherent genericism.\n\nDreadful artwork notwithstanding, the signs were positive when the quintet released their first single \"Raven's Flight\" - certainly one of the highlights on the album. But then came \"Crack The Sky\", a moderately bouncy plodder with a lazy chorus and boring structure. Even its place on the album makes it drag the energy of the LP down at a crucial point. \"Fafner's Gold\" was a great choice of opener; explosive, catchy and riff-centric with a strong performance from Johan Hegg. But, yeah, \"Crack The Sky\" is the first sign of the generic and dull direction this record takes at some points. Maybe develop the chorus? Change key? Different lyrics? No? Okay...\n\nI don't want this to be one long moan about the dangerous direction of a much-loved artist. Therefore, I will say that the middle chunk of Berserker is well worth your time. \"Valkyria\" is surprisingly moving; \"Raven's Flight\" has one of the best 'UGH's in metal (1:50); \"Ironside\" is anthemic (and even includes some clean vocals from Hegg!); \"The Berserker At Stamford Bridge\" is super interesting with its restraint which only unleashes hell at particular points. But \"Shield Wall\" blows all other tracks on the album out of the water with its fist-pumping batch of riffs, rousing mid-section, and a chorus that can flatten armies. What a banger.\n\nUnfortunately, the rest ranges from 'decent' to full-on 'forgettable'. There were minor hints of this meandering direction on Jomsviking, but tracks like \"When Once Again We Can Set Our Sails\" and especially \"Mjolner, Hammer Of Thor\" are almost totally skippable due to their ability to bore through your brain and simply fly out again. Sure, \"Skoll & Hati\" picks up the energy, but it's too little too late for that stage on the album. Perhaps with some fat-trimming and a more brash production quality, this might have reached the excitement of Twilight Of The Thunder God or similar. Unfortunately, for now, we make do with an album made up of half gems and half nod-along background music. At least Johan's voice is still the manliest thing on the planet.\n\n\"Vikings, raise the shield wall!\nHold the frontline!\nFight 'til death!\n",
        "\nFor the better part of 30 years, Amon Amarth has not only been a pinnacle of consistency within the broader Swedish melodic death metal scene, but also a veritable band of modern bards that have laid forth a musical retelling of Scandinavian lore and history almost as comprehensive as the Poetic Eddas themselves. Nevertheless, with each new studio offering they somehow manage to tackle new lyrical territory despite now being eleven LPs deep into their career, all the while still maintaining a steadfast loyalty to their adopted stylistic niche that sees their sound evolving in very gradual steps. But for those core fans that have followed their career since the primordial days of Once Sent From The Golden Hall to the present, there has been a progression of ideas that finds them in a fairly new territory, all the while causing all to wonder how they were at it for so long and never got around to tackling one of the most well-known phenomena in Viking Age battle tactics.\n\nDespite putting out studio material regularly since the mid-1990s, only now at the twilight of the current decade has the iconic historical character know as Berserker found itself gracing the cover of Sweden\u2019s premier disseminator of all things Nordic. Along for the ride is a collection of highly memorable anthems to the exploits of the mighty Norsemen and the deeds of their pantheon\u2019s principle characters that is well polished and prime for the arena, be it that of the concert hall or of a gladiator\u2019s ring. To the uninitiated, the latter days of this band\u2019s career has seen them settle into more of a stylized, less chaotic variant of melodeath perhaps best comparable to the power thrashing character of recent Arch Enemy outings, though minus the wild technical guitar displays and with a vocalist in Johan Hegg who\u2019s deep guttural barks are more reminiscent of the old school death metal vocal persona best exemplified in Chris Barnes and a number of early Swedish vocalists including fellow Viking obsessed traditional death metal pioneers Unleashed.\n\nThe name of this maddened warrior charging the enemy lines 10 paces ahead of his comrade\u2019s game is memorable yet nuanced songwriting, and while the approach proves to be fairly formulaic and definitely in line with the band\u2019s sound since the release of With Oden By Our Side, there are a few noteworthy surprises that find little precedent in Amon Amarth\u2019s career. Though not known for employing acoustic guitars and overtly folksy themes in their writing, the opening song \u201cFafner\u2019s Gold\u201d starts off like a Viking metal reinterpretation of Metallica\u2019s \u201cBlackened\u201d intro, which differs from said classic song in that the introductory material is reprised in the lead guitar during the chorus and the song\u2019s thrashing character has more of a deep, down-tuned demeanor. Starting off on a similarly subdued note with a folksy clean guitar intro, the chaotic crusher \u201cIronside\u201d follows a likewise straightforward structure, then out of nowhere exclusively harsh shouter Johan Hegg decides to trot out a clean sung passage in a dense, husky bass register that could almost pass for Peter Steele.\n\nThroughout this grand epic excursion a number of other fairly surprising peripheral devices rear their heads, such as a piano and orchestrated prelude to the more coasting and slow-paced epic closing song \u201cInto The Dark\u201d and the almost melodic power metal-like character of the guitar work and driving feel of \u201cMjolner, Hammer Of Thor\u201d, but overall this album seals the deal with a series of predictable bangers that reminisce on the glorious character of their turn of the decade albums Twilight Of The Thunder God and Surtur Rising. This is perhaps best exemplified in the rich guitar harmonies and generally simple riff assault of mid-paced songs like \u201cWhen Once Again We Can Set Our Sails\u201d and the driving up tempo cruiser \u201cRaven\u2019s Flight\u201d, though the high octane thrashing of \u201cSkoll And Hati\u201d proves to be no slouch in the nostalgia department and will likely take any fan of this band\u2019s previous efforts back to the glory of \u201cTwilight Of The Thunder God\u201d, which many view as the greatest musical accomplishment of their current stylistic incarnation.\n\nIn the grand scheme of this outfit\u2019s career, Amon Amarth has had few lulls to speak of, but this is among the stronger albums they\u2019ve put out since the mid-2000s. Bare minimum, it stands toe to toe with the widely lauded Twilight Of The Thunder God and Surtur Rising, the latter of which still remains the author of this review\u2019s personal favorite of the lot by an axe\u2019s tip. It\u2019s difficult to say definitively where the apex of this album rests, as the whole thing listens like a straight succession of glorious battles along the lines of the most recent Game Of Thrones episodes. With a moderate amount of surprises that open their formula to further possibilities down the line, it\u2019s pretty safe to say that unlike the lyrical topics that they cover, Amon Amarth is not relegated to the past. The dragon boats may no longer be terrorizing the coasts of Europe and Ragnarok may well have come and gone, but these stalwart storytellers are sure to find plenty more ways to retell the same grand tales.\n\nOriginally written for Sonic Perspectives (www.sonicperspectives.com)\n",
        "\nThere is something to be said for artists that stick to their guns and release consistently good albums, for whom the pursuit of genre defying masterworks takes a backseat to fist pumping anthems and tried and true songwriting. With their last several releases, Amon Amarth have settled comfortably into this niche, pushing out solid yet inoffensive material at a steady pace to a grateful and passionate fanbase. Despite some moments of glory, the Swede\u2019s penultimate release \u201cJomsviking\u201d began to reveal the cracks in this formula. With \u201cBerserker,\u201d Amon Amarth finally tips the scales from reliability to complacency.\n\nFrom beginning to end, \u201cBerserker\u201d blearily chugs along on momentum alone as the band deems it fit to copy past successes and spin their wheels. Cannibalized Iron Maiden leads tirelessly ring out over listless tremolo riffing only to be syncopated by predictably \u201cheavy\u201d palm muted chugs and breakdowns. Occasional acoustic guitars, piano keys, and spoken word sections serve as filler to tracks already stretched painfully thin through ceaseless verse-chorus patterns. Moments of brilliance are few and far between and are often marred by hamstringing frustrations. \u201cShield Wall\u201d wastes the potential of its menacing climax by rolling into another recycled verse. The brief drum interlude of \u201cRaven\u2019s Flight\u201d sounds painfully synthetic. \u201cIronside\u201d starts with promise but then ruins it with a jarringly awkward chorus. Amon Amarth is great at fashioning epic album closers, but \u201cInto the Dark\u201d comes off as an uninspired re-tread of \u201cDoom Over Dead Man.\u201d The record\u2019s few strengths, such as a smattering of headbanging riffs and the one of a kind vocals of Johan Hegg do little to counter this fatal realization, there is nothing on \u201cBerserker\u201d that Amon Amarth hasn\u2019t done (and done better) before.\n\nProduction wise things aren\u2019t much better, most of the album functioning as a vocal-centric and compressed wall of sound. Rhythm guitars sound dull and lethargic, the leads paper thin and out of place. As is depressingly common in metal, the bass rarely steps out from behind the guitars. \u201cBerserker\u201d marks the band\u2019s first full length recording with drummer Jocke Wallgren. His contributions are serviceable but do little to stand out from the herd and fail to leave the shadow cast by ex-member Fredrik Andersson. \n\nIn a market dominated by major labels and contractual obligations, it\u2019s all too easy for bands to simply churn out another bunch of songs and then get back to touring. With their eleventh record, Amon Amarth falls victim to this cycle, recycling their own back catalog to the point that their longest record to date slides by in a blur. But all the same, the machine churns on. Shows need booking. Horns need filling. Shirts need selling. For Amon Amarth, \u201cBerserker\u201d is just another day on the job. \n\n[Review was originally written for my personal blog at \"Heathenhearted.net\"]\n",
        "\nBasically I follow the approach of reviewing albums that I personally like a lot. This time I make an exception because I don't want Amon Amarth to get away with this album.\n\nIn order to be able to categorize my review better, I am an Amon Amarth fan of the first hour. I remember exactly how I ordered the MCD \"Sorrow Throughout the Nine Worlds\" as a teenager from a small mailorder and was enthusiastic about the sound. I still remember well that the MCD was compared to Dissection at that time, simply because there was hardly any other band which had a similar sound that could help as reference. Since then a lot of very good albums followed without exception, each album has its own charm. I still love the epic side of \"Once Sent from the Golden Hall\" or the unrestrained rage of \"The Crusher\", but I also love newer albums like \"Surtur Rising\" or \"Deceiver of the Gods\".\n\nThe first album with which I had my difficulties was \"Jomsviking\". It wasn't a bad album, there were really great songs with \"First Kill\", \"On a Sea of Blood\" or \"Back on Northern Shores\", but I couldn't resist the impression that the album was extremely \"calculated\". One reason for this is of course the fact that it is a concept album. Still I found that the authenticity of earlier albums had given way to a certain comic touch. It felt more like being a soundtrack for certain Viking series, games or comics than an album that feels seriously related to Nordic mythology and Viking legends.\n\nAnd exactly this impression has been further intensified with \"Berserker\". It starts with the cover, which I personally find very generic and cheesy. Here again the comic or video game atmosphere comes to prominence. The music unfortunately follows the very generic cover. I could hardly find riffs and arrangements that would have touched me personally and that was exactly one of the main points Amon Amarth always made for me. If I had to highlight songs, \"When Once Again We Can Set Our Sails\" & \"Into the Dark\" could convince me with good ideas. But most of the songs sound extremely calculated, catchy and \"mass suitable\". And if you really take the music seriously, then you can definitely feel it. To keep it short, the conviction, passion, fury & aggression of former days is missing for me.\n\nThe quality of the production is of course high-class, but I still don't like the chosen overall sound. For my personal taste the \"bite\" is missing which these kind of riffs need in my opinion to fully unfold their potential.\n\nI am curious in which direction Amon Amarth will develop with their next album. I definitely haven't written them off yet. Until then, however, I prefer the comprehensive back catalogue. Unfortunately, no song of this album has made it on my all-time Amon Amarth playlist, too bad...\n",
        "\nThe Swede Vikings are back full-blast. Relentless as ever in their music, or even more ruthless than their more recent albums, they tell the tales of the Ancients and the Timeless ones, with lessons from the rich Viking history. On their eleventh release, the band have finally decided to address head-on the long-present criticism regarding their lack of variation and the sameness of their productions. \"We've done something quite different as AMON AMARTH, even though very familiar for the fans,\u201d Johan Hegg, the much commended vocalist of the band, pointed this out in an interview with Blabbermouth. \u201cBut it's still gonna sound AMON AMARTH, of course, but there's a lot of new elements and new stuff in the recording. So I think people are gonna be pleasantly surprised about the album.\"\n\nThe dominant mood of this album, similar to their previous efforts, is ferocious and forceful. Most of the songs are centered around crushing riffs, founded on permeating drumming and extended by vigorous melodies. The prime examples of the said song structure can be Raven's Flight and Crack the Sky: the riffs are headbanger-friendly, the melodies are dynamic and the drums not only lay the foundation of the what we hear, but also fill the gaps between guitar notes; and as a result, there is not a moment throughout the album to think to yourself that there could have been something more to showcase that the band didn\u2019t. \n\nIn order to shatter the figurative bars they were caged behind, the band decided to infuse instances of innovation here and there from other regions of metal, yet working well within the genre they are most known and praised for. The sound of hammer pounding on anvil on Mjolner, Hammer of Thor, or the piano outro on Valkyria are two examples of added sounds. Music-wise, Skoll and Hati is a NWOBHM incarnation and The Berserker at Stamford Bridge is a Viking historical account, less brutal but definitely more narrative and memorable. The epitome of novelty of sound, however, is the opener Fafner's Gold. During the first seconds of its acoustic intro, the melody is introduced. The distant scream of the electric guitar is then tussled, alongside the drum, into the foreground. \n\nThis starter would be my top choice of the album had it not been for its closer: Into the Dark. This gem of a track is on another level altogether. A piano-driven orchestral intro flows into the main riff, heavy and hefty with its mid-paced tempo, and mid-song out comes the blackened death break followed by the melodic solo. The blackened death momentarily resurfaces to be replaced by more melo death. The curtain then falls when the beginning orchestration is mirrored to fade out to silence. What a colossal piece this was! Amon Amarth raised the bar with this song and now I would expect to see one of these on every album. Thanks to its lyrics and theme, which is about inner struggle and fighting our personal demons, unlike all the other songs, and its unique musical composition, Into the Dark stands atop the other ones - the jewel on Berserker\u2019s crown.\n\nBut as we all expect, the string that hold the other eleven beads together is the Viking history and mythos. Subjects vary, albeit narrowly, from the legendary (Bjorn) Ironside, who is a renowned historical figure (son of Ragnar Lodbrok and the first ruler of the Swedish Muns\u00f6 dynasty) to two songs about the famed god Thor (Crack the Sky and Mjolner, Hammer of Thor), to the Vikings\u2019 conquests (Raven's Flight, When Once Again We Can Set Our Sails and Wings of Eagles). The song whose lyrics made an impression was The Berserker at Stamford Bridge; this can be seen as an example of a case where the music serves the lyrics and not the other way around. That is not to say, though, that on the other songs, the lyrics stay out of synchrony with the music; quite contrary, the threads of words are well woven into the fabric of music and the whole piece is well-embroidered. \n\nOverall, this album offers enough freshness to please the variety-seekers and, at the same time, is rooted so deeply and firmly into the band\u2019s tradition that the most unwavering fans would also take climactic joy in what these Swedes offer. A classic Amon Amarth like Shield Wall, which will assuredly be a concert staple, juxtaposes the band\u2019s newer sound representative Fafnir\u2019s Gold, both equally eloquent and electrifying. In short, this album leaves nothing to crave for and nothing to complain about.\n\nRating: \nLyrics: 9.5\nArtwork: 8.5\nMusicianship: 9.5\nVocals: 9.5\nOverall: 9.3\n",
        "\nAs someone who\u2019s always been a a huge fan of this band, and a very defensive one at that, I\u2019m afraid I will have trouble in containing my words describing this absolute mess.\n\nWhen it comes to experimentation and trying out new things \u2013 I welcome it with open arms. Especially in metal, where there\u2019s so much room for experimenting and trying out new things; many bands have made a great legacy by introducing new things to this genre. Alas, not every experiment bears positive outcomes. I would compare this album to St. Anger, the prime example of experimentation of a new sound gone wrong \u2013 perhaps it's not as bad as St. Anger, but it\u2019s somewhere near it in terms of absolute lack of quality. While Amon Amarth has experimented with new sounds many times throughout their discography, it has, in my opinion, been quite successful - from pushing the dark ambience to the max with Fate of Norns, incorporating a more streamlined approach to their songwriting with With Oden on Our Side and Twilight of the Thunder God, to creating an amazing concept album featuring female vocals for the first time on Jomsviking. The latter in particular was a great change for this band, perhaps even their career peak. It\u2019s very disappointing that after such a masterpiece album, which took the took the band a few levels forward, Berserker unfortunately takes the band 10 steps backward, in every field possible.\n\nEven before we get to the music and the lyrics, the disappointment starts immediately with that horrendous album artwork. As someone who is of the opinion that album artworks oftentimes may play an important role to the overall experience of an album, where a great artwork can make a great album legendary, a bad artwork can, in the same way, make a suboptimal album even worse. The picture of the berserker looks very poorly animated, and the very bland choice of colors make me skeptical of even checking this album out. What hurts the most is that Amon Amarth has always had great album artwork, and now this. Just as how the music on St. Anger was horrendous, the absolutely lazy and zero-effort artwork made it worse on a whole other level - and the same can be said for this record. But nevertheless, an album's artwork plays a minor role in the grand scheme of things, so it's not entirely impossible to try your best to set this factor aside - there are tons of great albums with questionable, or downright terrible covers - but doing that won't change anything in the case of Berserker.\n\nThen we start to dive into the actual songs, however we\u2019re still not near the music itself. While not the downright worst part of the album, the lyrics are a huge downgrade and also a giant step backwards. Maybe this is a direct result of having Jomsviking and its great lyrics in mind while reviewing this album - since it\u2019s a tough album to follow up in every way - but Amon Amarth had good lyricism even before Jomsviking. One thing in particular made a bad impression on my overall experience: after what is in my opinion the worst song on the album, and by far their most repetitive song to date, Crack the Sky, where the lyrics Thor! Let your hammer fly! Let your hammer crack the blackened skies!\u201d take up 90% of the song, Amon Amarth decides to dedicate another song to good ol' Thor right after it, called Mjolner, the Hammer of Thor (hands down their laziest song title ever). If it were a concept album about Thor himself, then maybe it would make sense, but putting two songs like this one after another is appallingly lazy. In an interview published a few months before the album\u2019s release, Hegg admits that he \u201cwent pretty lazy on this one\u201d, referring to the whole album - which might explain literally everything. Perhaps he should've named this album Lazy, since this is what you get when you're lazy. If I were to single out one positive thing here, it would probably be the very theme itself, since it's very interesting from a historical standpoint.\n\nFinally, we get to the music of Berserker. It\u2019s incredibly boring, uninspiring, underwhelming and LAZY. This is the result of two things \u2013 firstly, the production, which sounds to me like they muffled the guitar work pretty hard (especially the leads), which would make even a good album sound suboptimal, and secondly, and more importantly, the songwriting and riff work itself. This is by far the biggest disappointment in Amon Amarth\u2019s sound as a band, where the riffs themselves just seem like some rushed, zero-effort, on-the-spot work of a drunken man making the most basic riffs he can just to get some more beer money to continue with his alcoholism as quickly as possible. Almost no variation in sound, no melody (is this even a melodic death metal record?), no beautiful riffs like on all their other albums. And I\u2019m not even talking about their best work here, this album literally lacks three GOOD RIFFS. The only song I somewhat like is Shield Wall, but even this is more of an \u201cok\u201d song instead of an actually good one. Ironically, the best pieces of music are the acoustic guitar intro to Fafner\u2019s Gold and the piano outro to Into the Dark. That says a lot about the quality of the album. There\u2019s not much to say that hasn\u2019t already been said, the rest of the album just creates major headache and utter disappointment. It really lacks life, energy, passion.\n\nIt would be a bit too much to call this the end of Amon Amarth. It\u2019s not the first time a band with an amazing discography releases a bad album, and it\u2019s not the end of their career by any means. Amon Amarth as a band has always tried to evolve, both their sound and themselves as musicians, so let us hope the band bounces back to the level of quality they used to be on in future albums.\n",
        "\nTo start this off, i've been listening to Amon Amarth for almost 14 years now and have yet to be too disappointed with a release. I do feel that a lot of their more recent albums lack some of that power and spirit that made With Oden on our side, Fate of Norns, and Twilight of the Thunder God so special. It just seemed distant, not quite there as if almost in the background. This album thankfully, returns some of that power.\n\nThunderous drums, vicious vocals, guitars so crushing Mjolner would be jealous, and bass just as heavy to compliment, this album doesn't lack in any of the staples that make Amon Amarth them, nor does it disappoint. The mixing is wonderful, the guitar riffing on this album is extremely good ( see the tracks Iron Side, Mjolner Hammer of Thor, Skoll and Hati) and the NWOBHM influence is even more present on this album, carried over from Jomsviking. The dueling guitars and solos are more then welcome and I feel add some decent depth to the sound, plus the addition of the acoustic intro that starts the album off in Fafner's Gold, or the clean guitar intro of Ironside are very great indeed and new for Amon Amarth. The band is trying some new things but it isn't ultimately enough to really change their over all sound, or win over anyone looking for them to change things up and not be the same old Viking themed Melodic Death metal band they have been for 25 years now.\n\nSo the album sounds great and the riffage is amazing, then where does the album fall short? Sadly, that would be in the lyrical department. Johan himself even admitted to taking a more lazy approach to lyrics on the album, writing them after all the instrumental parts had been written and recorded, and it shows a little. While most of the songs feel lyrically sufficient, most lack a little depth, and there are a few duds ( Crack the sky, Shield wall are the biggest ones) that while the instrumental work is amazing, the lyrics are definitely lacking as to them probably being more songs tailored to crowd interaction when playing live. \n\nAll in all, as an old fan I find the album very good for a modern AA release, but no where near as good as With Oden on our Side or Twilight of the Thunder god. A nice surprise and a somewhat return to form from the old timers that is welcome to any fans discography. Hopefully in the future the band returns to the glory days of their sound, like the Norsemen to familiar British shores battle axe in hand and Odin on their side.\n\nHighlights of the album: Fafner's Gold, Wings of Eagles, Ironside, Skoll and Hati, and the Berserker at Stamford Bridge\n",
        "\nI've been a big fan of Amon Amarth ever since I first heard \"Twilight of the Thunder God\" as a young metalhead. I've since acquired all of their albums and I will be seeing them for my third time in just a few short months. Needless to say, when they announced merely a month and a half ago that they would be releasing Berserker, I was very hopeful. I can't say that I've disliked any Amon Amarth album, though I found Jomsviking mildly disappointing and viewed it as an unnecessary deviation from their tried-and-true, heavy yet melodic songwriting formula. The band's first single for this new album was \"Raven's Flight,\" which I think sounds like a song from With Oden on Our Side, and I became so hopeful that I pre-ordered the CD (I rarely blindly buy an album that doesn't have good reviews, let alone one with no reviews yet at all).\n\nThough the second single, \"Crack the Sky,\" seemed completely stupid when I first heard it and my hopes dwindled, I was not disappointed when the album was released and I set out to listen to it as many times as possible. The first thing that stuck out to me was how many unusual elements Amon Amarth had so willingly and so freely incorporated into their music when they had previously been pretty conservative about letting variation into their songs. The album kicks off with some acoustic guitars; I can count on one hand the number of times I've heard the band use such instrumentation on past albums, and they'd never before missed an opportunity to kick off a record with an intense bang. Luckily this doesn't stop \"Fafner's Gold\" from being an instant classic, and I'm confident that it will soon hold a cemented place in the band's live set. \"Valkyria\" features an extended piano outro. \"Into the Dark\" incorporates an ominous, orchestral intro that can only really be compared to \"Doom Over Dead Man\" from Surtur Rising yet would seem much more at home on a My Dying Bride Album.\n\nOh, and in case I forgot to mention it, Johan Hegg sings on this album. I mean he really sings. This is the first time he's ever sung on a real, original song: The cover of \"Aerials\" and the mock-Black Sabbath song \"Satan Rising\" hardly count. It's brief, and it just follows the guitar melody, but on \"Ironside\" Hegg belts a ridiculously deep couple of lines that manage to single-handedly redefine to fans what the band is truly capable of.\n\nDespite these unforeseen elements, several songs on Berserker follow Amon Amarth's patterns and traditions. Though it seems overly simple, cheesy, and completely ridiculous; \"Crack the Sky\" fits the role of the silly anthemic song in the tracklist, similar in many ways to \"The Pursuit of Vikings.\" \"Shield Wall\" is another stupid, bone-headed, generic song that follows in the footsteps of \"The Way of Vikings.\" \"Into the Dark\" is an epic, long, slower closing song similar to those featured on the previous four albums.\n\nOf course, few albums are completely without flaws. I've already mentioned my distaste for pretty much the entirety of \"Shield Wall;\" this song is completely disposable and easily one of the worst songs Amon Amarth have ever released. The rest of the songs manage to be pretty good at worst and excellent at best, and there are twelve songs total, more than any other previous album the band had put out. Other than that abysmal song, my main complaint is the production: Olavi Mikkonen and Johan S\u00f6derberg transitioned to Kemper amplifiers at some point at the beginning of this decade, and had managed to keep them inconspicuous on the two or three albums they were used on; but on Berserker, the guitar tone feels excessively tweaked and artificial in a really obviously digital way that doesn't properly convey the necessary aggression of the riffs. This is also the first studio album to feature drummer Jocke Wallgren, whose performance has blown me away both times I've seen him in a concert setting. But on recording, they've got some crappy sample replacement going on: the tone qualities of the snare and kick drum aren't quite right, having the same effect on the drums that the amp profilers had on the guitars.\n\nWhen it comes to the songs themselves, though, I view this album as a much-needed return to form for Amon Amarth. They started off as a pretty intense melodic death metal that focused on heaviness and death metal riffing just as much as melody. On recent albums, especially Jomsviking, the melodies (especially high-pitched lead lines) overtook the chugging and brutality, and for the most part hogged the spotlight. This is definitely not the case on Berserker, luckily.\n\nOn Deceiver of the Gods, the only mythology-themed lyrics seemed to revolve around Loke and (briefly) Hel, two deities who are anything but obscure. The rest of the lyrics were about vikings. Jomsviking was supposedly a concept album about vikings. Obviously, Amon Amarth were in need of some more in-depth tales, which they offer up on \"Fafner's Gold\" and \"Skoll and Hati.\" There is, of course, plenty of Rick Riordan-esque \"mainstream\" mythology in here as well; Hegg pays homage to Thor and Oden perhaps more than their fair share.\n\nSo, why have I rated Berserker so highly while still recognizing its shortcomings? Because, although I know it's not Amon Amarth's greatest album ever, I accept that it seems to be a course correction that will hopefully keep them going on the right path in the future. Despite the fact that one of the twelve songs totally sucks and the production is stupid and the lyrics are cheesy, I think that what truly makes an Amon Amarth album great at this point is how fun it is. Berserker is a very fun album, even if it won't go down in metal history as an all-time classic or one of the most original works of art or anything like that. It's enjoyable, and that's what really matters.\n\nBest songs: \"Fafner's Gold,\" \"Valkyria,\" \"Raven's Flight,\" \"Ironside,\" \"When Once Again We Can Set Our Sails,\" and \"Skoll and Hati.\"\n",
        "\nAmon Amarth has released yet another album in the line of death-metal-meets-heavy-metal; continuing to elude the less appealing aspects of melodic death metal, but at the same time, slipping into further genericness and lack of enthusiasm. As evidenced by the goofy album cover and title.\n\nOn the surface, the checklist is complete: pulsing drums, melodic but beefy guitar lines, and Hegg's familiar brutal growls belting out lyrics about Odin's familiars and Viking raids. They even carry on the formula I liked so much from Deceiver of the Gods with the Iron Maiden homage in tracks like \"When Once Again We Can Set Our Sails\" and \"Valkyria\".\n\nBut below the surface of seemingly proper styling and passable playing, the passion is lacking, and the emotional grip of their melodic lines has weakened considerably in the span of two albums. \"Mjolner, Hammer of Thor\" has one of the most inoffensive and dainty melodies I've heard from this band, and \"Crack the Sky\" has one of the most pedestrian and mainstream verse riffs this band has ever put to recording. \"Raven's Flight\" and \"Shield Wall\" start out promising enough, but never really give you more than the tease of a great melodic idea.\n\n\"Wings of Eagles\" is the prime example of how most of these songs go. It starts with high energy, with a drum fill and swelling guitars fading in, a fast-enough drum beat drops in but the riff is just ever-so-slightly too far on the side of melody and not of aggression as it seemed to have been foretelling something brutal and you get just a half-hearted riff. The main melody is just too lighthearted and generic. The drums fall away at the midpoint to let the guitar introduce a darker, more dissonant riff with a touch of chromaticism - you think, \"This is going to be a brutal breakdown\" or some cool shift will happen here, but the drums just plop back into the mix, run through the riff a couple times, joined by the vocals, then move back into another generic melodic part, ultimately adding nothing to the song and just making an uninspired, uninteresting song. From that opening moment of promise, there is just minor letdown after minor letdown.\n\nOn top of all this, the band simply seems to ever-so-slightly be relenting on their heaviness, which there's no reason to compromise if you're playing death metal. Two albums back, they were indulging the heavy metal overtones and keeping the heaviness well in tact, but I see cracks in it here.\n\nMost of these tracks are not so distasteful that I wouldn't find myself listening to it at some point, but at the same time, there are only two legitimately good tracks here. The opening track (it's never a good sign when the opening track is arguably the best) and Ironside. Ironside starts out with acoustic, but the melody is top-notch, catch-as-fuck and strong enough to carry the whole song - even through Hegg's questionable clean vocals in the song's midsection. Fafner's Gold, also starts out acoustic but carries the only other truly strong melody on the album, with a good amount of riffing off of the main theme throughout the song to make what is the only tactfully constructed song on the album.\n\nArguably their weakest album, but I kind of saw them going this route with increased popularity and based on the way the last album went. Not bad, definitely not up to par either. The band is clearly delivering more now on expectations by a large fanbase than from their own inspiration. The score is helped considerably by the two standout tracks because I do like them a lot, but without them this could have been a real dud.\n",
        "\nI don't think there should be much left to say about who Amon Amarth are and how successful they have become over the last 15+ years. But just in case you are one of the chosen few who don't know who these Swedish vikings are \u2013 they've been on the forefront of the Scandinavian melodic death metal scene for a long time now, with their music being rooted in traditional death metal, as opposed to the more classic metal-oriented roots of their Gothenburg-counterparts (In Flames, Dark Tranquillity, etc.). With them releasing chart-topping (!) albums in the last few years, Amon Amarth achieved a level of popularity largely unheard of before in the more extreme metal realms. \n\nWhile their core ingredients have remained pretty similar throughout the years \u2013 effective, powerful but still easily decipherable mid-range death metal vocals by the inimitable Johan Hegg, down-tuned tremolo-picked guitar riffs, heavy single-note grooves and prominently melodic leads provided by longtime axe-wielding protagonists Olavi Mikkonen and Johan S\u00f6derberg plus a frequent use of predominantly fast-paced & forceful drumming including lots of double-bass passages \u2013 the way they are integrated into their modern day presentation is not always on par when compared to earlier incantations of the band. Of course, a band like them would very probably not like to do carbon copies of their early masterpieces over and over again but their stylistic choices have not always been the most immaculate in more recent times...\n\nIn my personal view, Amon Amarth have been losing it somewhat since the release of Surtur Rising back in 2011. Up to and including 2008's Twilight of the Thundergod there's been a constant streak of songs now considered classics on every single record with hardly a true filler to be found. Back then, they managed to create various climaxes due to the perfect mix of vivid Viking imagery, a classic death metal riff-set more at home in the realms of Bolt Thrower and similar, crawling, steamrolling rhythm guitar-stylings sans sacrificing basic melody, with a bag of tricks providing the \u201chow-to\u201d in terms of epic musical landscape-building, achieved through variable, yet infectious lead guitar hooks and some of the more impressive heavy drumming displayed in a comparatively \u201caccessible\u201d style of death metal. Putting Johan Hegg atop, a moderately brutal, yet powerful, distinctive and likeable vocalist that almost every metalhead could easily be a fan of or at least get accustomed to, finalized the formula. \n\nSo if you think I'm repeating myself a little, you are definitely not wrong. Said formula has largely remained the same, but the vintage battle axe does the old chopping-off-heads a little less effectively these days; the most glaring issue can be found in the drumming, which might still be okay by modern standards, but is barely comparable to the driving force of earlier days. Part of this can be traced back to the rather slick, restrained production job - courtesy of Jay Ruston, who's also been responsible for creations by Killswitch Engage and Stone Sour (even the Freddy Got Fingered \u2013 soundtrack was handled by him!) - but I'm afraid that Jocke Wallgreen (who's been the band's drummer since 2016) is just not quite the man-machine that Fredik Andersson had proven to be in his almost 20-year stay with the band. Time and subsequent albums may prove me wrong, but so far I'm not impressed. While the man is certainly no amateur, there is a gaudy powerlessness in his delivery that's never been this noticeable in their music, even though Andersson's later performances had become more lackluster as well, at least by the end of his tenure. So go ahead, call me a traditionalist, but I want my \u201cSound of Eight Hooves\u201d back! \n\nOh and Johan, for the love of Odin, please stop singing cleanly! It sucks. Your repeated attempts at striking the right notes kill off every atmospheric buildup and every emotion that might have poured through my speakers. He's already been trying to include clean singing on the previous album Jomsviking with similar results, so Johan and I might have differing opinions...\n\nWhen it comes to describing the guitar and songwriting-meat and potatoes, we might discover another conflict here; you already now that the ingredients have indeed remained stable, but one cannot deny the lack of freshness and creativity in the rhythm guitar department. This is - compared to their classic period \u2013 another slap in the face, but to soften the blow a little, Berserker is still more memorable and a little heavier than the last record(s) from this band, resulting in a few glorious moments whose surpluses are either achieved due to the use of more dominant and often harmonized guitar leads or fruitful efforts to shake things up a little. Not too much \u2013 it's still Amon Amarth after all \u2013 and yet the introduction of (almost alien to them!) acoustic guitars and piano (totally alien!) in a few places does offer some minor creative enhancements. \n\nIt's very difficult to pick individual highlights here, because the presented songs either suffer from too much repetition (\u201cCrack the Sky\u201d), are too short to develop into proper epics (\u201cShield Wall\u201d) or include a bunch of weaker/even off-putting sections preventing a thoroughly enjoyable listen (\u201cThe Berserker at Stamford Bridge\u201d, \u201cIronside\u201d). Ditching the most forgettable ones, which are frankly just AA-by-the-numbers and have many prettier siblings on previous records, there's only two entirely great songs on here that'd find their way on a long-term-playlist of mine: \u201cWhen Once Again We Can Set Our Sails\u201d and \u201cInto the Dark\u201d. The former succeeds in delivering an all-encompassing mid-era Amon Amarth experience in four and a half-minutes while the second one is the only epic worth the name tag due to its efficient use of crescendo/decrescendo dynamics and smooth experimentation. \n\nHonestly, by now I'm pretty certain that we will never get another thunderous opus like \u201cWhere Silent Gods Stand Guard\u201d again, nor do I really expect that they have another sledgehammer in the vein of \u201cMasters of War\u201d in them. But as long as they keep doing what they do, there'll always be something worth salvaging off their albums because despite my moaning about the shortage of top-tier-workmanship on Berserker, this is still not bad overall and probably fun enough to headbang to in a live environment. Just don't wait for consistently great results anymore, because they haven't been able to deliver an entirely satisfying album package since Twilight of the Thundergod. \n\noriginally written for http://antichristmagazine.com\n",
        "\nTo start us off, let me express one thing with all the needed clarity - it all comes down to what expectations you approach Jomsviking with. If you still live the futile hope that the Swedish long-haired Viking horde will come up with something revolutionary in their old days, you will be horribly disappointed with their new offering. However, if you expect to hear the trademark post-2006 Amon Amarth sound, then have fun because Jomsviking offers exactly that, albeit a bit watered down.\n\nThe album is a bit of an up and down ride. For the most parts we have one song that sounds powerful and fierce, only to be succeeded by a more mellow, let's say \"boring\" one. But don't get me wrong - Jomsviking is as solid as it gets by the standards of Amon Amarth. Right from the first tunes of First Kill the band approaches you, punches you in the face and declares: do not forget, this is trademark Amon Amarth, bitch!\n\nThe overall musicianship is, as expected, really good, the compositions tight enough, S\u00f6derberg still produces neat sounding solos and Heggs vocal performance is as good es ever - for most parts, that is. He seemingly tries to modulate his voice a bit here and there, but sometimes not for an overall benefit. See the chorus of Raise Your Horns for example; it's not full-force Hegg there and it sounds...weird. Speaking of that song - well, well, well, look at that. Not only is the lyrical content somewhat different from your standard Amon Amarth song, but listen also to that melodic line: it is folk metal played in a death metal way. Pretty interesting. But it's tracks like this with their pacing and/or lackluster approach only manage to slow the whole album down a bit. The pace then picks up again in a sine-wave manner and it's the same pattern until the end of the album. That inconsistency, leading to a disturbance in the overall listening experience, is what makes me rate this album under 80%\n\nIn conclusion: the guys from Amon Amarth perform as expected; the aged Viking tries to resist the withering of time and so far he manages to cope somewhat well with it, although one can tell that the ferocity of olden times is fading away album after album. The replay value of Jomsviking is not as high as the guys would certainly want it to be.\n",
        "\nAmon Amarth's 9th studio album is one that sees them diving headlong into their most melodic aspects. At this point in their careers the music has become a touch formulaic, but extremely well honed. Rather than being melodic death metal, Amon Amarth is death metal, which happens to be melodic. Hegg's brutal growls leave no wiggle room in defining this as anything but death metal, along with the deep, crushing guitar tone, and double-bass filled drum beats. But what has always been Amon Amarth's strength and signature, is their poignant melodic guitar melodies that are as heroic as they are sorrowful, and leave the band's overall sound as melodic as it is brutal. What the band has done here is add a flavor of classic heavy metal in the spirit of Judas Priest with tremendous results, and refined the blending of vicious and bittersweet to virtual perfection.\n\nThis subtle shift in style is the only thing that can account, in my mind, for the lukewarm response this album seemed to have gotten. It's confusing to me. It's more melodic than Surtur Rising, more consistent than Twilight of the Thunder God, or Jomsviking, and all the same, still more true to the band's sound than With Oden On Our Side. Past there, you might make an argument, but of anything since Fate Of Norns, there's no question in my mind, this is their strongest album. I've been listening to this band for about 15 years, and I might be tempted to even say this is their best album, period. I tend not to review such popular bands, or those with so many reviews, but I just had to offer my diverging opinion here.\n\nIn the less common moment where they focus on brutality ahead of melody, they still do it expertly \u2013 as in Blood Eagle or We Shall Destroy. Blood Eagle is maybe the fastest track, and maybe the most brutal - which after all is about splitting someone open like a baked potato, but still drops in a great, even slightly lighthearted sounding melody in the mid section of the song. We Shall Destroy is a slower pace, where Hegg really gets to draw out the vocal lines and the thunderous tone of his voice can really be appreciated in full.\n\nThe most conspicuous of all the nods to classic heavy metal is in tracks like Father of the Wolf, which is pure Judas Priest. But man, if you ever thought Judas Priest in the style of death metal wouldn't work, lemme tell you, you could not be more wrong. Few songs make me bang my head like this track. It's got this really driving, perhaps even stiff sounding drum beat, but it just works so well. It's secondary riff is a nod to early Dickenson-era Iron Maiden. It's got just a dark enough undercurrent to convey the great lyrics of Loki birthing Fenrir to kill Odin. Coming of the Tide is another track that plays very much like a strong Maiden guitar line, but of course backed with a constant double-bass drum part.\n\nOftentimes, I tend not to elaborate on is how albums emotionally connect with me \u2013 although this is partly because so few do. But something about Amon Amarth has always tugged on my heartstrings. Especially this album. It's just amazing that this band can make you feel such stinging sorrowful emotions, and bang your head till you're nearly concussed, at the very same time. This album in particular just grips me. Albums that really implore me to bang my head wildly, are pretty rare. Albums that legitimately connect with me emotionally, are rarer still. Yet, this album is both at once.\n\nThe riffs are great throughout, the shifting from all-out punishing death metal, to old school heavy metal style riffs never seems to lose the focus - the undertone of the bittersweet yet powerful. The potent lyrics in Hegg's booming, vicious voice just knock you over. Almost every song has something I look forward to, either a brilliant main riff, a great vocal line, a sweet middle section, or much of the time, all three of these things. Many of the songs here are of the caliber that would make them standout tracks on most albums \u2013 the \u201cooh, this is that song that really kicks ass\u201d quality. The classic melodies of some of the earlier tracks, the brutality of the middle tracks, the epicness of the closing track, no need to skip tracks with this album.\n\nI like to have my ducks in a row before I give albums really high scores. Meaning, there's almost a vague checklist of things an album must, and must not do before it can cross the 90 threshold. But there are certain things that can outweigh. Taken by themselves, some of the riffs here are a bit generic, like the verse riff on the title track, or main riffs of Under Siege or Hel. But this is just heavily outweighed by the punishing, powerful nature of this album.\n\nPicking a highlight here is really difficult for me. The whole album is so strong. Father of the Wolf is fantastic, the title track is classic, but I also love the closing track Warriors of the North with it's stirring black metal tinted main melody, epic scope and awesome transitions between black metal, heavy metal and death metal stylings.\n\nThis is a truly classic and revered album for me. I can't wrap my head around the lukewarm reception this album got. Having actually reviewed it and being forced to assign it a score, I can't imagine giving any of their other albums a score this high, so that decides it \u2013 it's their best album!\n",
        "\nAmon Amarth are unquestionably the kings of Viking metal. From the inspiring and vivid lyrics, to the most badass, anthemic choruses out there, they bring the heat with every release they put out. Twilight of the Thunder God is an album with a lot of groove and more focus on melody than some of their previous releases. In spite of this there is no lack of heaviness. There are some absolutely brutal tracks on this album and such a wide range of songs. Some are very fast paced and melodic or others slow and brooding and dark.This album was the best possible next step in their musical journey, everything good about their sound was honed and crafted into this Viking epic. This masterpiece of slaughter and mayhem.\n\nThe playing on the album is insanely tight as always, and the production quality makes this album a masterpiece. The tones on everything are phenomenal. The drums sound massive, the guitars are tight and heavy as hell, and Johan's vocals are even gritter and more brutal than before. I feel that this album also has some of their best songwriting, utilizing some basic song structures but with really well developed riffs and melodies that compliment each other beautifully. And of course no Amon Amarth album would be complete without some absolute bangers. This album is loaded with riffs from front to back that will make you start a mosh pit in a nursing home. This album is your new gym playlist. Your warcry. Your larping soundtrack. Any song that comes on and it makes you wanna rampage on your way to Vahalla. Unbelievably killer release.\n",
        "\nWhen it comes to the vast discography of Amon Amarth, many of the \"trve\" metallers will only claim to like releases preceding Twilight of the Thunder God. However, while the production many be squeaky clean and the sound obviously more melodic than their \"classic\" albums, Deceiver of the Gods is a force to be reckoned with. The album makes up for the excessively catchy riffs with a brutal sound and violent lyrics.\n\nBeginning with the anthemic title track, the album is catchy as hell. Throughout its 48-minute length, the band leads the listener through a journey of variations on their signature songwriting formula. While the album has a definitive worst song (''We Shall Destroy,'' which features laid-back riffs and a White Zombie ripoff in the bridge), the other nine songs are simply stunning. \"Hel\" sees Candlemass singer Messiah Marcolin taking co-lead vocals and a creepy synth melody being used to great effect. \"Under Siege\" has an earwormy melody in the chorus, and has a tragic sense to it. \"Warriors of the North\" is just plain epic, and \"As Loke Falls\" is a live staple as well as an instant classic. \"Blood Eagle\" stands out as the most violent song on the album.\n\nInstrumentally, this album is a great work of art. It is filled with beautiful speed-picked harmonies and melodies by genius guitarists Olavi Mikkonen and Johan Soderberg. The vocals are brutal and powerful, even emotional at times, and the drums are hard-hitting throughout the entire course. There's even a cool bass solo in \"Under Siege,\" showing the overlooked musical ability of bassist Ted Lundstrom. The riffs are vikingish and singable, making the album brilliant and memorable.\n\nDeciever of the Gods is an overlooked and underrated album, and it is one of the best Amon Amarth has put out to date. It has great riffs, melodies, lyrics, and production, giving it the total product of an incredible record.\n",
        "\nWhen it comes to Amon Amarth's large discography of Viking-themed blackened melodic death metal, Jomsviking certainly stands out. Marketed as \"Amon Amarth's first concept album,\" it supposedly contains a story; the story is pretty hard to follow, though, with no set characters and a pretty boring plot. If they hadn't said so themselves, I never would've thought of it as a concept album at all.\n\nJomsviking sees Amon Amarth departing from their classic ball-smashing heaviness for a lighter, more melodic approach on some songs. While a handful (\"First Kill,\" \"On A Sea of Blood,\" \"One Against All\") retain their well-known and well-loved sheer metal approach, the band clearly was trying to break the mainstream with songs like \"At Dawn's First Light,\" \"One Thousand Burning Arrows,\" and \"A Dream That Cannot Be,\" which features metal goddess Doro Pesch singing an awkward duet with the macho growling giant Johan Hegg.\n\nAlthough more mainstream than their past albums, this one certainly has a few songs for their old-school fans: Songs like ''At Dawn's First Light,'' ''On A Sea of Blood,'' and ''Vengeance is My Name'' retain some of the band's original heaviness despite having a more melodic and accessible sound.\n\nThis album is overall decent, but not one of the band's best like Twilight of the Thunder God or With Oden on Our Side. It's worth a listen if you already are familiar with their other albums and understand their true purpose as a metal band.\n",
        "\nSwedish melodeath viking metallers Amon Amarth decided to pay some respect to their early inspirations on Under the Influence. Instead of taking the obvious route and covering a song by each band, the fearsome five instead chose to write a tune in the style of each group. While blessed with a few inspiring and cool moments throughout its 16-minute course, much of it comes off as lazy and unoriginal.\n\n\"Burning Anvil of Steel\" is a tribute to Judas Priest. This song sees Amon Amarth sacrificing their heavy guitar tone for a more \"classic\" sound and riffing style, but when Johan Hegg tries to use his typical growl over this lighter tone it sounds unbalanced and badly made. \"Satan Rising\" is the best song on the record, a tribute to Ozzy-era Black Sabbath. The riffs are heavy and doom-laden just like Iommi's, and Hegg even pulls of a pretty great Osbourne impression. \"Snake Eyes\" sounds like Motorhead right from the get-go, with an obvious \"we play Rock 'N' Roll\" feel to it. Hegg's signature guttural even manages to make itself sound like Kilmister himself. \"Stand Up to Go Down\" is the oddball on this album, with simple AC/DC style riffs and growled lyrics riddled with sexual innuendos.\n\nI bought this album along with Deceiver of the Gods as part of a $22 package at a festival that Amon Amarth was playing at. I don't regret this purchase, although I never would have bought Under the Influence as a standalone album. It's too short and somewhat uninspired in the sense that they seem to draw from only the most obvious stylings of the four bands.\n\nAll in all, this is a decent tribute album that's worth maybe a listen on a streaming service, but isn't really good enough to be bought by itself. The riffs are too basic and generic to be entertaining, and the whole thing ends up coming off as a cash grab.\n",
        "\nFor all the ubiquity of their latter-day output, Amon Amarth arrived on the European metal scene rather rudely, not so much knocking politely on the door of the Golden Hall, but applying a large boot to it (surely Johan Hegg must be at least a size 14) and snapping it off its hinges. That abruptness extends beyond the introduction to the already fully-formed epic style, as well as the greater roughness of this album compared to other bands of their ilk. There is a definite argument for putting early Amon Amarth squarely in with the Gothenburg melodic death metal scene (although they actually hail from Stockholm), since the insistent melodies and frequent likeness to At the Gates' early work aligns them more strongly with that city than their hometown of putrid old school death. Then again, the Norse themes emerged with their first releases, keeping them slightly distant from those bands and putting them more in the camp of Enslaved or Unleashed, both of whom had used Viking imagery and stories along with the more epic bent of the former band.\n\nAs such, this isn't the polished Amon Amarth of Twilight of the Thunder God, nor even the hooky confident invaders that brought Versus the World to our shores. Johan Hegg, for starters, had not developed his deep, clear roar by this point, screaming in a more strained and visceral tone that occasionally sounds like pure death metal, though fits comfortably with the early Gothenburg bands. On 'Victorious March', I'm even reminded of Jonas Renkse's vocals on Katatonia's Dance of December Souls, which are just about the height of unrefined nastiness. The guitarists, too, don't finesse the songs as they would later do, attacking savagely and at high pace on all but the two epics, utilizing a similar drilling tremolo style to At the Gates on With Fear I Kiss the Burning Darkness, which even breaks into a black metal riff at 1:18 in 'Abandoned', possibly the most extreme song here. Those tremolos could lead to a less intense style, especially when they roll rather than drill, but Martin Lopez drums in a very active (occasionally schizophrenic) style, well summed-up in Pfuntner's review, where he says that \"Lopez drives the tempo like a man in fear for his life\". His battery on the opening songs is certainly anything but relaxed, though it's on 'Friends of the Suncross' when things start to get strange: the riff at 0:58 gets a totally random time signature and full-on death metal bludgeon thrown onto it, as though Lopez had suddenly had a premonition that he would later join Opeth but had taken the \"progressive death metal\" tag a little too close to heart. It isn't the only song where he goes nuts either, branding the closing title track with the same sort of stamp.\n\nThese more extreme and less refined elements lends Once Sent from the Golden Hall a special kind of danger that most other Amon Amarth albums don't possess, be that because of the production, songwriting, or more controlled style of the musicians. The way that the sharp guitars, pounding drums, and searing screams of the opening 'Ride for Vengeance' cut through the listener is pretty serious and has nothing to do with catchiness at all, the lasting effect being much greater than any hook, since novices are likely to have shat on the sofa and seasoned headbangers to have pulled a muscle. There are also the presence of two particularly long songs, which the band have never returned to in their career (rarely, if ever, topping 7 minutes on any subsequent album), both of which opt for mid-paced vistas of victory and immortality. 'Victorious March' drops little of the clatter and roar of the other numbers, though has that seminal Amon Amarth \"foot-stomping\" riff at its core, while 'Amon Amarth' gets a different treatment. This one reminds me especially of Enslaved, Lopez rolling around on his toms to build a stormy atmosphere from the opening, while the drawn-out tremolos have just a hint of frost and darkness to them, which Hegg highlights further with a high snarl and generally more black metal vocals. 'Amon Amarth' does have quite a bit of repetition (it's the only song that is definitely too long), though its widescreen quality is probably its greatest asset, sounding like a view over a battle-torn valley.\n\nAs for the remaining songs, 'Abandoned' is the odd one out, with those divergent riffing and drumming styles, while the first and last might be your best bet for pure potency. Some of the leads on these songs work very well too, not merely soloing aimlessly or skilfully, but finding the right tone and mood for the song, something that has always impressed me about Amon Amarth's guitarists. The best of the lot is surely the alternately skittering and soaring lead from 'The Dragons' Flight Across the Waves'. All of this means that Once Sent from the Golden Hall is a rather more complex album than any of the band's more recent efforts, due in part to the richer mixture of influences and styles, while there are moments that would now seem unusual in the context of With Oden on Our Side. I'm not really sure that this is better than an album like that, because there are a fair few differences, though for those that would prefer brutality to hooks and desperation to finesse this is the best choice.\n",
        "\nTwilight of the Thunder God is certainly a major turning point in Amon Amarth's discography. It becomes evident very quickly that this is an \"epic\", for lack of a better term, album. The sludgy riffs and grinding blastbeats of previous albums seem to be gone for good here, but they've been replaced by extremely catchy, melodic riffs. Many would bitch about the band throwing away their artistic integrity by becoming more accessible, but in my opinion, this style is superior to one exhibited early in their career.\n\nTwilight of the Thunder God houses some brilliant songs- namely the title track, which is an all out anthem and an ode to Thor. There are a few lackluster songs scattered here and there as well; songs like \"Free Will Sacrifice\" seem like filler. Every song does have a cool riff, but the filler songs all sound very similar to each other.\n\nThe vocals on Twilight of the Thunder God definitely live up to they album's title- they are thunderous indeed. The roars that fill the title track and the crushing \"Guardians of Asgard\" are simply awesome. I've always admired Johan Hegg's vocal abilities, but they definitely manifest themselves better here than they have on any of the band's previous efforts.\n\nThis is definitely a \"shred album\", it's very lead-centric. The soloing is very melodic, and it's far from the ear grating whammy bar masturbation that plagues many other death metal bands. It's awesome to hear a death metal guitarist who writes solos in a very thought out, compositional manner.\n\nOverall, despite the occasional flaw, Twilight of the Thunder God is an album that's pretty much guaranteed to be a lot of fun for those who are into death metal or folk metal.\n",
        "\nThere's a question about Amon Amarth that needs answering. To do so I'm going to paint a picture, which is actually one of Amon Amarth's own. Imagine this: a great battle with a great many warriors on either side, men fighting tooth and nail for survival, using only the most physical of weapons to cut and hack the enemy to death; on each side a heroic leader astride a horse who fights for victory alongside his men; one of those leaders has his horse killed early in the battle and must continue on foot; he is no longer in sight since he cannot be raised above the heads of the other combatants, though he continues to fight nonetheless; the opposing leader's horse suffers no such violence and keeps him aloft, easily cutting through attacks from every side. Now here's the question: which of those leaders is the more worthy of praise? The leader who was successful in battle, who all could see as he fought, and who was surely on the victorious side? Or the leader who fell from his horse, who was invisible as he struggled courageously, and surely did not survive the battle? Who do you choose?\n\nIn that situation, Amon Amarth are of course the horseback leader - the prominent one in this arena. They have been one of the most well-known melodic death metal bands for many years now and surely are also famous for their Viking themes. The unhorsed leader could represent many other bands: perhaps Unleashed or Bathory or Enslaved, who took Viking themes as their main subject during the early 1990s, or perhaps Insomnium or Kataklysm or Ensiferum, who are probably their closest kin in the melodeath/extreme/folk genres. The prominence of Amon Amarth has come upon the world forcefully and suddenly, bringing their music some mainstream attention and descending in the period from With Oden on Our Side to the more deliberately commercial Twilight of the Thunder God. What many are sceptical about is whether Amon Amarth deserve the praise and attention bestowed on them or whether there are other worthier bands who are producing similar music in a more sincere and creative fashion. In short, since its release this album has become a source of much argument and controversy.\n\nSo, what should we expect from With Oden on Our Side? There is the same kind of mid-paced melodeath that the band had originally displayed on their debut album, deviating from the common generic trend of thrashy, pounding rhythms and hooks, utilizing instead smoother riffing styles that borrow heavily from the moody tremolos of black metal or offer a loping chug that demands to be stamped along to. The mood is present in the riffing style, either sending a surge of nostalgia and wonder through the listener with the tremolos, creating a spirited, celebratory mood at foot-stomping speed, or producing more of a dangerous, adrenalized feeling with more standard death metal parts, as in the savage 'Asator'. There's an epic, widescreen quality to the music that brings Amon Amarth musically much closer to Enslaved than many would expect, which certainly increases the drama of the album, though occasionally causes parts of songs to blur together. There are not a great many lead moments on the album, the rhythm players tending to keep things tight as well, Fredrik Andersson maintaining standard pace for much of the time and Ted Lundstr\u00f6m doing little to make the bass stand out. Johan Hegg's vocals are a strange mixture of the extreme and the accessible, possessing a very deep and belchy voice similar to Insomnium's Niilo Sev\u00e4nen, but one that has surprising clarity and includes few strained moments.\n\nThat description may make Amon Amarth seem rather plain, seeing as it is left mainly to the guitarists to create mood and excitement. However, the mix is very good and the guitars are pushed weightily against the front of the sound, plus the drums have a bit of reverb that gives the whole thing a cavernous effect, making everything grand and epic. Usually that quality is a cause for celebration, particularly as Hegg's lyrics about battles and journeys are gripping, although when the intensity is lost on songs like 'Under the Northern Star' and 'Runes to My Memory' there appears to be a gap that the rest of the band can't fill. A few riffs also cut oddly stark shapes compared to the general fullness of sound, mostly those which jump on the low E and plug the gaps, such as the opening riff of 'Valhall Awaits Me' or the early part of 'Hermod's Ride to Hel'. There are a few really excellent moments, such as the bluster of 'Asator' as it takes off, the lamenting solo in 'Valhall Awaits Me', and the glorious momentum that accrues during 'Gods of War', perhaps the most complete song here. In general, the songs are strong and reasonably compact, though the end of the album from 'Cry of the Black Birds' seems weaker than the rest.\n\nThe real subject that seems worth examining, however, is whether WIth Oden on Our Side is an album that makes Amon Amarth worthy of the attention subsequently given them. It is almost certainly among their best releases, arguably compacting all that had made them noteworthy in the first place into a well-defined whole, although introducing few novel ideas into a well-established style. One thing that seems to hold it back from truly taking the crown at the end of the battle is something as straightforward as a lack of confidence: some of the songs (particularly those three mentioned as highlights, in addition to the title track) grab hold of the moment and brandish it proudly, while others aren't as consistent or feel underwhelming when they finish. The least that can be said is that Amon Amarth had forged a distinct sound by this point in their career and - however much or little that sound has been altered since - stand as a representative for the scenes in which they harbour. Not necessarily the true hero of the battle, but surely a satisfactory example of a hero nonetheless.\n",
        "\nOne of the first bands in the style, Swedish melodic death metal mainstays Amon Amarth have been steadily employing their blend of black and melodic death metal into being one of the best bands in this style. With long-time drummer Fredrik Andersson stepping down and the studio parts recorded by Tobias Gustafsson, the bands\u2019 tenth full-length effort was released March 25, 2016 on Metal Blade Records.\n\nAs has been the case from the start, the group here certainly knows their way around melodic death metal riffing, and that continues here with this one generating the kind of fiery melodic rhythms that has long been apart of the group\u2019 core sound. Blazing with hummable, dynamic riffing that\u2019s filled with swirling melodic leads alongside the deep, driving charge that propels the songs forward, the melodic tendencies of the band are at the forefront of the album overall. With the main rhythms adopting their signature swirling tremolo-picked patterns while alternating between the glorious, triumphant marches, full-speed thrash-paced frenzies or a more relaxed mid-tempo pace with a deeper, churning crunch pattern to the main rhythm-work, there\u2019s quite an impressive mix of their usual work featured here that creates a driving blend of black, death and minor elements of thrash into the overall package that\u2019s found here. This usual amount of variance creates a wholly appealing ebb and flow within the album as the different pieces take prominence on select tracks which is always wrapped up with melodic lead-work that\u2019s all tight, frantic and off-sets the vicious work on display here as the album does continually shift gears to a fault. There\u2019s way too many sections within this one that could\u2019ve been handled with a slightly more upbeat vibe as the attempts to showcase the metalcore-leaning riffs don\u2019t gel well with their sound at all. It\u2019s just obviously attempted to interject a variety into the tracks but the mechanical, chugging rhythms are out-of-place and stick out quite obviously against the more natural-sounding riffing elsewhere here. As well, it\u2019s all too familiar and does the same thing too many times over, but as it\u2019s been there since the beginning it\u2019s not that bad of a detriment and doesn\u2019t hurt it that much.\n\nStill sticking with their formula through thick-and-thin, the group\u2019s obviously patented sound that hasn\u2019t bit them before continues to serve them well as it generates a strong overall effort that while not as important or dynamic as what came before it still has plenty of appeal for fans of the band so far as well as those looking for genuine melodic death metal acts.\n",
        "\nWhen a particular niche of storytelling sums up the entire career of a band, it's often only a matter of time before the story will absorb an entire album, if it hasn't been doing so from the very beginning. The topic of Vikings naturally has a rich history with metal music in general, though the marriage of it with a death metal sound came about a bit later, and was popularized largely thanks to the efforts of Unleashed and their better known melodic Swedish counterparts Amon Amarth. Nevertheless, while the entirety of Amon Amarth's albums has been steeped in Viking history and lore, it has not been until the current year with the release of Jomsviking that a story dedicated to them has spanned an entire conceptual opus. If anything, this band has gotten into the concept album craze extremely late, and a close inspection of the resulting body of music reveals a band that is continuing its very slow evolution where consistency is the rule, and all development having been relegated to the periphery.\n\nThe story itself is a straightforward man vs. society tale set in the Viking ages where an individual finds himself a fugitive in his native land and takes up with the Jomsviking, a merciless band of Viking mercenaries who's historicity is disputed, if not legendary in character. The usual foray of bloodshed and revenge follows, though in contrast to most stories of a heroic nature, the quest ultimately ends in failure and death, though with the silver-lining of a hero's welcome to Valhalla. Given the somewhat more ambitious demeanor of the album's lyrical pursuits relative to past efforts, one might venture a guess that the accompanying music might find the band exploring more adventurous territory, but stylistically speaking this is an exercise all but entirely in the familiar. While arguably a bit more intricate than the generally slow paced and dark middle era of Versus The World and Fate Of Norns, this is an album that sticks to the same general format as every album following With Oden By Our Side, with a particularly similar melodic and quick-paced character to Surtur Rising.\n\nAt first glance, this album would seem to be more ambitious than anything heard previously, but after the initial excitement of the highlight moments and the generally consistency of one song to the next, it tends to settle into tried and true territory for this band. Fast paced cruisers like \"On A Sea Of Blood\", \"First Kill\" and \"One Against Many\" being front-loaded onto the first half of the album might fool one into thinking that Amon Amarth plans on moving closer to the speed-infused character of The Crown, but as things progress beyond things sort of veer off into a heavier, mid-paced direction with some occasional hints at an actual Viking/Folk influence (something that ordinarily would be associated with metal music on the given subject, but in this band's case has never been so), particularly on \"The Way Of Vikings\" and the tragic closing epic \"Back On Northern Shores\", the former heaving an almost symphonic film score introduction and a heavily folksy melodic drive, the latter being generally slow and heavy, not to mention a bit long and expansive relative to past albums.\n\nPerhaps the continual comparisons to past works can get a bit tiresome, but they are a necessity in assessing Amon Amarth's newer material as it tends to compare best to their extensive past. If there is anything that truly sets this album apart from others bearing the band's insignia, it's a greater degree of technical ambition, largely in the guitar department where solos tend to be a bit more common and melodic leads tend to wander about a bit more. It also veers ever so slightly closer to the cinema obsessed character of a lot of newer bands, but unlike some exaggerated reactions to this album, goes nowhere near Rhapsody Of Fire or Ensiferum territory. There's a few narrated voice-over parts here and there, but nothing that really crosses over into being overtly campy. It's final impression, conceptual aspects not withstanding, is largely of the typical catchy and formulaic character of Surtur Rising and Twilight Of The Thunder God, and with it comes the same array of complaints from detractors and praise from the steadfast. That's ultimately what Amon Amarth is, steadfast, and though they don't record the same album over and over, they have a clearly defined sound and they are sticking to it.\n",
        "\nYou know Amon Amarth. Let's not beat about the bush. Everyone's favourite accessible Viking-cum-melodeath Swedes release albums that sound similar to one another, just as AC/DC have been doing for 40 years. Got it. And to cut a long story very short: if you like any of Amon Amarth's albums since Versus the World you will like this. And if you're tired that they come up with little new from album to album, you're probably going to get tired of this too.\n\nJust from my own personal opinion, it seems like Surtur Rising was a strong reaction to the bid for commercial acceptance that was Twilight of the Thunder God, though it doesn't exactly cook up a new formula for the songs. The pace is generally faster and the overall feeling geared more towards heaviness, while catchiness is decidely less overt, if still involved in the songwriting. It's slightly hard finding good comparisons for Amon Amarth, since they mostly just sound like themselves, but by this point in their career, they had become attached to a polished yet heavy guitar sound that can rip up the ground on faster songs like 'Destroyer of the Universe' and streamline itself into soaring epic tremolo riffs moments later. There are also some more chugging riffs, so that we veer somewhere between power metal, black metal, and metalcore without actually touching any of those genres, staying close to melodeath though not in the manner that At the Gates or In Flames or Omnium Gatherum have ever done it. I guess if you really need a comparison, this is a bit like Insomnium if you take away the softer parts and the progressive touches, especially since the vocalists both have deep and cavernous voices.\n\nDespite a rather polished production, Surtur Rising sounds like a metal album in a way that Amon Amarth have not otherwise achieved since the release of With Oden on Our Side, since the riffs and - happily - leads do a lot of the talking in most of the songs. Counting through the first five songs on the album, I can call to mind a riff that I like in each and the leads in 'Destroyer of the Universe', 'Wrath of the Norsemen', and 'A Beast Am I' really stand out over most of the band's other work, having both visceral and atmospheric appeal. Those three riffing styles I mentioned earlier combine to great effect, giving one part heavy, one part epic, and one part catchy to a mixture that Fredrik Andersson stirs heartily with a powerful drumming performance. Johan Hegg is usually pivotal to the band's music, but here the vocalist has plenty of help from the guitarists, trading deep roars with those prevalent leads and a few decent melodies, so that some emotion is brought to the tales of dying warriors and impending doom.\n\nDepending on my mood, I get along well with slightly different songs from the album. If I want something serious, the faster numbers like 'A Beast Am I', 'War of the Gods', and particularly 'Destroyer of the Universe' get me going, while there are big groovy riffs to have fun with in 'Tock's Taunt', 'Slaves of Fear', and 'Live Without Regrets' if I'm seeking simpler pleasures. I was initially rather sceptical about the slower and strongly melodic 'The Last Stand of Frej', though it's grown on me and provides a break mid-album. One feature of that song is the crushing, doomy riff that strikes during the first half, something that is picked up by the \"experimental\" closer (nothing is ever really experimental for Amon Amarth), which drops the pace to a march and matches orchestration to the riffs for an equally solemn and doomy effect. Given the similarity of some of this band's albums to one another, it's not surprising that I occasionally get confused about which one I'm listening to, having special problems during 'Victory or Death', which I'm convinced was on the preceding album. It isn't that memorable anyway, generically existing as another Amon Amarth song, as does 'Slaves of Fear' to a lesser degree.\n\nIf you got into Amon Amarth through With Oden on Our Side and are looking for something in that vein, I would recommend Surtur Rising as the best album available, since it's certainly heavier than the other efforts that came in the wake of the band's breakthrough and satisfies more in the way of guitar content. For those concerned about the redundancy of another similar album from the Swedes, I cannot assuage your fears, though I would recommend a listen to 'Wrath of the Norsemen' if you're looking for motivation to buy this; the transition from creepy lead guitar suspense to all-out riffing on that song is immense. And, thankfully, so is the majority of the album.\n",
        "\nOh boy, where do I even start with this one? I do wish I could just write \u201cBoring As Fuck\u201d in big block letters and leave it at that, but a review is a review so let\u2019s get on with it. Out of all the things people have criticized the band for, the one thing that stands out the most is their painfully obvious and crippling lack of variety. When you\u2019re listening to a 9 song album and everything starts sounding the same by the 3rd song itself, you know something is wrong. Very wrong. The previous sentence itself should give you a fair idea of what this band is about. Clearly \u201cviking metal\u201d is not my cup of tea. Also rather funny that they call themselves by that genre tagline when their music barely has any power to it aye? Something to think about, that\u2019s all. Songwriting seems to be pretty much non-existent on this album. \n\nAlso I\u2019m sorry but the riffs are barely metal to begin with. They sound more like straightforward rock or punk riffs with extra distortion and boring chug riffs that never end rather than anything by a melodeath band. Okay that was a bit harsh and there are exceptions in the case of a few songs but regardless. Even the solos and leads are nothing to write home about, being just some random generic harmonisation that Maiden have already done to death since the 80s or a scale run. There are even some tremolo riffs that sound like Cradle Of Filth rejects sapped of all their energy and vitality. Equally boring are the vocals just being ultra-low guttural growls that borders close to harsh whispering at times. Yawn. I was seriously considering turning this album off halfway through itself, but I soldiered on. Big mistake. If you\u2019re even a casual fan of melodeath you\u2019d have heard all these licks and riffs a good million times before. No kidding. Also the band almost NEVER gets out of the mid-paced rut they\u2019ve set themselves in from the first song onward. I mean okay I\u2019m not asking for time signature changes or any of that complex stuff but at least change it up a bit willya? \n\nI seriously just don\u2019t get it. Why the fuck is this band so revered? Is it because their riffs just go THUD THUD THUD PLONK PLONK on and on forever with no sense of variation or dynamics and that\u2019s what metalheads dig the most nowadays? Is it because nowadays metal fans simply want to mindlessly jump/mosh to anything and everything brutal/heavy without bothering about the music having any lasting power? Granted death metal (or even melodic death metal for that matter) is not known for having dynamics in that sense, but COME ON! You could at least TRY and sound interested in playing the music you do, but these guys sound bored as fuck. Just like the music itself, so I guess that\u2019s pretty apt. It\u2019s like they went to the studio literally saying \u201cSo we\u2019re gonna compose this song in the key of Ab and that song in the key of D#\u201d or whatever. I mean this is just so by-the-numbers and manufactured that a part of my brain actually finds it difficult to believe that actual musicians wrote this music and more the fact that it could\u2019ve just been whipped up on a damn computer one fine day and nobody would even know. There\u2019s no fire or passion or feel or atmosphere or literally ANYTHING of worth to be found on this album that would make you want to listen to it again. Background music of the most mundane kind. You could flip the tracklist backwards from 9 to 1 and put \u201cPrediction of Warfare\u201d in the place of \u201cValhall Awaits Me\u201d and it would make NO DAMN DIFFERENCE whatsoever. That\u2019s how samey and interchangeable the songs are. Some would say that\u2019s a good thing and consistency and all that jazz, but definitely not in the case of this band. Seriously its bands and albums like these that prove every halfwit metal-hater out there claiming that \u201cMan, metal is boring as fuck\u201d right at the end of the day because that\u2019s exactly what it is. Fucking boring. What pisses me off the most is that now, because of their widespread popularity (for reasons completely beyond my understanding) most metal newbies will most-probably end up hearing Amon Amarth before the better (and more underrated) Gothenburg bands and subsequently think they know all about melodeath. Sheesh. Not good. And this is one of their best albums?? Christ on a fucking pogo stick, I don\u2019t think I even want to know what their other albums sound like. No thanks. \n\nI mean seriously, I consider myself a die-hard fan of melodeath and yet I can\u2019t help but find these guys unbearably dull. The last sentence should speak for itself. If you still want to go ahead and waste your time checking these guys out when there are literally hundreds of underrated melodeath bands out there who are a million times more deserving of your attention, by all means knock yourself out. However if you\u2019re not an idiot, don\u2019t even bother. If you\u2019re that curious just listen to \u201cAsator\u201d (the only song actually worth hearing) and call it a day.\n",
        "\nI find it something astounding that someone could dedicate their lives to art, and lack the drive to push themselves in a fresh direction at some point. I'm perfectly aware that Amon Amarth have occasionally done things to spruce up their sound, but the fact remains: If we get an album from them twenty years from now, you'll already know exactly what to expect from it. \n\nI saw them play for a packed house last night for the first time in over a decade, and I realize I understand the appeal without necessarily sharing it myself. For a band like Amon Amarth, fans aren't looking for something new. They're looking for thick, anthemic songs to serve simultaneously as a vessel for Viking legends and a backdrop for socially-enabled alcoholism. Not that any of that is a bad thing. Fun can be a neat thing to have sometimes. But it does beg the question: How excited can one be for an album where everything expected is granted? Jomsviking is crafted from most of the same ingredients we've heard previously, and the few curveballs they offer are iffy at best. In most respects it's perfectly functional as a melodic death metal record, but their formula has long since worn thin.\n\nAt this stage in Amon Amarth's career, their style is practically set in stone. I wouldn't say this is entire a bad thing; where many bands fall short of earning themselves a unique character, you can hear a single track off Jomsviking and instantly recognize the band. By melodeath standards, Amon Amarth are consummately mid-paced, with the thick rhythms and growls striking a contrast with pretty lead melodies. It's almost redundant to describe the style at this point; for better or worse, they've stuck to that template throughout their career. There's not a ton of variety within the formula. Tales of Viking loss, sacrifice and/or victory are all expressed in much of the same way. Despite this predictable nature, there are songs that manage to stand out. \"First Kill\" opens the album on a hopeful note, and \"The Way of Vikings\" pairs an interesting lyrical insight with above-average melodic writing.\n\nThe song that's been getting the most attention is easily \"A Dream That Cannot Be\", and this is where the half-successful innovation I was talking about earlier comes in. The heavy metal icon Doro Pesch jumps in for a guest segment alongside Johan Hegg's gruff delivery. I've never cared much for her music as Doro, but the inclusion of her vocals here feels incredibly contrived. She may have the vocal pipes for it, but her style clashes with the antiquated Viking atmosphere the band tries to evoke. To their credit, the idea of including a female vocalist seems to fit the album. Jomsviking is labelled as Amon Amarth's first concept album, telling the story of a Viking who is exiled for killing someone in defence of his woman, longing to return to his home. In a sense, it's not a world away from Opeth's Still Life concept, although any sense of running narrative is overswept by the broad Viking themes. I've always liked Amon Amarth's lyrics for their cultural expertise and storytelling, and the idea of hearing a larger story from them was promising. The lyrics are still probably the most engaging thing on Jomsviking, but the concept album potential here was only half-realized. Most of the songs work best on their own, and only a handful (like \"First Kill\" and \"A Dream That Cannot Be\") serve to place the concept front and centre.\n\nJomsviking is an enjoyable continuation of the band's legacy. It pales in comparison with Versus the World and With Oden on Our Side, but I think as much could have been expected from any of the band's subsequent output. As predictable and rote as these guys have become, I almost commend them for sticking to what they know best. When so many bands reinvent themselves tastelessly, I suppose there's a certain elegance to staying true to yourself for over two decades and counting. Thinking that way doesn't make Jomsviking any more interesting to listen to, but it is something to consider.\n",
        "\nAmon Amarth is a band that requires no introduction, if you're a metalhead and you are a fan of melodic death metal, you should know Amon Amarth and if you don't then, well now you know. Amon Amarth is probably one of, if not the most famous viking themed band in the metal genre and for good reason. However many long time fans and even some new fans of the band have noticed that slowly the band has not been releasing as good material as before, including me.\n\nQuite awhile ago Amon Amarth decided to change their sound from a more heavier form of melodeath to a more melodic form of the same genre, which is fine, I personally prefer the new melodic sound. They still have been releasing great albums such as With Odin On Our Side, Twilight of the Thunder God, and Surtur Rising. Then Deceiver of the Gods came out and a lot of fans noticed that their sound changed ever so slightly, but the album was still rather good. 3 years later Amon Amarth releases their next album: Jomsviking...\n\nTo be completely honest I was really disappointed with this album considering how much hype was put into it by the band. There's only a few songs off of the album that I really like, those being First Kill, Raise Your Horns, and One Thousand Burning Arrows. The rest of songs are just... meh. \"Meh.\" That's a word you don't want to describe your album. Especially after all the hype they raised for this album.\n\nSee, Amon Amarth always had a atmosphere they produced in their music which usually gave you an awesome feeling while listening. That feeling you get is the feeling of pure epicness. It's like watching an action movie or playing a video game, during that final fight scene when all the awesome stuff is happening, in your head you are thinking \"This is fucking awesome!\" but to be completely honest that feeling is almost completely absent from this album.\n\nHalf of the album is the band's attempt at making something symphonic at utterly failing at it most of the time, and the other half of it is them forcing the brutalness of the music. Take the song Wanderer for example: the song is ok but the chorus is the main part you should be looking at. The chorus starts with a more melodic piece just for the flow to be interrupted by what I can only assume to be the band's attempt at being brutal but it's not. This happens multiple times throughout the entire album! Why did they do this? Did they think it was a good idea; because it clearly wasn't!\n\nMost of the songs are so mediocre that I found myself skipping songs half-way through or walking away from my computer to go do something else for a few minutes. To be completely honest I haven't even listened to the final song yet because I had to wash away the utter disappointment that this album is with some other band. In fact, the only reason why I am giving this album a 55% is because the few good songs on this album are really good. If First Kill and Raise Your Horns weren't as good as they were I'd probably give this album a 38%.\n",
        "\nThe three year wait since Deceiver of the Gods gave me some inkling of hope that the band would regroup and sharpen their collective blade for a bloodletting at least on par with the burly Surtur Rising; but that album is starting to feel like a fluke, adrift in a sea of mediocrity that reaches all of the way back to the barely-passable Twilight of the Thunder God, which started the trend of Amon Amarth playing it safe whenever they could cut corners, and the songwriting suffered immeasurably as a result. Hell, at least Fate of Norns attempted something different, and committed to the aesthetic wholly, even if it ended up failing. Jomsviking mans the oars with one unexpected card in its deck, that being the slightly more fleshed out narrative, but does this even amount to anything worth a damn?\n\nOf course not. A smattering of spoken word lead-ins does little to cement the music as anything deeper or more profound on a conceptual level, even if it does tackle some atypical themes. In the end, its just a different shade of dried blood plastered on these Swedes' blades, and the band has perhaps never sounded more redundant. Boy, is that a hard revelation to even come to terms with, but with the production values cleaned up and washed out to the point of inanity, Amon Amarth's mighty mid-paced churning riffing style is neutered in ways never previously conceived. The band really needs to get back to the rawer guitar tone used on albums like The Crusher, which evocatively cemented the tremolo sections and gave the music that swirling, pulsing gait that works well alongside Hegg's maniacal rambling. The loss of Andersson behind the kit also shortchanges the band, with Gustafsson failing to evoke the same war-drum, cement-cracking predilection. The production values do him no favors, as the kit is pathetically softened along with most of the remainder, but the performance lacks gusto and drive.\n\nSomewhere, buried deep within Jomsviking, one can hear hints of the band's primary assault, which while present and accounted for on paper, absolutely does not translate well on the record. I did enjoy the triumphant orchestrations employed on \"The Way of Vikings,\" but the lyrics are as rote as ever, and the rest does little to evoke the anthemic aesthetic purported. The guitarists attempt to cultivate a more traditionally-inspired sound regarding the leads, following more standard melodic lines instead of the epic/monolithic slant granted by the scant leads on earlier records. In this regard, the band seems to lose a bit of their identity. Some of these note progressions are beyond played out, and do so little interesting I struggle to recall even the better examples. Displaying this fault is \"One Thousand Burning Arrows,\" which gives the leads a chance to cook up a more mournful slant like the band does on at least one song per album, but I find myself skipping to the next song before the tune even reaches the halfway point. \n\nNearly lost among the swelling crowd of pretentious vehicles for stock guitar lines is \"One Against All,\" which opens and maintains momentum in a manner redolent of some of the band's best from a decade or so ago. This is easily the best song here, and the only true takeaway from Jomsviking. The tremolos swirl at full force despite the plastic production, but it definitely excels in a manner nothing on the previous album did. This is their best song since \"For Victory or Death,\" in my opinion. The remainder is lamentably boring, with Amon Amarth simply not capable of pulling off a truly memorable tune from front to back. \"Raise Your Horns\" has some fun moments, and the closer \"Back on Northern Shores\" feels suitable as a finale for the narrative, but the rest is so transparent it's easy to miss. Don't get me wrong, Jomsviking is functional for newcomers to the genre, so at most basic level, Amon Amarth still have some relevance there, but don't let anybody fool you into thinking this is a return to form. The best accolade I can grant the album is the presence of \"One Against All,\" but I won't sugarcoat my indifference concerning the remainder. This is their worst since Fate of Norns.\n",
        "\nIt has been about three years since Amon Amarth\u2019s last album, Deceiver Of The Gods, which for me was just another perfectly acceptable addition to their discography. When I heard the first single for Jomsviking, aptly named \u201cFirst Kill\u201d, and watched the accompanying music video I thought \u201cOh, another Amon Amarth album.\u201d Everything changed when I heard the opening lines of \u201cAt Dawn\u2019s First Light\u201d. I was confronted with a corny stripped down version of what I knew as Amon Amarth, I even made the remark to a friend \u201cIs Amon Amarth turning into folk metal?\u201d Needless to say my expectations for another Surtur Rising were dashed, but I went into the album with an open mind.\n\nFortunately listening to \u201cOne Thousand Burning Arrows\u201d and \u201cBack on Northern Shores\u201d I realized that Jomsviking\u2019s fault seems to only be in its lyrics and not the instrumentation. I don\u2019t know if this new direction in lyrics will be a constant for Amon Amarth or if Johan Hegg is suffering from some serious writer\u2019s block or even some new band members have been given the lyrical reins that should not have but if they were trying to shock their audience that takes the band too seriously dubbing them as viking metal, they succeeded.\n\nLooking past the spoken word passages, poor word choices that seemingly come straight out of the head of someone who plays too much World of Warcraft, and lack luster gang vocals then you can get to the real strength of the album and Amon Amarth as a whole, their song crafting ability. Even though its main theme is reminiscent of the outro for \u201cA Beast Am I\u201d, \u201cOne Thousand Burning Arrows\u201d is a beautiful serenade to a deceased Viking King that really put my faith back into an album that was all over the shop as far as quality goes.\n\n\u201cA Dream That Cannot Be\u201d fits well into the band\u2019s collection of collaborations this time employing the veteran metal singer Doro Pesch. The song is a very female centric empowering song talking about a man who thinks he knows best for his woman but she is already confident and free in her own right that will most likely open the door to more females in metal which in my opinion is never a bad thing.\n\nHaving Amon Amarth\u2019s complete studio album discography and listening to it frequently I have noticed a trend on their more recent albums of putting their melodic masterpieces towards the end of the track listing and in this one aspect Jomsviking did not disappoint. \u201cBack on Northern Shores\u201d is not very far off from being Amon Amarth\u2019s attempt at a prog song with an up tempo guitar opening that carries throughout most of the song giving a true sense of scale for the battle that Johan is describing through his heartfelt growls.\n\nIf this album was devoid of a track like \u201cBack on Northern Shores\u201d then I would have had to rate it a five at best but thankfully the anxiety I had after viewing \u201cAt Dawn\u2019s First Light\u201d was ill-founded. Jomsviking is a solid seven out of ten for me, if the band does continue making albums I just hope this low point in lyrical writing passes.\n\nOriginally written for qjukebox.com\n",
        "\nI promised myself I'd hold off reviewing any albums from Swedens finest vikings until they created something truly unique. My hopes of this occurrence were slim to begin with, but when it was announced that Amon Amarth's newest full-length, \"Jomsviking\", was to be a concept album - well this was my chance! So what was to be expected from this new venture? Grandiose introductions? Narrative interludes? An orchestra? Choir?! Nnnope! Of course not. This is good old melodic death metal done the way only Amon Amarth know how. Sure, it's pretty much the same album they've been releasing since 2002, but are you complaining? No, of course not.\n\nHarmonious twin leads? Check. Brutal riffs? Check. Solid, precise drumming? Check. Johan Hegg's inimitable growls? Check-a-roony! Sure, the familiar sound of Amon Amarth is unchanging and reliable as a stone pillar. But there's one more thing we can add to this checklist: a storyline! The narrative may not be carried convincingly through the music itself - but a quick glance through the lyric booklet provides an effective visual aid to the layers of admirable melo-death that lie before you. It is a romance (!!!) about a man whose lover is kidnapped. On his quest to retrieve her, he encounters the Jomsvikings - an elite viking force whose lifestyle enthralls him. When he eventually locates his lost love - it turns out she has moved on, doesn't need him anymore, and even threatens to kill him! So naturally, he returns to what he does best: being a fucking viking.\n\nThis tragic turn of events, in what is quite a detailed story (for a death metal band!), could have paved the way for an enormous variation of styles throughout each track. But Amon Amarth chose to stick to what they do best...just like the man in the story! So maybe they DID think about this after all! The most dynamic parts of the album are the absolute highlights. The melancholic \"Wanderer\" is effective in its display of loneliness. The back-and-forth vocals in \"A Dream That Cannot Be\" accurately recreate the pivotal point of the plot - though Doro Pesch's guest vocals leave a lot to be desired. Most impressive of all is the sorrowful \"One Thousand Burning Arrows\". As a musical interpretation of a royal viking funeral, it is truly emotive and powerful. Don't be afraid to shed a tear or two to this tune. It's this album's equivalent of 2007's \"Embrace of the Endless Ocean\".\n\nThe obvious crowd-pleaser, which I can see becoming a live staple for decades to come, is the anthemic \"Raise Your Horns\" - the title says it all really. Though the chorus solidifies in your brain like cement, it's the killer main riff which is the star of this track. \"On a Sea of Blood\" is also responsible for one of the most vicious riffs in the band's arsenal. The section that drops at 1:51 is made even more monstrous by Johan, joining in at the 2-minute mark, with some colossal low-end roars.\n\nThe production quality is top-notch as expected. Those homespun guitar duels shine brightly; Tobias Gustafsson's performance behind the kit is admirable indeed, especially his blast-beats in the closing track (a trait strangely omitted from Amon Amarth's catalogue); Johan Hegg's voice ploughs through the wall of sound effortlessly; but unfortunately, the bass gets completely lost - even when the texture becomes sparse. The cover art is incredible - it certainly pulled me in anyhow! I highly recommend the digibook, as each track comes with a beautifully-drawn visual aid to help immerse you in the story. \n\n\"Jomsviking\" doesn't re-write the book of melodic death metal, in any shape or form. But when have you ever expected Amon Amarth to be anything other than...Amon Amarth? Solid, reliable, familiar melo-death, just the way we want/need it. If you feel yourself becoming one with the narrative - then that's just a bonus for you, compliments of Johan & co.\n\n\"Raise your horns, raise them up to the sky!\nWe will drink to glory tonight!\nRaise your horns, for brave fallen friends!\nWe will meet where the beer never ends!\"\n",
        "\nHorned helmets off to Amon Amarth, no one quite does heavy metal like them. What other band can produce [now] 10 albums themed around the Viking era and make them all sound so consistently appealing? Whatever your answer, this trait is a double edged sword. While most of their back catalogue is an impressive collection of adrenaline fuelled metal, they lack identity and diversity- essentially you could pick and mix tracks from every album to form a new one and the outcome would be that it still sounds like every other release. \n\n\u201cJomsviking\u201d is the first release by Amon Amarth that is truly identifiably and the reason behind that fact is because it is a concept album. The basic story of it tells the tale of a man\u2019s life in an elite mercenary group called the Jomsvikings which he joins after he murders a man that tries to steal his lover from him. After many perils in the Jomsviking brotherhood, the hero seeks out his woman once again only to find that she doesn\u2019t want him anymore and even threatens to kill him. Heartbroken, he returns to the only thing he has worth fighting for: The Jomsvikings. \n\n\u201cAmon Amarth made an album featuring romance you say?!\u201d \n\nFear not\u2026 \u201cJomsviking\u201d is packed full of the brutish characteristics that everyone always craves for from this band. \u2018First Kill\u2019 kicks things off with a menacing narrative of the hero\u2019s attack and instantly showcases, new drummer, Tobias Gustafsson\u2019s precision behind the kit. Darker tracks such as \u2018The Way Of Vikings\u2019 and \u2018One Against All\u2019 are both typically ferocious chapters that wield spiralling hooks and savage riffs which sail along seas of traditional tremolo-picking assaults. \u2018At Dawn\u2019s First Light\u2019 displays a good balance of ruthlessness and melody however Andy Sneap\u2019s- usually brilliant- production seems to sway towards the melodious side of Amon Amarth here which undesirably extracts the muscle behind the power that \u201cJomsviking\u201d constantly seems to yearn for.\n\nJohan Hegg displays his excellent lyricism throughout in the story that increases the sense of drama in each song. He portrays vivid imagery through a first person viewpoint that really makes us feel involved in his character\u2019s adventure. Musically, \u2018One Thousand Burning Arrows\u2019 is a slow ballad-like song that appears a bit serious for Amon Amarth\u2019s signature sound but lyrically, it richly depicts a traditional procedure of a Viking funeral for the Jomsvikings\u2019 fallen leader. \u2018Raise Your Horns\u2019 incorporates a more sludgier sound that we\u2019re used to but with anthemic chants and infectious choruses you can\u2019t resist the pride that this song illustrates after their victorious battle. \u2018A Dream That Cannot Be\u2019 is the penultimate chapter when the hero discovers that his lover chooses her own freedom and even threatens to kill him. Doro Pesch (Warlock) even makes a guest appearance to sing the lover\u2019s perspective which gives the song a genuine sense of character. \n\nIf you\u2019ve listened to Amon Amarth\u2019s past work, you\u2019ve essentially have already heard what this album sounds like. But in contrast, their renowned take on Viking obsessed death metal with a wild array of riffs sharp enough to whet a blade, \u201cJomsviking\u201d was never really destined to disappoint anyone- and it definitely does not.\n\nOriginally written for http://www.sputnikmusic.com/review/70257/Amon-Amarth-Jomsviking/ by myself. \n",
        "\nAmon Amarth is a band that needs no introduction. They are a legendary band and have garnered quite the fan base since the release of their first album \u201cOnce Sent from the Golden Hall\u201d back in 1998. They are one of my favorite bands and put on a great live show as well. I saw them at Mayhem Festival in 2013 when they were touring for their previous album \u201cDeceiver of the Gods\u201d. Now, that album is not one of my favorites of theirs but was still a solid listen. My introduction to this band was through \u201cTwilight of the Thunder God\u201d and about two years after I got into them, they released \u201cSurtur Rising\u201d, which is one of their best in my opinion. How does \u201cJomsviking\u201d stack up to the band\u2019s previous eight albums? I\u2019ve been reading a lot of negative reviews on the Internet, but are these reviews justified? Let us investigate.\n\nThe first thing I notice is how familiar this album sounds. It follows a similar sound to what they\u2019ve pretty much been doing their entire career with a few differences. It differs a slight bit from the last few albums, with a bit more of an emphasis on atmosphere. However, the thick, heroic guitar tone is still there and the riffs are as crunchy as ever. The guitars are still extremely melodic and catchy. \u201cFirst Kill\u201d and the fairly simple \u201cOne Against All\u201d have some very catchy riffs that retain the album\u2019s heaviness, while songs like \u201cAt Dawn\u2019s First Light\u201d, \u201cBack on Northern Shores\u201d, and the truly epic \u201cThe Way of Vikings\u201d showcase a keen emphasis on atmosphere and there are points on this album that actually sound fairly melancholic, but not depressing. Overall, the guitar work is much more impressive than the last album but still doesn\u2019t quite match any of the albums before it, minus perhaps \u201cFate of Norns\u201d, which I really don\u2019t like that much. I don\u2019t think we will ever hear another album like \u201cThe Avenger\u201d or \u201cVersus the World\u201d but seeing as these guys are in their forties now, the sound is bound to fall a little bit behind. Songs like \u201cRaise Your Horns\u201d do keep the Northern spirit alive within the band, although maybe it could be a bit better.\n\nOne factor that sets this album apart from any other release these guys have put out, is the fact that it\u2019s a concept album. It follows the story of the Jomsvikings, a tragic story dealing with love and revenge. Johan Hegg stated \u201cIt\u2019s a tragedy, I guess! But I like sad endings, because they\u2019re the ones that affect you the most\u201d. And this makes sense. It\u2019s really cool to listen along to the lyrics and visualize the story unfolding in front of you. Johan\u2019s vocals still sound as good as they\u2019ve always sounded, and it is really cool that his voice hasn\u2019t suffered throughout Amon Amarth\u2019s career. There are even clean vocals on the track \u201cA Dream that Cannot Be\u201d provided by Doro Pesch of the German band Doro. I\u2019m not a fan of Doro or her singing these cleans are actually a very unique addition to this album, and it would be cool if Amon Amarth would continue to work with clean vocals, although, maybe they could utilize someone better\u2026? But hey, that\u2019s just my opinion.\n\nCompared to any of the albums before \u201cDeceiver of the Gods\u201d, this really isn\u2019t all that special, aside from \u201cFate of Norns\u201d as I stated earlier. Even so, it\u2019s still a solid album that does no harm and would be worth a spin or two if you\u2019re a fan of this band. It doesn\u2019t deserve all the negativity I\u2019ve seen on the Internet thus far and features a really cool storyline.\n",
        "\nAmon Amarth are a very distinct band. Each of their releases is different from the others, but there's always a sense of familiarity. You can always tell when a song is one of theirs, no matter which of their albums it's from. In recent times they've been met with some criticism for precisely that, and many find themselves growing tired of the style that they've kept fairly unchanged for almost their entire career. I understand why this is, but I find the band nothing short of incredibly consistent and everything they release seems to be at least worth a few spins.\n\nIt has to be noted that there's more focus on atmosphere than intensity across Jomsviking, something that has perhaps been lacking from the majority of their recent works. The thundering riffs courtesy of the rhythm guitar have always been something that I liked about Amon Amarth, and they're still a prominent feature of the band's work. Galloping across a large portion of the album the band's intensity is still there when they want it to be, but in typical Amon Amarth fashion the melodies remain right at the forefront throughout. And it's those melodies that really make this album the beautiful beast that it is. As you'd expect nothing's overly complex, but there's an extra degree of harmonising between the guitarists and it brings me right back to With Oden on Our Side, the last Amon Amarth album that really hammered home the melodic side of things rather than trying to simply floor the reader through ferocity. And that's just how things should be.\n\nJohan Hegg's vocals for me have always been impressive, and it's no different here. As usual what he says is actually intelligible without the lyrics in front of the reader, and his approach is reasonably varied throughout as far as harsh vocals go. His gutturals are powerful and work well when the guitars turn to their typical thundering passages, and his higher barks retain the same force. I can't fault his performance here, but it should be noted that Doro Pesch's guest appearance on 'A Dream That Cannot Be' does add something that appears to be missing from elsewhere, possibly a sign that Amon Amarth could benefit from using cleans more often. Given the simplistic nature of their music it's perhaps unsurprising, and as harsh vocals are always slightly one-dimensional compared to cleans Johan's input doesn't always have the impact that it ought to, despite how accomplished he is.\n\nIt has to be said that Jomsviking is exactly what I hoped Amon Amarth would put out, and it holds up well in their vast discography of great albums. Doesn't quite top With Oden on Our Side, but certainly is their best album since that was released ten years ago. Well worth a listen, and it might restore some people's faith in Amon Amarth after a few \"lacklustre\" albums.\n",
        "\nWhen a band has been around as long as Amon Amarth has been, toting a very stylized and consistent sound, the risk of degenerating into an overly repetitious orthodoxy becomes quite high. In a sense they've been content to tinker around the edges following the release of 2006's With Oden On Our Side, and perhaps with good reason given how powerful of an album it was and how many possibilities it opened up in keeping up the epic side of things without losing their accessibility. In fact, one wouldn't be too far off base in comparing the contents of their previous four LPs to a modernization of the old school heavy metal ideal, where streamlined songwriting had yet to give way to Iron Maiden's towering seven minutes plus epics and progressive tendencies. While the jury is still out as far as what the upcoming Jomsviking release will do differently, if their promotional single First Kill is a strong indicator, it will see a comparably significant shift in approach while still holding to the basic tenants of their past.\n\nAt its inception, the A-side of this single is quite intent on treading a path that's a bit closer to the mid-90s Gothenburg sound, where layering of harmonic material was a more common practice, shifts in feel were a bit more rapid, and atmosphere had a greater degree of influence on the sound relative to sheer impact. To be clear, these songs don't come up short in the impact department either, but there is definitely more of a nimble character to the guitar work, along with a greater degree of interplay with the rhythm section. \"First Kill\" actually takes a rare occasional allow bassist Ted Lundstr\u00f6m to do more than play his usual support role, resulting in a greater degree of density to the overall song amid an already greater degree of guitar layering. Even Johan Hegg's vocals, which have tended towards a one-dimensional barking character, tends to switch things up a bit more and giving a greater degree of depth to the berserker vocal persona he's been going for these past 24 years.\n\nThere is always a danger in being presumptuous when trying to predict the outcome of a soon to be released LP based on one or two songs being dropped in advance. Nevertheless, it's a pretty safe assumption that Jomsviking will have all the obligatory elements to make the typical Amon Amarth fan throw the horns in the air, but this may prove to be among their better albums in recent years given the greater degree of intricacy at play in the songwriting. For being generally standard length songs, there is a fair degree of differing elements mixed in, and while not have any outright crazy shred moments in line with a typical Arch Enemy or Children Of Bodom song, they are on the upper echelon of what passes for technically ambitious by Amon Amarth standards. If nothing else, it shows that the passage of time need not be an excuse for sheathing your sword and going along to get along, the antithesis of the Viking way.\n",
        "\nThe first we've heard from Amon Amarth since 2013's Deceiver of the Gods is this single which comes ahead of their upcoming album Jomsviking. Its two tracks are both cuts from the full-length, and they offer an exciting sneak peek at the new record.\n\nMy first impression is that these songs feature very impressive songwriting. On older releases, it wasn't uncommon for Amon Amarth to rely more on intensity than creativity. Some consider their discography to suffer from monotony. The band has a distinctive sound, and at times they have fallen into repetitiveness.\n\n\"First Kill\" and \"At Dawn's First Light\" are both complex, intricate songs with many moving parts. The title track is a headbanger in the vein of \"Valhall Awaits Me\" and \"Runes To My Memory,\" while the second song is a fast-paced piece with excellent guitar passages and a terrific sense of cohesion. Both of them, while still falling squarely in the accessible realm of high production value melodic death metal, contain progressive elements that are a breath of fresh air for the band.\n\nJohan Hegg's vocals sound a little thin at times, and his death growl is less recognizable than his higher-pitched shouts. The lyrics come across at times as campy and rote, but this isn't the Prose Edda we're talking about. The vocals/lyrics are functional and acceptable, even though I feel that they are on the weaker side of this release's qualities.\n\nThis single makes me excited for the album, which a good single should. These songs are a strong showing for this band, now well into their third decade, and suggest that Amon Amarth are not slowing down.\n",
        "\nBeyond the quite-wonderful \"Viking Metal\" phrase, I hadn't been all that familiar with Amon Amarth. Then I heard that they were headlining a show a while back with Enslaved and Skeletonwitch as support. And since there was no question, because of my fandom for Enslaved, and my interest in Skeletonwitch, that I was going to get my geriatric ass to that show, I figured it'd be a good idea to buy Amon Amarth's latest, just so I could be sort of familiar with the headliners when I did.\n\nTurned out I bought some kind of deluxe version of Deceiver of the Gods, which included this EP, and good thing I did.\n\nWhile there are some good examples out there (I'll recommend Coverkill in addition to the Metallica and Slayer and Rush stuff you'd already think of), the cover album over the last ten years has become something of a cliche. But though it pays tribute to M\u00f6t\u00f6rhead, AC/DC, Black Sabbath, and Judas Priest, Under the Influence is not a cover album (or EP). Instead, Amon Amarth wrote and recorded four new songs of their own, one each in the style of the bands mentioned.\n\nIt was a risky thing to do, if you think about it. If you miss the mark, the whole thing falls flat on its face. You look like a bunch of highfalutin' idiots, and besides, with all due respect to Amon Amarth--I liked the melodic death approach of Deceiver of the Gods quite a bit--they're probably not as good as any of the bands they pay tribute to here, excepting perhaps AC/DC.\n\nBut they pulled it off. On each of the four songs, you know for certain within 30 seconds which band is being, umm, tributed. Amon Amarth nail it both musically and lyrically. The AC/DC tune is characteristic of the Aussies in that it is both singlemindedly concerned with sex, and hilarious, both things as they should be. \"Stand Up to Go Down\" is full of double- and single- entendres, sort of the only place you could still go after \"Whole Lotta Rosie.\" And you'll swear it's Angus playing the solo.\n\nJohan Hegg sings the Sabbath tune (\"Satan Rising,\" natch) with uncharacteristic clean vocals that actually end up sounding a bit like Ozzy when he dropped down, and it ends with a characteristic production trick. And Amon Amarth have quite the feel for proto-doom, how about that?\n\nHegg sounds a little bit like Lemmy (probably because the esteemed Mr. Kilmeister is about as guttural as you can get outside the death metal scene), but \"Snake Eyes,\" like the AC/DC riff, is also particularly on target with the lyrics, which covers the Kilmeister fascination with gambling, and even manages to name-drop \"Born to Lose.\"\n\nThe Priest tune probably faces the biggest challenge, because Hegg sounds nothing like Rob Halford. But Amon Amarth get the twin-lead attack down, as well as the Priestian shout chorus.\n\nUnder the Influence gets a whole bunch of the details right, and is exceedingly clever, to boot. Again, something like this would have been very easy to botch. Amon Amarth's home field so to speak is melodic death metal, yet they show a wonderful facility with styles not their own on Under the Influence. Not to make it more than what it is, but it's undeniably a fascinating and deft achievement.\n\nFour Stars.\n\nhttp://lahistoriadelamusicarock.blogspot.com/2013/12/year-end-album-reviews-5.html\n",
        "\nThe idea of composing tunes with a style reminiscent of a certain, influential band as a tribute of some kind is not bad at all. Some bands, such as Thulcandra, Entrails, Orchid or Blazon Stone, even manage to build a career by copying the style and overall aesthetics of a renowned band. Like it or not, in greater or lesser degree, some of those bands truly carry the scent and spirit of their primal influence. Some may argue it might be more interesting than just covering the desired band, but of course, that depends on the quality of the resulting compositions. With this little EP, Sweden's most beloved berserkers tried to pay homage to their classic metal influences; four bands, four tunes. Are they as successful as the bands I mentioned before? Well\u2026\n\n\u201cBurning Anvil of Steel\u201d is a Judas Priest tribute, reminiscent of their early 80s stuff, lets say something that could have been found on British Steel or Point of Entry. It's a mid-paced, fist-pumping, hard rock-ish number, and one can easily picture this song with the Metal God singing to it, as it is similar in spirit to \u201cLiving After Midnight\u201d or \u201cYou've Got Another Thing Comin'\u201d. But in his place we've got Johan Hegg's trademark hoarse gruff and it sounds\u2026 funny here. I'd rather listening them composing something more challenging, like the faster, more complex songs found in Defenders of the Faith or Painkiller, which I think are more suitable to Hegg's barbaric vocals, though he attempts a high-pitched scream at the end of the tune. But that's not the case, and this song, while peculiar, is not particularly enticing.\n\n\u201cSatan Rising\u201d it's an obvious Ozzy-era Black Sabbath tribute, with doom-esque heavy riffs, mid to slow tempos, and Johan's pretty good impersonation of the Prince of Darkness himself. This is my favorite track of the EP, it's fun and it's well done. Around the 2:10 minute mark, and eerie melody starts, more similar to the melodic extreme metal found in the Vikings homeland than to anything Sabbath attempted, but at the same time it fits perfectly into the composition. So, while it definitely has the Sabbath sound, the Swedes manage to inject some of their own to it. At the 2:45 mark, the song accelerates a bit, to a faster conclusion not unlike the end of \u201cIron Man\u201d or \u201cLord of this World\u201d.\n\n\u201cSnake Eyes\u201d is a Mot\u00f6rhead track, forceful and speedy, and Johan switches back to this usual gruffly self. The riffs are pretty similar to \u201cIron Fist\u201d and their ilk. This should be fun, but ends up as the least exciting tune of the EP. It\u2019s extremely predictable and lacks personality. And so, finally, we arrive to the AC-DC number, \u201cStand Up to Go Down\u201d. Unsurprisingly, it is another mid-paced, hard rock-ish track in which Johan uses his regular death grunts, so it's not very different from the opening song. But the chorus is amusing and the solo well done, without being extraordinary, so I'd probably rank this as the second best track of the release. \n\nEven though in general it is an amusing listen, I believe there's just not much to give this EP great value. It's not like they're going to play this stuff live. I don't know the story behind this recording, but probably they just did it to relax between takes while recording Deceiver of the Gods, and they decided to release it with the Special Edition of that album. The cover artwork didn't took them too much thinking either, so obviously, not great effort was put into this. However good their idea, I believe if they have took things more seriously, better compositions could have surfaced. But alas, here it is. Now, I'm going to listen to With Oden on Our Side, if you excuse me\u2026\n",
        "\nAmon Amarth are no mysterious band. They may sound mysterious when they're described as five huge and hairy Vikings come from Scandinavia to spread the myths and primitive culture of their icy homeland via mean, cruising death metal; yet, when they're described as Swedes who have found a niche creating mid-paced melodeath with war themes, they lose some of that initial appeal. It's true, Amon Amarth have been putting out the same album for more than 15 years now (10 at the time of this release) and there aren't many surprises left. That said, 'Twilight of the Thunder God' was a clear move on the band's part, shifting from the underground to a prominent position in metal's mainstream by dint of a catchier and more song-oriented formula. The move was a success, though has left the band with a problem - they now have the metal world's attention focused on them and need to deliver something special.\n\nIt's notable that 'Twilight of the Thunder God' has produced the only single of Amon Amarth's career: the title track was released as a precursor to the album and, like many others, it was the first time I heard the band. That song is a joyous surge of riffs and growls that made In Flames look stupid and Soilwork sound heavy. There isn't really a great deal of death metal to speak of beyond Johan Hegg's monstrous vocals (he's deep and furious but the lyrics are completely audible), with a concerted effort to include hooks and memorable moments, even if the chorus (\"Thor, Odin's son, protector of mankind, ride to meet your fate, your destiny awaits / Thor, Hl\u00f3dyn's son, protector of mankind, ride to meet your fate, Ragnar\u00f6k awaits\") contains too much Nordic jargon to be a complete dumbing down of the band's aesthetic. For the most part, that's how the album unfolds, with catchy riffs greatly outnumbering heavy ones and stomping drums taking the lead from blastbeats. There are barely any progressive ideas left, not that Amon Amarth were ever especially complex to begin with, but there's nothing like 'Gods of War Arise' from the preceding 'With Oden on Our Side' album, even if the closing 'Embrace of the Endless Ocean' bears a strong resemblance to 'Prediction of Warfare', with its extended running time and epic storyline. Of the 10 songs on 'Twilight of the Thunder God', only that closing track and 'The Hero' deviate from popular songwriting structure that follows a pattern of verse, chorus, and bridge.\n\nThis conventionality means that Amon Amarth must make distinct and memorable songs, a point on which they largely succeed. Even with a comparatively brutal voice like Hegg's it's possible to sink a few great choruses and his vocal rhythms are always shifting and finding interesting deliveries, though it's more down to the guitarists that the band come out on top. There is at least one riff per song that is instantly recognizable upon listening, bolstering the simple structures and giving strong reference points for repeating parts. 'Varyags of Miklagaard' and 'Tattered Banners and Bloody Flags' both triumph mid-album for exactly this reason, setting out their stalls with infuriatingly catchy riffs that probably will never leave your mind, even if neither of them attempt to inject much heaviness or furious drive into the equation. However, 'No Fear for the Setting Sun', which follows them, redresses the balance with more crusading tremolo riffs and a squealing solo, making you standing up and shout more than nod your head to the groove. The drums are also quite varied, throwing in several sections of riff-breaking percussion that Hegg follows vocally; these are interesting and change the feel of the guitars, roughing up the smooth and slick riffs for a short time. Bass is also audible most of the time, heavying up the sound with a steady low groan.\n\nThe band really do their best to make this formula pay off for the entire album, altering pace frequently and juxtaposing the catchy stomp with the soaring battle melodeath. 'Guardians of Asgaard' is perhaps the most delightfully hooky in its emphasized riffs, even at fairly slow pace, but 'Where Is Your God?' is clearly the compromise, a lightning-paced rager that parallels 'Asator' from the previous album; however, it feels rushed, particularly the vocals in the verse, which barely fit into the space allowed, even if the savage chorus is a highlight. I've now mentioned two songs that have a predecessor on 'With Oden on Our Side' and that's one of the issues with this album. Although the band's sound has distinctly shifted towards a more mainstream direction, the songs here are nothing new and actually follow a similar running order to the earlier release. The more balanced songs kick off the album, showcasing catchy and heavy elements of the band, then the token \"fast song\" follows, with another couple of strong numbers afterwards, leaving the latter half to meander a little and leave the path, before concluding with a more involved epic. There are tricks there to make things seem different, like the cellos in 'Live for the Kill' and the horns in 'Tattered Banners and Bloody Flags', though these moments feel like just that - tricks to try and make the formula fresh. None of the songs are really poor, but nobody expects that from Amon Amarth; the issue here is that none of them can do quite enough to sound massively exciting, unless this is your first listen to the band.\n\nIt seems like Amon Amarth will never make a poor album, yet one has to question whether there is much purpose in them continuing if there are no fresh ideas to progress their sound. On the other hand, they are quite clearly the outstanding band playing this kind of music, so there is little need for them to change anything major besides a few of the smaller puzzle pieces. Perhaps the best that can be said for 'Twilight of the Thunder God' is that it isn't dramatically worse than any of the other Amon Amarth albums, though it certainly doesn't bear the distinction of being the best, as it can't produce the excitement of its older brother or even the grandaddies from the 90s. For the band, the transition to a more accessible style has paid off in full, even if I'm still not sure it made them a better band.\n",
        "\nWith the title track being what is possibly Amon Amarth's most famous song, I expected quite a lot from Twilight of the Thunder God. Unfortunately those expectations aren't met, and there are a few fatal flaws with this record that ultimately mean it doesn't leave much of an impact.\n\nFirst of all, the guitars are less heavy than they were previously. Normally that wouldn't matter to me, because I prefer melodic death metal that is more melodic than death metal, but Amon Amarth just seem incapable of doing anything incredibly complex that would appeal to my ears. It's not like listening to Arch Enemy or Children of Bodom where there are melodic hooks that are placed throughout every song, there are a lot of fairly blank sections that rely solely on the power that's missing here. Aside from that not working, the guitars are more distorted than I would like them to be and the leads tend to get lost under everything else.\n\nOf course, Johan's vocal abilities are as strong as ever here. Not that anyone would expect anything less. I always find his work incredible, and it's no different here. The drumming is also still great, very fast for the most part but never overly so. It's a shame that the guitars ruin the main part of the music, because otherwise the band might have challenged the quality of their last album with this one.\n\nThere's another offence in the form of Varyags of Miklagaard. It is literally a clone of Gods of War Arise, only watered down and basically made less enjoyable. It's sad that the band thought they could get away with that one. Live for the Kill lingers dangerously close at a point in the chorus to stealing from Cry of the Black Birds and again after the solo, but can just about get away with it. Now, we can all appreciate that With Oden on Our Side was a great album, but that doesn't mean that you have to copy all your ideas from that record over onto the next in order for it to be a success too.\n\nThis album might be a good starting point for people that want to get into melodic death metal, but if you're after an outstanding release by Amon Amarth I'd recommend for you to go and listen to With Oden on Our Side from cover to cover. It's far superior to Twilight of the Thunder God in almost every way.\n",
        "\nI've known about Amon Amarth for a while now (who doesn't?), and really I should have reviewed some of their work earlier seeing as I'd enjoyed quite a lot of it. But I'm here now, so let me pass judgement on what is arguably their best album, With Odin on Our Side. If Odin really is on their side then they'll get a good score... Yeah, I think we'll forget that pun ever happened.\n\nAnyway, something worth pointing out: their music is quite simplistic. It doesn't need to be complex, it just sounds good. People will say that it doesn't qualify as death metal (which is partly true as their style is more akin to NWOBHM than pure and simple death metal) and therefore it is just nothingness if it doesn't have any sort of intricate guitar riff to it, but I completely disagree. Think of this album like J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter series: it's not going to win any prizes for being the most amazingly exaggerated work of art out there, but why does it need to be? What's the point in having an incredible idea if nobody's going to give it any notice? Sure, it'll get some hate from the critics, but that's part and parcel of becoming famous. The number of fans will far outweigh the number of haters.\n\nOnto the thing I actually came to do. The sounds coming from the guitars are - as I have just felt the need to point out - nothing seemingly impossible. For the most part they play the same riffs over and over again in the verses, but tend to step up a gear during the chorus and produce something that always seems to be enchanting. Simple yet beautiful melodies come from multiple angles on nearly every track, and usually there's a neat little solo somewhere in the works. Very nice to listen to no matter what your take on the band or the genre happens to be.\n\nAs expected, Johan Hegg's voice remains one of the best in the genre. I'm not sure what it is about it that's quite so awesome, but it just adds an extra dimension to the already great music. Meanwhile in the background the drumming is pretty sensational too, mostly featuring a constant double bass but also other elements that really work in great harmony with the thundering riffs of the verses. The poor bassist is mostly forgotten about, but we'll give him credit too seeing as how the rest of the band is doing so well.\n\nThere are so many good things to take from this record that I can't really choose any particular tracks to recommend to anyone reading this. My advice would be to start from the beginning and listen to the entire thing. It's just brilliant, and although many will find that the verses get too samey I personally never get bored of hearing the stuff that this band produce played over and over and over again. Recommended for anyone that likes metal, whatever type it is that you enjoy.\n",
        "\nMy reactions to this album have been all over the place. When I first listened to it, I really didn\u2019t like it much at all. Then I came back to it sometime later and dug pretty much every song. Now, time has worn on and I have settled into a lukewarm relationship with it. People rave about this album, and I don\u2019t really get it. It falls in a slump right between the decline in energy on The Crusher and aimless Fate of Norns.\n\nIt took me a while to put my finger on the problem, but it became quite obvious: this album ends far too many times. You know how a lot of viking metal albums end with that long, drawn out, epic track? Every song on here feels like one of those. In theory that sounds like it could make for one long, epic album, but it doesn\u2019t. A good album has attention to pacing. There is none to speak of here. With every song mid-to-slow pace, it starts to drone.\n\nThere are multiple moments where I feel like hitting skip. It\u2019s not just the speed, either. Amon Amarth has made numerous mid-tempo songs that sported some interesting instrumentation to carry them. Not so here. With the exception of the opening riff, I can\u2019t remember a single noteworthy guitar part. This is after a few years of listening. It\u2019s a mess of plodding power chords, uninspired drumming, and absent basswork.\n\nThe lyrics and vocals are still strong enough to carry some of these tracks to the end. There is definitely still that spark of the relentless warrior. Production is also clean and balanced. But without the song structure to back it, I\u2019d much rather pop in one of their other albums. If you want the strengths of this record without all of the drawbacks, skip two forward to the near-perfect With Oden on Our Side.\n",
        "\nWhile carving a niche for yourself musically is initially a good thing, over time you become a slave to it. After a decade or more, one must work to keep things fresh. While bands like Vader, Behemoth, and Septicflesh have made comebacks by adding increased symphonic elements and tightening their song-writing, Amon Amarth continue to stick mostly to the original formula. Overall, they still manage to succeed with a mixture of sheer force, a couple fun new hooks, and a little experimentation.\n\nThis is still pretty much your typical AA fare. The majority of the songs are mid-tempo hero anthems. They are enjoyable, but you will likely have a certain sense of having heard this before. Certain riffs harken a little to closely to those of past albums. Rather than seeing the comparison and finding growth and improvement, I found myself thinking how much better they did it before. Honestly, the single, Father of the Wolf, is my least favorite track. The lyrics are laughable, even from viking-metal standards. The music is muddled and unmemorable. Several of the other tracks also suffer from a lack of urgency the vocals used to incite. What once felt more of call to arms now feels like a lukewarm mythology class.\n\nLuckily, there is some ambrosia to be found in this ode to the gods. The title track and As Loke Falls open the album with a pure onslaught of war. The latter has one of the best riffs the band has ever written. It sticks in your head and will leave guitar players scrambling for tabs. Blood Eagle and Coming of the Tide are also among my favorites. There is some dynamic to the song-writing. The slow moments help accent the faster ones. Instruments compliment one another and feel like time was taken to get it just right.\n\nHel also deserves mention for its uniqueness. It is not one of the greatest tracks in my opinion, however the experiment could prove interesting if the ideas are further developed. This is a first to my knowledge of featuring a Dio-esque guest vocalist. The band's typical growls are deepened even more as you're welcomed to the abyss, and the 80's vibe somehow compliments this quite well. Something to watch for in the future anyways.\n\nIn sum, this is still an album I would recommend buying. If this were a new band, I might not be so kind, but Amon Amarth get points for finding some ways to keep things fresh after 9 LPS, and without losing their identity. A difficult feat that deserves respect.\n",
        "\nI remember seeing Amon Amarth live a few years back, and all I remember was the overweight nordic dude behind me bellowing the lyrics. Other than that, the music seemed altogether disappointing. I tried to get into the band again, since everyone says they're the best in viking metal, but it proved to be a losing battle. At the forefront was With Oden On Our Side, which was loudly proclaimed to be their strongest effort, with \"The Cry Of The Blackbirds\" in particular. \n\nWell, are we even listening to the same band? Never before have I heard such a homogenous gaggle of songs; riffs change, drumbeats change, but I can't help but get the impression that Amon Amarth are not drawing from a very large bag of ideas, and that is the main reason why I cannot stand this band anymore. They're not bad, per se', and their performance was definitely powerful, tight, and top notch, and all the chorii and \"mosh pit\" sections are in place, but it doesn't seem to have any lasting impact. Through all the lashings and bludgeonings with their mighty war hammers, there seems to be, for the most part, no sonic damage, and I remain unmoved by their music as a result. \n\nA large part, in issue, is that the tempos used are very similar and interchangeable. A song on this album would not be out of place on either of its surrounding albums, and any riff on this album would not be out of place on any other song, as well. The only thing differentiating the riffs seem to be what key they're in, but as there are only so many keys to put a song in (and I doubt Amarth have much experience with complex chords like m7M9 type chords or sus chords) it becomes stale. The drums gallop, and onward they gallop with a thunder akin to Sleipnir, but do they do anything else but gallop? No. No blastbeats, no nuance, no rhythm even approaching challenging. It seems that rhythmically Amon Amarth are drawing from an equally miniscule idea pool as they are in the songwriting department. Similarly, dynamics are an unknown concept to Amon Amarth, but death metal as a whole is not known for its sense of dynamics, so this is forgivable, although calling Amon Amarth death metal is only true in the loose sense of the word. \n\nWhat Amon Amarth are, despite all labels to the contrary, are generic extreme metal. Take the opening riff of the album. This is not a death metal riff. This is heavy metal riff that would sound lame and dated even in 1985. Despite the steely production, vocals of Johan, and constant double bass, this is nothing but generic heavy metal riffs interspersed with tremolo picked sections. Surface attributes do not a genre make, and after all, Children of Bodom is not death metal or black metal, despite the snarled vocals and steely production, so why should Amon Amarth? Truth be told, this is just a roughly death metal skin grafted on to a dated heavy metal skeleton, and as a result, this remains boring as shit to listen to. I mentioned earlier that all the good aesthetics seem to be in place, like performances and chorii, and that everything is neatly structured and put together, and said that despite all that, this has no lasting impact. Well, I'm changing that. It's precisely BECAUSE all the attributes are so neatly presented that I lose interest. Death metal is supposed to be raw and aggressive, ugly and merciless, and horrific and grotesque. This is pretty. This should actually offend 2 groups of people: fans of death metal, and fans of viking culture, because it dramatically oversimplifies both and attempts to sell them to the scene kids in their clothes they purchased at Hot Topic. \n\nWell count me out. All these riffs were better used by the NWOBHM and proto-power metal bands in the 80's who Amon Amarth stole them from. I gave them a shot, and listened to their supposed \"best album\" from start to finish twice in a row, and see absolutely nothing in them that would motivate me to listen to them again. I gave 45 points because of the flawless production and tight performances, but it's not technical by any stretch of the imagination and the songwriting is somewhere between stale and downright plagiarism. This is one of the most dishonest albums made by one of the most dishonest bands. Avoid, especially since there's better death metal bands, better viking bands, and bands who use these generic heavy metal riffs far better.\n",
        "\nWhile it is impressive how cohesive the band's approach was by the time of it's release, Amon Amarth's debut, Once Sent from the Golden Hall can't hope to match it's direct successor in terms of sheer destructive merits. What honestly can, though? It isn't that any of this material is bad, but the performance is a little more shaky, almost as if this approach wasn't intrinsic to the band yet. The burly rumble of \"The Dragons' Flight Across the Waves\" serves as a passable stylistic precursor to stomping behemoths like \"Masters of War\", but Hegg's diffident inflection drags things back down to earth prematurely. His gravely shouts sound like he is unnaturally stretching his voice to fit the music, which is ironic considering how caustic his modern delivery has become.\n\nStill, even these issues can't keep mid-paced cookers like \"Without Fear\" from busting through the melodic space-time continuum when the band feels like it. Listen to that opening riff, it rips like no other and reminds me of the gargantuan-sounding title track from Versus the World. The song rides out on a variant of the same movement, making this the best song here by far. The virulent intro of \"Friends of the Suncross\" open up to more abuse of the minor key that Amon Amarth is so fond of, earning it my melodic stamp of approval all the same. It doesn't even end there though, as the song erupts into a stomping groove that has potent neck-jerking potential and serves as a decent counterpoint to the blistering opening. \n\nThe band plays with a near-reckless abandon that is unique to Once Sent from the Golden Hall. \"Ride for Vengeance\" is a good example of this, coming off as a more spastic and animated \"A Fury Divine\". It lacks the sophistication of later albums, but is endearing all the same. The sludgy tremolo passages that are a modern Amon Amarth trademark are present here in limited quantity. You can almost hear as the band comes close to the magic formula achieved on later albums, only to kneecap themselves right before the precipice is reached. It infuses the listener with optimism but is at the same time incredibly frustrating.\n\nIt is definitely far from perfect, as both \"Victorious March\" and \"Amon Amarth\" plod on for far too long. They would be much more searing an memorable if they were more compact like the other songs, but even the best tracks here would be space-fillers on The Avenger. The lower production values damage the potential impact of Lopez's drums, but this is all forgivable since this is a debut. Actually, Lopez may be the main reason Once Sent from the Golden Hall is so much faster than it's younger siblings. He has a decent, unique style on the kit that would have forced the band into a much different sonic landscape had he stayed with them. The pieces are all here, but they had yet to fully cement themselves. Interesting from a historical standpoint, but get The Avenger instead.\n",
        "\nRock-solid might seem like a redundant expression regarding Amon Amarth, but the term holds special meaning in The Avenger's case. Being only the group's second full-length release, the cohesion present here is astounding on multiple levels. While these compositions are more expansive and epic than the band's more recent output, that isn't to say there is a lack of murderous compulsion. The stranglehold of the overdriven, murky passages of \"God, His Son and Holy Whore\" drops the listener right into the furnace as the lugubrious inclination of the incendiary death metal surges give way to slicing tremolos that burn like a buzzsaw blade. The guttural bellows that counterpoint the melodic underpinnings of \"Metalwrath\" make the listener feel as if he has been swept up by Hegg for a crash course in gladiatorial combat. The stop-start open note detonations that alternate between the measured surge of S\u00f6derberg near the end of the song help it stand high and mighty over nearly anything the band has released since.\n\n\"Bleed for the Ancient Gods\" is a great opener, featuring a melody during the chorus that reminds me of \"Runes to My Memory\" along with a decent solo section. For some reason Amon Amarth's earlier albums feature more involved, traditional leadwork that was later dropped as the band streamlined their approach. The subtle lack of control present on The Avenger ends up being half of the appeal, as these compositions feature an air of controlled chaos that keeps the listener on his toes. \"The Last with Pagan Blood\" is my favorite here, though. The churning lower-register riffs meld with the potent bass presence, forming a gut-wrenchingly heavy disposition that plods along unwaveringly. So inordinate is it's approach that it very nearly damages the melodic inclination of some of the leads. Leads that have great potential and evoke more of that dark atmosphere that the band so effortlessly injected into these earlier albums. While they may lack the triumphant undertones of \"Gods of War Arise\", they certainly make up for it in zeal and tenacity. The closing moments of \"North Sea Storm\" is a great example of this approach, that lead is just infectious.\n\nThere are naturally more experimental elements as well, like the overly-distorted bass intro to \"Legend of a Banished Man\". Lundstr\u00f6m's officious tone is upfront like on Fate of Norns, but the difference is that the rest of the band shares the spotlight this time around. Hegg also experiments with some half-shout vocal passages that remind me of Turisas and summon a similar anachronistic atmosphere. This is all just icing on the cake at the end of the day, as The Avenger can carry it's weight even without their inclusion.\n\nYou end up wishing it was longer, as seven tracks just aren't enough to rein in the primal delivery espoused by Amon Amarth in The Avenger's case. The elephantine riffs the band has become so famous for are only part of the appeal here, as a sonic balance is achieved that wasn't even present on The Crusher. It is that good.\n",
        "\nThis lacks some of whats to come, but most definitely has a killer instinct all it's own. At it's best The Crusher rivals With Oden on Our Side in pure ruinous abandon, featuring a gritty, lethal guitar tone that was lacking on Versus the World. The guitars come off as less formulaic on the whole, although this may be due to this album's position early in Amon Amarth's catalogue. Even Mikkonen's solos, which are normally an afterthought, are emotive and searing from a technical standpoint. The colossal sonic aesthetics are paired with the final throes of the dark atmosphere the band experimented with on earlier albums, constituting a surprisingly potent approach that radiates energy not unlike the hammer featured on the cover.\n\nWhile \"Bastards of a Lying Breed\" is a functional enough opener, it isn't until \"Masters of War\" that we begin to see flashes of brilliance. This song can be viewed as a more suffocating and relentless \"Death in Fire\", featuring similar percussive patterns and mid-paced inclinations. The simple, descending riff that constitutes the majority of the song hints at future compositional elements while at the same time having it's own unique appeal. The churning, visceral tremolo assault of \"The Sound of Eight Hooves\" makes a strong case for the top spot here, although with spastic barnburners like \"A Fury Divine\" nipping at it's heels it becomes difficult to really pick favorites all the same. \"Annihilation of Hammerfest\" features such a potent build-up and release of tension throughout it's first half, you almost lose track of what album you are actually listening to. \n\nHegg experiments a bit more with his Teutonic inflection here, diffusing primal roars with raspy croaks not unlike early Kalmah. His approach naturally falls in line with Versus the World more than anything, which isn't necessarily unwelcome. The riffs steal the spotlight in such an oppressive manner that the vocals become more of an afterthought than ever. Check out the intro of \"A Fury Divine\", which features multiple false-starts that give way into pulverizing tremolo surges that churn your insides like butter. The endless sea of thick, voluminous distortion permeates the air like the pyre of a scorched village. It isn't that Amon Amarth's later approach would lack this compressive lack of inhibition, but it comes off as if the band is having a lot more fun on The Crusher all the same.\n\nThis still can't dethrone With Oden on Our Side, but it comes dangerously close at times. None of these tracks are throwaways, which is something I can't say for any other album by these Swedes. Yes, some of the middle of the album runs together, but this is a risk necessitated by the deliberate approach Amon Amarth are so lauded/reviled for today. Somehow this one gets passed over more often than not, which is a damn shame. Don't let The Crusher fall through Ginnungagap without giving it a fair shake.\n",
        "\nFate of Norns exists as the biggest misstep the Norsemen ever committed to disc. How could they fall so far after the ripping, methodical Versus the World? The songwriting is similar, but comes off as anemic and toothless all the same. The production is also a hot mess this time around, making even Twilight of the Thunder God sound colossal in comparison. As Andersson's plastic drums pitter-patter away alongside Hegg's inert ramblings, you just end up wishing the whole band would jump off their ship and sacrifice themselves to the fishes.\n\nTo address the few positives right away, Lundstr\u00f6m's popping, clangy bass presence is a cool aesthetic decision on the band's part. It adds a decent counterpoint to some of the more enterprising riff passages. \"Arson\" features some solid moments driven by the groove of the bass alone, adding a potent atmosphere to the more somber melodies the guitars are churning out. Sadly, few listeners will probably ever make it that far into the album. \"An Ancient Sign of Coming Storm\" comes off as a potent opener at first blush, but the potential lasts for exactly twenty seconds as Hegg's first raspy croak rushes through your speakers and neuters the inertia. What is going on with the vocals here? Hegg almost comes off as a black metal vocalist on a bad day, as he completely fails to evoke the primal intonations he is traditionally lauded for. Even while Fate of Norns is mercifully short, it still manages to overstay it's welcome several times over.\n\nIf there is one unique aspect on Fate of Norns from a songwriting standpoint, it is it's depressive atmosphere. I can't tell if it is a side effect of the band's indolent performance or a stylistic decision. Regardless, \"Where Death Seems to Dwell\" comes off as especially melancholic and depressive, along with the aforementioned \"Arson\". It doesn't necessarily play to Amon Amarth's strengths, but it is an interesting sonic attribute that only seems to be prominent on this album. The normally virulent, macerating guitar tone is so buried that the bass actually begins to take the reins from it. It isn't that the guitars sound any different than on Versus the World, they just lack presence in the mix, neutering the band's Teutonic aesthetics just when it seems like they might rise from mediocrity. \n\nThe only song that is passable on the whole (and this is even stretching it) is \"The Pursuit of Vikings\", which has a decent bouncy inclination to it's procession. It also features some more traditionally churning tremolo passages along with stop-start riffing patterns that have some neck-jerking potential. Even this requires you to overlook the ghastly sounding drums. Andersson's kit is completely gutted, as evident by the typewriter-esque sound he achieves during the tepid intro of \"Valkyries Ride\".\n\nFate of Norns stinks more than the piles of rotting bodies normally accrued after a traditional Amon Amarth album is released. Burn it just like you'd burn them and save us all the sight of it.\n",
        "\nAs our plundering friends in Amon Amarth probably know all too well by now: the double-edged broadsword swings quite widely. This much was evident during the last decade as the band wafted between good efforts: Versus the World, great efforts: With Oden on Our Side, and faceless patience-testers: Twilight of the Thunder God. While the group gained a decent enough foothold with the massive-sounding Surtur Rising, I hate to be the one to admit that they are beginning to let the spectres of past adversaries-slain distract and obfuscate their material again.\n\nFrom a sonic standpoint, this falls in line with most of what we have come to expect from Amon Amarth. The guitar tone is massive and crunchy, heading the charge as the band continues to experiment with more traditional heavy metal aesthetics like during the main riff of \"Hel\". That's not to say there is a dearth of speed though, as \"Father of the Wolf\" trudges along at a pretty efficient tempo as it hails back to the memorable \"Valhall Awaits Me\". The guitars' tone sounds acerbic and cavernous, with meaty notes ringing out over the deliberate inclination of Andersson's percussive assault. The drums sound a bit too clicky and mechanical for my taste, but the performance is naturally quite solid; even if it lacks the reverberating disposition present on Surtur Rising.\n\nThe biggest single issue manifests itself from a melodic standpoint. Amon Amarth's trademark heaviness is accounted for, but the triumphant melodies most definitely aren't. The title track makes false promises in this regard, as it opens with a solid lead but quickly discards it, never to revisit it's melodic appeal again. This does immeasurable damage to Deceiver of the Gods' lasting power, as the measured leadwork is what made former epics like \"For Victory or Death\" so potent and memorable. \"Shape Shifter\" tries to summon a decent, groovy atmosphere but it's stock melodies put more pressure on the riffs than they can handle. The band tries to add variety, like the inclusion of a guest vocalist during the otherwise potent \"Hel\", but it comes off as a distraction more than anything in this case. \n\nAt first blush this doesn't come off as offensive as Twilight of the Thunder God due to the still-crushing production, but the tepid compositions seal it's fate as yet another disappointment. It isn't that anything here on Deceiver of the Gods is abashedly repulsive, but it reeks of a phoned-in performance and rushjob all the same. \"Father of the Wolf\" is decent, grooving death metal. The requisite closer \"Warriors of the North\" also becomes more animated during it's second half, but this all just makes you wish that the band would take more time and gather their warriors for a more structured, honed assault on the senses. Anything is better than the lukewarm genre-posturing present here.\n",
        "\nThis is where Amon Amarth's well-worn formula begins to show thin points at the seams. Having to follow up the massive With Oden on Our Side doesn't help Twilight of the Thunder God's case as well. S\u00f6derberg and Mikkonen's delivery is similar in approach, but they can't help but rehash themselves if the material is spread this thinly. Take \"Guardians of Asgaard\" for example, which opens with a churning, virulent surge only to devolve into ephemeral stacatto-esque riffs that embody everything stagnant regarding Amon Amarth's modern approach. The chorus tries to salvage the song, but it is too little too late. The biggest offender is without a doubt \"Varyags of Miklagaard\", which comes off as nothing more than a less visceral twin to \"Gods of War Arise\". The verses are nearly identical.\n\nThe guitars' burly, subsonic delivery is befitting of the primal subject matter, but Andersson's kit lacks the snaring appeal it had on the previous album. This damages the normally-cohesive rhythm backbone, which was the driving force behind classics like \"Runes to My Memory\". Keen ears can still discern the potential lurking somewhere in the background, as it occasionally surfaces during songs like the more traditional romp, \"The Hero\". The band experiments with some interesting elements, like the fluttering gallop during sections of \"Tattered Banners and Bloody Flags\", but it comes off as an insincere attempt at adding variety; proving that the band was aware of the stagnation that was beginning to set in. Some of these experiments work, such as the more traditional heavy/power metal riffs during \"Live for the Kill\". This one wouldn't sound out of place on a modern Grave Digger album like Rheingold, so it comes off as a winner to my ears.\n\nOthers like \"Free Will Sacrifice\" try to play up the more colossal aesthetics present on Versus the World, but are let down by the uneven production. The guitars sound strangely compressed and low in the mix, even if the performance falls in line with most of Amon Amarth's more superior efforts. The one sonic attribute that edges out With Oden on Our Side is regarding Hegg's vocals. He digs into even more sepulchral levels of primal rage, delivering his most memorable vocal assault to date. The few standouts include the title track and \"Where Is Your God?\", which wouldn't sound too out of place on the previous opus, but far too little sticks.\n\nThis is a hard one to keep around at the end of the day. I feel like I have to lower my standards to an uncomfortable threshold in order to enjoy any of Twilight of the Thunder God. Yes, it is methodical and consistent in it's delivery, but what it delivers falls very short.\n",
        "\nMan, does this blow Twilight of the Thunder God out of the water or what? Surtur Rising sounds decidedly less overproduced and compressed, allowing the individual performances to shine as they eventually converge into a cohesive whole. The dense, well-balanced distortion that helped rise With Oden on Our Side to greatness is present here as well, reigniting the torches of impetuosity that had begun to dim as the band began to lose the plot.\n\nWhile it still falls short of Amon Amarth's 2006 opus, Surtur Rising can rest it's hat on the fact that it can go toe-to-toe with other impressive records like Versus the World. In fact, the songwriting approach here is quite similar to that album, only minus the proclivity for slower numbers and the inclusion of atmospheric keyboards. There are moments of controlled speed that reach a velocity the band rarely flirts with, like during the majority of \"Destroyer of the Universe\". This is refreshing and adds a new dimension to the band's approach, which is traditionally deprived of the experimental attributes it needs to function on it's highest level. The whole ordeal exudes rancor, as the band moves from traditional cookers like \"Slaves of Fear\" to grooving behemoths like \"Wrath of the Norsemen\". While the standard is undoubtedly high, \"For Victory or Death\" stands high and mighty above all. Check out the infectious main melody, which serves as a great counterpoint to the animated verses and Andersson's fill-happy patterns.\n\nSpeaking of the drums, they have finally regained some of their foothold here, lending a bone-rumbling aesthetic to the rhythm section. Andersson's kit is mixed quite well, as the lower toms rumble with a near-subsonic vivacity equal to the pounding war drums they so eagerly attempt to replicate. The mechanisms of the kit find themselves in lockstep with the surging riffs during many of these songs, summoning a parallel to Versus the World's more determined passages. Regardless, in typical Amon Amarth fashion, even the reinvigorated procedure fails to inspire for the entire duration. \"A Beast Am I\" and the opener \"War of the Gods\" fail to make much of an impact, even if only by virtue of the quality compositions elsewhere on Surtur Rising. In isolated environs the album falls slightly short, especially if the listener isn't aware of the pedestrian effort that preceded it. It really shouldn't matter, however, as Surtur Rising has the merits to stand on it's own two feet all the same.\n\nIn hindsight, this embodies yet another stepping stone in the back-and-forth pattern Amon Amarth keeps finding themselves entrenched in. Just like the Suebian brutes they so faithfully pay homage to, Amon Amarth will continue to push the envelope of brutality and excess; for better or worse.\n",
        "\nTake all of the best attributes present on Versus the World, up the ante regarding the production values, and something akin to With Oden on Our Side should begin to take form. The muddy, overdriven aesthetics present on Fate of Norns served it moderately well, but the band wisely discarded that approach in favor of a more straightforward, modern sheen here. The moderated, singeing zest of \"Valhall Awaits Me\", the subsonic distortion achieved during the title track, the compressive aesthetics of \"Runes to my Memory\"; these are all among Amon Amarth's best compositions to date.\n\nEven the slower, more deliberate songs - which are usually more patience-testing than they need to be - come off as novel here. Take the closer \"Prediction of Warfare\", for example. Once the wistful opening melody (which reminds me of the forest theme from Chrono Trigger of all things) wraps up, the song detonates into a cacophony of percussive riffs and ascending powerchords. It isn't that the band comes off as any more primal in their delivery, the compositions are simply more succinct and take advantage of the massive sounding aesthetics. The one-two punch of \"Gods of War Arise\" and the title track is a hard act to follow, both rivaling the namesake piece from Versus the World in monolithic riff delivery.\n\nUpping the ante regarding the production was a wise choice, as it breathes new life into the band's otherwise stagnated approach. Andersson's kit undoubtedly benefits the most from this. His snare and cymbals sound amazing, most evident during the percussive swells that open the title track. The splash cymbal in particular cuts through the distortion and adds a unique counterpoint to the normally straightforward drum approach. The minor key that the band is always fluttering around in is utilized to it's full potential during \"Cry of the Black Birds\", which must be the most memorable song here from a melodic standpoint. The atmosphere evoked is tense and foreboding, but at the same time triumphant. Some old habits die hard, such as the proclivity to settle into pedestrian, staccato riffing patterns like during the verses of \"Runes to my Memory\". Even so, the melodic chorus swings the affairs back into a more positive direction, saving the track from mediocrity.\n\nThe same sadly doesn't occur during \"Under the Northern Star\", which falls victim to many of the same pitfalls present on Fate of Norns, coming off as something of an afterthought in the procession. I can also go either way regarding \"Hermod's Ride to Hel - Loke's Treachery Part I\", the galloping verses have some bite to them, but the main melody lacks the appeal of most of the other songs here. The riffs are so massive that they finally befit the subject matter being espoused by frontman Hegg. His rants come off as a little less trite than usual, which is refreshing. Many of these songs should run together as they all feature a similar approach and atmosphere as per most modern Amon Amarth, but the strength of the compositions keep this from happening in With Oden on Our Side's case. A high water mark for the band that has yet to be challenged.\n",
        "\nWhile most modern Amon Amarth albums can be criminally boring, there are two major exceptions to this rule: With Oden on Our Side and Versus the World. By virtue of some sort of balancing act that later fell short, the mordant, gut-wrenching tremolo passages that define the band's riff assault are clearly at their most potent and venomous here. It isn't even that more recent albums like Deceiver of the Gods are far removed from this approach, but the band has bled the formula dry all the same.\n\nAt any rate, much of Versus the World exhibits lasting power and strong compositions that play to Amon Amarth's biggest strength: murky death metal passages backed by Andersson's measured percussive surge. The drumming is what raises some of these songs to greatness, such as \"Death in Fire\". No, the performance isn't technically impressive, but Andersson proves that less can sometimes be more if the songwriting can back it up. Amon Amarth generally wafts between two tempos, both being rather slow and deliberate in their approach. \"Where Silent Gods Stand Guard\" and \"Across the Rainbow Bridge\" embody the slower end of the spectrum here, generally being more melancholic from a melodic standpoint. On the faster side of things, you have the stomping, relentless abandon of \"Bloodshed\" and the title track, which both end up being highlights. The title track is by far the most impressive song here, featuring an astronomically massive main riff and surging tremolo sections that counterpoint the main melody and leave destruction in their wake. In fact, the more somber-sounding chorus serves as the only real break from it's otherwise relentless assault. Don't miss that one.\n\nSome of the slower tracks tend to blur together, as there are more of them then there really needs to be. \"Across the Rainbow Bridge\" is more melodic and features some solid escalating riffs, so it gets a pass. Alternatively, \"Where Silent Gods Stand Guard\" kind of wallows around in it's own melodrama, never really accumulating into the atmospheric ode to war that it wants to be. The closer \"...and Soon the World Will Cease to Be\" appears to be yet another slower number at first blush, but actually ascends into a solid mid-paced affair that rivals the title track regarding monolithic riff-delivery. The guitars have an abrasive, overdriven sound that while lacking the low-end roar present on With Oden on Our Side, still carry the day fairly well. In fact, the muddy nature of the guitars might actually add to part of Versus the World's sonic appeal, as it adds an air of gritty intemperance to the whole affair.\n\nVariety is still a problem, but the searingly memorable title track nearly makes up for all of these follies on its own. Amon Amarth reminds me of modern Grave Digger in that they can be consistent nearly to a fault. Part of this is due to Hegg's unwavering vocal approach. His guttural roars are unique in that you can actually understand most of his sepulchral rants instead of having to scan the lyric sheet. Regardless, the lyrics have always been an afterthought and always come off as trite and generic to my ears. Seriously, how many times can the band shoehorn in the phrase \"They/I will die\", or some variant of it? I consider Versus the World the first Amon Amarth album that finally realized the band's potential from a commercial standpoint. It is more accessible and less dissonant than their oft-disregarded early works, giving it a wider appeal that still holds up today.\n",
        "\nI was excited to hear that Amon Amarth had written songs in the styles of 4 of their favorite bands but was a bit worried that the band would be unable to write in other bands' styles well enough and that this EP would suck. My fears proved to be unfounded. Under the Influence is a fantastic tribute to the bands Judas Priest, Black Sabbath, Motorhead, and AC/DC.\n\nBurning Anvil of Steel: I've never been a huge fan of Judas Priest, but I like them enough for me to recognize that Amon Amarth had managed to write a song that they would be proud of. The slightly cheesy fantasy lyrics matched perfectly with the music, making this an excellent tribute to one of the pioneers of heavy metal. Johan's usual bear growl is tempered to make it try to fit earlier heavy metal and while it shouldn't work, it does.\n\nSatan Rising: I don't know how they did it, but this song sounds almost exactly like early Black Sabbath. Even the vocals. When I first heard this my mind was blown. I had to stop and listen closer to make sure that it wasn't really Ozzy on vocals. Every riff sounded like it could have come from Tony Iommi. The only real differences were that this was a song written for two guitars and the drums didn't quite sound like Bill Ward. This song could be placed on Paranoid and fit in perfectly.\n\nSnake Eyes: Once again I don't listen to much Motorhead, but lyrically this is very similar to what I have heard. The riffs and drums fit in well with what I've heard from Motorhead as well. Johan altered his guttural roar again to fit this style of hard drinkin' heavy metal and once again it works well.\n\nStand Up To Go Down: This is perhaps my favorite of the songs on this EP. Johan didn't seem to try to match Brian Johnson or Bon Scott, instead he kept his usual roar toned down to fit the music. Other than the vocals this song could have been written by AC/DC. The guitar riffs fit, the drums are rock and roll, the lyrics fit the late 70s and early 80s incredibly well. There are a few points where Amon Amarth doesn't quite match AC/DC's style but this is a very good song.\n",
        "\nOriginally written for The Metal Review.\n\nThe melodic death metal giants, Amon Amarth are back in a big way with the release of their 9th studio full-length album, Deceiver of the Gods. This album is released after a two year break following Surtur Rising from 2011. Deceiver of the Gods adds some substantial girth to an already bolstering repertua of powerful tracks that have earned them legions of fans all across the globe. To be nine records deep into a career and still be gaining popularity is a feat not often seen in the music industry in general, much less in the world of metal. Now with such a reputation comes the responsibility to deliver new, harder, and better material with each coming record which is an infinite times easier said than done. Following the success of records like Surtur Rising and Twilight of the Thunder God would be a daunting task to say the least. We are all familiar with bands that have not been able to cope with that sheer amount of pressure resulting in such atrocities like the ever infamous St.Anger or Illud Divinum Insanus. The gentlemen of Amon Amarth however, handled the pressure like the professionals they really are, delivering a very solid record. Easily one of the better records to be released this year, it should go over well with fans. The single and title track off the record, \u201cDeceiver of the Gods\u201d had seen a very strong positive response which bodes well for the record as a whole. At the current point in time, they are working on a music video for the song \u201cFather of the Wolf\u201d and based on the trailer recently released, in true Amon Amarth form, it looks to be full of blood, vikings killing things, and epic shots of long flowing hair being whipped around in various stages of headbanging and windmilling. \n\nDeceiver of the Gods opens with its title track, which is an odd and rather boring place for it, but that\u2019s irrelevant. The title track is a strong way to start of the record, very aggressive with memorable hooks to suck in the listener. The second track, \u201cAs Loke Falls\u201d, one of my favorites off the record, starts off with a slower, almost atmospheric guitar line over pounding drums, the classic suspenseful build up to the song. The drums give way to a simple tapping riff played out on its own in an effort to pique curiosity before slamming you in the face with a full blast of thundering drums and powerful guitars. It might just be me, but this build up would be a perfect segway to an adrenaline fueled, raging Wall of Death. The song doesn\u2019t relent at all, barraging the listener with aggressive tremolo picking and brutal vocals until the very end where you\u2019re left with a beautiful outro of epic guitar harmonizations. \n\nWorking deeper into the record, \u201cUnder Siege\u201d is a great example of the signature sound Amon Amarth is known to deliver. A brilliant mix of melodic grooves and thundering gallups, all to be tied together in the end in a glorious fashion. The bass is left out on its own, rolling into a punchy tapping riff that sits deep in your skull only to be joined by heart-wrenching melodies and screams that wouldn\u2019t be out of place in a dramatic battle cry from days past. I did get a kick out of hearing the intro of \u201cBlood Eagle\u201d which sounded like a man taking an axe to the chest a few times after which his ribcage presumably was crushed, judging by the wonderful sound effects. \n\nThroughout this record, I\u2019m met with this nagging feeling of deja-vu. After 19 years of writing and performing music, one would anticipate a little more variety and an increase in complexity. Understandably, some of the riffs run dry and feel a bit regurgitated, lacking that driving inspirational feeling that culminated so well on Surtur Rising, however I don\u2019t see this as a big of an issue as its already being made out to be. To me, Amon Amarth has carved out their own niche in the same way bands like Cannibal Corpse have. These bands have the market cornered and have created their own signature sound that they\u2019ve stuck with for better or worse. In a sense, they\u2019ve established who they are and what they do and that\u2019s what they put on the records, their latest interpretation of their signature style. While this may lead to some recycling of riffs and themes, bands like Amon Amarth are generally the most consistent in producing solid records that often don\u2019t disappoint, but aren\u2019t nearly as impressive. While fans might not lose their minds over this latest record, it is definitely a solid record nonetheless and has already broken into the top of the charts all over the world. Just be grateful they didn\u2019t pull a Morbid Angel and take a hard right turn off the edge of rationality into the abyss that is \u201ctoo extreme\u201d. For fans of any kind of metal, I can safely recommend this album, knowing it will appeal to many a metalhead the world over.\n",
        "\nAmon Amarth have been on a face ripping spree for years now, and they\u2019ve yet to misstep since the incredible With Oden On Our Side. Their ninth album Deceiver Of The Gods is no different, proving Amon Amarth to again be the complete masters of their craft. Whilst a lot of people are going to proclaim this as more of the same (never a bad thing with these guys), I would say that there are a few elements added to the melting pot which help keep this from being Surtur Rising MK II or Twilight Of The Thunder God MK II. \n\nFrom the get go I\u2019d say one of the main factors which helps differ this release are the glossy, expertly articulated riffs, which are without a doubt the most refined I\u2019ve heard Amon Amarth sound in this department. I feel this is what they\u2019ve been building up to since at least Thunder God, with the melodic, Iron Maiden style elements really becoming more apparent in their sound. I\u2019d also say the lead guitars \u2013 which have, and will likely always be relatively minimalistic \u2013 sound their finest here. Another interesting element, which I think will likely remain personal to Deceiver Of The Gods is Messiah Marcolin\u2019s guest vocal slot on \u201cHel\u201d. His vocals are really well integrated alongside Johan Hegg\u2019s growls, definitely breaking some new ground for the band with some excellent middle eastern vibes largely brought to the table via Messiah\u2019s vocals.\n\nOn the subject of vocals, I have to say Johan Hegg sounds without a doubt the finest he ever has. His growls are crisp, perfectly decipherable and sound flat-out great. As for the rest of the band, well this is Amon Amarth and at this point in their career it\u2019s clear they\u2019re masters of their craft. All of the songs bring something to the table, from rip-roaring smokers like \u201cComing Of The Tide\u201d and \u201cBlood Eagle\u201d with it\u2019s Slayer style swagger to cracking melodic numbers like \u201cAs Loke Falls\u201d all a way to the epic closer \u201cWarriors Of The North\u201d which nigh on steals the show right at the end. \n\nFor this being their ninth full-length I\u2019d say Amon Amarth sound exactly where they want to be in their career. There are enough newer elements on Deceiver Of The Gods to keep this from being a mere rehash of x album, and the performances are as hungry and potent as they have ever been. Certainly one of the better albums I\u2019ve heard this year, I can\u2019t think of any reason why you shouldn\u2019t pick this up.\n",
        "\nFor the past several years now, Amon Amarth has been releasing stylistically consistent melodic death albums. Deceiver of the Gods is no different. If you are even remotely familiar with the band\u2019s last two efforts, you will find this latest release quite enjoyable. Yet again, lyrics expound the wondrous feats and violent brutality of Norse mythology while instruments bombard the ears with catchy riffs and fast paced songs. Surprisingly, after several albums of pretty much the same formula, it still works. \n\nThe songs here follow what is fast becoming the Amon Amarth formula and this is not a bad thing at all. This time around, tracks like \u201cBlood Eagle\u201d and \u201cShapeshifter\u201d have a strong, relentless thrash vibe and are riddled with tremolo picking goodness. Other songs resound with NWOBHM riffs and still others have the staple guitar melodies and harmonies that have been with the band through many albums, particularly Surtur Rising and Twilight of the Thunder God. One track, \u201cHel,\u201d features Messiah Marcolin, formerly of Candlemass. This song is slower than the rest of the album but fits Marcolin\u2019s vocals perfectly. While the overall production is great here, things sometimes sound mechanical. I appreciate that while Amon Amarth\u2019s drumming is pretty cymbal intense; the mixing prevents it from overshadowing the meaty riffs and catchy harmonies. This album also feels bassier than previous efforts.\n\nThroughout the album, there is a very consistent pace and the songs change little in tempo. With frequent listens, songs blur together and it isn\u2019t until you\u2019re hit with a catchy hook or a guitar lead that you realize, oh, this is indeed a new song. One would think that, for an album dealing with complex mythological stories and cataclysmic events, you would find more variation between and within the songs. Alas, this is not so, and I feel it is the primary reason other reviewers seem to find the album a bit stale and lacking. And this is a big contrast to the band\u2019s previous two albums which had wide variations in style and pace, so it\u2019s easy to see why the less hardcore fans will be disappointed.\n\nDespite this lack of variety, Deceiver of the Gods is a solid album with strong riffs, guitar harmonies emblematic of the band\u2019s staple image, and mid to up-tempo songs brimming with aggression, powerful vocals, and captivating lyrical content. But let\u2019s face it \u2013 who is expecting variety from Amon Amarth after a decade plus? This band is consistent and consistently good. Some might find it plodding, but if you\u2019re a fan, you\u2019ll raise your mead and bang your head.\n",
        "\nAggression is rampant here, alongside riffs that well accompany the vocals. Don't expect exceptionally fast tempo releases to spew out of your speakers, just pure awesome melodic death. I've never been a huge fan of this band, though I did think to myself \"why the hell not try this new release?\" It turned out for the better because they fit well within the melodic death genre, which is one of my favorite genres of metal. I was expecting to hear an album more brutal than this, but I was satisfied hearing this entire album. The melodies, production, vocals, atmosphere, etc. really blew the rest of the hair that I have left back.\n\nThere was a combination of deep throat which went into a transition to high end screaming, especially during the chorus bits. Everything seemed to fit really well in this recording. I'm motivated now to hear more of their material-this is for the fact that I've gained respect back for the band. Some really great melodies on here that remind me of a lot of older Arch Enemy, how the Amotts would have one guitar playing heavy rhythms alongside Michael's melodies in the lead department. That's the best way that I can describe this album's musicianship. Rhythm over lead riffs that simply dominate.\n\nThe emotion was really there-hatred, brutality, darkness, destruction that was all so ready laden destruction of melodic death annihilation. Definitely a great original release for this year, which has been a lot of disappointing outputs already in the metal scene, however, I give this one a \"B\" rating obviously because it is really appealing. Some riffs that occur here really strike home in your memory banks and slaughter the soul! A gripping onslaught of heavy, thick chord progressions with melodies that go well along with everything else that was orchestrated during this entire album.\n\nOnly some of the music didn't strike home for me otherwise I'd give it a higher rating. The production sound was well done and mixing definitely held true for this one, I especially think that there was some Hypocrisy melodic riffing going on here, at least from what I've heard of Hypocrisy's newer material. But still since they're in the same genre, the influences are endless. The vocals just own and I like how there were fluctuations in that department. The biggest portion that deserves recognition was the bloody damn well music. At times I felt some boredom though, however, that would only come about because of the mood that the setting is in.\n\nDo yourself a favor and if you're a melodic death metal follower, YouTube some songs off of here to form your own opinion. I've stated mine and this release isn't a failure, it's a triumph. I was appalled to not hear more about this release by other metal friends of mine. Everything fit together and the music is the biggest reason for the grade that I gave it. Amazing riffing and aggression that's heard on this entire domination of metal. Remember, not all metal is created equal, which is a given, but give yourself a break and try to follow my words here not as empty ones, but sheerly a voice of reason when it comes to evaluating this output. Get it, it won't disappoint!\n",
        "\nWhen we talk about Amon Amarth we are making a reference to one of, if not the greatest, melodic death metal bands nowadays. Those who completely love the sound of the band don't complain a lot about the sound that has been kept the same over the last years, but most of the people said they needed a small change, at least some new sounds, some new guitar riffs, or some new ideas. Of course, they also needed to keep their unique style that made them who they are today, but they couldn't live in the shadow of that glorious recent past. At the right time, Amon Amarth changed the producer from Jens Bogren (who produced three great albums, we must admit) to Andy Sneap, and even though the changes are not very deep, \"Deceiver of the Gods\" gives us a fresh air from Amon Amarth, a fresh air that was needed.\n\nIn the beginning of the album we can listen to a great opening guitar riff that kind of makes us think about what this album can bring to us. Well, we have some things that have been kept the same or that at least remind us of the most recent albums of Amon Amarth, but let's talk about these 'typical things': the warm duels between amazing guitar solos and fast drums, the lyrics, and, of course, almighty Johan's growls. But the thing that really makes me go back in the past is the song \"We Shall Destroy\". The rhythm reminds me of one of the best songs Amon Amarth has ever made, \"Death In Fire\". I believe Amon Amarth did well when they made this song, for \"Death in Fire\" is considered by lots of fans their greatest and most well-written songs ever.\n\nThose small changes that exist in this new album can be confirmed in some songs like \"As Loke Falls\" with amazing work in the beginning of the song or \"Father of the Wolf\", that is probably one of the heaviest songs the band has ever made. The music in \"Warriors of the North\" is the perfect ending for this album, with the great work of the guitars all over the song, but we are already accustomed to great music in the end of each Amon Amarth album, just like \"Embrace of the Endless Ocean\", \"Doom Over Dead Man\", and \"Prediction of Warfare\" (just referring to the most recent albums). \n\nWe also have time for a few surprises, like the end of \"Under Siege\", with good bass work and a smooth sound in the very end of the song. I have always been waiting for Amon Amarth to do something as great and as melodic as this \"Under Siege\" finale and I am glad they realized that it would fit perfectly in their music. The guest singer for this album is Messiah Marcolin, much different from LG Petrov who had the same role in \"Twilight of the Thunder God\", in the song \"Guardians of Asgaard\". In \"DOTG\", the former singer of doom metal band Candlemass creates an interesting contrast with Johan Hegg, for Messiah's clean vocals are much different from Johan's growls. The song \"Hel\" becomes interesting because of that. That sick beginning of the song \"Blood Eagle\" makes me think about the wars all the Vikings have fought, which is exactly what Amon Amarth like to write about.\n\nIn the end, this is an album much more focused on the melodies than its ancestor \"Surtur Rising\", but is much more loose. This album is made not to disappoint the fans, but the opinions I've heard are sometimes too different. However, this album has potential to be in the Top 20 metal albums of the year. They really have strength from the gods that makes them head out to sea with no fear and march to destiny, with no fear or remorse for death or victory.\n",
        "\nWhen it comes to metal, there\u2019s a large variety of ways a band can find their sound. Some start off with an obvious influence and then work their way into their own identity, sometimes sounding surprisingly different from where they end. Then, there are some who manage to assume an identity decently soon, and then keep that same sound forever. And to a lot of metal fans, in theory, the constant cloning direction is generally not a pro (albeit sales and execution speak otherwise most of the time), as there are a lot of bands that will only play their style with limited variance, and the predictability of their music creates stagnation in the interest amongst their fans. But then you have bands like Amon Amarth, who despite more or less playing the same Viking-themed melodic death metal for the past nineteen years (Holy shit, 19 years already!?!?!), have managed to stay irritatingly consistent in not only style, but quality as well (blowing us away as recently as 2011). This is a band that a lot of metal heads have been waiting to see fail, not out of any particular spite, but just out of the expectation that goes up, must come down.\n\nOkay, so I guess I\u2019ll answer this question quickly with a straight-forward: Nyep. A combination of no and yep. The riffing is still definitely pure Amon Amarth; laden with their bouncing, low-end heavy melodic death metal riffs equipped with melancholic or epic duel-lead guitar harmonization\u2019s, playing Viking-esque melodies over thunderous, war-like drumming. There are still marching ballads and a brutal, beautifully coherent Viking-growl performance from Johan Hegg. Unfortunately, however, none of the songs particularly stand out. There are songs on Deceiver of the Gods where I can hear where the song is attempting a hook/chorus, but so often they just slide into it so seamlessly with little care for flair and UMPH!, that there\u2019s little power and no emotion, or any draw, to the bit. And really that\u2019s the problem with this record, its musical habits and approach is just so homogeneous. It\u2019s never really too fast and never really slow, just kind a generally mid-paced as it either chugs or marches along. I think what made the last record, Surtur Rising, so surprisingly good was that they really went all over the place in style and pace; there were songs that hinted at almost pure death metal, like the early records, while a few took the catchy, chorus-heavy, power metal route hinted on Twilight Of The Thunder God while keeping the powerful balladry and passion of With Oden On Our Side. That gave the record huge variety and broke up the seams of the songs nicely, so not only could you tell when you we\u2019re listening to a new song, it also held an engaging, diverse emotional narrative \u2013 like any good story or continuous piece of art should. On here, the approach\u2019s always come off as so passionless, so it\u2019s hard to get a boost of energy from any of the songs.\n\nAs I mentioned before, the band did a really good job at mixing all their previous \u201csounds\u201d together on the 2011 release, and I think they did attempt that again this time. The problem here though, however, was the whole \u201clack of power\u201d habit they have here, so instead of songs sounding like their either Death or Power-based, there all somewhat watered down, and considering power and death\u2019s common lineage, the result ends up being something more along the lines of bouncy, melodic half-thrash, which is a sound popular metal drove into the ground about 8 years ago, and to me and a lot of metal fans, has little appeal anymore. The album starts off at about its fastest with a vikingy-semi thrasher, and that\u2019s about the most violent this record gets. I suppose the things that do somewhat save this record for me, however, are the duel leads, which they still manage to do well, albeit still in sparing amount. They tended to save their best tremolo-picked rhythm riffs for these parts as well, so if you are to mention when the members of Amon Amarth did their best here, it\u2019s probably going to be isolated to those specific moments as well. The only other highlight on this record would be on the track Hel, which features former Candlemass vocalist, Messiah Marcolin. The song definitely takes a more Candlemass-ian tone as well, adopting the ominous, witchcraft-like persona as well, which they do by adding darker, chugged riffs which are eventually lead by eastern-inspired keyboard melodies and Messiah\u2019s trademark, haunting-opera-howl style.\n\nIn the end, for an album based around Ragnar\u00f6k: the destruction and rebirth of man, the gods and the world, it\u2019s pretty uninspired. I would think this would be an album where one would turn the extremity and energy to the max, not plod along like you\u2019re on a jog. Hell, even if they\u2019d just done something slowed down but different, and used Messiah\u2019s guest as a way to complement something more along the lines of epic Doom metal would have made more sense for the amount of energy they used, and it could have worked stylistically since it\u2019s a pretty bleak, but monolithic event. So while on a superficial level, everything is as normal for Amon Amarth, they\u2019ve really kind of dropped the ball in terms of performance and vision here, and I feel that one will notice immediately after one play through as well. It just sounds like Amon Amarth jamming and improvising, sometimes verging on something good enough that a song could be based around, but ultimately staying with their respective, playing comfort spaces, as to avoid losing the song\u2019s direction. I\u2019m not really surprised though, considering it was only a year and a half since the last record, which is a pretty brief time for a band who\u2019s touring heavily as well. I\u2019d suggest these guys take at most, a three year creative break when writing albums from now on, because I don\u2019t think they can shoot out a spree of amazing albums this late in their career on such short notice, and I don\u2019t really think anyone can. Amon Amarth fanbois will undoubtedly enjoy this, but even they will sense a level of flaw to it.\n\n{Originally written as Adam for AXIS OF METAL http://axisofmetal.com/2013/06/amon-amarth-deceiver-of-the-gods-review/] )\n",
        "\nLadies and gentlemen, the fucking Viking death metal riffs are coming toward your speakers to crack your walls with more roughness and brutality, the Swedish monsters Amon Amarth are back with another hammering release for all the fans of death metal music. \"Deceiver of the Gods\" is the 9th full-length album for Amon Amarth, and its also the 9th full-length album to be released by the exceptional extreme metal label Metal Blade Records.\n\nThe melodic and Viking musical style of Amon Amarth hasn't changed for years and this musical constancy has helped the band reach beyond Europe and hit the limit of the Earth with excellent music and performance, and here is \"Deceiver of the Gods\" proving that the original sound of Amon Amarth cannot be copied by any band except Amon Amarth. Though I am hearing a big semblance between this album and the previous releases, I can't but love every single moment in this melodic and brutal immorality. Here Andy Sneap (the known guitarist from Sabbat) is handling the mastering and the production for the first time in the discography of Amon Amarth and I think the result is really satisfying for all the fans of extreme and fast metal music. The roaring vocal sound and the slamming sound of the guitars are supported by the slashing sound of the drums and the deep sound of the bass, and the total sound created on this album is on the same level of the previous 2 albums (and maybe better).\n\nThe tracks \"Deceiver of the Gods\" and \"Shape Shifter\" have been released before the release of the album and these tracks gave the fans a good indication of how the album will sound. The headbanging rhythmic guitars and the pounding drumming were the main musical themes of these tracks, and of course I can't ignore the very strong vocals of Johan Hegg that gave the whole album mightiness and strength. Tracks like \"Father of the Wolf\" and \"Under Siege\" have really caught my attention, the sound of Stockholm death metal force you can headbang to even if you're on your deathbed. The melodies of the lead guitar have always been charming and catchy in the music of Amon Amarth, and in this album the tracks \"As Loke Falls\" and \"Under Siege\" represent the best lead guitar lines to bleed the ears of all the melodic death metal fans in the world. The legendary vocalist Messiah Marcolin has been featured in the track \"Hel\" and this was actually the biggest surprise in this album, especially for the worshipers of this amazing vocalist.\n\nIf you're a death metal fan and you're searching for one of the best death metal releases of the year, then you have to get yourself a copy of this album immediately. As a fan of Amon Amarth, I liked the tiny new elements that the band has added in this release, but I defiantly needed to hear more fresh material. If you hated Amon Amarth before this release, then there's no chance that you'll love them now, but if you're already a fan, then I guess you'll like every single moment in this record. This is the sound of Stockholm that will never let you down.\n\nOriginally written for:\nwww.jorzine.com\n",
        "\nAmon Amarth has been at it for a fairly long time, yet only within the past 7 years have they settled into a particularly comfortable stylistic niche and find themselves revisiting nearly the exact same territory with each passing album. Though some will hint at traces of their stadium friendly brand of melodeath being present circa their lauded 2001 album \"Crusher\", it wasn't until the heavily popular \"With Oden On Our Side\" that the almost power metal leaning consistency of their songwriting became apparent. Naturally those who preferred the Swedish sound of the early 90s when At The Gates was raging at full speed and the other 2 members of the Gothenburg trio were just getting started are a bit skeptical of a band that has all but embraced the catchiness of rock radio while maintaining the vocal persona and heaviness that keeps them outside of the area inhabited by the likes of fellow Swedish darlings of the power metal scene Sabaton.\n\n\"Deceiver Of The Gods\" has very little contrast to it when dealing with \"Surtur Rising\" or \"Twilight Of The Thunder God\", save perhaps that here Amon Amarth has opted to get a bit fancier, a little catchier, and are keeping the tempo on the upper end. The songs themselves delve into the subject of Norse mythology a bit more than the historic exploits of the Vikings themselves, and along for the ride comes an approach to songwriting that is, interestingly enough, a bit more thrashing and yet also a bit more folksy. Occasional clean guitar passages filter out of the intro to the opening title song and the mid-tempo lighters blazing anthem \"Under Siege\" that almost point directly to the period sound of early Ensiferum, though no period instruments are employed. Simultaneously, the meat and potatoes of \"Deceiver Of The Gods\" brings in a slight Bay Area feel to complement a string of melodies and riffs that are quite similar to \"Twilight Of The Thunder God\", to speak nothing for the pummeling fit of thrashing rage that is \"Blood Eagle\".\n\nIn spite of all the unsubtle nods to latter day Testament and a number of folk bands from neighboring Finland, the prime feature of this album is its animated feel and unrelenting appeal to consonance in spite of the frosty ugliness of Hegg's guttural shouts. The songs that stick out the most, namely \"Father Of The Wolf\", \"Coming Of The Tide\", \"Deceiver Of The Gods\" and the surprisingly compatible merger of Amon Amarth with Messiah Marcolin \"Hel\", do so primarily because they tend to reaffirm elements that this band has found themselves referring back to of late when appealing to their base. The songwriting process is quite simple and borderlines on pop formulation, in spite of the presentation itself being way too aggressive for anything that the average post-grunge drone or pop punk would even contemplate messing with. Sure, there's a nice guitar solo here and there (particularly that of \"Father Of The Wolf\"), but the songs are largely built off of 3 or 4 different riffs and rarely veers off a basic rhythmic structure with a singing melody/harmony going on within the music.\n\nHaving said all of that, there was one truly shining moment to this album that makes its contrast with previous works, and that is the epic closer \"Warriors Of The North\". While not terribly more complex than anything else on here, the brilliant interplay between the instruments and the layering of clean and distorted guitar themes is nothing short of brilliant, bringing up memories of the majestic character of Ensiferum's \"Heathen Throne\", a song that itself sounded like it was influenced by early works by this band. It's a little bit plainer and stricter in its approach than the aforementioned song, but it accomplishes a similar sense of lofty imagery of warriors marching off for glory in the merciless snow-covered wastelands of the north.\n\nIt's a foregone conclusion that if any album that this band has put out since 2006 has agreed with you, this one will too. This band makes waves through a combination of quality and consistency, perhaps sacrificing originality in the process, but getting the job done regardless. They are essentially the ideal melodic death metal band for those not inclined toward death metal, which is not always seen as a good thing, but it agrees with the musical sensibilities of this reviewer, who is himself not averse to old school death metal nor all of its recent off-shoots. I still tend to prefer \"Surtur Rising\" a bit more, but this one is drawn from the same glorious strain and will likely be equally loved by all who were taken in by that one 2 years ago. Raise your goblets of mead to the sky once more, for the old Norse gods still seem to have a reputable group of bards to continue telling the tale.\n",
        "\nAmon Amarth catch my attention with each of their albums. I began skipping every other album since things started getting superfluous, but the general formula is something I appreciate. When the music starts to become duly, such as coming into existence only because Amon Amarth have to keep making music, then it gets pointless. Amon Amarth's brand of melodic death is easy to recognize, but even easier is to identify the stock riffs and unmemorable choruses that go with it. Plus that cover art's goofy in a bad way.\n\nThe usual slash of riffs colliding with thunderous power meanders with tenuous effectiveness here. It's a shell of the band's past performance, with less inspiration and more force of habit. I'm into Amon Amarth with spiraling, epic leads and colossal riffing, but that's spread thin now. I've heard more aggression and passion in As I Lay Dying songs, and that's being said as a fan of both bands. \"As Loke Falls\" has the tumultuous approach that I'm talking about in certain riffs, but it gets bogged down by lazy writing. It's like they got trapped in their own pool of riffs and could only muster a limited amount corresponding pieces for each song. The title track is a prime example of how to fuck up the momentum before the album even gets going. Compare that to the opener of Surtur Rising, which combined a tsunami-like tempo with bulky growls and tasteful leads to create something memorable and timeless.\n\nI can't fault the production, either, since it's still ripe and meaty (Sneap's productions can become stale, but I feel as though it works here). The bass' sustain is hefty and the riffs are still long-lasting and fat. \"Under Siege\" even has a great bass section that's like a pulsating beat carrying the song forward. The drum kit's a tad metallic with the snare but it's otherwise suitably smooth. The instruments are clearly mixed and come together well, but I'm just not feeling it in the music between Johan's gaping growls and the guitars. Not a lot feels right, as if it could have been written far better than it turned out. \"Father Of The Wolf\" for instance starts out immensely with its textbook Gothenburg riffs, but then it ends up in power metal territory. It works there, but too often on the album do the band's melodies teeter or end up sounding contrived as a result of unnatural transitions. For instance, \"We Shall Destroy\" sounds like a Bolt Thrower song sapped of life as it employs bouncy riffs and that tank-roll drumming. Opposite to that is the plodding rocker \"Hel\" with Messiah Marcolin sounding like an out-of-tune ass.\n\nThe closer, \"Warriors Of The North,\" is what I don't want to be hearing from the band this late in their career. The gash of harmonized leads and freer drumming envelops the rigorous riffs and tremolo picking, but the rhythm's decent enough so as to absorb the character. However, it's too long - like taking a modern Dark Tranquillity song and putting it on life support. It becomes unmemorable halfway through and the band figures that by burying itself in redundancy the song would somehow turn out fine. Go back to \"Prediction Of Warfare\" from With Oden On Our Side and you'll hear elegance in melodic death that didn't amount to being boring. It felt genuine with that warm atmosphere and titanic scope. Not like the desiccated droll the band is dishing out with this album. \n\nWhat's cool to me is the heavy / power metal influence in the song \"Coming Of The Tide\". It's pretty standard, but it's got more catchiness than the tired and tried melodic death ones. Something like that is stronger in keeping me interested, but Amon Amarth got too comfortable with themselves and went for banality. Surtur Rising was more potent than this, and the originality of that is only a hair above this one. Even with talk of originality out of the picture, I'm not sold on the unity and direction. There are a couple good tracks, but Deceiver Of The Gods is one unsavory offering. Best look back on past success for enjoyment from these guys.\n",
        "\nAmon Amarth is, and has been, undoubtedly one of the iconic Melodeath bands, the band has pioneered the use of their lyrical theme; they\u2019re one of the first bands to write lyrics that revolve around the Norse mythology (having been preceded by Bathory). The guys deserve credit for converting many metal fans to die-hard melodic death-metal fans.\n\nThe band has released eight studio albums, most of which are pretty impressive, but in this review, I\u2019ll be writing about this very album Surtur Rising. The album kicks off with the mighty initial riff of \u201cWar of The Gods\u201d, which quickly builds to explode into a complete song structure, with Johan\u2019s scream roaring in the background. It's then easily possible to tell that it\u2019s another Amon Amarth album. I\u2019m not going to review the songs individually in a dull way, don\u2019t worry.\n\nSurtur Rising is characterised by diversity, although most of the songs MAY sound similar at the first hearing... allow me to go deeper clarifying my opinion. Speaking of speed, having taken into consideration that most of the songs by Amon Amarth (Melodeath songs in general) are fast-paced (as in tracks #3 and 9 off this album), but still, you can find relatively-slow and heavy riffing in \u201cThe Last Stand of Frej\u201d. As I have mentioned before, the lyrics mainly revolve around the Norse mythology (which is absolutely fucking great) and continues to tell intriguing stories in a track after another, which is rather experimental, and allows the listener to visualise what the epic scene seems like, filling the listener with enthusiasm as if they are experiencing it themselves, yet, it\u2019s not limited by that theme; In \u201cSlaves of Fear\u201d, they lyrically move away from the mythological theme, (but not so far) to talk about religions, which is again, a form of diversity.\n\nTo be objective, some verses by Amon Amarth are quite silly, speaking within Surtur Rising: \u201cMy name is T\u00f6ck, and I won\u2019t cry\u201d I mean come on, seriously? Having written this crappy verse, the band succeeds in worsening the two parts of the story (the first is \"Loke's Treachery\" off With Oden on Our Side, in which the last two verses do not go very well with the rhyme, resulting in making me sometimes just stop the song at that very point). But well, I guess that was necessary to deliver a significant detail of the story of Baldr\u2019s death, still, I believe it could have been worked in a better way. Another weakness I've detected in the album, is that I've found it lacking the powerful choruses I had expected, exception be made for two: the first; \"Rise! Raise the flag once more, and the eagle will be fed...\" in \"For Victory or Death\", and the one in \"A Beast Am I\".\n\nI said that I wasn't going to review the tracks individually, I know, but \u201cA Beast Am I\u201d is a rather interesting song; when I had first heard the guitar-solo part in that song, I could tell that something fishy is going on in this very track; the whammy bar, it\u2019s being used to produce sounds that don\u2019t seem very \u201cAmon Amarthish\u201d, the curiosity had grown enough for me to Google it, which resulted in finding out that a guest (Simon Solomon) was playing the role of a lead guitarist.\n\nTo sum up: The album, as a whole, is quite exhilarating, forged from tons of gripping and powerful riffs (which was expected), and the usual powerful vocals, and a rather formerly-unknown sound that lasted but for few seconds. But after all, did this album add something remarkable to the band\u2019s discography, or is it just an album, in which the creativity and innovation are bounded?\n",
        "\nWhether you think of them as melodic death or straight up Viking metal, Amon Amarth has become a major force in the modern metal scene. In addition to their Norse aesthetics and relatively accessible sound by death metal standards, they are also becoming well known for having a consistency rate that is comparable to the likes of Motorhead and Cannibal Corpse. Surtur Rising is the band's eighth studio album and has already proven to be one of their biggest commercial successes to date. In a rare feat, it managed to sell 15,000 copies in its first week of release and chart on the Billboard's Top 40 with their distinct sound still kept intact!\n\nWith the possible exception of Adult Swim's Dethklok, Amon Amarth is probably the most easygoing band to ever utilize Cookie Monster vocals. That does not mean their music is watered down or creatively bankrupt, but rather that it is forged to form a distinct sound that appeals to fans of several genres. This album is certainly no exception as it happily averts accusations of selling out by going along with the traits that were established on past albums such as Fate of Norns and Twilight of the Thunder God.\n\nThus, most of the music on here seems to go between both melodic and extreme elements. On one hand, the production is done with a very modern polish, vocalist Johan Vegg's growls are the most clearly enunciated this side of Novembers Doom, and the usage of strings and guitar harmonizing help give things an epic but still melodic vibe. On the other hand, the riffs retain a healthy bite even in the midst of accessibility and the drums do largely go at an energetic pace. And while the vocals and overall band presentation may get a little goofy at times as most metal can, it does give the listener an enjoyable pounding.\n\nIn addition, the band has also retained their Norse lyrical themes and uses them to great effect as it goes about the usual tropes of Ragnarok and the other highlights of Viking culture. However, there are a few particularly interesting exceptions as \"Slaves of Fear\" deals with the terrorist mindset and \"Doom Over Dead Men\" seems to deal with the timeless and rather vague theme of dying.\n\nGoing along with the things that are firmly kept in place, the band does offer some solid songwriting. Predictably for a band of this genre, most of the songs on here are pretty fast paced and bring about an almost power metal vibe. The opening \"War Of The Gods\" manages to be the strongest track due to its particularly powerful verse/chorus transitions. In addition, \"Destroyer Of The Universe\" and \"A Beast Am I\" are probably the most extreme and hard hitting tracks on the album while \"Live Without Regrets\" takes on an almost folk metal direction with its incredibly happy harmonies.\n\nOf course, there are certain exceptions as some outliers play with slower tempos. \"Toke's Taunt,\" the sequel to \"Hermod's Ride to Hel\" off of With Oden On Our Side, goes between a grinding verse riff and softer moments that recall classic Immortal and Bathory. \"The Last Stand of Frej\" is a largely building track made memorable by its sweeping guitar lines and anticipating percussion while \"Slaves Of Fear\" features a mid-tempo riff that oddly reminds me of Trivium's \"Unrepentent\" while still remaining a solid song\n\nBut the most interesting song of all has to be the closing \"Doom Over Dead Men,\" a closing ballad that features a sweet introduction, nice string usage between verses, and growled vocals that somehow don't sound out of place in the middle of it all. Hell, they fit a lot better on a ballad than they do in that strange System Of A Down cover that was included on certain editions of the album...\n\nI'm not gonna lie to you; this is probably the most metal album that I've heard all year. It has just about everything that the genre should have and offers excellent songwriting and great instrumental performances all wrapped up with a smooth production job. While some established fans may find more to enjoy in some of their earlier efforts, I also think that this album could make for a great regret free gateway band into extreme metal for unaccustomed listeners. The song structures and melodies should appeal to power metal listeners, death metal fans will enjoy the vocals and rougher guitars and drumming, and the overall accessibility should make it a good purchase for new initiates. Check it out if you haven't already!\n\nCurrent Highlights:\n\"War Of The Gods\"\n\"Tock's Taunt - Loke's Treachery Part II\"\n\"Destroyer Of The Universe\"\n\"Slaves Of Fear\"\n\"Doom Over Dead Men\"\n",
        "\nMy first encounter with the Viking blades of Amon Amarth was Fate of Norns, an album that sadly remains much underappreciated among fans due to its admittedly simple, yet in my opinion, amazingly catchy compositions. When it came out I thought it was their strongest offering so far, well balanced and with zero point zero filler tracks. However, even though I was confident the Vikings would release a worthy successor, I didn\u2019t expect it to blow away the preceding album like dust upon a sleeve. And that\u2019s not only my own perception, for it is the general consensus that With Oden on Our Side  is the band\u2019s ULTIMATE MASTERPIECE. Moreover, I do not only believe this album is the best material Amon Amarth has offered so far to the metal-craving masses, but also one of melodic death metal\u2019s finest hours, on par with Carcass\u2019 Heartwork and Callenish Circle\u2019s My Passion // Your Pain. Those three gems constitute my own \"Unholy Trinity\" of melodeath albums, my absolute favorites in the genre.\n\nBlood starts to flow like the Iguazu Falls and limbs start to fly everywhere with the first riffs and the pounding drums of \u201cValhall Awaits Me\u201d, an adrenaline pumping opener that\u2019ll instantly compel you to go berserk, get a rune-carved battle axe or whatever similar object you find nearby, and FUCKIN\u2019 DESTROY! The first person point of view lyrics of the song totally own, you can put yourself in the place of the bearskin-clad warrior and visualize the carnage unfold before your very eyes. I\u2019ve always loved Johan Hegg\u2019s lyrics about Viking mythology and history but I find that his best songs narrate the mighty deeds and unfortunate fates of faceless, unnamed characters. It gives a more personal insight to the Viking-era world, in a dramatic and authentic way. This lyrical style is used on most songs of WOoOS and second axe blow \u201cRunes to My Memory\u201d is no exception, an ill-fated tale of a Viking incursion into Russia wrapped around another high dosage of ass-kicking riffs, epic melodies, tempo changes and forceful roars by the bearded giant himself. A one-two punch that\u2019ll leave you maimed, battered and bruised, aching for more\u2026 and that\u2019s precisely what you\u2019ll get!\n\nWith this first couple of tracks Amon Amarth shows a return to the speedy numbers of earlier works, now empowered with the catchiness developed during Versus the World and Fate of Norns. Well, get prepared, cos' track number three is even faster! A lightning speed three-minute Thor invocation, \u201cAsator\u201d will leave your neck\u2019s vertebrae completely pulverized. Afterwards the album relents a bit with a couple of slower but equally bone-breaking tunes: the mythological \u201cHelmod\u2019s Ride to Hel \u2013 Loke\u2019s Treachery Part I\u201d and \u201cGods of War Arise\u201d. The first one ranks among the less amazing songs of the album and yet, it boasts epic riffs, battle percussion and an overall great atmosphere. It\u2019s also vastly superior to its disappointing 2011 sequel. \u201cGods of Wars Arise\u201d is bigger, longer and meaner, a tale of conquest and subjugation that has Manowar-like levels of testosterone and one of Amon Amarth\u2019s best choruses:\n\n\u201cSacrifice to Gods of old\nBleed them of their lives\nFresh blood on our swords\nGods of war arise!\u201d\n\nSimple and LETHAL! Now, I\u2019ve listened to the CD version, but if you happened to get the vinyl, that\u2019d be the end of Side A. As Side B starts, you\u2019d be in for a pummeling with the arrival of the title-track itself, showing the great pacing this album has, the songs arranged in perfect order for a more concussive effect. \u201cWith Oden on Our Side\u201d displays great percussion by skin-basher Fredrik Andersson, including a tasty crashing of plates during the intro and excellent use of double bass bursts. It also has a very powerful chorus, a trait it shares with most songs of this Hel of an album. \u201cCry of the Blackbirds\u201d needs no introduction, as it\u2019s one of the songs responsible for converting hundreds of metalheads into Amon Amarth\u2019s loyal followers. It boasts stellar percussion AGAIN, memorable riffs and melodies AGAIN, thunderous vocals AGAIN and it kicks enormous amounts of ass, AGAIN and AGAIN! A battle song that ranks amongst Amon Amarth\u2019s most cherished tunes, it will always be a crowd pleaser and one my personal favorites. \n\nThe aftermath of the skirmish leaves us with two slower tracks. First we have the ballad equivalent to an Amon Amarth song in \u201cUnder the Northern Star\u201d. It has some of the most beautiful melodies ever crafted by a metal band, and a soothing cadence that makes you feel as if you were aboard a drakkar, balancing over the waves and staring at the dark blanket of the night, with only a dim light overhead showing the way. But it\u2019s still a melodic death metal song, and Johan Hegg\u2019s growls remind us there might be just another raid ahead. And it comes in the form of the climatic ending with \u201cPrediction of Warfare\u201d, a historical-themed six-minute closer that recalls the days of Viking-era Ireland. Honestly, it is the least interesting track of the album but it still manages to stay afloat on the vast ocean of greatness that is this masterpiece. It lacks the dynamism of the preceding songs, but it does have its moments and it\u2019s a fitting finale. Hence we conclude that: Side B is as killer as Side A.\n\nWith the best production vales so far in their entire career, Amon Amarth fully crowned themselves the undisputed kings of melodeath with this album, in my opinion ruling supreme on the top of the genre from 2004 \u2018til the release of 2011\u2019s Surtur Rising, when they stepped down a notch or two. WOoOS successor ensured this dominion, albeit I do find Twilight of the Thunder God a tiny bit less compelling in comparison, somehow making it up by being marginally more accessible and catchier. Nonetheless, With Oden on Our Side continues to be the one album by this band that I rate as virtually flawless, the one I urge fellow metal brothers and sisters to fetch and experience. It has everything done right and the riff crafting of both Olavi Mikkonen Johan S\u00f6derberg is simply mind-blowing, a perfect environment for Johan Hegg\u2019s inspired and inspiring tales of the Viking Era to come to life. This is MANDATORY listen for fans of the band, melodeath fans, Viking metal enthusiasts and any metalhead that enjoys the clashing of riffs and drum beats\u2026 in other words, GET IT NOW!\n",
        "\nAmon Amarth has one of the largest followings in the metal community and it is no surprise when you hear their material. Since their first lp, \"Once Sent from the Golden Halls\", Amon Amarth has continued to escalate their sound and improve with every release, and the new \"Surtur Rising\" is a perfect example of this trend.\n\nFrom the opening riff of \"War of the Gods\", you know this album is going to be good. I can only envision Johan and Olavi whaling away on their guitars with all the brutality and all the melody thrown together as they stand on top of a mountain. And the solo near the end of the song... wow. I am almost tempted to copy that bit from the song into its own track so I can listen to it over and over again. \n\nI'm not going to give a track-by-track review, but tracks to listen to include \"War of the Gods\", of course, \"T\u00f6ck's Taunt: Loke's Treachery Part II\", \"Slaves of Fear\", and \"For Victory or Death\". The riffs, the heathen-inspiring lyrics, the guitar melodies... it's all there on these tracks, top notch. Amon Amarth never ceases to impress.\n\nOh, and did I mention the dvd? I didn't? Well, are you in for a treat! Amon Amarth fans will enjoy the hours of live performances the dvd includes. There are four shows, each playing start to finish some of Amon Amarth's classic albums. This is one of the things that gets me so excited about Amon Amarth releases: the bonus content they include when you buy their albums is outstanding. In total, these shows together are 33 tracks, making it over four hours long. A four hour long live dvd. It doesn't get much better then that, folks!\n\nI hope you enjoyed my review. Get out and buy this!\n\n95/100\n",
        "\nI was not really a true metal head until I checked out MA few days back. After a lot of stumbling upon many MA recommendations, I finally picked an album to really storm up my brain. My new year started with brutal death metal. When I tried Trivium's Ascendancy, I really thought these melodic riffs, although catchy, don't really appeal to metal heads, but only after listening to Amon Amarth's Surtur Rising did my impression change. From the start itself, back to back melody riffing with beast-like vocals were absolute phenomenal. Johan Hegg did a really great job with a twin harmonic guitar melancholy that really drove me into medieval age Viking stuff. This album is narrative, emotive, and a brain crusher.\n\nThe song compositions were top-notch except for a few filler songs in between, but the music grows on you nonetheless. As a thrash metal fan, I missed the killer riffs and shredding solos, but this type of death metal is really enjoyable. I can't not say that there are a few solos. S\u00f6derberg & Mikkonen manage to fill the songs with great trade-off solos. Drumming is more of a death metal-style with pounding speed and aggression. Their themes depict Norse mythology and it definitely suits the metal atmosphere. Each songs describes a definitive subject in Norse mythology. I always find fault with black/death metal productions, but this stepped aside for me and I can't imagine a better production than this. Some may find the song structures repetitive, but the album grows on you very soon. Songs like War of the Gods and Slaves of Fear have ideal song structures and the band continues to maintain throughout, but somewhat seem to be very insistent. \n\nOpening track 'War of the Gods' is a great track with an epic riff and great production with Hegg screaming like hell that's bolstered by anthemic chorus. 'Destroyer of the Universe' starts with a fast death metal riff and twin solos, probably the fastest ones on the album. 'Slaves of Fear' is the most brutal track off of this record and one of my most favourite ones and the twin guitar harmony section continues on this one too. 'Live Without Regrets' is emotive while 'The Last Stand of Frej' is relatively slow and catchy. 'Wrath of Norsemen', another power metal anthem, is accompanied by catchy lyrics and great guitar solo work. 'A Best I Am' has yet another crushing riff followed by Hegg's howling noises and an extended solo. 'Doom Over Dead Man' is another slow track with a denser sound. A bonus track, 'Aerials', is a mixed track with both slow and fast compositions. \n\nThere are many instances where I have thought that these rhythmic patterns were rip offs of the previous tracks, but overall this album is a very memorable one to me and to metal history as a whole.\n\nOriginally written for http://headbangersherald.blogspot.com/.\n",
        "\nWhen I review music, I like to have it playing in the background. It helps keep my points fresh in my head, and generally makes for better reviewing. I couldn't leave \"Surtur Rising\" on for long, though, because it's really hard to review an album while headbanging.\n\nBefore I dig into this splendid-looking platter of metal, I'd like to acknowledge that many view Amon Amarth as fickle at times - that is to say, they don't always hold up to their previous standards or what they're truly capable of. While it's up in the air as far as meeting past standards...\n\nAmon Amarth does a damn good job with \"Surtur Rising\", their latest release. The concept of this album is - you guessed it! - Surtur! The inglorious badass himself rises from Muspelheim, and boy, is his fury sublime as ever. Amon has always been quite adept at creating heavy, enjoyable tracks, and this record is no exception. Johan Hegg's songwriting abilities fit the music great, and his vocals even moreso. The new sound is by no means revolutionary, but it is refreshing, and sounds great while still retaining a definitive Amon feel to it.\n\nThis album really shows Amon Amarth's ability to create atmospheric tracks as well. While album opener \"War of the Gods\" is first and foremost a thrashingly heavy track, showing that Amon is still the piece of work they were in past releases, \"Tocke's Taunt\" is a much more emphatic release, with a very carefully-crafted atmospheric presence to it. Speaking of the second track, \"Tocke's Taunt\" is also a very good track. It shows a slow side at times, but the mood is welcome and gives a feel for what the rest of the album has to offer. My personal favourite is the third track, \"Destroyer of the Universe\", which is really heavy and really well done. The solo has a \"shut up and windmill\" feel to it, and the outro's vocals grind in the best possible way. With the first three tracks exhibiting this much heavy attitude and atmosphere, it's difficult to complain. \"Slaves of Fear\" is a decent track with an interesting meaning, and \"Live Without Regrets\" definitely deserves a listen for its war-cry take on the popular saying. \"A Beast Am I\" and \"Doom Over Dead Men\" hold a blend of both slow and fast moods, and the atmosphere in the last track is incredible, building off the synth outro of \"A Beast Am I\".\n\nThe album's faults lie within the tracks that could be tossed on any Amon Amarth album. \"The Last Stand of Frej\" is interchangeable with many of the more melodic tracks off of previous records and just sounds too slow to be Amon. I kept expecting something to happen - something awesome, something interesting - and it never did. \"Wrath of the Norseman\" is very reminiscent of the entirety of \"With Oden on Our Side\", although it does sound good, and \"For Victory or Death\" just isn't memorable enough to write too much about. That being said, when you can only complain about three tracks out of eleven, the album's pretty damn sharp.\n\nThe bonus track on this album is a cover of \"Aerials\" by System of a Down. Despite there being a big gap in sound between the bands, Amon Amarth's cover does it justice. You wouldn't notice any difference if it was an actual Amon song, thanks to the epic guitarwork and Johan's epic screaming outro to the song. Basically, the song sounds like it would if the band had made it first.\n\nAll in all, great album, decent cover, and awesome artwork (though I don't know why the Viking has a horned helmet...). Give it a listen if you haven't already.\n\nRecommended Tracks:\n1.) War of the Gods\n2.) Tocke's Taunt: Loke's Treachery Pt. II\n3.) Destroyer of the Universe\n9.) A Beast Am I\n10.) Doom Over Dead Men\n",
        "\nThis early 2002 release is often regarded as one of the heaviest - and most meaningful - Amon Amarth record to date, and for damn good reasons; that's exactly what it is.\n\nBefore I get into the highlights of the album, a few main things stand out to me. The first is that there's a real focus on the drumming. It's generally steady, but fast enough to carry a 'barely on the rails' type feeling for the main body of most of the songs. Regardless of the pace, though, the drum definitely serves as a proper framework for the tracks. Well-written and executed riffs comprise the majority of the instrumental listen, though, and the solos are polished and awe-inspiring.\n\nJohan Hegg's vocals are at some of their finest points in this record (no surprise there), and the lyrical themes are dark, but interesting. As always, a lyrical focus of Norse mythology is paramount, but this record's feel is particularly dreadful and foreshadowing. From the passage in thrashy album opener \"Death in Fire\", which is incredibly addictive to listen to, to the album closer \"...And Soon the World will Cease to Be\", the end-of-the-world scenarios of Bifrost's arrival and Ragnar\u00f6k aren't just present - they're literally screamed at you.\n\nWait, what's that? With all this crazy off-the-rails thrashiness, you say, how would one find a slower groove of a song? Listeners need not look any further than the second track, \"For the Stabwounds in Our Backs\", the fifth track, \"Across the Rainbow Bridge, and the ninth and final track, which I've mentioned before. While \"Death in Fire\" is an excellent song, the second track really hits home with meaning without being too monotonously slow, and as such prevents any one track from being disinteresting. \"Stabwounds\" is an excellent track unto itself, showing pain in the betrayal orchestrated by the \"civilised\" Christian folks (a theme that's repeated in \"Thousand Years of Oppression\", which I'll discuss later). While lyrical themes are repeated within certain tracks, each song is distinct in its differences. The mastery Amon shows in this record is like no other, and really sets them above the rank and file.\n\nWhile all the tracks are quite exceptional, my personal favourite is \"Thousand Years of Oppression\". It combines the pure thrashiness and brutality of death metal with severe and genuine, heartfelt emotion into what I honestly believe to be the pure embodiment of Amon Amarth. This track is an amazing listen from start to finish, from the exceptional riffage to the grinding vocals. Album closer \"...And Soon the World will Cease to Be\" is another very good track, showing a little soft side in the beginning before closing the book on Versus the World in an extremely satisfying way. It's one of those songs you'd hold a lighter to if they played it live, before throwing yourself into the circle pit, and it's done really well.\n\nAll in all? I think this album deserves the five stars I'm giving it. I know it's an old release, but I promised this review a long while ago. Have a look at the recommended tracks if you don't already have this album.\n\nRecommended Tracks\n1.) \"Death in Fire\"\n2.) \"For the Stabwounds in Our Backs\"\n3.) \"Across the Rainbow Bridge\"\n4.) \"Thousand Years of Oppression\"\n5.) \"...And Soon the World will Cease to Be\"\n",
        "\nI've always had a close connection to this band one way or another. For starters they basically helped me really get into extreme metal with their simplistic easy to follow formula of melodic riffs coupled with Johan's storming thunderous voice. It was a sound I really was into and could listen to the band for hours. That, plus Norse mythology is really appealing and has a whole slew of neat stories and tales that are pretty well fitted for a metal outfit. I've always enjoyed reading lyrics about heroic tales and struggles and its always been a highlight of this band to me. My first exposure to this band was actually Fate of Norns, arguably one of their more safe and simplistic sounding albums, which is why I guess it was so accessible at the time. They really haven't deviated from that style too much before or after that album with the exception of Once Sent From the Golden Hall which was a little more raw and faster paced. \n\nThere's no exception here. This is band you've either grown to love or hate. Nothing here is different from what you've come to expect. All the basic formula still applies. Mid paced, mid length melodic songs with lots of melodic riffs and solo's with the centre stage being focused on the vocals and drums carrying it all along nicely. To start off, the guitars are the most present thing here, being two of them. The tone is very chunky, there isn't really any problems with the production. The rhythm guitar does a good job of steadily providing a good backbone for the lead guitar although at times it does feel like there really isn't much to grab onto when certain parts start to drag when they start to chug along awkwardly. Luckily, there are enough catchy lead parts to keep it from becoming stale and boring. The solo work is nice, keeping with what Amon Amarth have always liked to go for with the tapping solo's without ever really going over the top or going blazing fast. The songs, for the most part all build up and climax at the right time without going overboard or dragging on for too long. \n\n\nThe drumming is something I'd like to mention as well. Fredrik Andersson is an awesome drummer, and his work sounds even better with great drum production that is on this album. The double bass is deep and punchy and has perfect echo, the snare is deep and rings out over everything else and the cymbals and hi-hats are very bright and crisp. He provides plenty of creative drum fills and an extra dose of double bass on just about every track and he is a big reason why the album never falls flat on it's ass from being mundane and boring. The bass, however doesn't really do anything special. I don't think the album would really suffer if it hadn't been there at all. It doesn't offer anything or detract anything, it's just whatever. It could just be it is badly mixed or just bad writing but either way its a bummer. A big problem I have with this album is the compression. I don't know if its just my copy, but when I listened on my stereo and when I ripped it on my CD everything sounded really compressed and compact. Everything sounded a little less vibrant and dull compared to releases in the 80's/90's. Now I don't want to be THAT guy that always bitches about how shitty the music industry is today (no matter how true) and how audio has gone down the shitter because of digital stuff, but it really does suffer here. \n\n\nVocals are what you'd expect, greatness. Johan Hegg is probably one the best vocalist in melodic death metal, while admittedly it isn't a genre I'm very fond of he is the needle in a hay stack. Echoing roars and shouts with a very raspy yet understandable tone with great range. Often doing bellowing deep grunts, while other times mid range shouts or really high shrieks. His range is all over the place and it's awesome to listen to. However not all is well, the lyrics aren't exactly as fresh and interesting as they use to be. Basically \"VIKINGS ARE STRONG WE KILL NOW ROARRRRRR\" and that's about it. I miss the ballad type stuff like Across the Rainbow Bridge, Under the Northern Star, and Gods of War Arise. \n\nI do feel like some of the tracks on here are a little filler. Songs like The Last Stand of Frej, For Victory or Death, and Slaves of Fear are nothing really spectacular. While songs like Doom Over Dead Man, Wrath of the Norsemen, and Destroyer of the Universe are leaps and bounds better than the rest. On the subject of songs being a lot better than others, Doom Over Dead Man is a slower paced sorrowful doomy song that feature some brief violin stuff and Johan's vocals on this song are just awesome as well as the riffs. \n\nReally the bottom line is if you're an Amon Amarth fan and you're sick of all the rest of their material then for sure pick this up. However if you're simply just a fan of melodic death metal and are looking to get into this band then I recommend getting Versus the World or The Avenger first.\n",
        "\nAmon Amarth\u2019s 8th album packs fairly few surprises. At this stage in the game, one goes into an Amon Amarth album knowing what to expect. Harmonized tremolo-picking, pedaled melodies and heavy power chords backed by thundering double bass drumming and Johan Hegg\u2019s immense roar bellowing out tales of gods and men in pre-Christian Scandinavia. In this respect Surtur Rising does not disappoint. The ineffectual production of the last album is gone, in its place an updated version of the patented \u201cViking Juggernaut\u201d sound found on the first four albums. The sound is a tad too clean for my tastes, but the propulsive drumming and crunchy riffing packs quite a punch. \n\nIt would be easy enough to simply say \u201cyep, it\u2019s an Amon Amarth album,\u201d and then you could decide what to do based on your past experience with the band. However, as something of an obsessive fan I prefer to pick everything apart. In this spirit, let\u2019s press on.\n\nSurtur Rising kicks off with War of the Gods, and you would be forgiven for thinking you\u2019d put in the wrong Amon Amarth album. The band is clearly reusing melodies at this point \u2013 in this case, I detect similarities to An Ancient Sign of Coming Storm from Fate of Norns and the title track from Twilight of the Thunder God. I don\u2019t mind the band playing it safe, but this is a little too formulaic, which is something of a problem with Surtur Rising. Still, the formula works relatively well. War of the Gods is lacking in song-craft, moving in very predictable patterns that unfortunately drain it of impact, but later in the tracklist Live Without Regrets is also instantly familiar and yet still serves as a rousing battle hymn. \n\nThe band seem to be at their most comfortable chugging along at mid-tempo. The fastest song on the album, Destroyer of the Universe, seems to have been written with speed in mind, and it simply feels awkward, while the melodic grooves of Slaves of Fear are smooth like the young Thai girl and catchy like the VD she left you with. Even so, relatively few of the tracks here have much staying power compared to the band\u2019s past work. The Last Stand of Frej, a weighty mid-paced number with a fairly doomy feel, is impressive and instantly memorable, a well-crafted tune that eschews the predictable structures favored on most of the album. The afore-mentioned Live Without Regrets will doubtless live on in the band\u2019s live sets as another enjoyable sing-along glorifying an ideology remarkably consistent with suicide bombing (oops, did I ruin it for you?). However, the crowning moment is without a doubt the closer Doom Over Dead Man, a slow song that\u2019s bound to get stuck in your head\u2026if you can stop pressing replay long enough to tear yourself away.\n\nSpecial notice should go to the weakest song on the album, For Victory Or Death, which sees the band straying ever closer to power metal territory (some would argue they\u2019re already there).\n\nThe performances on the album are, as always, perfectly fine \u2013 this stuff isn\u2019t terribly hard to play. Drummer Fredrik Andersson steals the show \u2013 again, as always \u2013 with clever fills and transitions that help to smooth over some rough spots in the song-writing. I really love this guy\u2019s playing, although his most impressive performance is still his work on Cry of the Black Birds from With Oden on Our Side. Johan Hegg retains the depth and clarity he\u2019s known for, and the vocal production is spot on. This guy\u2019s a real monster. It doesn\u2019t even sound like he\u2019s growling, it sounds like that\u2019s just what he sounds like \u2013 and if you\u2019ve seen interviews you\u2019ll know that\u2019s not far off. However, his lyrics are weaker than ever. He used to deliver, both in terms of simple Viking badassery (see Victorious March or Masters of War) and cool storytelling (The Sound of Eight Hooves is a real masterpiece), but now he just scribbles some shit about Viking mythology that rhymes decently and calls it a day. Hardly a deal-breaker, and probably a complete non-issue for many, but I do miss the good old days.\n\nUltimately I find it hard to strongly recommend this album. It\u2019s definitely good \u2013 it\u2019s full of catchy choruses, meaty riffs, epic melodies, and general Viking ass-kicking \u2013 but I would direct newcomers to the band\u2019s previous works (Once Sent From The Golden Hall and With Oden on Our Side are probably the best places to start) and long-time fans may find the lack of originality distasteful. Still, if you\u2019re like me you had to have this anyways and it\u2019s got some pretty damn good stuff on it, so I guess if you have all their other stuff you should get this. It\u2019s honestly almost worth the price of entry for the closer alone.\n",
        "\nI really like Amon Amarth's eighth full-length release Surtur Rising and I actually find it to be superior to the previously well received Twilight of the Thunder God. Even though the two albums are very, very similar, I feel that Surtur Rising has finer tracks and a slightly better sound.\n\nWhat is immediately noticeable on Surtur Rising is the upgrade in the guitar work department. This sees Amon Amarth at their most melodic, with excellent harmonies sewn throughout the albums almost fifty minute run time. We even have some guitar solos that serve a good purpose, and kick their fair amount of backside. The album has a certain power metal edge to it, but don't let that put you off there is still a dragon boat load of heavy riffs to be enjoyed.\n\nTracks such as \"T\u00f6ck's Taunt - Loke's Treachery Part II\" and personal highlight \"For Victory or Death\" show Amon Amarth at their melodic best, with the latter having an air of the title track from the last album to it. Although as far as I'm concerned a far superior track, that melodic intro is as mighty as they come. Its business as usual once the main riff kicks in, the foots a stomping and the heads a banging. \n\nThose looking for something a little heavier should be pointed in the direction of \"Destroyer of the Universe\", and with a title like that you should expect the utmost in punishing melodic death metal. The track is like someone let \"Asator's\" mean little brother out of its cage, and holy shit that guitar break around a minute in, since when did Amon Amarth shred like that!?\n\nOther odes to bad-assery would include the grooving \"Wrath of the Norsemen\" with its almost Slayer breakdown intro, \"Beast I Am\" with its mighty rolling riffage, and the typical album opening brilliance of \"War of the Gods\". \n\nAll in all, this is just about up there with Amon Amarth's best releases, offering a lot in the way of guitar work. Especially the melodic stuff, and there are some really cool riffs and leads strewn throughout. Johan sounds great, the production is perfect, and fans of the band as well as more melodically inclined death metal need this in their collection. Recommended.\n",
        "\nTwlight of the Thunder God had the arduous task of having to follow up Amon Amarth's finest hour in With Oden On Our Side. Having heard the title track prior to the albums release I was stoked. An undeniably quality tune, with a classic metal feel interspersed with Amon Amarth's signature melodic death metal. Great guitar lines, and quality riffs I certainly felt positive about the album.\n\nUpon hearing the finished product the feeling of positivity I had stuck around, which was pleasing. Which is also what I think can be said about the whole album, a pleasing effort. Whilst this can't match the heights of With Oden On Our Side or even the likes of The Crusher this album is a whole load more enjoyable than the ropey middle area of their career. \n\nOpening up with the aforementioned title track, Amon Amarth take us on a journey through raging seas, and bloodied battle grounds. The album has a noticeably rounder sound to it, whilst With Oden On Our Side had a loud and heavy sound Twilight of the Thunder God has more in common production-wise with The Crusher. The music contained is typical of Amon Amarth, although the riffs sacrifice some of the heaviness from the previous release in favor of catchier numbers. This album would certainly serve as a good introduction to the band.\n\nAs for standout tracks the title track is pretty damn bad-ass, and I remember bounding with excitement when I first heard it. \"Free Will Sacrifice\" has some quality grooving to it, and a catchy riff that you can happily hum along to. \"Where is Your God\" has some heavy riffs, but I've found it to be fairly passable over repeated listens. \"Varyags Of Miklagaard\" is one of the more melodic numbers on the album, and is certainly one of the finer tracks here. \"Tattered Banners and Bloody Flags\" is along with the title track and maybe \"Live For The Kill\" (that fucking riff, man) the best of the bunch here. All of which showcase Amon Amarth ala 2008, with their formula and sound firmly cemented.\n\nOverall Twilight of the Thunder God is a worthy addition to the Amon Amarth back catalogue, but just can't hold a flame to the sheer excitement of With Oden On Our Side. I could never quite understand why this album received such ridiculous levels of fellation. This is Amon Amarth doing what Amon Amarth does, with a slight air of distillation and more focus on being catchy than heavy.\n",
        "\nAfter the lacklustre Fate of Norns Amon Amarth needed something pretty darn special to get themselves out of the funk they had got themselves into. I don't know what kind of viking shit Johan and co. were smoking in the two years between this and their last album, but by the ball-hair of Thor does this bad-boy rip.\n\n\"Vahall Awaits Me\" YES! Uncontrollable windmilling ensues, I can feel the fires in the eyes of each band member raging, this is exactly the kind of fist pumping, foot stomping magic I've come to expect from these Swedish death metal masters. The riffs have a weight behind them that the band hadn't seen in years, blazing across my speakers with scorching passion, even the leads are damn cool. \n\nNext up is one of my absolute favorite Amon Amarth tunes. \"Runes to my fucking MEMORY\", holy crap does that intro riff smoke, this song is one of the more melodic tracks on the album. Ideal to hold up your replica sword/beer drinking horn/fist/whatever to and belt out that majestic chorus at the top of your voice. That melodic build up to the chorus is so epic, watching it live I shed one manly tear of metal and then head-banged myself into oblivion. \n\nI'm veering into track by track territory here, I'll try not to go on too much, but it is With Oden On Our Side after all. So, next up we have the almighty \"ASATOR\" which is completely worthy of being typed in caps lock because this is one of Amon Amarth's heaviest numbers, which is no small feat. The intro exudes levels of bad-ass that verge on superhuman, I remember when they played this fucker live; my neck was ruined. Three minutes of insane head-banging madness. \n\nFrom here onwards Amon Amarth display the mastery of their given style and genre, this rivals the bands finest works, and for my money is their finest work. I could seriously go on and on with the tracks but this review would surely turn into an unintelligible mess of superlatives, exclamation marks, bad puns, caps lock, and a sickening dose of expleteives...\n\nSo I'll leave it at that. With Oden On Our Side is Amon Amarth's masterpiece, and any fan of the band who fancies contesting that is probably living a lie. Their debut and Thunder God come close, but in terms of sheer quality, and as far asriffs, and songs go; accept no substitute. A modern classic.\n",
        "\nSo here we have Amon Amarth's fifth full-length Versus the World...cough, I mean Fate of Norns which sadly holds the position of being my least favorite Amon Amarth album, and arguably their least interesting. \n\nAs with Versus the World downgrading from The Crusher, Fate of Norns provides us with yet another downgrade. Everything from the production to the track listing feels kind of half-baked. The band seem so content to plow through the motions, there isn't even a shred of conviction in the performances, with the exception of Johan's vocals which are business as usual. \n\nWith the exception of some relatively cool riffs here and there I have next to no desire to listen to Fate of Norns, even now I'm sat here itching to put on With Oden On Our Side. Don't get me wrong the album isn't bad, and I'd rather listen to this than a whole host of inferior bands, and come to think about it \"Valkyries Ride\" is pretty damn cool (with an ever-so-slight nod to slower Morbid Angel tracks in the first verse). However, as far as Amon Amarth albums go this is a bit of a joke. \n\nSo overall, this is one for the completionists and the fanboy's. Anyone else could quite happily give this one a wide berth, as I can assure you aren't missing out on much...Okay, okay, download \"Valkyries Ride\" for your playlist.\n",
        "\nI kind of have to like this album due to owning a Versus the Word T-shirt. I mean don't get me wrong, this isn't a bad album by any stretch of the word, but it is so Amon Amarth by the numbers. I've always gave The Crusher a bit of a break due to it standing as the amalgamate of the bands career at that point, but this is essentially just a rehash of that album with different artwork and song titles.\n\nReviewing the two back to back really shows how interchangeable Versus the World and The Crusher really are. The only noticeable major differences between the two would be that Versus the World is a little slower, and a little less intricate in arrangement and construction. However the slight slowing down works to the bands advantage in the case of the albums highlight \"Where Silent Gods Stand Guard\" which is an awesome cut, not too far away from \"Victorious March\" (at least in feel). \n\nI can keep this one pretty short as there isn't too much to it, while there are some quality songs across Versus the World it really is quite interchangeable with the last release, and as a result I would make this one of the later stops in checking out the bands back catalogue. Obviously fans of the band will know what they're getting themselves in for, and of course completionist's can purchase without reserve, its still Amon Amarth and even on a decidedly average day they still kick a lot of tail.\n",
        "\nAlong with The Avenger and Once Sent.. Amon Amarth formed something of a holy triad of epic melodic death metal with their third opus The Crusher. What I love about their third album is that it combines everything they had done so far. Forging the depth of their debut with the feral energy unleashed with The Avenger the band nailed us with one of their more complete works.\n\nHowever while I say more complete I will say that there isn't any truly standout tracks as there were on the previous two albums. Not necessarily a bad thing though, I feel The Crusher maintains an equal measure of quality throughout its runtime. The beauty of this equal measure of quality is that the album makes for a great choice to whack on and sit back to. Especially if you're playing a particularly epic video game, The Crusher makes for a great soundtrack (think Dragon Age or something).\n\nThat isn't to say this album merely fades into background noise, it just makes for a great listen from start to finish. However if I were to have to pick out some standout tracks it would be \"Bastards of a Lying Breed\", \"As Long as the Raven Flies\" and the stoic \"Annihilation of Hammerfest\". \n\nOverall this is another quality release from Amon Amarth, although it did see them starting to establish a formula/template that they would begin to rely on. This would also be the last truly great Amon Amarth album for a while. The Crusher serves as a great introduction to the band, and along with Twlight of the Thunder God would be the albums I would recommend to anyone yet to hear them/ trying to get into them.\n",
        "\nHot on the heels of their debut, Amon Amarth unleashed upon us the furious slab of melodically inclined death metal that is the almighty THE AVENGERRRR produced to devastating affect, this album is like Once Sent From the Golden Hall's meaner, older brother. \n\nAs I hinted on, the production here gives the album a tenfold heavier feel. Whilst on their debut I was happy to pump my fist and head-bang, The Avenger has me wanting to rampage. I swear this album could turn me into \"The Incredible Hulk\". Amon Amarth waste no time getting things raging, a short drum roll signals a furious riff and before I know it I'm involuntarily flailing around like a wild man, \"Bleed for the Ancient Gods\" packs so much in the way of bad-ass riffage, and that riff around the 2:34 mark is ridiculously heavy.\n\nFrom here onwards ensues just over 35 minutes of balls out, riff mastery, Johan Hegg sounds great and his warriors are on top form. Even across the 7 minutes plus of the title track Amon Amarth keep it up, with glorious riffs and themes. Special mention goes to live staple \"God, His Son and Holy Whore\", which is Amon Amarth at their frenetic best.\n\nOverall The Avenger is a furious installment in Amon Amarth's saga, and up there with some of their best material. Whilst I prefer their debut due to it offering a little more in terms of depth, if ever I'm looking for a good old fashioned bang of the head I normally look towards The Avenger.\n",
        "\nThis is another one I did for the Crypt a while back that fancied giving the shiny new treatment. As you may have noticed (if you read my reviews) I'm going along the majority of my collection from A - Z in a personal challenge to see if I can do it all before the new year. \n\nSo, onto the actual review. This was Swedish death metal superstars Amon Amarth's debut release. Back then their sound still had quite a bit in common with the regional Stockholm death metal style, although they did employ good use of melody, pushed a little further than say Dismember for instance, veering more towards Unanimated levels of melody (note I'm not comparing as similar sound, more similar ideals). It was in the melody where Amon Amarth seperated themselves from their peers, and coupled with the lyrics helped establish the whole viking thing that everyone now of course knows them for. \n\nI really like Once Sent From the Golden Hall and feel it features some of Amon Amarth's very best material. The stupendous \"The Dragons' Flight Across the Waves\" kicks some serious back-side, with some brilliant riffs and quality melodic themes. \"Victorious March\" embodies exactly what the song title promises, marching along with excellent guitar work. I had the pleasure of seeing this song live and I remember head-banging myself stupid. That fucking main riff that kicks in after the intro, man; if ever there were a riff to simultaneously bang your head and stamp your foot to this is it. Rounding out my personal picks from the album would be \"Friends of the Suncross\" which simply smokes, some great riffs and themes here. \n\nBefore the boys from Gothenburg came around and sadly bastardized the whole \"melodic death metal\" thing this was how it was done, and it always will be. Amon Amarth are a quality, reliable band and certainly one of my favorite death metal bands, especially as far as modern death metal goes. Once Sent From the Golden Hall is packed full of great music and is an essential part of any death metal collection, and for that matter any serious metal collection.\n",
        "\nI usually skip every other Amon Amarth album, considering that whatever they did with the first album will likely remain the same with the latest album. Well, the debut rules, I\u2019ll give it that, and now this latest one comes out and overall it\u2019s still the same well-produced, modern melodic death Amon Amarth\u2019s been putting out since they struck huge with With Oden On Our Side (even further than that if counting the core sound). Whereas With Oden On Our Side album I put up with the debut as the band\u2019s best, this new one I\u2019d put on the level as Versus The World. It isn\u2019t ruthless and doesn\u2019t contain the bands best writing, but the same immense scope, enjoyable songs, and ferocious intent remain. It\u2019s a humble album that has one purpose \u2013 to continue Amon Amarth\u2019s reign of consistency in the melodic death scene. With its share of awesome songs that translate impeccably in concert, Surtur Rising has enough that prevents it from failing hard.\n\nOff the bat, \u201cWar Of The Gods\u201d throws a fast tempo, hectic riffs, epic leads, thunderous drums, and a tsunami solo to eat up. For any release, this is a textbook example of what to open up with, and in a concert setting this doesn\u2019t fail one bit. \u201cWar Of The Gods\u201d intends to get the listener pumping and energized for the rest of the trip, which lets up on speed when necessary but doesn\u2019t drop a dose of heaviness. Overall, there isn\u2019t any large dip in quality, but some songs don\u2019t tend to ignite the same vigor as others. \u201cWar Of The Gods\u201d, \u201cSlaves Of Fear\u201d, \u201cLive Without Regrets\u201d, \u201cThe Last Stand Of Frej\u201d, and \u201cA Beast Am I\u201d are the songs that offer the most on every front musically, while the others are sort of the same Amon Amarth-standard padding. Good songs, the rest of the lot, but the real treat lies in those five aforementioned tracks. Production for all these tracks is fat, clear, and polished without being overtly modern and vilifying.\n\nJohan Hegg\u2019s growls are bellowing, up front, and clear as can be for such a well-produced album. They haven\u2019t changed a bit, and that\u2019s perfectly fine since their warm and unperturbed tones invite the listener with relaxed affinity. On the lighter side he\u2019s calm, but his lower grunts are the ones I prefer due to their girth. The slower, warlike rhythms in songs like \u201cThe Last Stand Of Frej\u201d are great examples of the seamless coexistence between this sincere, inviting attitude. Andersson\u2019s blend of assaulting double bass, snare hits, and warlike gallops continue to add to the band\u2019s experienced, melodic death twist. In favor of the riffs, \u201cA Beast Am I\u201d is up there with the best on the album, pressing forward with savagery and despondence like latter era God Dethroned. Surtur Rising\u2019s chunky bass always follows the rupturing barrage of abrasive riffs and the (more or less) ambitiously harmonic leads to the very end of every song (or until the epic, ghostly outro in \u201cA Beast Am I\u201d\u2019s case).\n\nAnyone digging Amon Amarth would like this album unless they have some beef with a band doing the same thing over and over. Newcomers wouldn\u2019t have a hard time at all hearing this album as their first for the band, and I\u2019d even go as far as recommending it. Surtur Rising isn\u2019t the best album by the band, but it\u2019s certainly not totally forgettable. There\u2019s a sufficient number of tracks that stand out in the band\u2019s discography, and even those that don\u2019t stand out don\u2019t bomb.\n",
        "\nI have never really enjoyed Amon Amarth. I mean my experience with the band is limited to having listened to Twilight of the Thunder God a few times. I have a big issue with that album and it holds true with Surtur Rising as well.\n\nAmon Amarth don't seem to play melodic death metal so much as down tuned heavy metal or hard rock with death metal vocals over them. Lets keep in mind, just having death metal vocals does not make a band death metal. Are they catchy? Yes, so I can see why people like them. But in the metal community not many people seem to call them out for the fact that they play really weak melodic \"death metal\".\n\nI mean is anything on Surtur Rising any heavier than Slipknot or 5 Finger Death Punch or even Killswitch Engage? In the vocal department I can give Johan Hegg credit. He has a very death metal sounding growl. But musically this is far from death metal or even the crud that passes for melodic death metal these days.\n\nThere are some fast picked parts in songs like Tock's Taunt - Loke's Treachery Pt 2 and Destroyer of the Universe which are actually more in line with what you would normally hear in the genre. But for every one of these parts you have stuff like The Last Stand of Frej or their cover of the System of a Down track Aerials. A Beast I Am is actually a pretty decent song and the furthest away from the heavy rock/metal style they play in. Its both aggressive and heavy which makes me wish they could have done this throughout the entire album.\n\nSo for those looking for good melodic death metal rather than hard rock on steroids I suggest you look elsewhere. While the vocals are good and some of the tracks (A Beast I Am, Live Without Regrets, Destroyer of the Universe) are good, most of it is just watered down metal lite with death metal vocals over it. In fact the best part of this album is probably the cool album artwork. I'm sure there are plenty more enticing bands and albums out this year than this drivel. \n\nOriginally reviewed @ http://abaddonsmetalshop.blogspot.com/\n",
        "\nAmon Amarth has always been a good viking/melodic death metal band, plain and simple! A band with great charisma, strength and determination to dominate the European metal scene, Amon Amarth definitely don't mess around with the important bits, especially not with this album! Twilight of the Thunder God is same old AA, sad to say really. Viking folklore and mythology is their usual schtick, before you crazy AA fans cry foul, Amon Amarth is, without a doubt, the only band that actually makes me think and fantasize about viking folk tales. \"Thunder\" is really a portal to the past, to the old days of axes, killing and pillaging, a viking's life. When you pop this into your stereo or switch it on your MP3, you feel like you've entered a completely different world full of life and viking myths. A real treat to any AA or Norse mythology fan such as myself.\n\nTime for the music, did it suck major ass? There's one answer to that one: no. They really delivered, sure it's nothing new really, it's what you'd expect. However, the production is clear, better and louder! The entire band seemed to step up a notch in terms of sound quality, everything has a certain togetherness, meaning the band unity and overall musicianship is very high and taken seriously. This album would've been 100% if not for the same old song and dance that AA has brought to the table, I mean seriously, can they sing other than Vikings or Norse mythology? Maybe not, it's their thing and it's what people expect, but I would prefer them to sing about something else from time to time. That's not just the only reason why I gave this album an 85. I felt like some of the songs are something I've already heard before like the \"Live For The Kill\" chorus riff sounds just like \"Cry of the Black Birds\" from their previous album or even \"Embrace of the Endless Ocean\" has the outro riff to \"Gods Of War Arise\" from their album \"With Oden on Our Side\". In way it feels like I've heard it all before and that I've experienced it all, it also shows AA's lack of creativity by replaying, literally, the same stuff. Give those songs a listen and I'm sure you'll notice it.\n\nFor the overall band performance: Hegg's vocal power was the same as it was on any AA album, powerful and intimidating. He executed them perfectly and he deserves a pat on the back with a horn full of mead. The guitars were played beautifully, perhaps too distorted and lacked some melody but other than that it was a nice touch. The drums were good as well, although, a bit repetitive at times because you'll mostly hear the same damn drum beat over and over. It's not terrible or anything, but then again it's not stellar.\n\nThis album was mainly a repetition of AAs previous work, some riffs that you'll find are the same and they have the same melody to it also. To be honest, it's just all of their previous work that's been remastered into a new album with a different title and cover. It sounds, feels and looks good, but looks aren't everything. It's about the content, and I think AA is lacking just a bit, lacking power, creative edge and that's all. Other than that it's a good album, but you should listen to it mainly because it's Amon Amarth. I personally enjoyed it at times and I found that adding orchestra filler was a nice touch, well done guys, but you can do better.\n",
        "\nI don\u2019t think this is a bad album, but I can\u2019t help thinking there are just so much more interesting things to listen to than With Oden On Our Side, and Amon Amarth in general. It\u2019s tough to pin down an opinion on these guys because I have no grounds to hate them and they never bother me when a song starts or anything, but at the same time they just lose my attention so quickly with their rather vapid and uninspiring songwriting - which admittedly did start to bother me as the album went on, as I yearned for something with substance to listen to, or at least something moderately entertaining. There simply isn\u2019t much to this music, and the simplicity doesn\u2019t hit hard enough for it to be one of the band\u2019s strengths.\n\nThis is pretty much the most cookie-cutter modern metal you can ask for, with little that is creative or interesting about it. The lyrics are pretty simple Viking gimmick-stuff and are delivered by the rather restrained and bland growls of Johan Hegg, worshiped the world over for reasons I\u2019ll never get. He doesn\u2019t have a bad voice but he just never lets loose and really puts his whole self into the performance, making it sound like he\u2019s just restraining himself so as to not scare anyone. He\u2019s very listenable in general, but why bother having harsh vocals if you\u2019re going to do it so tamely and unimpressively? I think this stuff would work just fine with clean vocals. It\u2019s not like this is really that extreme or anything, and the growls are just boring as it is.\n\nThe music itself is also very tame, with mostly midpaced songs that occasionally lapse into \u2018fast\u2019 sections, though never anything truly unhinged or passionate-sounding like they actually give a crap about the music they're playing. The songs are all well written and contain some decent riffs and melodies, but none of them ever break out of the stodgy and unimpressive restraint they have going. There\u2019s very little, if any, atmosphere on this, and that\u2019s largely due to the dry production job, but the rather redundant songwriting also plays a part. The riffs are tightly played, but they're also pretty unexciting on the whole. \"Runes to my Memory\" and \"Asator\" probably have the highest quotient of riffs that didn't bore me, but even those are only decent, not really any more than that. On the other hand, \"Gods of War Arise\" and \"Prediction of Warfare\" are interminal slices of undiluted blandness than I felt very tempted to skip, with dull, dull riffs and rather listless melodies that didn't do anything for me at all.\n\nEverything about this just sounds so small and average. I'm not asking for ornate prog-isms and complex songwriting, but With Oden just sounds meager. The songs' scope is small, the melodies are small, the riffs are small, the vocals are small. Nothing here aspires to greater heights; it is all very by-the-numbers and stale. The songwriting does not inspire me to bang my head or sing along, which is what it was going for, so I guess that makes it kind of a failure to me. The band seems very much content to just keep marching along and achieving only the barest minimum of quality possible, which isn't a good thing. They never do anything wrong on this, but very little right, either, and mostly I was just bored as hell listening to this. Amon Amarth have a lot of fans, and I'm sure no matter what I say, those fans won't be deterred, but me, this isn't my kind of thing, and I find it too unimaginative and uncreative to really get into. Why should I waste my time on this? I really don't see a reason. So 50%, because while I can't say this inspires any kind of rage or disgust, it is definitely lacking in any positive traits for me to give it any higher.\n",
        "\n-------ORIGINALLY WRITTEN FOR www.demrockritic.in-----------\n\n\nSo this is the time for a new Amon Amarth release. Anticipation surges through their fans like lightning from the helm of Thor\u2019s hammer Mjollnir. And just like every time in the past, that lightning crackles and glows till it strikes exactly where it counts. \u2018Surtur Rising\u2019 is heavy, narrative, emotive and one hell of a sedative. The band\u2019s epic tribute to the fire giant of Muspelheim is a fitting successor to their tribute to Asgard\u2019s thunder god.\n\nThe kick-off to the album has now been quite well heard all over the metal community thanks to the internet viral. \u2018War of the Gods\u2019 is a volatile mid-tempo fable about the war between the Vanir and Aesir gods. The song is instrumentally loaded with rhythmic patterns and textures that blend into each other through the correct tempo shifts, coming together to create a very familiar yet newly explored Amon Amarth sound. It is topped by the heavy guttural war cries of Johan Hegg who takes the idea of low frequency to a totally new level. This defines the style of the album overall. The band has a lot of familiar sounds to offer in terms of the way the notes are structured but it has also explored slower tempos, scale jumps and softer textures to a much greater extent. \u2018T\u00f6ck\u2019s Taunt: Loke\u2019s Treachery part II\u2019 is one such example where the beat is a slower groove and undulating heavy and soft sections. However, it is the 3rd song, which the band likes to call the title track albeit a different name, that is easily the juiciest part of this album. \u2018Destroyer of the Universe\u2019 is relentlessly fast, unforgivingly heavy and the chorus riff marks a return to the \u2018With Oden on Our Side\u2019 sound, firing the heavy/low tremolo ambience straight into the listener\u2019s heart, probably the most epic song that the band has to offer since \u2018Cry of the Blackbirds\u2019. Other musically experimental standouts are \u2018Slaves of Fear\u2019, \u2018Live Without Regrets\u2019, \u2018For Victory or Death\u2019, \u2018The Last Stand of Frej\u2019 and \u2018Doom Over Dead Man\u2019. All of them explore the polyrhythmic flexibility of the slower beat and also delve into octave and scale variations, particularly exemplified by the chorus section of \u2018Live Without Regrets\u2019.\n\nConceptually, the album does not tell the story of Surt\u00fcr\u2019s life and his destruction of the universe, nor the story of the war between the Aesir and Vanir. Though the former is dealt with by \u2018War of the Gods\u2019, \u2018Destroyer of the Universe\u2019 and \u2018The Last Stand of Frej\u2019, most of the other songs have a more personal point to make. \u2018Slaves of Fear\u2019 is a conceptually out-of-place modern commentary on how religious leaders have the society in their grasp by using the fear of god as a tool, \u2018Live Without Regrets\u2019 and \u2018For Victory or Death\u2019 are just general \u2018feel good\u2019 Viking songs, \u2018Wrath of the Norsemen\u2019 is a first person account of a victim of the fury of the Vikings, \u2018A Beast Am I\u2019 is a lament by Fenris, the wolf brother of the Midgard serpent Jormungandr. Their most melancholy song till date, \u2018Doom Over Dead Man\u2019 is a slow lament of a dying man who has done only wrong deeds in life.\n\nThere are moments in the album when one feels like he has heard this riff before or that the same rhythm could have some variation in each measure, but overall, this album is historic. It is their most musically experimental till date while also being the heaviest. The stories it tells are closer to the listener\u2019s heart than just a retelling of the Norse Edda. It actually completes a \u2018trinity\u2019 with the previous two releases in the emotion that one feels from them. AND, the album cover also has fire on it, symbolic of the divine fury that the band\u2019s music creates, engulfing listeners from every part of the world, uniting them with the hope that they are the last Vikings on Earth.\n",
        "\nIt will probably come as no surprise to most people that new Amon Amarth album could not only be defined by the clich\u00e9 more of the same, but maybe also by the marginally wittier \u201cif it ain\u2019t broken, don\u2019t fix it\u201d. However, with a group whose thematic notions play an important, if not fundamental, role in shaping their music, it is understandable why this is the case.\n\nWith the huge success pf predecessor, \u201cFate of norns\u201d, it makes sense why further scrutiny has been made in respect of the production for this, their follow-up, \u201cWith Oden on our side\u201d. Needless to say, producer Jens Bogren has made a sterling effort from atmospheric opener \u201cValhalla awaits me\u201d, to majestic closer \u201cPrediction of warfare\u201d. Formidable frontman Johan Hegg, is also firing on all cylinders as he reminisces with booming nostalgia, the past lives of Viking honor and their noble raping, pillaging and conquests. Along with the impressive title track, other notables include \u201cHermod\u2019s ride to Hel (Lokes treachery part1)\u201d and \u201cGods of war arise\u201d, that all demonstrate the sheer vocal extremities and quality musicianship within. But the primary appeal of this album is the impeccable balance of melody and harsh, Scandinavian death metal, a skill that most groups rarely pull off well. The painstaking production emphasises this aspect of Amon Amarth even more so this time round and the epic riffing of Johan S\u00f6derberg and Olavi Mikkonen helps the album to this end. However, with the craze of its predecessor dying off slightly, fans may find the new offering to be a little too predictable for it to achieve anything on the scale that \u201cFate of norns\u201d did. After all, it came when the whole Viking-metal obsession was becoming more appealing again, whereas \u201cWith Oden...\u201d comes just as everyone\u2019s beginning to tire of it.\u2019\n\nNevertheless, a much welcome limited edition digipak version of the album will feature many collectables. These include two live tracks from their immense 2am performance at Wacken Open Air in 2004, two demo versions from tracks off \u201cWith Oden...\u201d and two tracks from the 1997 Sunlight studio recordings.\n",
        "\nThe first Amon Amarth song I ever heard was \"An Ancient Sign of Coming Storm,\" and from then on I was hooked. That being said, I've owned their debut album for a long time, but have never seriously listened to it. After doing so, and listening to several other of their albums, I can see a progression in their music from good to great.\n\nMusically, Amon Amarth plays a fast, somewhat thrash oriented death metal, yet they skillfully incorporate melody and harmony into their music. It has an epic feel, has if by putting your headphones on, you're instantly transported into a Norse saga. \n\nThe guitars are down tuned, and every riff is a thing of beauty. The opening track, title track, and \"Abandoned,\" have a certain thrash sound to the guitar playing, albeit somewhat heavier, slower, and more melodic sounding. Amon Amarth expertly uses their guitars to create wonderful and aesthetically pleasing harmonies. \"Without Fear,\" the solo on the opening track and the riff on \"Victorious March\" are prime examples of this. The drums essentially only serve to provide a backbone to the music, and keep the beat going steadily. I feel that the band could have utilized their drummer more effectively but I am highly satisfied with the end result.\n\nLyrically, every one of Amon Amarth's songs is a Norse epic saga. The opening track describes a father's anger and sorrow over the loss of his son. \"Abandoned,\" tells the tale of a dying warrior who feels abandoned by the traditional native Gods for accepting a new, foreign one, and the beautifully crafted \"Friends of the Suncross,\" tells a tale about five warriors triumphantly riding into battle together. Hegg and his band mates obviously read the tales from their country's history, and expertly merged them into their music to give it a distinctly \"Norse\" feel to it. \n\nJohann Hegg's vocals are one of my favorite, and least favorite things about the album. For the most part, his vocals are very skillfully done throughout the entire album; however he has his low points. The style that Hegg uses on the debut is different from the more polished, deeper, and ultimately better sound he would use on later releases. Yet on the debut, his voice has a pleasant booming quality to it. Imagine that you're in Scandinavia in the Viking Age, and you're being enthralled by tales of the Norse gods and legends by an expert storyteller that makes you sit on the edge of your seat. That storyteller is Johann Hegg, who masterfully uses his voice to achieve this effect.\n\nHowever, Hegg does have some flaws. At certain points on \"The Dragons Flight Across the Waves,\" and \"Without Fear,\" he does this awkward sounding thing where he attempts to combine his growls with a combination of a shout and a battle cry that doesn't come out very well. The low points of Hegg's vocals aren't helped by the albums poor production, which produces a fuzzy sound all the way through, and drags the quality of the album down and prevents it from realizing its full potential, and renders the bass pretty much inaudible, at least to my ears.\n\nOverall however, the album is superb and the good points make up for the poor production quality. It certainly is a triumphant start to the bands career.\n",
        "\nYou can learn alot of little things listening to all types of different music. Billy Jean not being young enough. Lemmy's preference of female is the highest card in the deck. Not tugging on Superman's cape. Things like that. But in the end, you don't fuck with Amon Amarth! I mean that would be like Loki telling Thor \"oh and by the way, I also chopped off your wife's braids last night. Can you bury the hatchet, bro?\" You don't do it. They may be signed to Metal Blade and open for Dimmu Borgir but so what? They don't trash hotel rooms. They pillage them. They don't bang groupies but throw axes at their locks. They play marbles with Shagrath's balls while teabagging Akercocke after the show. Putting some Satan metal in its place. Hailing Odin and all that happy hooey, you get the gist. Another thing you don't do is call this album \"'melodeath\". In Flames plays melodeath. Amon Amarth play epic death metal and Fate of Norns is marked as Exhibit E for epic or for the discographically challenged: their fifth full-length. I was going to prescribe my own colloquialism for this album under 'epideath' but I decided that it sounded too much like a bogus trademark name for the juice some quack injected Chris Benoit with. Okay, that was cold but so equally brutal is the metal heard on Fate of Norns! And yet the melodies employed by the band here make the violence sound so sharp. They make the story of the warring Norsemen so winning. Fate of Norns seizes the day. \n\nAn Ancient Sign of Coming Storm. Amon Amarth are death metal's proper counterpart to Immortal is what this song convinced me of. Again, it's about learning things from music! The riffs are cold and fast tremolos. Guitars harmonizing away with Fredrik's drumming evoking intimidation to match. Onwards warpath. Always blazing. At 3:26 the song fades down depicting the eye of the storm that accompanies an oncoming Viking battle. Johan Hegg growls describe the scenery; blood, wooden arrows, bad weather and the will for victory. The following track starts slow and you can hear an eerie wind blow before anything. I really like how the band sets the album up this way by providing an epic atmosphere. Almost all their albums begin with songs just as fast as An Ancient Sign and the second songs may be faster or perhaps slower. In this case, what I liked is that the track listing seems particularly stage managed for dramatic effect. The example I use is the Star Wars opening theme with its rousing crescendo that automatically drifts in to the next scene composition which usually settles down low to establish an opening setting which will then typically ratchet up quite quickly as the action takes place. The band does this very same thing on Fate of Norns. It also goes without saying that the record as a whole is a simpler and tidier production this time around. The sole focus is aggression from song to song. Essentially all the music are built for lyrical narration. There are no hooks or extended leads. The guitars are almost always rhythm oriented the whole time Johan sings verses describing Norse battle. \n\nThe most obvious thing that stands out is how uniform the songs are. The opening riff of track 1 sounds much like the concluding riff on The Pursuit of Vikings played at almost the same pace too. Some people point that out as one of the biggest weaknesses of this album. I think it works well. Fate of Norns is relentless and doesn't let you take a breath from the action for very long. Similar riffs are employed as quasi-leitmotifs here which is unusual for bands like this. Everything sounds faster than usual despite having an average runtime compared to the other albums. I think The Fate of Norns is probably AA's most simplified song. The riffs and drum beats are pretty much designed around that whole chorus. It contains rousing groove type riffs and a fiery midsection of epic winding down describing a Norseman carrying his dead son in his arms. You can hear the wail of sadness. As I told you, there is compelling drama told in these songs and that's why the arrangements are shored up. \n\nThis band is so fucking cool. They compress so much detail into furiously fast melodic death metal. It's like they're documenting while playing. They don't skimp on the estimates either. Hence lyrics like \"one thousand men and five hundred horsemen\" and \"two thousand warriors died that day-most of them Danes.\" That's one helluva ballpark figure. If only those armies had an S-3 staffed by Amon Amarth. \n\nAnd when that Viking horn sounds out on Arson, you know this epic album is winding down in dramatic fashion. This is yet another epistolary fashioned song. This one burns appropriately. Soaring guitars and the sounds of flames engulfing the homestead. Revenge is the theme alluded to for the next song called Once Sealed in Blood. It is the final track and I found it pretty weak to end the album. It's got a vengeful harmony running along but the song wholly seems rushed. The drums lose that rattling fury to back the bass too. \n\nEven if the band themselves don't find this album as awesome as I do, I can just turn it up full blast until my room is shaking so much I can appeal to my Amon Amarth bobbleheads instead. It isn't as great as Once Sent but few albums are. The last song poops out and Valkyries Ride while containing one of the best death metal opening riffs ever, doesn't take full advantage of them. However, I'm a big fan of this album. You can even say I drink the \"Faterade\" and it leaves me with a drunken smile that says 'Got Mead?'\n",
        "\nI really wonder why many of my metal brothers claim that this is Amon Amarth\u2019s weakest album. I couldn\u2019t disagree more. I think some of them haven\u2019t given it enough spins, which is a shame. Or perhaps is it that they prefer when the five vikings just pummel things to the ground with their faster and more complex tunes, which I do enjoy greatly. But for me, sheer ferocity and complexity are not everything in metal. And I\u2019m convinced that this is one of Amon Amarth\u2019s greatest records because, combined with their usual display of aggression, it has an unbridled feeling of melancholy none of their other albums possess.\n\nIt\u2019s true, this is less fast and hard-hitting than other Amon Amarth releases. Songs rely more on tremolo picking riff repetition, have more straightforward structures, simpler yet solid rhythms, and all eight compositions reside within mid-tempo range, with only the excellent closer \u201cOnce Sealed in Blood\u201d reaching some fairly speedy moments. Also, there\u2019s only one guitar solo on this record, more precisely in the middle part of \u201cArson\u201d, and honestly is nothing special. However it turns out the riffs found here are quite catchy, ensnaring and instantly transporting you to the Viking era. The simple yet epic-feeling riffage of the opener \u201cAn Ancient Sign of Coming Storm\u201d testifies that. Thunder of sword and shield indeed!\n\nMost of the melodic lines here are extremely melancholic, not like in a clich\u00e9d gothic metal release, but truly woeful yet aggressive at the same time. I found them to be truly moving, especially the ones on \u201cArson\u201d and the title-track, which combined with its tragic lyrics sometimes manage to almost squeeze a tear out of me\u2026 well almost. While most Amon Amarth albums have varying degrees of melancholy and fury with varying degrees, Fate of Norns is indisputably the most sorrowful, and that\u2019s where its strength resides. Perhaps the problem most fans find here, is that it doesn\u2019t have the same amount of \u201cepic glory\u201d and \u201cbattlefield atmosphere\u201d as both the album that precedes this and the one that succeeds it, yet it exists, particularly in the tracks \u201cThe Beheading of a King\u201d and the ominous \u201cValkyries Ride\u201d.\n\nAs the famed architect Mies van der Rohe said, \u201cLess is more\u201d. All of the songs here are memorable despite being simple, and I enjoy them all, which is something I can\u2019t say about most Amon Amarth albums, especially the ones before this one. There\u2019s no filler here. And the production is perfect, you can hear everything clearly enough, including the rich bass tones of\u2026 well, the bass itself and the drums. I think this is a pretty appropriate album for the non-fan to step into the Viking world of Amon Amarth, since other albums feature more brutal and complex compositions yet this one includes all the signature elements of this band. Well, I guess that depends on what type of non-fan listens to this. Fans of brutal death will probably dismiss this, yet fans of classic metal might like it more. \n\nSo, let\u2019s see, good songs? In my honest opinion, all of them are worthy. My personal favorites include the opener, of which I love the ending folksy melodies, the vengeful closer (I wonder if they will continue this tale in a future album), the single-like \u201cThe Pursuit of Vikings\u201d and the sorrowful title-track.\n",
        "\nIt takes alot to live up to a name that means 'Mount Doom' in Tolkien's Sindarin language, but Sweden's Amon Amarth do excactly that. This band has been in constant eruption since its fantastic debut back in 1998. Although their sound has certainly progressed, they've never lost that galloping sound that makes you want to destroy everything and headbang until you can't move. \n\nThat being said, this album is a prime example of Amon Amarth's unique style of melodic death metal. The guitar anthems are just as epic as they always are, although there is that slight hint of progression that's evident in every sequential Amon Amarth release. The musicians are as tight as ever, leaving no single instrument standout (which is good because they're all brilliant). The only problem with the instruments is that sometimes the bass is not audible (nothing unusual for metal though) and the guitar riffs lack memorability. The production is really high-profile and solid. I love the guitar tone and the way the vocals are always a bit higher in the mix. Thd drums are really professional; some really nice fills are to be found here! I despise the System Of A Down cover, not because the original is a mallcore song, but because i believe they recorded it just to gain attention since that band is re-uniting this year and such a big hype is being created. They did it just for money in my opinion. I'm not going to talk about each individual track, because I believe a track-by-track review for this album is useless, since it is better enjoyed and absorbed if listened to as a full album.\n\nOverall this is a very solid release and quite enjoyable and fun. The only things that i don't like are the cover song and the lack of memorabity in some songs (it is quite rare though). So far though it is early, 2011 has been a great year for metal and this release is one of the best so far.\n\nHighlights ; 'War of the Gods' , 'Live Without Regrets' , 'For Victory or Death' , 'A Beast Am I' .\n",
        "\nAmon Amarth, the way I see it, is one of those great fallback groups, one you can always count on when the shitheads of \u201cmetal\u201d pollute tours and album stores with their dreck. This listener has maintained a sort of awe with the way these Swedish monsters come back time and again with increasingly tantalizing albums chock full of Mjolner-swinging, bone-crushing melodic nastiness, and while it\u2019s taken way too long for them to follow up on the superb \u201cTwilight of the Thunder God\u201d, still I sat and waited as patiently as can be, albeit a touch jumpy at the prospect of seeing if they can continue this trend of fantasticness.\n\n\u201cTwilight\u2026\u201d may have set the bar rather high for \u2018Amarth, but I can give the benefit of the doubt should it be due, and am ready to see if any storms of Valhalla will cascade all around me\u2026\n\nIt may have been a while, but the rising of Surter is certainly worth the wait. Coupling the tried-and-true melodic heaviness with a few bouts of calmer, slower moments, \u201cSurter Rising\u201d again reminds the listener of the necessity of Amon Amarth in this era of musical wastelands popping up all around us. And while this might not be as up to par as \u201cTwilight\u2026\u201d and \u201cWith Oden At Our Side\u201d, I don\u2019t hold it against them as this new collection of Viking hymns is still as addictive and satisfying in its own right. That sense of sword-swinging superiority is still large and in charge as the dark and brutal riffs, nerve-tingling melodic leads, punishing double-bass drum work and raging growls/roars continue to fascinate and evoke compelling urges to sail across the closest Great Lake and conquer the first town I come across. Surely, this is music meant to be the penultimate soundtrack to divide, conquer, and dominate, something that augments that desire to do away with those pesky enemies and naysayers (well\u2026rhetorically, of course\u2026don\u2019t wanna be responsible for the actions of anyone reading too much into my words\u2026), and both extremes of the spectrum, from the harmonious to the violent, work in the proper cohesion necessary for an album of its caliber to maintain its awesomeness. The production also helps in this regard, as its thickness and overwhelming sound envelop any would-be listeners within the smoldering brimstone of their tales of godly murder and vengeful rhetoric, the bread and butter of finer \u2019Amarth albums the world over. Time has certainly been good to these Swedish goons, the way their teeth and proverbial axes have been cut so finely that songs like \u201cDestroyer of the Universe\u201d, \u201cLive Without Regrets\u201d, and \u201cFor Victory or Death\u201d have all the energy and ability necessary to destroy without needing to force themselves to do so.\n\nAt the end of the day, Amon Amarth again dominates with the same powerfully brutal melody that\u2019s kept them on the radar lo these many years. This is a fine example of knowing that they have plenty of pith and vinegar in them, and it surely an album to come back to time and again. Hails!\n",
        "\nA highly expected release, Amon Amarth\u2019s eight full-length, really isn\u2019t as good as it should have been. The signs were all right. From the title and the fiery (as expected) breathtaking artwork to the song titles. And most importantly, the band in question, as the norsemen, almost since their inception, have been providing the metal world with great release after great release, and I do firmly believe that with every album they perfected or further explored successfully an element of their brand of viking-themed melodic death metal, especially on their last four LP\u2019s. From the searing melancholy of the often-underrated Fate of Norns, to the majestic perfection of With Oden On Our Side and the catchiness of Twilight of the Thunder God, Amon Amarth brimmed with quality and excellent delivery. \n\nSo what\u2019s the problem with Surtur Rising? It seams to me they decided to play it safe and not experiment further. There are no attempts to pursue a different path or risk a tiny bit, even within their established formula. It\u2019s not so grave of a problem, since this is a pretty consistent album anyway, and some songs do kick the expected ass. For instance, \u201cWar of the Gods\u201d, the opener, reminds us this is still an Amon Amarth album, and no matter how clich\u00e9d it is, you\u2019ll surely bang your head to its nordic tunes. \u201cDestroyer of the Universe\u201d is a blazing scorcher, and sort of a title-track, with pyroclasmic percussion and a couple of solos that burn your ears like the fires of Ragnar\u00f6k. \u201cLive Without Regrets\u201d reminds me of the epic battlefield feeling of last year\u2019s AEALO from greek metallers Rotting Christ (so it\u2019s actually a big compliment in case you\u2019re wondering). \n\nOther good songs are \u201cFor Victory or Death\u201d which could have been a track from their previous album because of its rocky catchiness, \u201cA Beast I Am\u201d, a fast pummeling song about Fenris (enough said!) that concludes with a clamed melodic outro, and the closer \u201cDoom Over Dead Man\u201d, a waltzing mellow dirge with sporadic mild orchestral arrangements that is perhaps the greatest innovation to be found here. The rest of the songs are solid enough, but tainted with the \u201ctoo much of the same\u201d illness, especially \u201cSlaves of Fear\u201d, another anti-Christianity stance, which is inferior to many similarly-themed past efforts by the vikings like the outstanding \u201cA Thousand Years of Oppression\u201d from Versus the World to name the first that comes to mind. Also \u201cWrath of the Norsemen\u201d and \u201cT\u00f6ck\u2019s Taunt\u201d were a bit disappointing and don\u2019t live up to the hype and expectation created by their titles.\n\nProduction and musicianship are top notch as expected, from Johan Hegg\u2019s mighty roars to the pounding skinbashing of Fredrik Andersson. In that aspect, there\u2019s not much room for improving. However, most of the compositions are not challenging enough and feel like recycled ideas from past albums, and that drains Surtur Rising of both originality and personality. \n\nI really wanted and expected this album to surpass its predecessor, because Twilight of the Thunder God was a bit of a step back in comparison to the flawless masterpiece that was With Oden On Our Side, but it appears that Amon Amarth has reached a point in which their releases are no longer going to surpass each other. Instead, now at the top echelons of international metal, they might take it easy and comfortably release solid quality material from time to time, ala Mot\u00f6rhead, which we will undoubtedly devour as loyal fans but it won\u2019t blow our minds like it did before. For the sake of us metalheads around the globe, let\u2019s hope a new world of creativity and delivery is born for this melodeath masters after the fires of Surtr are extinguished.\n",
        "\nSo this is the first full length album from the metal giants Amon Amarth, and it certainly does not fail to meet expectations. While this is a far cry from the intensely melodic death metal that comes from their more recent albums, this is still fairly melodic. It is still clearly death metal, however, as made apparent by the tremolo picked guitar riffs and the quick double bass pedals in the background. Their style becomes more defined later on in their career, but this only contains a hint of that intense Viking atmosphere.\n\nAs I usually do, I will divide the album\u2019s songs into two categories based on the length of the song. The long songs on this album are merely Victorious March, Abandoned, and Amon Amarth, while the rest of the songs on the album make up the slightly shorter section. So, without further procrastination on my part, let\u2019s begin.\n\nThe longer songs on this album are certainly some of the strongest, as Amon Amarth and Victorious March have become live staples for the band at their live shows. Both Victorious March and Abandoned are similar in the way they are written; the song is mostly a repetition of different riffs in a pattern that is repeated. In a way, the entire song can be viewed as a refrain in a very mainstream styled analysis. That\u2019s not to say it\u2019s boring; Victorious March features an extensive solo section and Abandoned blows the top off of your head with a sick breakdown at the end. Yeah I called it a breakdown. Deal with it scene haters.\n\nAmon Amarth is an entirely different entity though. It is much the same melody repeated throughout the song, and it weighs heavily in influence from doom and stoner metal. The band adds flavor like tremolo picking that basic melody and experimenting with the tempo with the drumming. This song also features the best(also the most nerdy) lyrics on the entire album. It is a challenge of modern physiology to not head bang to this song in all of its epic glory nonetheless.\nThe rest of the album contains songs that are shorter in length, averaging somewhere around 4 and half minutes (that is a pure guess). This includes Ride for Vengeance, The Dragon\u2019s Flight Across the Waves, Without Fear, Friends of the Suncross, and the title track. These songs never dwell too long on one riff or another, but are always based around a main riff. The length suits these songs well, as you get enough of everything but it does not feel drawn out. \n\nAll of these songs feature guitar solos, all of which are as epic as a lobster knife fight. The best are on The Dragon\u2019s Flight Across the Waves and Without Fear. These are also the best of the short songs, with Johan Hegg dominating on vocals and lyrics, while the guitars remain super fast and the drums provide a nice backdrop of pounding ferocity. Ride for Vengeance and Friends of the Suncross are nice blends of thrash and melodic death metal, and it is difficult not to headbang to. The vocals falter at times here as well the drums, but the guitar riffing is solid here and throughout the album. A word on Ride for Vengeance, now. The song opens the album with a massive chord of Viking brutality that imbeds itself upon your pitiful eardrums. This album happened to be the first CD I played on my new stereo, and, as you can imagine, I had no idea of the volume controls. As a result this chord blasted out at maximum volume and almost blew the speakers, but IT WAS EPIC.\n\nThe final track of the album, which bears the same name, is a bit of a mystery to me. I have difficulty understanding it all as everything blends together in a chaos that is rather unpleasant to me. The outro is very unorthodox but it doesn\u2019t work for me. Even the church bells, which usually are a great addition to a song, feel out of place here. The lyrics are odd, Hegg\u2019s vocals strike a poor chord, and the drums feel too random, unlike the precise offbeat drumming in Friends of the Suncross. It is a very poor way to end the album, but I does not ruin it such that the first 7 songs are absolutely amazing.\n\nI also had the pleasure of purchasing the rerelease of the album, which included a live version of the album played in its entirety, as well as information from the band about the recording and writing of the album. It sounds amazing live and Hegg works the crowd while maintaining his roar very well, and the live distortion in the guitars doesn\u2019t take that much away. The solos are even more epic live. The huge (by comparison to other CD booklets) booklet contains a lot of cool comments from the band as well as a lot of pictures from the band at the time. I don\u2019t think I would have enjoyed this album as much without these added bonuses.\n\nIn short I would highly recommend to this album, as it contains all the elements of melodic death metal that has made Amon Amarth as famous as they are today. All the instrumentals are there in perfect harmony with some minor blunders along the way. Johan Hegg is a beast as he tells tales of Vikings killing and pillaging. This is a must for new fans to the band like me, although almost anything by them is good (I hate Fate of the Norns). Best songs: The Dragon\u2019s Flight Across the Waves, Without Fear, Victorious March, and Friends of the Suncross. But stay away from the title track, as epic as it sounds.\n",
        "\nI will skip the long introduction as any metal head already knows Amon Amarth and might have his or her own opinion about it. Let's get this straight: I think that the image and style of the band is rather silly and closed minded but I liked some of their past albums. I have now listened to the new album several times and to facilitate my review, I decided to divide it into ten points. \n\n1.) Package: The first thing you can analyze when you buy a disc is the package and the relation between the offered material and the prize. This point is maybe the strongest one of the album. For a good price you don't only get ten new songs but also a bonus DVD that features 33 (!) live songs from four different concerts. That's a lot of material and might attract old and new fans and guarantee many hours of metal entertainment. The limited edition offers a nice statue and two bonus tracks and there is also a third bonus song for the Ap(pl)e generation. That's way more than other bands would do. \n\nMy verdict here: 10/10 \n\n2.) Production: The production is generally well done but I miss some edges and some energy that would rate this album up and make it heavier. The sound is not bad but not quite outstanding and it lacks of a soul and atmosphere because I think the sound is somewhat neutral and emotionless. \nMy verdict here: 5/10 \n\n3.) Expectations: Does this album offer what it pretends? It surely does and anybody that listens to Amon Amarth knows what he might get delivered - rather slow paced melodic death metal. But there is a little problem about it. The band always pretends to refer to the Viking history and Norse mythology. Concerning the lyrics, that might be true, but the image of the band is filled with ridiculous stereotypes of grim and brutal Vikings and the music has no mythological, historic or epic touch at all. There is nothing epic about the songs, they are sharp, short and sweet and the band could also sing about anything else and it would fit to the same kind of music. \n\nMy verdict here: 5/10 \n\n4.) Innovation: The band offers nothing new in here, the album is just another typical Amon Amarth album and it doesn't seem as if the band would have had a certain artistically goal or intention concerning the record. If one has one of the older records of the band and is not a fan boy, there is no reason to buy the new stuff. The older albums often varied more and something special from time to time which isn't the case in here. \n\nMy verdict here: 0/10 \n\n5.) Fan base: The next point is connected to the previous one. Even though the band isn't innovating at all and more conservative and closed minded as their Viking ancestors, this album might please to the old fan base. If you like the general style of Amon Amarth, you might also like this album. But it won't mostly be amongst your favourite record of the band on the other hand. \n\nMy verdict here: 5/10 \n\n6.) Catchiness: If the songs are not innovating or surprising are they at least catchy? Are there great choruses, tons of sharp riffs and catchy melodies? Not at all, not a single chorus or melody stays on my mind after several tries. The riffs are sharp but sound very much like the previous stuff. The songs are all quite repeating the same style and not one single track stands out. \n\nMy verdict here: 0/10 \n\n7.) Strength: If the songs are neither catchy nor innovating, do they at least have a lot of power and energy? As I said, there is a lack of emotion and atmosphere on the album and I must admit that the guitar riffs sound used and that the vocal range quite limited and bored. The clinical production doesn't save this point either. But as there is no true epic song or even ballad on the album, the songs are mostly straight forward and there are at least some good guitar solos from time to time that show that the band has got some talent. \n\nMy verdict here: 5/10 \n\n8.) Lifetime: What is the lifetime of the album? Will this record be a classic in a few years? Is this a visionary album? Is this an album that takes some time to grow and when it ultimately grows, it will be a great record? No, this is really just one of many Amon Amarth records and I think that it might be considered as one of their less impressive records and filler albums in the near future. The album is not visionary; it is boring, conservative and dumb. This album may be of interest until the concerts and next release for the tough fan base but that's all. \n\nMy verdict here: 0/10 \n\n9.) Touring: Sometimes, there is the phenomenon that songs don't work quite well on a record but much better during the live concerts. I think that the songs from \"Surtur rising\" may sound less clinical and straighter in front of a crowd. The sharp riffs and especially the guitar solos may sound more natural and energizing. But there are no songs like the live classics \"Victorious march\", \"The pursuit of Vikings\" or \"Death in fire\" on this record. The songs may be better but not exceptional. \n\nMy verdict here: 5/10 \n\n10.) Concurrence: I compared the new record to the old works of the band, but one must also do a comparison to other bands of the same genre. I must admit that must of the so called Viking metal bands such as Ensiferum or Tyr sound more authentic, epic and progressive than Amon Amarth. If we compare this album to the big classics of bands such as Bathory, the record fails even more. At least, it mostly sounds better and more convincing like many new hyped bands of the genre such as Swashbuckle or at some points Alestorm. If we compare the album to the releases of other melodic death metal bands, Amon Amarth easily beat the overrated posers of Children of Bodom but bands such as In Flames lately proved that they can innovate and look beyond the frontiers of a single genre which Amon Amarth clearly don't do. \n\nMy verdict here: 5/10 \n\nIn the end, all those aspects lead to a final rating of forty weak points. This album might only please to the solid fan base of the band or people that simply want to bang their heads during the next concerts. Concerning the aspects of atmosphere, innovation and catchiness, the band completely fails. With their poser attitude of grim Vikings in the band photos and a cover that has the same level of intelligence and innovation as the covers of the Manowar albums, this popular and overrated band is one of the reasons why people that are not that much into metal often have a bad idea and negatively wrong impression of the whole musical culture. Most metal heads don't care but I have experienced several times that many people I know associate the term \"metal\" to superficial music like this and miss out some progressive, symphonic or power metal acts that they might actually like. Only modern gore and core music, nasty poser bands and extreme black metal sickness are worse than this stuff. Don't get me wrong, I personally like harder metal genres and listen to a lot of Gothic, Viking and Thrash Metal and even to some atmospheric Black and Death stuff from time to time, but this here is completely ass and a good example for a dumb and uninspiring hype band. This band wants to represent a \"true\" Viking style but the truth is that those hard guys are completely silly and the music sucks from an objective point of view. The progression and somewhat interesting aspects of the last two records of the band (which I liked and which convinced me to give them a chance for this one) seem to be erased with this downfall. \n\nMy final verdict: Don't believe the hype and try out other metal genres or other bands of the same genre. If you happen to like the band or if you want to discover them, I would rather suggest you to try out \"Once sent from the golden hall\" or the more recent \u201cWith Oden on our side\u201d- they had much more diversity and atmosphere and have the rights and reasons to be considered as classics or at least strong albums. I would give at least the double of the points I gave to this new record to them. \n\nOr to finish my review with a few words for the German fans to describe this new record briefly: \u201cAmon Amarth = Am Arsch\".\n",
        "\nAmon Amarth could be likened to a favorite beer mug that is specifically designated for mead consumption. Apart from those who obsess with the particular beverage common to the Varangian pallet and have an affinity with an orthodox, non-folksy variant on melodeath, it\u2019s a glass drinking implement that might only be used every now and then, but it has its place even among those not particularly of the persuasion in question. The ebbs have been few, and the flows many with regards to this mainstay of Swedish brand excellence with a guttural voice, and there has been a particularly noteworthy streak of late, with the newly released \u201cSurtur Rising\u201d being the third installment. Named for a mythical giant whose great flaming sword would engulf the Earth at Ragnar\u00f6k (according to the Poetic and Prose Eddas), this is yet another album that successfully lives up to the grandiose imagery it portrays.\n\nIn most respects, this is a pure stylistic continuation of the post \u201cFate Of Norns\u201d era of the band featuring the usual mixture of up tempo majesty, catchy riffing, and dark berserker barks. At the same time, this is also something of a further refinement of the same sound that merges the best elements of \u201cWith Oden On Our Side\u201d and \u201cTwilight Of The Thunder God\u201d. The energetic tendencies of the former are on full display as the majority of the songs are fast and riff happy, while the somewhat lighter and melodic tendencies of the latter have given them a catchiness that is comparable to power metal at times. These are songs that are easy to get into, and also easy to become addicted to, despite the fairly simple model that shapes the whole. Basically this is the sort of standard verse/chorus approach to songwriting that could pass for radio, yet the quality is still just a bit too high and the edges too extreme for most rock radio stations to touch it.\n\nThere is hardly a moment where one can avoid being saturated with grand images of horses galloping, volcanoes exploding and a great sword of fire cutting down all foes in its wake. As the fast paced \u201cWar Of The Gods\u201d kicks off the album, a familiar air to that of the hit title song off the last album becomes obvious, albeit the riff set is heavier and the atmosphere much more bleak, as if fate is about to smack the entire world head on. The usual flurry of tremolo melodies and rumbling drum work pounds the earth on \u201cDestroyer Of The Universe\u201d and \u201cLive Without Regrets\u201d, but the implicit flames of chaos that are communicated through each note scorch the land with greater intensity. And when all seems to be another exercise in tried and true, the album closes on a high note with an orchestrated epic in \u201cDoom Over Dead Man\u201d, with string sounds shimmering over a bleak, slow moving set of fatalistic guitar lines. Likewise, the lead guitar work that pops in and out of many of these songs is a bit more active than it has been in a long time, and without the assistance of guest slots from technicians like Rope Latvia.\n\nPretty much everything that is expected of an Amon Amarth release happens on this album, and it kicks ass all the same. This is the sort of quality material meant for those who already know exactly what they are looking for and want it served in a predictable fashion. Speaking for myself, this band is at its best when they put together triumphant, power metal tinged classics like the title song on \u201cTwilight Of The Thunder God\u201d, and a musical continuation of that classic mixture of death metal vocal wickedness and heroic catchiness can be found on \u201cFor Victory Or Death\u201d. No new converts will likely be won over by this album, but given the near universal appeal of this band, messing with a winning sound is anything but a good idea, and these Vikings show a definite preference for seeking familiar lands to plunder.\n\nOriginally submitted to (www.metal-observer.com) on March 30, 2011.\n",
        "\nAmon Amarth is nothing if not consistent. This is their eighth album and the Swedish band still has a knack for crafting catchy songs and infectious melodies. Amon Amarth has always been an impressively melodic band, but that has always been lurking a little bit beneath the surface of their crushing riffs and singer Johan Hegg's deep guttural roars. However, on this release, Amon Amarth actually does sound as if they are focusing on the melodies.\n\nThis is not a massive change of pace for Amon Amarth. The band has been stripping away the death metal sound for quite some time. This is just a natural progression for the band. While this is not as heavy of a release for the band, it is still very clearly them. It is still recognizable.\n\nAll of the other elements are still present. Hegg's vocals sound just as powerful as they did on their debut album. The dual guitar attack still churns out melodeath riffs and rips off some impressive solos. And the rhythm section still thunders along as the foundation of Amon Amarth's sound.\n\nAs I stated earlier, Amon Amarth still puts out some catchy songs. Opener \"War of the Gods\" is another great leading track from the band and captures the listener's attention early on. \"A Beast Am I\" is an absolutely crushing song. Most of the rest of the songs definitely have their moments and fall in line with typical Amon Amarth material.\n\nAmon Amarth has switched up the formula a little bit. While this is not an instant classic like some of their other albums, it is definitely a good album. This may disappoint some of the band's longtime fans, but it will more than likely win them many more.\n",
        "\nMy personal relationship to the work of these Viking death inheritors has fluctuated through the years, reaching peaks of affection with The Avenger and With Oden On Our Side, but sinking into domestic squabbles with the far less impressive Fate of Norns. Three years back, though, another climax arrived in Twilight of the Thunder God, which was probably their best, most accessible album. The songs were almost unanimously memorable, the production immense, and despite the Norse Cliff Notes lyrical incentives, there was clearly an immense passion for the subject matter. If anything, this is expanded upon with Surtur Rising, the 8th Amon Amarth album, almost a twin brother to its predecessor.\n\nYes, they can hardly be accused of poetic license to rival the Eddas themselves, but it's obvious that Johan Hegg and his band of Swedish sea reavers feel a strong connection to the source material which they have invested here, in tales of the great fire giant and the Gods on high. The lyrics are a little better. It's safe to say that many of the band's ever broadening fan base would have been satisfied with a near carbon copy of Twilight of the Thunder God, and to a large extent, such an effort is made manifest in this. The studio standards are enormously high, without succumbing to the sterility that often plagues other large budget, melodic death entities. The riffs are simple but effective as they were on the last two albums, the Swedes never biting off more than they feel they ought to chew. The guitars ring loudly and often, the rhythmic battery of Fredrik Andersson a perfect, churning millstone of tempo, and the plunking of Ted Lundstr\u00f6m adequate if not engrossing. You'll hear no lightening of the load in the vocal department, as Hegg continues to bluster out his gut busting grunts.\n\nThat said, there are a number of tunes marring the surface here that did little to draw in my attentions. \"War of the Gods\" is emotional but predictable, and the crushing but pensive sequel to 2006's \"Hermod's Ride to Hell', titled \"T\u00f6ck's Taunt - Loke's Treachery Part II\" is a standard mid-paced Amon Amarth swagger with little compelling hiding out in its depths, not even the calm and clean segue. \"Destroyer of the Universe\" picks up the momentum, with a surge not unlike the Twilight of the Thunder God title track. Honestly, though, it's not until \"Slaves of Fear\" that I started to bang my hammer and become absorbed to the simple, melodic thrashing and its transmutation into the arching, forceful bridge. \"Live Without Regrets\" has one of those catchy, folk epic notation patterns in its first riff, and a decent if predictable Viking breakdown; but then \"The Last Stand of Frej\" arrives, synthesizers gleaming with the grace of lost heroes behind the hammering double bass, and perhaps the climax of the entire album. Honorable mentions should also be imparted to the atmospheric closers \"A Beast I Am\" and \"Doom Over Dead Man\", which are also quite phenomenal.\n\nAre they as good as \"Guardians of Asgard\", \"Twilight of the Thunder God\", \"Tattered Banners and Bloody Flags\", or \"The Hero\" from the last album? Nah, but then they're really nothing to scoff at either, and should easily survive a good number of spins. There are also a number of cover tunes here on the various versions. \"Balls to the Wall\" (Accept) and \"War Machine\" (KISS) are functional, but the most surprising is the iTunes bonus, a fucking System of a Down cover! Not something one would expect from these Swedes, and yet somehow they transform \"Aerials\" into a product their own, with all the atmosphere of the rest of the album. If you weren't aware of the original (which I'm happy to say I wasn't), you might not even realize the band had drawn it from an external source.\n\nUltimately, if you've loathed everything this band has released since whatever sufficiently secure and obscure stopping point (say, Sorrow Throughout the Nine Worlds), then you are unlikely to feel much differently about Surtur Rising. But if you loved the last effort, then you'll probably want to peel another twenty spot from your wallet to acquire a horn or mug. Gods know, you'll want to be swinging it to most of the songs here, even if it does land somewhat short of the last two shores.\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nI have to mention that 'The Crusher' is personally important to me because this was the first Amon Amarth album I've ever heard, and also this was the one who made me their fan. Of course, later I realised that this might be their weakest effort but I still like it. The songs were written with the same Viking themes in melodic death metal style but with less outstanding moments. However, two of my favourite Amon Amarth songs were featured on this record, 'Fury Divine' and 'Bastards Of A Lying Breed'. They also remade and re-recorded the 'Risen From The Sea' from 'Thor Arise' demo, but I have to say that I prefer the original one rather than this one because of the original atmosphere, despite that the sound of the revisited song is better. Beside this, there's another remake, a Possessed cover ('Eyes of Horror'), which is okay, it has the essential old-school feeling.\n\nThe problem with the rest of the album is that those songs are rather fast than good. Okay, they are not bad either, but Amon Amarth could write way better songs (as they did before and after this release). The sound is too heavy and a bit raw so I would recommend the remastered version, the songs sound way better than the original and it comes with a cool bonus disc. Anyway, I can recommend it to those who want to become familiar with the earlier work of Amon Amarth but who don't want to start it from the very beginning. It's good for a starter, but if you want to listen to them at their top form, then Versus The World or their last two full-length is for you.\n",
        "\nWhat does make Amon Amarth stand out from the rest of death metal bands in terms of popularity? This question might seem rhetorical at first, but anyone who knows at least some of the band\u2019s work would take no more than fifteen seconds to answer it. The fact is that with their never-changing formula of \u201csmooth\u201d, mid-paced death metal with massive growls that doesn\u2019t show much technique is extremely easy to listen to, and even if they might not be your favorite death metal band, but few bands appeal to more people than Amon Amarth: apart from those who absolutely hate any form of death metal, anyone who enjoys metal a little bit tends to listen to this band once in a while.\n\n\u201cWith Oden on Our Side\u201d is surely an amazing release, and it is not because Amon Amarth chose to make it so: they were simply at their peak of creativity. There are some characteristics that make this release a little different from what the band had released before, which include louder vocals, noticeable bass and better production, but in its essence, the album is Versus the World 2.0, with catchy riffs, creative melodies and without focus on technique or too much aggression. The vocals are the highlight of this release, and are helped by a production that made them extremely clear even when they are as low as Johan Hegg is capable of going. The rest of the band is definitely there, but the other instruments (with the possible exception of the guitars) position themselves as background to Hegg\u2019s inhuman growls, never bothering to deliver something extremely memorable technically speaking. \n\nIt is rare for an Amon Amarth release to have actual highlights, and this album is no different: there are so many riffs and melodies that it is difficult to stop at one song and hear it repeatedly. \u201cValhalla Awaits Me\u201d introduces us to a thashier side of Amon Amarth by using fast yet melodically interesting riffs to tell us about a dying berserker in the field of battle. It impresses from beginning to end and gives way to \u201cRunes to My Memory\u201d, perhaps the strongest track of the album. The second track is a mid-paced song that is incredibly heavy even in death metal standards, with root-note-spamming bass hidden beneath three massive guitars that sometimes deliver three different riffs at once. The lyrics tell us another dying Viking story, but this time in the aftermath of a battle, and the first-person point of view does a hell of a job in immersing the listener. Sometimes it almost feels like you are personally hearing the man\u2019s last words, and the merciless double bass and some simple yet amazing percussive breakdowns give way to some solid headbanging. \n\nWith \u201cAsator\u201d, \u201cGods of War Arise\u201d and \u201cWith Oden on Our Side\u201d the band keeps you headbanging like there is no tomorrow. Holy crap, there are no fillers here. Not a single fucking filler. Every song feels right in the album, yet is unique when played individually. No riffs fall short in terms of creativity (even if in \u201cCry of the Black Birds\u201d the riffs are clearly overused) and every track is melodically interesting (with highlights on \u201cUnder The Northern Star\u201d). Norse mythology and wars involving a lot of bearded men are the obvious theme of the album, and just like in \u201cVersus the World\u201d, there is space for sadness and longing, but the optimistic loyalty to Odin and the courage when facing battles overwhelms anything else. The epic feeling is always there, and is emphasized by the sincerity that the lyrics emanate (I am sure that real Vikings would not come up with lyrics much different from these\u2026\n\n\u201cUnder the Northern Star\u201d is a very slow and emotional interlude with rather interesting melodies that also works as a display of Hegg\u2019s incredible guttural range. It has some capable leads, but some of the lowest growls I have ever seen are what actually holds the song together. It might be the most emotional song of the album, and its solo pretty much obligates the listener to picture the scene that is being described. With \u201cPrediction of Warfare\u201d, the album closes as it started: with the band trying to break your neck from headbanging alone. The 6 minutes epic is extremely memorable, and although the track drags as it approaches the end it has some elaborate guitar harmonies riffs that prevent actual boredom.\n\nIf this album does flaws, the lack of variation is certainly one of them. Not all songs suffer from it, but some songs that are incredibly catchy, like \u201cCry of The Black Birds\u201d end up becoming boring after the three minutes mark. Riffs are overused sometimes, which by itself does not make any song bad, but I cannot help but feel that this kind of problem simply shouldn\u2019t happen in an album that has varied melodies as its main selling point.\n\nThis album is great because it appeals to basically anyone, including those who have never heard of death metal. If you haven\u2019t heard of Amon Amarth yet this is the ideal album to start with, and if you have you probably already own a copy.\n",
        "\nAmon Amarth is an interesting band. Even if death metal is their clearest influence, their music is more riff-oriented than the music delivered to us by a lot of thrash metal bands. Their vocals rock in the album and during the concerts, being Johan Hegg capable of delivering some of the most intense growls I have ever seen. Yet, those vocals are melodically interesting, and it doesn't feel like Hegg is showing off, even if it must be hard as hell to sing like that. The drums are regular at best, but they don't need to be spectacular or to deliver blast beats because the two guitars and the bass are always there, throwing riff after riff and never letting the listener get bored.\n\nIf you are reading this review you probably know at least a little about Amon Amarth, so why am I bothering to describe the band? It's because in Twilight of The Thunder God the band works with all the elements mentioned above, with little to no variation. While it sounds amazing most of the time, the lack of different stuff exposes the only clear problem present here, which is also present in most of Amon Amarth's work: the music is not actually diverse. There isn't a song that is more epic than the other (except for the title track), one that focuses more on the solo or one that focuses more on the drums: the whole recording is composed of riff-based songs with predictable drums and vocals that manage to be brutal and melodic at the same time. Sometimes solos kick in, but they are average and barely manage to be a decent background to the amazing riffs.\n\nThe title track, however, made me forgive almost all the flaws present in this full-length. \"Twilight of The Thunder God\" is the best song Amon Amarth has delivered so far, and may be the best they will ever deliver. The riffs are perfect, the vocals are even more brutal than usual, the drums are very good although not necessarily creative and even the guitar solo (which starts jumping an unknown number of octaves and ends up using almost the whole guitar neck) is extremely creative.\n\nThe epic feeling is always there. The lyrics are kind of silly (although I recognize that writing about Vikings is not the easiest thing to do) but they don't ruin the mood: while listening to the album it is impossible not to imagine the scenes that the lyrics describe, characteristic somehow unique to Amon Amarth that is created by using emotional yet heavy riffs.\n\nThis album will hardly surprise anyone, but if you like Amon Amarth's melodeath I recommend it. It is not the most complex or the best metal recording ever, but it does provide 43 minutes of solid headbanging and awe-inspiring vocals. If you choose not to buy it, though, make sure to listen to the title track, it rocks.\n",
        "\nAmon Amarth... I never actually heard of them when I listened to this album. I checked a few pictures of them... it seems they are bearded hairy men who look like they live in the dark ages. Apparently they can make music too, and they\u2019re not just your average death metal band either. And they seem quite popular, and when I hear the music I totally understand. I guess this is what people call \u2018Viking metal\u2019; melodic death metal with some folky tunes every now and then, complemented with lyrics about ancient gods like Odin and Thor. The whole lot surprised me a little bit, since I actually was expected the average death metal band I despise. Instead, I got to hear an album by a band with talent and a unique sound.\n\nThese guys have a very heavy sound created by two guitars and a bass, one that\u2019s really fat and juicy. Complemented with the heavy drums of Fredrik Andersson and the deep growls of bearded vocalist Johan Hegg, you\u2019ve got the main ingredients for a melodic death band. The songs are catchy and melodic but still very heavy, which makes them attractive. Mostly they have some good lead guitar melodies during the chorus, making it epic and memorable, like on \u201cThe Hero\u201d. I guess it\u2019s a part of the Viking-attribute to have lead guitars play a folky melody to add some catchiness. Also, these guys are not extreme. They create heavy death metal, but there are no blastbeats, aggressive screams and/or other wild things. This is purely creating good songs with enough variation, purely for the music. I can\u2019t actually say the same about other bands in their genre, though there are always exceptions. There are fast anthems on here such as the title track, \u201cWhere Is Your God?\u201d and \u201cLive for the Kill\u201d, also mid-paced little epics such as \u201cFree Will Sacrifice\u201d and \u201cGuardians of Asgaard\u201d, which are two of the best tracks on the album, and there is an epic album closer in the shape of \u201cEmbrace of the Endless Ocean\u201d, which does not only have a catchy title, but is truly epic in its own way. There is not one weak song on here.\n\nIt\u2019s time to have a look at the highlights of this album, and thereby describing some more details. Title track \u201cTwilight of the Thunder God\u201d features some real catchy guitar melodies as the main riff, and after about four times the theme the speedy drums kick in with a double bass. The deep growls are really one of the best I have ever heard. There\u2019s also some notable guitar soloing here. \u201cFree Will Sacrifice\u201d features some weird-ish riff, which easily became one of my favorites after a few listens. And again it is the melodic lead guitar at the chorus which adds the finishing touch to the album. As if the first two songs were not good enough, in comes \u201cGuardians of Asgaard\u201d, with a bombarding riff, so powerful I was just blown away. Then the song goes into a true Viking-melody that sounds like a child\u2019s song when played on the piano, but like a true metal anthem when played on a down tuned guitar like here. The bombarding riff returns a few times at the chorus, which is one of the highlights of the album. Then comes the very fast \u201cWhere Is Your God?\u201d, which actually has a quite funny lyric and some very speedy double bass drumming. I think the highlight of this song is when the song drops dead for a second and you hear the vocalist take a breath for the last chorus. The other songs of the album all feature a steady riff with memorable Viking-melodies and deep growling, but they are not as memorable as the first four songs. Last but not least I want to praise the drummer. Fredrik Andersson is no beginner behind his drums, damn! His drumming is very appropriate on every song and just so inventive and so much variation.\n\nSo, this album is very good. Not much more I can say about it. If you\u2019re into the genre or into Amon Amarth, this album is a must-have. If you are new to the genre, this album will be the one that gets you into it.\n\nStrongest tracks: \u201cTwilight of the Thunder God\u201d, \u201cFree Will Sacrifice\u201d and \u201cGuardians of Asgaard\u201d.\n\nhttp://thecryreviews.blogspot.com/\n",
        "\nAmon Amarth, in all their modern Norse power and might, began their career with the EP proper \"Sorrow throughout the Nine Worlds.\" This EP would then lead to a full-length debut, \"Once Sent from the Golden Hall.\" Due perhaps to the raw sound quality of this album (more so than \"The Avenger\" and \"The Crusher,\") this album seems to be left behind in favor of more recent outings. While the band's outputs in the last five years or so have yielded some fine listens in their unique niche of heavy metal, its their early career that I believe exhibits the best experience. \n\nOn \"Once Sent from the Golden Hall,\" one might be surprised. I was originally curious over this album, desperately wanting to hear it but deep inside wondering if this album might be underdeveloped. I was completely wrong, and in some ways it contains just as much, if not more energy and power than recent efforts. The album also plays a sense of epic strength in its songs, though this comes from the production. Johan Hegg's beserker vocals sound like they emit from a distant peak, as he commands his Norse warriors to battle. This creates a unique effect on songs like \"The Dragon's Flight Across the Waves,\" where at the end Hegg shouts \"Attack!\" repeatedly, almost as if he is directing his troops to strike their foes. This quality is unique to this album, as it creates atmosphere without the need for the keyboard indulgence of some bands.\n\nAside from that, the riff attack is killer as usual. Powerful rhythms thunder along like \"Ride for Vengeance\" and \"Victorious March.\" The unfortunate aspect of all this is that this album does become a tad repetitive. Note that three of these eight songs have a length over five minutes. Most of these do not supply enough ideas equal to their time lengths, though honestly I've heard much worse. Despite that, these three songs are still rather strong in nature, just not anything that noteworthy over more concise and more memorable numbers like \"Ride for Vengeance,\" \"Without Fear,\" and the title track. \"Ride for Vengeance\" and \"Without Fear\" are the best of these, the former with its relentless bludgeoning attack and the latter for its melodies. \n\nDespite the repetitive factor that sometimes weaves it way in here (though not nearly to extent of some Gothenburg inspired bands) I see \"Once Sent from the Golden Hall\" as a milestone in melodic death metal. That's a rather big statement to make, I know, but I can't think of any other band who can deliver such power (notice I use that alot referring to this band) in this genre. Not only that, but Amon Amarth are also a very memorable band and one that several can cling to. Johan Hegg is doing great things with his voice, particularly his ability to be both relentless, but without succumbing to those dumb-assed, unintelligible grunts that are so common these days. Needless to say, Amon Amarth have carved a unique sector of metal for themselves, one I doubt anyone can wrestle away from them.\n\nAll things considered, some see \"Once Sent from the Golden Hall\" as a flawed beginning for Amon Amarth. I personally see it in a different light, one that paved the way for this band's slowly evolving and current, modern day sound. Either way, those diehard legions of Amon Amarth fans definitely need to check on this one while casual listeners might learn a thing or two from this release.\n",
        "\nIn the world of heavy metal music, in all its various shapes and sizes, few things get me more pumped than Amon Amarth. While many listeners have caught onto this band's mighty warship through more recent releases such as \"With Oden on Our Side\" and \"Twilight of the Thunder God\" I will always see this band's glory days etched in their early existence. \"The Avenger\" is the band's second proper album, and a devastating array of talent that this band continues to put forth even to this day.\n\nAs described before, Amon Amarth's consistent plan of attack includes gracious melodies, simple (yet killer) riffs, energetic structure, thunderous drums, and Johan Hegg's mighty yet intelligent vocals. In the world of melodic death metal, and sometimes obvious trappings of repetitiveness of the Gothenburg groups, Amon Amarth are a gemstone that few can ignore. \"The Avenger\" delivers this and more, just not with the clear sound quality of \"Fate of Norns\" and beyond that newer listeners have gotten used to.\n\nThe album's higher points stick to their comfortable formula, though some upgrades have occured since \"Once Sent from the Golden Hall.\" For one, the production is better, though it still pertains a sense of raw charm. Johan Hegg now sounds up front, rather than his yelling from a mountain of the last album. He has cashed in most of that gruff yelling style he used on the album prior, instead focusing more on his unmistakable growls as he charges forth with thunderous rhythms and straight-for-the-jugular riffing. This is seen in \"Bleed for Ancient Gods,\" the incredible \"The Last with Pagan Blood,\" and \"North Sea Storm.\" All three of these songs are definite stand-outs, and some of the best this band has put forth. \n\nUnfortunately, you only get seven songs on this release (though my version has a re-recorded \"Thor Arise.\") Naturally, since \"The Avenger\" isn't as strong as the album before or after, this is a bit of a snag. The title track, while building something epic with its seven minute length is just too long. Its not bad and definitely not anything near a throwaway, but the shorter songs still reign supreme here. \"Metalwrath,\" aside from its backstory, isn't as noteworthy, either. Considering the stronger tracks like \"North Sea Storm\" and \"The Last with Pagan Blood\" are outright incredible, its hard for everything else here to stand-up to it. That being said, none of these seven songs are throwaways and all have merit of worth. This also includes the bonus track in \"Thor Arise,\" a re-recorded song that originally appeared on the demo of the same name. I've never heard the original demo version, though this version is good, though being tacked on at the end makes it stick out a little bit. It isn't necessarily great, though still worthy. Its just that throwing it on at the end seems a bit out of place, kind of like the \"Eyes of Horror\" cover that appears on \"The Crusher\" album.\n\nThough its not as consistent as \"With Oden on Our Side\" nor has as many good songs as \"The Crusher,\" \"The Avenger\" is by no means a bad album. Any Amon Amarth fan is still required by the Viking gods to check it out, its just that in the grand picture of things, it doesn't stick out very much. The consistency of this band's formula that exists to this day is on this album, and the songwriting has improved over \"Once Sent from the Golden Hall,\" even if I prefer that album to this one. For those new to this mighty band, I'd suggest looking towards \"Versus the World\" or \"The Crusher\" before this one, as both are better than this one but also because they are easier to get into and put forth more quality for your buck. Yet if you're more familiar with Amon Amarth's music and your collection is lacking this album, its like a Viking going to battle without his shield: you just don't do it.\n",
        "\nSweden's Amon Amarth swiftly became my favorite melodic death metal band several years ago when I first heard them. Though \"Fate of Norns\" was the first album I acquired by this band, it was this, \"The Crusher,\" that sealed the deal for me. While Amon Amarth have refined their sound and become more accessible (not due to sylistic change but to updated album production measures,) I still see their earlier days as their prime. Not discounting what they've done in recent years, which is all good to the ears, but the raw sounds and incredible songwriting give these early works an epic in high doses feel.\n\n\"Bastards of a Lying Breed\" is an excellent example of this, with the songs themselves mimicing (though not copying, don't confuse the two) the style we heard on \"The Avenger.\" Rest assured, anyone who liked that album will like this one as they are very similiar in both sound and production standard. Although the stage of refinement in the style and songwriting hasn't changed much, I've always preferred to this album to its predecessor. To me, there just isn't overcoming the thunderous \"The Sound of Eight Hooves\" or instant goodness of \"Risen from the Sea,\" a re-recorded version which originally appeared on the \"Thor Arise\" demo some time prior. I've never actually heard the original (except for the re-release version of the demos on \"Versus the World\" special set) but I prefer this one to what I have heard.\n\nNaturally this wouldn't be Amon Amarth without some good Norse mythology and history, nor the unmistakable and intelligent growls of Johan Hegg. He delivers a great performance here, from the firestorms of \"Bastards of a Lying Breed\" to that of \"Releasing Surtur's Fire,\" there isn't a dull moment with the guy. I've always loved how Hegg has always sounded intimidating yet his vocals are somewhat distinguishable and intelligent, never dumbing himself to those redundant and utterly disgusting growls that most \"gore\" death bands and American deathcore bands get caught in.\n\nIn terms of sheer melodic death firepower, look no further than \"Annilihation of Hammerfest,\" \"The Sound of Eight Hooves,\" and \"Masters of War.\" My personal favorite out of the track list would belong to the lengthy but never boring \"A Fury Divine.\" It lays out this band's usual epic nature on full scale, complete with an emotive solo, making this one of the album's great highlights. That being said, there isn't a dull moment on this record, from start to finish. The Possessed cover in \"Eyes of Horror\" is rather well done, and while not exactly a fan of that band I particularly enjoyed the cover more than I expected to. There has been a re-release of this album sometime in 2009, which is complete with some live performances. I personally have the original, but I can say I've not been tempted necessarily with re-purchasing this album for the sake of the extra goodies.\n\nBottom line, Amon Amarth's earlier career always stands as their best to me, seeing this band refining their sound and creating albums that become pure musical gold. Of those, \"The Crusher\" stands in high regard. I enjoyed these songs more so than those on \"The Avenger,\" albeit slightly, while I see this album being more accessible to newer fans than \"Once Sent from the Golden Hall.\" \"Accessible\" is a relative term, for this is still serious heavy metal firepower of the melodic death variety. It also outclasses most Gothenburg acts out there, which is saying alot considering I'm often partial to the works of bands like early In Flames, Dark Tranquility and earlier Arch Enemy. Already established fans who own \"With Oden On Our Side\" but are curious about this band's past, look no further than the great power of \"The Crusher.\"\n",
        "\nEvery once in a long while there comes a metal band who doesn\u2019t like change; a band whose members stick by their sound no matter what happens. Some will criticize them for it, but such bands are the summit of integrity in the music world, refusing to alter their sound in a direction desired by some third party, be it the public or the band\u2019s label. The perfect example of such a band is Amon Amarth. As I write this they\u2019ve put out seven albums of relentless melodic death metal with an undying Viking theme to it, and they show absolutely no signs of quitting or even slowing down. Of all those albums, none of which is bad and almost all of which are downright kick-ass, Versus the World can arguably be called the pinnacle, the definitive summit of the badass Viking-inspired metal that Amon Amarth love to play. \n\nThis album truly is a monster of massive proportions. The first hint is given, or, to better put it, shoved in the listener\u2019s face, right from the first few seconds of Death In Fire. Thick production, pounding drumming and riffs which just seem to announce a bunch of angry northern warriors coming for you, all those elements are introduced here and will remain a constant until the album\u2019s very end. This opener is undoubtedly Amon Amarth\u2019s most warlike to date, and that\u2019s saying a hell of a lot with previous albums\u2019 contenders for the throne including the classics Ride for Vengeance and Bleed for Ancient Gods. The fast-paced pounding of Death in Fire buries all that and introduces a new standard of quality which the entire album lives up to. \n\nIn this case, describing in detail each song which jumps out of the pack would amount to a detailed description of every single song on this album. Suffice it to say, most of this album varies from fast-as-hell to a more mid-paced type of uncompromising melodic death metal, running from the rousing anthem to vengeance that is For the Stabwounds in Our Backs to insane epics like Across the Rainbow Bridge and Thousand Years of Oppression, and the final slow beast \u2026And Soon The World Will Cease to Be. As mentioned above, I\u2019d want to name each standout but I\u2019d end up writing down the album\u2019s entire damn track list. Everything which was so promising and intense on the previous albums is honed to perfection here; every band member\u2019s role is taken advantage of as much as is humanly possible, and then some. The guitar playing reaches a level of complexity and variation which may have only been grazed on the legendary Once Sent From the Golden Hall, as the magnificent solo on Death in Fire demonstrates, but this guitar playing is here coupled with the most aggressive drumming yet to be performed by Frederik Andersson. This evolution of the band\u2019s sound in such a linear and harmonious manner can only be explained by the extreme stability of the band. In fact, there have been no line-up changes whatsoever after the release of the debut album in 1998, making Amon Amarth a unique, or at least extremely rare, phenomenon in the world of metal: a band who has now had the exact same line-up for 12 years! \n\nFinally we come to a subject which is central to this and indeed to all of Amon Amarth\u2019s albums, perhaps the most recognizable element in the band\u2019s signature sound: Johan Hegg\u2019s vocals. This man can growl as very few others can, having evolved his skills from the much more primal sound on the first EP & album to the finely honed sound featured on this album. His voice, which creates an inhumanly deep growl, needless to say goes perfectly with the rest of the band\u2019s work, giving the entire album that final aura of defiance and power one would expect from an album with such an ambitious title. I dare say that Johan\u2019s never sounded this good, although his skills on the following albums will return to a level of excellence on With Oden on Our Side despite a noticeable deterioration on the slightly weaker Fate of Norns. \n\nStanding equal to the undeniably epic and powerful music are the lyrics. Amon Amarth outdid themselves this time. Now, all of the band\u2019s albums have lyrics which could send most bands straight into retirement, but this is a level beyond. The glorious and endless violence of Death In Fire and Bloodshed, the hymns to vengeance that are For the Stabwounds in our Backs and, to a lesser extent, Thousand Years of Oppression, as well as the purely badass \u201cwe\u2019ve fought things you didn\u2019t even know existed\u201d of Versus the World are all particularly loud witnesses to the excellence of the content here. But the one song which stands out, both musically and lyrically, is the closing epic, \u2026And Soon the World Shall Cease to Be, a slow monster that simply deals with the end and subsequent renewal of the world, Norse style: Ragnar\u00f6k, the Twilight of the Gods. This song\u2019s lyrics are of incredible density and power, so much in fact that there\u2019s enough material here to make a motion picture epic on the subject, which if done correctly could instantly bury every single piece of eye candy calling themselves films of the last few decades. \n\nIs there any kind of bad side, even a slight flaw in this album? Absolutely not. Every track is a particularly brutal monster on its own and, when they\u2019re all put together, they form an entity immensely more powerful than the sum of its parts. Versus the World is the peak of Amon Amarth\u2019s amazing discography, symbolizing all that is great about the band. This truly is one of the best metal albums of the decade, perhaps even of all time.\n",
        "\nAh, the impetuousness of youth \u2026 In a past review I rather prematurely stated that Once Sent From the Golden Hall was Amon Amarth\u2019s best album, but listening to both the band\u2019s debut and their third full-length release numerous times has since led me to the conclusion that the often overlooked and somewhat underrated The Crusher is in fact just as good as the lauded debut, maybe even a tiny bit better. What I generally like about Amon Amarth\u2019s older albums is that the band was far less predictable in those days: whereas nowadays they almost exclusively write slower material, they used to do a much better job mixing things up tempo-wise in the early stages of their career. This is not to say that Amon Amarth\u2019s later work isn\u2019t quite amazing as well, but it seems to me that by sticking to what they apparently perceive to be their greatest strength, which is writing slower, anthemic songs geared more toward accessibility than diversity, they have creatively handcuffed themselves to a certain degree.\n\nBesides, it\u2019s not like their fast songs aren\u2019t plenty melodic and catchy as well \u2013 for evidence see exhibit A, \u201cBastards of a Lying Breed,\u201d which will stick in your ear almost immediately. It is indeed the faster songs (the other ones being \u201cThe Sound of Eight Hooves,\u201d \u201cRisen From the Sea\u201d and \u201cA Fury Divine\u201d) that make The Crusher such an enjoyable experience, with the excellent \u201cA Fury Divine\u201d perhaps taking the cake as the album\u2019s standout track and also serving as a prime example of the occasionally quite thoughtful lyrics the band penned down for some of the songs. While the usual one-sided anti-Christian fare is certainly present as well \u2013 for evidence, see the crushingly heavy \u201cMasters of War,\u201d the entire lyrical content of which could be summed up with the words \u201cDie, puny Christian, die!\u201d \u2013, some of the lyrics are surprisingly emotional and original. In this regard, the aforementioned \u201cA Fury Divine\u201d comes up with an interesting take on the Christianization of northern Europe in the Early Middle Ages, telling the tale of a Germanic tribesman who is captured by his Christian foes and told to renounce the heathen gods of his forefathers; in the end, he refuses to submit and chooses death by decapitation over forced conversion and baptism:\n\nI will stand firm, I refuse to kneel\nThe fury in me is divine\nMy dark grave awaits, my fate is revealed\nBut I'm not afraid to die\n\nAnother song with very heartfelt (albeit slightly repetitive) lyrics is \u201cAs Long as the Raven Flies,\u201d which is of the same ilk as some of the plodding \u00fcber-melodic mid-tempo anthems that Amon Amarth would specialize in on later albums, but works even better in the context of an album with more diversified songwriting:\n\nMen will fight and men will die\nWars will be lost and won\nThat's how it's been and still will be\nLong after I'm gone\n\nLyrical content aside, I\u2019ve always considered Johann Hegg to be one of the best vocalists in all of death metal, and The Crusher shows again why: his growls are delivered with astounding conviction and are very throaty and deep, yet they usually let the listener understand what he\u2019s singing about, which is always a plus. As for the other band members, they are in fine shape as well: bassist Ted Lundstr\u00f6m and Fredrik Andersson, master of the pounding double bass drum, form a perfectly tight rhythm section; Andersson in particular has to be one of the most solid drummers out there \u2013 his play isn\u2019t overly technical or flashy, but it has an unmistakable presence about it that simply commands respect. Johan S\u00f6derberg and Olavi Mikkonen, the guitar dream duo of melodic death metal, simply do what they do best, which is churn out a wealth of crushing riffs and one insanely catchy lead guitar theme after another. The production courtesy of metal workaholic Peter T\u00e4gtgren definitely helps in bringing out the best in the band\u2019s stellar performance and is virtually flawless. Especially the guitar tone annihilates everything in its wake; in that respect, the punishing riff in the very first seconds of album opener \u201cBastards of a Lying Breed\u201d is a harbinger of things to come and leaves no doubt that the listener is in for quite a ride!\n\nAll things considered, The Crusher \u2013 at least in this reviewer\u2019s humble opinion \u2013 ranks right up there among the top three Amon Amarth albums (the other two being the debut and the equally impeccable With Oden on Our Side); for a band that to this day has never released even a mediocre, let alone a bad album, that's really saying something. However, a few points have to be subtracted from the overall rating for the fact that the last three proper songs \u2013 \u201cAnnihilation of Hammerfest,\u201d \u201cThe Fall Through Ginnungagap\u201d and \u201cReleasing Surtur\u2019s Fire\u201d \u2013 lack variety and, while being consistently solid and offering plenty of fine moments, don't quite match the level of utter brilliance achieved by some of the other tracks. The CD bonus track \u201cEyes of Horror\u201d (a Possessed cover) also doesn\u2019t do much to round off the album as it\u2019s very poorly produced and stylistically doesn't fit with the rest of the material. Leaving such minor complaints aside, however, The Crusher is a mandatory listen for all fans of Amon Amarth as well as of non-Gothenburg Swedish melodic death metal in general.\n\nChoicest cuts: Bastards of a Lying Breed, Risen From the Sea, As Long as the Raven Flies, A Fury Divine\n",
        "\nI first came to know Amon Amarth about the same time this album was released in 2004. I had heard about them from a friend, and at that time being a melodic death metal fan, I felt obligated to see what they were all about. Considering my previous adventures with the melo-death realm in the more familiar works of bands like In Flames and Dark Tranquility, I wasn't exactly sure what to expect. After all, the obvious hinting of Norse mythology in the album title had me a little curious. \n\nOver time, as I've become a diehard fan of this band I've come to learn this is actually Amon Amarth's weakest effort. Sure, every band is entitled to a flop but the ironic thing is that this album is not actually a flop at all. Instead, its churns out reliable mid-tempo metal that ends up listening well rather listening spectacularly. The songs end up moving along without a whole lot happening, which in retrospect is pretty disappointing given how albums like \"The Crusher\" and \"Versus the World\" played out. All of the albums before this one had at least one or two incredible songs to them that set the bar further for the band in general. \"Fate of Norns\" has none of this, though the concept of greatness does appear, though briefly, in a few of these songs. \n\nAll of the problems with this album are laid out for you in the opening track. \"An Ancient Sign of Coming Storm\" is an all you can eat buffet of everything wrong here. It sounds great, like the usual Amon Amarth fare diving into the pre-Christian Norse era and the mythology and lore that accompanies it. Yet it really goes nowhere despite being a decent tune, not to mention it simply picks up at the end and then stops and fades away. \"Where Death Seems to Dwell\" does better, but I begin to see a pattern here. Its almost as if Amon Amarth was shooting for something else here, as opposed to simply running out of ideas. Were they trying to create a more traditional metal album with Johan Hegg's beserker vocals? The end result seems to be pointed in that direction but it doesn't establish itself as a true adherent to the traditional style. Most of the songs here seem grounded in that enigma, trying to become something but not really sure of what to do and end up plodding along in a reliable but unspectacular way for three or four minutes at the time.\n\nThe two songs that break away from this and salvage the album as a whole is \"Once Sealed In Blood\" and \"Valkyries Ride.\" As someone already pointed out, these two remind quite a bit of what would occur on \"With Oden On Our Side,\" which was a better album in every way than this one. The two songs mentioned have a healthy supply of ideas that do more than simply run their course to the finish line. Both contain elements that remind me of why I fell in love with this band's music in the first place. However, two songs out of eight that conjure that feeling do not make a great listen. There is nothing wrong here, but it short changes the listen on everything they'd expect out of the usual Amon Amarth release.\n\nTo fans of this band, save your money and put this one last on the list. It is definitely the band's most lackluster in every way, but again, it is by no means bad. The uninitiated listener curious about what Amon Amarth are all about, I'd advise looking elsewhere. \"Fate of Norns\" does carry itself well, but as I've stated so many times before, it simply pales in comparison to everything else this band has to offer. Its worth your time if you absolutely love this band, but not enough so to take precedence over any other album sporting this band's name.\n",
        "\nI'll admit to have been rather late in the entry of the AMON AMARTHy Viking ship. Nothing against them\u2026I knew who they were, and at the risk of seeming out of the loop, for what it's worth I just didn't become too interested in their works until their name became large and in charge within the American touring circuit. By then I just had to find out what the hell the deal was with these guys. And in doing so, spotting these swarthy Swedes on stage, tearing through their well-to-do method of melodic death metal, struck a Nordic chord in my blackened heart like a well-aimed sword tip so intensely that over time I craved more, more, more. And more I got...they kept at it, appearing time and again, to my increasing delight, until the hunger for all things Viking and deathly bled into the procurement of their recorded works, which turned out to be just as satisfying.\n\nAnd so we've come to their latest Valhallic offering...\n\nWhat makes the AMON AMARTH machine work so well is their \"if it ain't broke, don't fix it\" take on metal. Time and again their platter of fist-pumping death metal musicality and Fimbulvetr-evoking lyrical content always quenches nicely with each successive listen and album. There\u2019s something infectious with the way the material is presented, more so than many others of their ilk who were left in the dust years ago; sure, the performance and overall compositions are taken seriously, but not TOO seriously and still a fun factor is noticed the more continuous listens increase. The entire band channels this focus acutely with their combined performances, where awe-inspiring riffs, melodic guitar tandems, pitter-patter percussion abuses and unearthly growls come together in a morass of metallic masterment that puts them in an echelon populated by few others, at thankful lengths (it would\u2018ve been easy for the band to totally overstay their welcome with such material present, but 4 or so minutes is a perfect serving to this listener). Whether the monstrous heaviness of \u201cTwilight of the Thunder God\u201d and \u201cFree Will Sacrifice\u201d or the epic atmosphere of \u201cGuardians of Aasgard\u201d and \u201cEmbrace of the Endless Ocean\u201d, this recording helps solidify AMON AMARTH among the elite of metaldom, cleaving a path for heathen banners to fly and Mjolners to be held high. With good reason, too.\n\nSo in the end, this album helps prove the awesome factor of AMON AMARTH that much more. The burning horizon is theirs to conquer, and by Thor, they\u2019ve earned this victory. FUCKING HAILS!\n",
        "\nContrary to popular belief, Amon Amarth was not the first of the Swedish Viking death metal bands, as Unleashed predated them for some years; however, they have certainly been the most successful, in recent years their albums like With Oden On Our Side and Twilight of the Thunder Gods have been huge, with an appeal that has spread even beyond the core metal crowd. Granted, many of these noobs would likely have enjoyed metal all along, if they only sat down to listen, but Amon Amarth has become a gateway band, or a 'return' for so many that have veered away to their placid hipster lives and listening rotations.\n\nCome 1999, they were a rising force, but not yet at their peak level of popularity (which we still may not have experienced). The Avenger was their 2nd full-length offering, and the material written was a bit catchier than that found on their debut, Once Sent from the Golden Hall. It was also the first album to feature the huge line-up that the band has maintained to this day, with Johan S\u00f6derberg joining on guitar and Fredrik Andersson behind the drums. This is a seasoned, powerful album, with only 1-2 tracks slacking behind the rest, and it's honestly better than most they have released since (at least until the past few efforts, which have been stunning).\n\nAmon Amarth take the term 'melodic death metal' to an entirely different medium, for while the band is making almost constant use of melodies over the bludgeoning death metal base, they aren't the kind of jumpy and spotty riffs used by In Flames or Dark Tranquillity. These are woven right into the foundation of the band's crushing force. Hegg is a true jarl of the north, easily shifting from his distinctive death metal growls to a blacker rasp without losing any of the thrust; Andersson is a beast; and while Mikkonen and S\u00f6derberg do not often indulge in complex riffing, they know how to level you with straightforward, hammering rhythms that best fit the band's Norse lyrical theme. Speaking of the lyrics, they've never been this band's strength, instead a pastiche of rather simplified Viking/Norse mythology which is presented to be accessible. But The Avenger is far from the worst of them.\n\n'Making way through blades and spears\nWe attack at dawn\nThe glory scene is near\nFrom northern gods we're spawned'\n\nThe album wastes no time in kicking your ass with the thundering \"Bleed for Ancient Gods\", a song they are still making today, a decade later. Gorgeous, glorious rhythm riffs and an unending barrage of crashing drums will send you this straight to your memory. \"The Last With Pagan Blood\" has one of the most inspiring song titles I've ever seen, and the song itself is one of my favorites from the album, with its spear formation walls of biting sorrow. The following track \"North Sea Storm\" is not only the best of the album, but my favorite Amon Amarth song to date, a warlike rhythm collapsing into an eternal and distinct verse rhythm which heralds both an emotion of loss and wonderment, and a futile, atavistic clarion to battle. The band even manages to pull off a chug-down without me becoming restless, that is how good this song is, and the standard by which I just much of their other material. \"Avenger\" is fashioned from more subtle textures, surely the driving power of the band continues, but it thrives off its cascade of golden, fading sunlight and the plodding of its bridge rhythm.\n\n\"God, His Son and Holy Whore\" was not one of my favorites here, but it maintains the thundering largesse of the album and I did enjoy the first riff. \"Metalwrath\" is a rather notorious track, as the band makes a jab at countrymen Hammerfall, who they supposedly had some minor feud with. The song itself is decent, but not one of the stronger on the album. \"Legend of a Banished Man\" thankfully bings back the glory of the first half of the record, with some great bass work by Ted Lundstrom, and a heavy as hell chugging ballast which transforms into dynamic, march-like drumming. My version of the CD also includes the bonus track \"Thor Arise\", which is faster than much of the other material, and not quite so memorable.\n\nThe Avenger really rides off its stronger material, but it's not an entirely kickass album. \"Bleed for Ancient Gods\", \"The Last With Pagan Blood\" and \"North Sea Storm\" should belong to any compilation of Amon Amarth's greatest hits, and I still listen to these today, but on the whole, the band has released superior work since (especially Twilight of the Thunder God). Viking death metal is surely not as commonplace as Viking black metal, so a band like Amon Amarth has always been welcome, and reaped the niche that Unleashed (and, to an extent, Bathory) had first carved out.\n\nHighlights: Bleed for Ancient Gods, The Last With Pagan Blood, North Sea Storm, Avenger\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nFor their 7th full-length, the Swedish Viking lords offer their catchiest effort yet, just surpassing their previous album With Oden On Our Side. While it took me a few spins to truly appreciate, others seemed to gel with it immediately, and it's not hard to figure out why.\n\nEach of the 10 tracks here is extremely memorable, striking the perfect balance between melody and brutality, as well as a flair for classic metal riffing throughout. The opening riff of the title track feels almost as if the band is channeling Iron Maiden's plucky melodic guitar style, though it soon gives way to Amarth's dense, patented strain of somber and glorious death metal. It also manages to wedge a pretty kickass thrash riff into the middle. \"Free Will Sacrifice\" has a great driving melody parting into a grooving melodic death metal riff. \"Guardians of Asgaard\" is a raging, throw your meadhorns up in the fucking air track plodding at a mid but unrelenting pace. \"Where is Your God\" is a another rager with some busy melodic hooks weaving into the milieu. \"Tattered Banners and Bloody Flags\" is classic Amon Amarth, with a fantastic, subtle, sorrow-filled riff I await in each verse with anticipation. \"The Hero\" is another of the best tracks here, triumphant and catchy.\n\nThe production is superb, it sounds good on everything I've played it on. The guitars are mixed perfectly, weaving their simple and effective melodies over churning rhythms. Johan Hegg's brutal vocals are in perfect form, at the perfect level in the mix. The lyrics are quite simplistic, occasionally bordering on dumb, but these guys have never been poet laureates to begin with. They are never intrusive, a great match for the music, and nothing more. Thematically the album is focused on the Norse mythos, you might call it \"Norse Myth for Dummies\". Regardless, the music is extremely effective in provoking this cultural nostalgia.\n\nPut simply, this is the best overall Amon Amarth album I've heard to date, and if I had to compile a list of my favorite tracks from the band's career, close to half of the list would originate here. It should be extremely pleasing to the band's loyal fan base and probably convert many more to the cause. And it's well worth your money.\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nThe Crusher is, when compared to some of the later albums from Amon Amarth, a stronger album. It\u2019s louder, faster, heavier, and a little bit more complex compared to any of their later work. Everything on The Crusher is just a little bit stronger when compared to one of their later albums like Twilight of the Thunder God. Everything just seems faster on this album. The riffs are faster, but the majority of them are Gothenburg styled riffing, yet they still keep some melody. The rhythm guitar is distorted while its tremolo picking and the distortion makes it sound like a buzzing static sound in the background.\n\nOne department that Amon Amarth has always lack in is song structure. All of their songs don\u2019t really have any sort of intro to them; they all just kind of just start. Same thing could be said about how they end. None of the songs progress into any sort of conclusion, they just end. And as for the structure, the songs usually alter between verse, bridge, and a chorus in the middle somewhere and after the second chorus/bridge in each song is when the guitar solo usually makes its appearance. Probably what makes the songs stand out from one another would be that even though the riffs are a bit simple, they still are surprisingly catchy, while changing tempos throughout the song. While the songs have a similar sound to them, you can still pick out every song from each other so it doesn\u2019t sound like a chaotic mess of bland songs. \n\nPersonally I think the best thing about The Crusher would be the vocals by Johan Hegg. Unlike most vocalists in a melodic death band, Hegg isn\u2019t a monotone vocalist. If you have ever had the misfortune of hearing a monotone screamer in any sort of death metal band then you know how quickly they can get annoying. This is not the case for Johan Hegg however; he\u2019s got a very angry and energetic scream and a nice grunt he throws in here and there creating a livelier listen. \n\nIt may not be their best album, but it still is an enjoyable album nonetheless. It features some great vocals, some heavy riffs, and a nice aggressive vibe to it all. The problems are minor and can be overlooked because the only real problem is that to some the songs will bleed into each other and sound the same. Other than that this is an appealing album worth checking out.\n",
        "\nJust when you thought no more rape and pillaging could be done and no more mead quaffed, Swedish Viking incarnates Amon Amarth have returned to our collective shores for round 7 of their quest to instill a pagan spirit in the lot of us whilst pumping forth some of the bloody catchiest death metal you will ever hear. What AA have done to get here, in 2008 releasing one of the best DM albums in \"Twilight Of The Thunder God\" I've heard in years, is staggering given my worries back in 2004 upon the release of \"Fate Of Norns\" that AA had stylistically cornered themselves beyond repair following 'breaker' album \"Versus The World\". However a burst of creative spirit has been unleashed to bring us \"With Oden On Our Side\", and now this, where with minimal revision of their sound Amon Amarth have proven themselves to be both as vital and effective as they have ever been. How the fuck have they down that?\n\nWell, the rough answer is by slowing down the pace a bit here, cleaning up the guitar sound a bit there, and placing greater emphasis on the catchiness element of their songs rather than the brutality. This again prompts the question of just 'how the fuck?!?' when noone in their right mind could suggest the band have sold out in the process, but I guess we just have to accept that is the sign of a great band. Whilst the back catalogue of Amon Amarth contains a number of terrifyingly brilliant tracks in the likes of \"Death In Fire\" and my personal fave \"Bastards Of A Lying Breed\", it is no exaggeration to say that \"Guardians Of Asgaard\" and \"Where Is Your God?\" are two of their absolute best. Full of fire and brimstone, these two are as contagious as syphilis from a Kings Cross prostitute, especially in the chorus of \"Where...\" upon which the deadliest lead riff of 2008 blasts forth, and the no less mighty chorus of \"Guardians...\", which with the backing vocals of Entombed's LG Petrov, is defiantly mighty in it's battle-rousing depth and vigour. Don't for one second think songs 3 and 4 are the only ones to grab your balls and yank very, very hard. The nimble-fingered lead riff of \"Tattered Banners And Bloody Flags\" is different to anything I've heard before and the inclusion of the cellos of Apocalyptica during the quiet (and some not-so-quiet) moments of \"Live For The Kill\" works surprisingly well, bringing out the sullen feel of the moment better than could have been anticipated.\n\nReally, anyone who enjoyed \"With Oden On Our Side\" will find much to enjoy here. Infact anyone who appreciates metal both heavy and hook-laden will revel in the groove of \"Twilight Of The Thunder God\". Arguments for the best album of their career is difficult as to me 2001's \"The Crusher\" is the epitomy of Amon Amarth at their heaviest AND catchiest but petty comparisons aside, this is as good as anything Amon Amarth have done. With a spot on the upcoming 'Unholy Alliance' tour supporting Slayer and Trivium, watch Amon Amarth's star grow until a point where there will be pagan-Vikings-inspirit than Christians of this world. I can't wait. \n\nOriginally written for Rockfreaks.net\n",
        "\nSome people say that it's easy to get a sense of what something is by talking about what it is not. This is the path I have chosen to review Versus the World.\n\nAmon Amarth have been a key player in the metal scene since their inception about thirteen years ago, and for what reason? They play music that is easy to like and digest by fans of any metal genre. Their older stuff was a little more complex and epic, but by Versus the World, they were pretty much streamlined into a blandish, formless mass with little of the exciting edge they had in their early days.\n\nThis is the kind of thing that can appeal to anyone, with heavy riffs that don't go too fast, vocals that don't offend too terribly much and a rhythm section that doesn't really do much exciting or complex at all. Amon Amarth have pretty much capitalized on the term \"easy listening metal\" here. I mean, I don't want to be too harsh on this kind of stuff, as it doesn't really do anything wrong aside from just being generally boring and unambitious. But then again, why shouldn't I be a bit angry at Versus the World for that reason? People need to demand more for their music. On one hand, this album is okay, with no songs that really stand out as bad or anything, but on the other...it's okay, with no songs that stand out as good or anything. This is basically just stodgy, midpaced Melodic Death Metal with the standard Gothenburg melodic trilling and also the standard Gothenburg bore factor, and it just doesn't do anything for me; the style never has.\n\nSo really, what is there to say about Versus the World? There are some decent parts, like some of the riffs in \"Death in Fire\" and the galloping end section in \"Across the Rainbow Bridge,\" but even those don't really seem to have much of a point beyond proving that the band is still relevant. There's no anger here, no hungry, raw energy, not even a sense of direction on half the stuff on this boring piece of plastic. Sure, there are some good parts, but...couldn't you, in all honesty, find the same quality from bands that actually have some sort of purpose to their music other than just being decent? That's what pisses me off the most about this; it seems to be content with just being decent and passable, not trying to aim for anything more. This kind of laziness is just lame, and while I can sort of see why people like this album, I just can't endorse it myself. Pass.\n",
        "\nWith the exception of \u201cOnce Sent From The Golden Hall\u201d, this album has the greatest title of any in Amon Amarth\u2019s history. There is nothing more epic and intricate insofar as Norse mythology goes that discussing the final destiny of Urd, Skuld and Verdandi, ergo the three mystical beings who control the destiny of all who live by tending to Yggdrasil, the great tree of life that connects all realms of man, giant and deity alike. Unfortunately, in the quest for a truly epic album that might top everything they\u2019ve done and perhaps be the final word in an already pretty solid musical career, the band got themselves caught in a bit of a rut.\n\n\u201cFate Of Norns\u201d is a transitional album, moving away from the band\u2019s older style of down tempo anthems to Norse glory and toward something faster and more ferocious. Many fans of this album have alluded to it being more aggressive than previous efforts, while its detractors note a lack of hooks and a sense of plodding in spite of any ratcheted up riffs. Ultimately both sentiments are mostly right, and this album\u2019s fatal flaw is that it short changes the listener on catchiness, while doing both the epic and the harder edged aspects halfway. Too many ideas seem to start off well and then wander off into a halfway decent groove, and then things just sort of taper off and become stale and unmemorable.\n\nA classic example of this buildup in anticipation with a few solid ideas that seem to lead somewhere yet don\u2019t is the opening track \u201cAn Ancient Sign Of Coming Storm\u201d. The principle riff is a pretty solid Maiden influenced one, giving way to a build up in tension that leads to a couple of narration-like verses done by Hegg in his usual demented and guttural manner, and then it just sort of fades into a series of plodding ideas and ends. The title song and \u201cThe Beheading Of A King\u201d are pretty much the same story, though they do reach a climactic section that simply goes away too quickly. The only two songs that actually are completely free from this sense of meandering are \u201cValkyries Ride\u201d and \u201cOnce Sealed In Blood\u201d, which listen very close to the style of faster and catchier melodic riffing that became standard on \u201cWith Oden On Our Side\u201d. \n\nAlthough this would definitely be qualified as the worst of Amon Amarth\u2019s releases, it does have its moments. The material on here sometimes gets a little close to a sort of a thrash feel, particularly at the beginning of \u201cThe Pursuit Of Vikings\u201d, which sounds a little bit like Megadeth before the old NWOBHM styled melodic material creeps in. There\u2019s not really anything that\u2019s overtly bad on here, but most of these songs just don\u2019t seem to really hit their full potential and just sort of coast to the finish line like a film score composition that is written for the intent of being chopped up and distributed to various parts of a feature. If you love this band and have everything else they\u2019ve done, this would be worth a trip to the local discount store, but it\u2019s definitely not something to sell yourself on the street over.\n\nOriginally submitted to (www.metal-observer.com) on April 22, 2009.\n",
        "\nAmon Amarth are known for their tenacious consistency, sticking to a formulaic hybrid of melodic heavy metal that focuses mostly on simplistic musical themes that are easy to grab onto, coupled with a harsh yet intelligible vocal delivery that brings images of long bearded Norsemen with war on their minds. There has been no variation in their chosen lyrical themes, nor any significant modifications to their musical formula, since their inception in the early 90s. The question that naturally arises is how do they keep from repeating themselves within such a strict and boxed in conceptual approach? The obvious answer is that while there is a definite sense of commonality that all of their releases share, the albums differentiate themselves in terms of the potency and power of the delivery.\n\n\u201cWith Oden On Our Side\u201d immediately establishes itself as among the better of their releases right from the beginning, wasting no time with developing some sort of musical introduction to give a solemn blessing to their quest. It just goes right for the jugular with a set of killer yet simple songs, and exploits an enormous upgrade in the band\u2019s production. This band is probably one of very few that have actually benefited from a modern production and maintained the epic feel of their music. The tremolo melodies, the down-tuned riffs, the bass and drums, and Hegg\u2019s berserker-like ravings just meld together perfectly into a thunderous celebration. \n\nBut even more auspicious than the positive result of updating their audio\u2019s fidelity is how remarkably simple the entire song set is. There\u2019s often no more than 4 or 5 riffs per song, and the interchanges between parts is done in a very obvious and methodical way, leading to one of the most formulaic outcomes heard from a melodic death band. The principle riffs of \u201cValhalla Awaits Me\u201d, \u201cAsator\u201d and \u201cWith Oden By Our Side\u201d are among the most memorable, yet also the most intense and speed happy songs that the band has ever put together, taking care not to overuse one of the style\u2019s clich\u00e9s too much, yet ultimately sticking to only a couple of contrasting ideas. Melodic development and lead guitar breaks are a bit more common here than they have been on previous efforts, though they don\u2019t go off quite to the same level of technical showmanship heard out of older Death Metal bands that influenced this style.\n\nThe lyrical themes are also a bit streamlined, concentrating mostly on descriptive storytelling of historical battles, or otherwise centering around the concept of Vikings at war. There\u2019s a lot less mysticism and mythology to be found here aside from the names of the gods being invoked before a battle charge, and everything is told from the standpoint of an unnamed narrator speaking from the view of a collective of people, rather than talking about the individual exploits of singular characters. Even the somewhat differently titled \u201cCry Of The Blackbirds\u201d, which is one of the more intense yet catchy fast songs on here, is lyrically quite straightforward in its depiction of Norse invaders challenging without fear or question.\n\nThough this isn\u2019t necessarily the best of Amon Amarth\u2019s releases, this would probably be the best one to get if you\u2019re just becoming familiar with the band. It\u2019s simplicity, it\u2019s catchiness and it\u2019s high energy level approach to this style is fairly uncharacteristic of many Swedish melodic death bands. From a riff standpoint, it comes a bit closer to a power/thrash character than most of its contemporaries in this style, as well when compared to previous efforts. It\u2019s a definite improvement over the fairly lackluster \u201cFate Of Norns\u201d and has plenty of head banging moments and fanfare melodies to sate all of the frequent concert goers.\n\nOriginally submitted to (www.metal-observer.com) on April 22, 2009.\n",
        "\n\"Pop metal\" is a usually derogatory term I use to describe inoffensive, fluffy, and friendly metal that seems to be made with the idea that it should be easily digestible by the mainstream. Examples of the negative are things like newer Bodom, Norther, and a whole slew of modern hard/rock power metal like the latest Edguy, Arthemis, and Hammerfall. Examples of the kind I enjoy are Ensiferum, Blind Guardian, and the black sheep of Timeless Miracle. I once took part in an internet debate (bad idea, I know), and somebody described Amon Amarth as melodic death metal/arena rock. Since this was around the time With Oden on our Sides was released, and since I'm a huge fan of that record, I took offense to the inflammatory remark. Two years later, Twilight of the Thunder God was released, and I sent the man an email containing a video of me eating my hat.\n\nApart from the fact that he must've been a fucking time traveler in order to know what this album was going to sound like years before recording, he was also 100% right. While Twilight of the Thunder God isn't a bad album per se, it's a noticeable step down from their earlier mastery of modern melodeath. Sure, it contains the title track, which is far and away the best song the band has EVER written, but it also contains garbage like \"Guardians of Asgaard\". Overall, the good outweighs the bad, but this is still unsettling on the whole. The problem is that they rose to initial prominence with a crappy record (Versus the World), and therefore the boring, plodding formula that was utilized there will forever be what people associate with the band, despite their stellar first three albums. While it seems like the band themselves can't let go of their former glory, as evidenced by releasing high speed pummeling tracks like \"Asator\" on the previous album, they can't shake the retardedly simple and catchy ideas that garnered them their popularity in the first place. Listen to the bouncy vocal patterns on \"Where is Your God?\" and \"Tattered Banners and Bloody Flags\" and tell me that they aren't taking cues from the mega successful AOR bands from the 80s. Hell, \"Guardians of Asgaard\" wouldn't sound out of place in a group of skinny, hairy dudes in spandex if only the vocals were different.\n\nOccasionally, they hearken back to their successful formula from WOooS on \"No Fear for the Setting Sun\" and the title track, but I get the feeling like they are trying to take the worn path of just mixing their two styles in order to please fans of both eras. It's honestly a good idea financially, since the new fans think they've gotten much heavier and the old fans think they're returning to their roots, but I'm not fooled. No doubt that this is a decent album, but it lacks whatever made the previous album so special, and it sounds like they made the album more out of an obligation just to churn out an album as opposed to writing an album full of songs they loved. It feels overall uninspired and some songs are frankly just fucking lazily written. They struck gold with the title track, and \"No Fear for the Setting Sun\" and \"Live for the Kill\" are also aggressive numbers reminiscent of what the band does best. \"Guardians of Asgaard\" and \"Varyags of Miklagaard\" are awful and should be ignored, and \"Where is Your God?\" is plagued by a ridiculous bouncy vocal pattern, but is otherwise pretty good. Like I said, this album isn't BAD, but I was expecting much more than I got.\n\nOriginally written for www.metalcrypt.com\n",
        "\nEveryone and their mother knows Amon Amarth these days so there is really no need to say anything about them or their career in general. I mean, last Midsummer, my aunt told me that \"The bonfire looks a lot like the album covers of that Swedish band who sound like Satan.\" The album starts off like so many other Amon Amarth songs, without any introduction, going straight into a fast and simple drum beat and tremolo picking. At about a minute in when the intro part is repeated again with Johan Hegg's harsh and desperate - even mournful - vocals joining in, you know what Amon Amarth is about. Harsh background combined with the melancholy and minor chords ruling the foreground.\n\nWhich is their downfall. You are hard pressed to make a difference between the songs. Their albums often end up sounding like they wrote two songs. \"Oh, this is the fast song. And now this is the slow one. Ah, 'tis the fast one again.\" However, on Sorrow Throughout the Nine Worlds this problem doesn't showcase as strongly. At least not in this particular form. They are yet to become so formulaic in their songwriting. The songs here don't really follow any conventional song structures, just flowing from one part to another, very fluidly too. While this unconventional style of writing makes for an interesting standpoint against the rest of their albums, it doesn't save the album from its aforementioned fatal flaw: The songs blend too much into others. One can listen to the EP from beginning to end numerous times, but nothing really sticks to one's mind. The first song is recognizable for its lack of any sort of intro and Burning Creation is notable for its staccato riff as well as the calmer and even more melancholic atmosphere, but besides that the album is a mesh of tremolo riffs, harsh vocals and bland drumming. \n\nDid I mention the drumming? I didn't? That's because there isn't anything happening there. It's not Martin Lopez yet here, but the original drummer, who is about as generic as you can be. The drumsound is clear, nothing is overpowering, but the man behind the kit just doesn't do anything that would make you want to pay attention to him. Which can be used to describe the rest of the album as well. The rhythm guitars have a great crunch to them, but aside from the intro of Burning Creation, they aren't utilized to any real extent. The lead guitar melodies and vocals are always overpowering them. There's potential here, but if you throw this one on, it's ending before you even realize it and you don't remember any of it.\n",
        "\nI\u2019ve been listening to both the original version and the reissue version off the Versus the World LP and there\u2019s not that much different about the two of them other than the fact that the reissued one has slightly better production with a more crisper guitar tone that sinks into the listener, and a more audible bass part. Still, this is a great death album that you should look for or at least listen to at least once. \n\nOne of my favorite aspects of this band has always been the vocals done by Johan Hegg and how his voice isn\u2019t monotone or have a flat and dull feel to it. He can create what feels like an immense battle or an angry warrior cry with his shrieks, grunts, and screams combined. His vocal speaking is very fast paced throughout much like the entire band itself, adding to the intensity of the music. \n\nThe guitars are amazing, very fast at times, full of melodies, and heavy. They change the pace or tempo of each song quite a bit which I like, it helps make the songs feel less like a linear death metal song and more like a hellish warfare going on in the song. The low tune of the guitars creates some kind of a doom metal like atmosphere at times which I like. The melodies have some sorrowful feel to them at times like at the end of the song \u201cThe Arrival of the Fimbul Winter\u201d which you can hear it the best at 4:16 in the song, right at the end of each song they set up a lower melody unlike what the rest of the song consist of.\n\nLike I said before, the only real difference between this the original versions of the five songs and the reissued versions on the Versus the World album is the production. What\u2019s missing on this one is the how the tone of the guitars is louder on the reissue so you don\u2019t get that whole aggression and battle like feeling in you. Also the guitars aren\u2019t as crisp and easily to hear so they don\u2019t sink you in and the bass part is a little bit harder to hear on this the original version, but considering that this came out almost thirteen years ago I don\u2019t find it to be that big of a deal. \n\nThis is a great EP from one of my favorite melodic death bands. I recommend that you go out and buy it, and if you can\u2019t find this EP you can get all the songs plus some additional ones in the Versus the World album.\n",
        "\nEver since Quorthon decided that combining Norse mythology with heave metal would lead to awesome results, many bands have been steadily absorbing inspiration from the last of the great European pagan beliefs to fall. Perhaps the band which utilises this lyrical approach the most consistently is Amon Amarth, having now released seven albums of melodic death metal with absolutely nothing other than Viking themes to them. \n\nThe unmistakably consistent approach to the band's lyrical themes is only matched by their music: album after album, the band never succumbs to the temptation to change their sound in a direction which could be seen as a betrayal of their roots. While Twilight of the Thunder God has a much more polished production job than each previous album, the sound becoming progressively rawer as we explore their discography further in the past, the music has lost none of the power and tenacity which made Once Sent from the Golden Hall and each following album excellent. \n\nTwilight of the Thunder God contains ten songs, which despite being impossible to confuse with the music of any other band on Earth are all vastly different from each other. For a band which is constantly accused of \"getting too comfortable\" with their sound and not evolving I find that Amon Amarth write very varied albums. Every song is not only unique, it's essential to the entirety of the album, each giving something with which to make of this album a masterpiece. From the fast-paced opening title track, which thunders on with a catchy, well, everything, to the epic closer Embrace the Endless Ocean, no two songs are alike. \n\nSpecial mention must be given to the vocals here. Johan Hegg has always been a very talented vocalist, always putting forth much emotion into his performance throughout the band\u2019s career, but this album almost makes his previous efforts seem sub-par by comparison. Maybe it's the bigger effort put forth for the production or something to do with the song structures, but his vocals are better here than they ever were in the past. The growls feel much more convincing, and there are sections which border on the inhuman, such as the fastest parts on the already breakneck speed song Where is Your God? in addition to the savage portion of Live For the Kill which follows the cello section done by Apocalyptica. I named those two because they're probably the most intense sections, as I'd end up naming each song if I were to talk about what I like about the verses and the choruses throughout. \n\nThe whole band makes an incredible effort here though, not just Johan. The drumming is both varied and technical throughout, although there is one particular song in which the drums are the driving force. This song is Tattered Banners and Bloody Flags, a battlefield song if there ever was one. Combined with the incredible riffs the band conceived for this particularly epic ode to war, the drums create a crushing atmosphere of a brutal fight between two massive armies. The chorus, which is repeated twice, first at the middle of the song and then at the end, gives the song an epic atmosphere rarely heard in music. Such epic sections are present throughout the album, although to a lesser degree when compared to Tattered Banners and Bloody Flags. The instrumental work throughout the album is very good, possibly not as impressive as their best songs off Versus the World or With Oden on our Side but coming so close as to be nearly unnoticeable. \n\nNaming highlights in this album is rather hard since all songs are incredible and worth listening to on their own. The aforementioned Tattered Banners, Live For the Kill with the very well done cello section near the end of the song, the title track and Free Will Sacrifice might all be named highlights, but none of the other songs even come close to being forgettable. Catchy albums such as this one might end up causing listeners to become jaded with some/all of the songs after a certain period of time, but even after over a hundred listens not only have I not lost even a shred of my appreciation for the songs I thought were incredible upon first listen, I've also learned to appreciate those songs which initially did not impress me as much, such as Guardians of Asgaard because of its slowdown chorus or No Fear For the Setting Sun. \n\nTwilight of the Thunder God is yet another masterpiece of an album crafted by Amon Amarth, one of the most talented bands in the current world of metal. This is just one of those albums which are written so well as to be both instantly appreciable upon first listen and excellent upon the ninety-ninth listen. It might not be as good as the previous album or Versus the World, but it certainly lives up to the name Amon Amarth and is in no way a \"watering down\" of the same old formula, actually adding many new interesting elements to the band's work.\n",
        "\nVikings are highly conducive to the metal medium, not merely for the steely swords, grand two-handed battle axes, or even the dragon headed longboats, but also because the spirit of the mighty Norsemen was untamable. It stands to reason that any music depicting such people need have a similarly unrestrained sense of artistry as well as a soldier\u2019s discipline and consistency. In this respect Amon Amarth has always been well suited for the task as aside from updates in production, they have exhibited an almost stubborn tenacity within their highly catchy, melodic and heavily formulaic sound that only the likes of Axel Rudi Pell and Overkill could truly appreciate.\n\n\u201cTwilight Of The Thunder God\u201d is the next logical step in terms of production from \u201cWith Oden On Our Side\u201d, because aside from Johan Hegg\u2019s manic berserker grunts and morose war cries, this album\u2019s mixing work is about as crystal clear as a pool of distilled, unsullied water. A good example can be heard throughout most of \u201cWhere Is Your God?\u201d, which is built almost completely out of those blurry tremolo riffs that Kreator introduced us to back in 1986, but surprisingly with such a crisp pick attack and precise execution that it lacks the stereotypical sloppiness heard in many mid-90s Gotherburg releases. But whether it\u2019s galloping riffs, down-tuned low end grooves, or simple melodic drones, everything is balanced in a manner that gives the album a slick outer layer of sound to hide weathered beards, stained teeth and hairy torsos beneath.\n\nThough as a whole this is not quite as consistent songwriting wise as its predecessor, several songs on here actually surpass much of this band\u2019s previous works. The obvious winner is the title track, which brings forth an unbelievably triumphant melodic riff right at the get go, almost like a grand overture to rival Wagner\u2019s \u201cWalk\u00fcrenritt\u201d but with a darker and less clich\u00e9 nature. It\u2019s fast and furious, makes frequent references to the thrash metal and Iron Maiden influences that birthed this genre, yet at the same time is fresh and inviting. This consistently intricate and up tempo approach, which hearkens back to their early demo days and was reintroduced on the last album, pops up again on nearly as intricate songs such as \u201cNo Fear For The Setting Sun\u201d and \u201cLive For The Kill\u201d. \n\nOn most of the rest of the music occupying this solid opus, things tend to listen well rather than outright extravagant. Part of the fault may lie in placing such a towering epic right at the very beginning of the album and then following it with a couple of mid-tempo numbers in \u201cFree Will Sacrifice\u201d and \u201cGuardians Of Asgaard\u201d which feature very catchy riffs, but are just a bit too settled and subdued, allowing the euphoria that has been produced to tapper off. \u201cThe Hero\u201d and \u201cTattered Banners And Bloody Flags\u201d have very interesting solos and plenty of pleasing melodic passages during buildup points between the verses and choruses, but sort of coast along and don\u2019t quite break out into spellbinding territory. There are a few guitar solos that filter in and out of some of the songs that grab the ears since they occur with a greater frequency than usual, but the most amazing lead break is the guest slot provided by Roope Latvala on the album\u2019s already riveting title track.\n\nIt\u2019s a very safe bet that if you liked the previous album, this one will be a sure winner. Like a few others in the metal world, the chief criticism levied against this band and this solid album is that the band isn\u2019t changing and is too safe. But if the measurement of a worthwhile album is found only in mere innovation, there would be no such thing as development and eventual perfection of style, and we\u2019d be left owning a miniscule handful of albums that we\u2019d get bored of within a few months. Staying within a given format does not leave one with zero latitude for variation, and is a necessary function of musical progression that does occasionally lead to incredible leaps in metal's evolution. But to expect anything other than a melodic death metal album from these veteran Viking folk is unrealistic, and the resulting problem between the listener and the music is a direct result of expectation, nothing more. But instead of dwelling on the opinions of others, the truly metal thing to do would be to simply check this out for yourself, form your own opinion, and enjoy.\n\nOriginally submitted to (www.metal-observer.com) on January 11, 2009.\n",
        "\nThis album is simply too good for me to let the minority of mediocre reviews drag it's percentage down. I am in the crowd who thought Versus the World would be the defining Amon Amarth release, but this has dethroned it in savage viking fashion to take its place at the top of the hill.\n\nThe first and least important triumph of the album is its artwork, depicting a defining moment of Norse mythology and keeping to the strict flame and hammer concept of the band's best works. The second and second most important exploit is the title track, which opens the album with a classic AA epic. If anyone asked me what this band was all about, I would play this track for them. Roope's solo (Which opens with a brief arpeggio that must be Finnish notation for 'Hello There\") is just a little bonus to push the track over the top of fine, typical AA and into distinctive memorability.\n\nThree tracks follow that exemplify everything good, vibrant, and exiting about what the band refuses to call viking metal, that put the melody into melodic death metal and, 'Where is Your God?' especially, keep the death. It's hard, it's so fun it's almost power metal, and it's so catchy that Grieg might have written it. Then track 4 hits. The Varyags of Miklagaard: As Oden peaked with the Blackbirds and Silent Gods topped Vs. The World, Varyags is the pinnacle, the magnum opus, the absolute high point of the album and therefore of AA, and perhaps then of viking metal. There are no words of praise too high for these 4 minutes of glory. It crashes from one riff to another, every theme an epic in itself, but together as they mingle and refrain the effect is akin to Pagan Prosperity or Tchaikovsky's 1812 overture, all compressed into a few seconds of brute force ear penetrating metal that makes me speed every time I hear it in the car, and instills a strange desire in me to die gloriously for the emperor of Istanbul.\n\nAfter that last paragraph, all I can rightly say about the next few songs is that they have a tough act to follow, but they follow it well, each of them would be the hit single from any other album, but here they are the meat of the hour, the connective tissue and all remain individually compelling, each is catchy and original in it's own right. The Hero's repeated closing lyric is a perfect anthem for the philosophy of Scandinavian metal, Apocalyptica's interlude in Live for the Kill adds another brief Finnish touch and sets the stage for the grand finale.\n\nAnd what a finale it is. Like Varyags before it, the Embrace of the Endless Ocean masters that AA trait in which the song is both meloncholy yet exiting, somber and awe inspiring at the same time. As the album draws to a close, I am always forced to admit I have heard few albums so great, so perfect. Rarely do I hear guitars sound so good, and I am hard pressed to find anything on the same level of great music among the classics. I frankly can't imagine any way this thing could have been better, anything on top of what's here would just be icing on the cake, like maybe a live dvd or comic book or, hell, why not bobble-head dolls of all the band members? Well, I can't speak for the $150 edition, I just have the album, and that's so much more than enough.\n\nIf you know Amon Amarth and want more, you have no excuse not to get this. If you read this review trying to figure out which album should introduce you to the band or viking metal or melodic death in general, you found your intro. If you have even the slightest capacity to be invigorated and inspired by great music and great metal, you cannot overlook Twilight of the Thunder God.\n",
        "\nPart two of the best death metal released within the last ten years, or maybe of all time.\n\nIt could be argued that Amon Amarth isn't pure death metal, whatever the fuck that means. This is DM whether you like it or not. Labeling bands may help you categorize them, but other than that it's useless. Not everyone has to sound like fucking Cannibal Craps to be considered death metal.\n\nWith Oden On Our Side is part of a continuing evolution in sound. Amon Amarth doesn't really change a whole lot from recording to recording, only using a different take on the same ideas each time. Fortunately, they pull it off well on nearly every release. Their entire discography is damn strong but this album is the ultimate execution of what this band is going for. A previous reviewer made a reference to Oden and Thor joining the band. I concur, it's as if they were sitting in for session work on this album or something. By, Oden! I feel a navy blue vicar coming on...\n\nTHUNDERBOLT RIFF UP YOUR ASS, SIDEWAYS PERHAPS.\nGALLOPING KING KONG DRUMMING TRAMPLES YOUR MUM.\n\nSorry, I felt that necessary just to underline how fucking epic this is. I usually take epic to mean \"dramatic\". But this is dramatic in the sense that a humongous Viking asshole is kicking the shit out of you after he robs your house and sets it on fire. That bastard even took your girlfriend. VIKING DRAMA. The lyrics are pure win. And the vocal delivery is described with words like \"big\" and \"Scandinavian\". You can clearly hear the words too, which is a big plus. Let me lay a few lines on you.\n\nI drop the shield\nand grab my axe.\nA weapon in each fist!\n\nThe first blow\nmakes the helmet crack.\nThe axe cut to the teeth!\n\nI rip the axe\nfrom the head,\ncovered in blood and brains!\n\nLeave the body lying dead,\nready to strike again!\n\nYeah. There are no doubts about what this music is about. To quote a friend who has seen them live, \"These dudes really think they're Vikings or something!\" The ultimate beer + headbanging music for sure. Everything is highly memorable, catchy even, with plenty of neck wrecking anthems. At times it really makes me think \"Saving Private Viking\" because the feeling of brotherhood is so strong, particularly on Under The Northern Star. This is in addition to the more pervasive feeling of invading some unsuspecting villagers and totally owning them. It's like your riding into battle with the band and this is the soundtrack. Now where's my fucking share of the loot?\n\nProduction is clean and spacious, the instrument sounds are great. The best I've heard from them (the following album is equal but not nearly as fulfilling otherwise). The melodic riffing on here is extremely epic. Lots of tremolo picking and the usual heavy power chord progressions and such. This is understated though since it's all absolutely amazing and is bested by only one other death metal album (the last to be featured in this series of reviews). The drumming is refreshingly restrained and manages to be suitably epic with plenty of different fills and cymbals to keep things interesting.\n\nThe pacing is generally mid tempo and the songs structures are rather conventional. They still please though, no glaring flaws with the composition. They don't really do anything revolutionary, however. Amon Amarth plays a unique brand of Swedish death that's better than similar bands like Entombed and Dismember along with more melodic acts like (gag) In Flames. More so than anyone else, I could compare them to Bolt Thrower the best. Both good, but again...Amon Amarth is better with this album!\n",
        "\n\"It's been two years, time for another album!\" is the underlying tone of this release, because 'Twilight of the Thunder God' is yet another Amon Amarth album; nothing more, quite a bit less though. While the majority of their discography is difficult to distinguish at times, except by production values, this album displays quite a notable dip in the quality of material presented. In layman's terms, they're really phoning it in by giving us what is a fairly inoffensive and unadventurous album.\n\nAmon Amarth's usual brand of melodic death metal is still on display and there are moments when it reaches their previous standards; the opening title track is a good example of what you'd find on 'With Oden on our Side' with plenty of speed along with a well-timed thrash break followed by the usual solo. \"Where is your God?\" is the heaviest song, sporting some simple but percussive death metal riffs and is just long enough to hold your interest. \"No Fear for the Setting Sun\" is quite similar, sporting some heavy riffs and generally eschewing the overtly sweet melodic lines that subdue the other songs.\n\nThe rest of the album is a retread of ground that we're all too familiar with, and while the aforementioned highlights are not innocent of such an accusation, they manage to diverge from the formula enough to keep things interesting without alienating the listener. It is something of a challenge to describe the experience of listening to 'Twilight of the Thunder God': it's tedious but at the same time you're not compelled to shut it off because at least it is competent noise filling the air. The main riff to each of the other songs is exceedingly dull; either due to an unimaginative set of chords or because the intensity was dialled down to 4. Even when they move into the usual tremolo picked section there's no intensity behind the instrumentation, it's part of the song because that's how Amon Amarth write their songs. The aforementioned increase in melodies can be attributed to an overall decrease in song quality mainly because their inception into every song is performed with a notable absence of subtlety. It's like launching a mortar into the sky only to have it suddenly dive into the ground just as it was about to reach the peak of its trajectory.\n\nIt feels unfair to bash Amon Amarth for having a consistent sound, but with every new album they release it's getting ridiculous because there are no risks in purchasing (or \"obtaining\") their new material. While people would argue that an absence of risk is a positive attribute, they are forgetting that you're not gaining anything from an album that sounds like the missing ten tracks from the previous one. Oh sure, now you've got another ten Amon Amarth songs to listen to in case you somehow got sick of the other sixty or so, but their consistency has resulted in stagnation. They neither decrease nor increase in quality. The excitement of a new album is in seeing what new ideas are coming to the forefront, and even if those albums happen to suck harder than a nuclear-powered dust buster it just makes the band's older material that much better by comparison. Where those bands fail plenty of others succeed which makes up for the pain and suffering of the previous infractions.\n\nAmon Amarth is a safe band, and 'Twilight of the Thunder God' is another safe album. I'd love to disdain this album but there are glimpses of actual effort being put into the song writing and of course the instrumental skill is up to standard. This is not a great album, it is merely competent.\n",
        "\nOn first listen I thought Twilight of the Thunder God sounds good but not as good as the last one, by the tenth listen I am anticipating the music, nice catchy riffs, cool melodies, tremendous power, you know the formula, by the twentieth listen it felt like an old friend, a classic and I\u2019ve only had it a week. I\u2019m sitting here on a Wednesday, the disk is being released in Sweden and Finland today, and in the rest of Europe on Friday and Monday. North America gets it the following Tuesday. It is only fitting it should have been released on a Thursday, and that is my only gripe with this album. Seriously. \n\nThe main thing I look for in Amon Amarth is consistency. They know what works in the studio and they stick with it, so sound quality is always spot on. They also know what image they want the songs to fit within, and they always do. Pick any release and any song would fit on any other release. Overall this is a diverse album, as long as you describe diverse as fitting within the confines of the predetermined Amon Amarth sound. Not only is there fast powerful riffing and high tempo drumming, but also somber melodies and heartfelt sorrow expressed with grace. \u201cEmbrace of the Endless Ocean\u201d is an album closer that makes you pause in what you are doing and take notice. It also makes you hesitate in starting up another disc as you devote some time to reflection. \n\n\u201cTattered Banners and Bloody Flags\u201d grabs your attention with the drum rolls to start and keeps it with the guitar leads. \u201cWhere is your God?\u201d has repeating riffs that will haunt your dreams they are so memorable. No need to mention the growls of Johan, as dynamic and powerful as ever and once again they dominate in the mix. And, as always he has a story to tell and he relates it beautifully. A few years back Johan told me his favorite passage from the Eddas is Ragnarok, and now he has successfully scripted the story for this album, a continuation of \u201cThe Arrival of the Fimbul Winter\u201d, \u201cBurning Creation\u201d and \u201c...and Soon the World Will Cease to Be,\u201d the title track is Thor\u2019s battle with Jormungandr, as magnificently rendered on the album cover. The song is a frenzy befitting this monumental battle that decides the fate of the world, easily one of the most powerful songs that band has ever written. Olavi Mikkonen is in top form. \n\nAbout two years ago I started loading all my cds and records into my computer in anticipation of getting an ipod. According to itunes I have 2148 bands represented and only one band has received more airplay in the last two years than Amon Amarth, Enslaved. There is something to be said about the company you keep\u2026 In addition to the cd release there will be a 2CD & DVD digipack, a double etched LP (1500 copies), a picture disc LP (500 copies) and a 'Bubblehead' edition (2000 copies). Does Twilight of the Thunder God measure up to the damn near perfect With Oden On Our Side? Damn straight it does. \n\nOriginally written for http://teethofthedivine.com\n",
        "\nWhat can be said about this album? To start off, no matter if you're a long-time fan of Melodic Death Metal or a newcomer to the genre, it's a great listen and not too hard to get into.\n\nStarting off with the heavy yet melodic Valhall Awaits Me, we are immediately introduced to the signature Amon Amarth sound, and Johan Hegg starts the song, fittingly, with the lines Blood gushes from the wound/The cut is wide and deep/Right before I turn around/He falls to his knees, in the vein of the song and in fact the album, which is mostly about Viking battles, death, and valor. No one better than Hegg to be able sing about this, his voice fitting perfectly with the subject material.\n\nHowever, before you know it, the song is over, and Runes to My Memory starts off, this time with slightly different subject material. Instead of dealing with the afterlife, the lyrics in Runes... are about what to do with the protagonist (probably the leader of the Viking clan), suggesting that he be glorified after his death with ancient runes describing his valorous acts. The melody keeps somewhat in tune with that of Valhall Awaits Me, so even if they are both amazing songs, they seem somewhat similar at first impression.\n\nNow we are treated to one of the less amazing (though still worthwhile) songs on the album, Asator. As one of the fastest songs, it is also one of the only ones that does not deal with battles or themes concerning the Vikings themselves, this song is more of a glorification of the Thunder God, Asator (which, by the way, is the Swedish name for Thor). The song does have one of the catchiest solos of the album, and all in all is just a good listen.\n\nHermod's Ride to Hel - Lokes Treachery, Part 1 implies that there might be a Part 2 somewhere, but so far it hasn't been announced, not even on the new album slated for release in September (Twilight of the Thunder Gods). Like Asator, this is one of not many lesser good songs on the album, though they are still all worth listening to with every listen of the album. Lyrically, however, this is an epic that could even be taken from an ancient book of folklore, very intricately relating Hermod and his journey to Hell.\n\nNow we get to the beginning of the second half of the album, which is somewhat better than the first half. Gods of War Arise, even when just listening to the chorus (Sacrifice to Gods of old/Bleed them of their lives/Fresh blood on our swords/Gods of war arise) makes you think of epic battles (and possibly part of a soundtrack to a multiplayer God of War game or Viking game). In similar vein as the first two songs on the album, the song elaborately describes battles worthy of the Vikings of old (to which the band members bear a striking resemblance). We are treated to multiple amazing solos, all fitting to the melody still being played in the background, and Hegg's vocal performance, like in all other songs, is top-notch.\n\nThe title track of the album, With Oden on Our Side, again goes back to the main theme of the album: battles (and valor). It describes the protagonist Viking clan at nightfall, waiting to attack an enemy village. Courageous, they attack, expecting nothing but to be valorous worthy of entrance to Valhalla (For each of us there are four of them/It matters not to us/We won't leave this field in shame/We are here to crush). Repeating lines of The battle is already won refers to their bloodthirstiness and their unwillingness to give up. This comes paired with the courage given to them by Oden (Under winter skies/We stand glorious/And with Oden on our side/We are victorious) they gain the strength needed to win the battle with no difficulty. One of the best songs of the album.\n\nAlmost as good, next is Cry of the Black Birds, a song which at first seems not to fit with the major themes of the album, but after consequent listens it is definite that it does. The black birds, of course, are ravens, that invoke anger and fear and take care of the dead. Lyrically, the last verse (The enemies are in disarray ride them down as they run/Send them to their violent graves, don't spare anyone/Dead and wounded lie all around see the pain in their eyes/Over the field an eerie sound, as we hear the raven's cry) and the third line of the chorus (Have no fear of death when it's your time) are some of the best on the album, for obvious reasons. The melodies played during the battle scenes are also amazingly done, resembling the charging horses portrayed and the wrath of the Vikings.\n\nWe now get to the softest (though still incredibly heavy for someone not used to the genre) yet most melodic song of the album, Under the Northern Star (ironically, Hegg's vocals in this song are some of the heaviest and deepest of all the songs). The battlefields strategically placed in other songs are here replaced by the open seas that the Vikings look to in order to return back home after such a long time. Telling some small parts of things that have happened, (The many hardships we've endured/Have brought us rich reward/Now the north star guides us home/With cargo full of gold) the protagonist implies that everyone has fought bravely, and paired with typical themes of Viking valor (Many friends died on the way/Only few of us survived/But I would gladly take their place/In Oden's hall up high) makes this a somewhat atypical but very successful song. In fact, I would place this at the top if I were to choose the best song on the album, abnormalities aside.\n\nTaking a departure back the the normal style heard in the other songs, now comes the last and longest song, Prediction of Warfare. Like Under the Northern Star, the Vikings must head to sea, to conquer Ireland. On the way there, the protagonist (presumably still the clan leader as described in earlier songs) has a nightmare, an omen, as he calls it, of a sea serpent attacking their ship. The serpent was scared off by the wrath of the furious Vikings, and as the warlord wakes up, land is seen. Attacking the Irish that have already prepared on land became harder as more were killed (The fight was short and deadly intense/The Irish fought us well/But as we gained the upperhand/Their fighting spirit grew), but as they kept on fighting, in the end, the king just escaped instead of fighting the Vikings (closely interlinking with what happened to the serpent). A very nice closure to the album.\n\nAll in all, this is an amazing album. Incredibly catchy from the first few listens on, Hegg's vocals are very deep and heavy, fitting amazingly well with Amon Amarth's subject matter. The album could have maybe one more song, but as is it already near perfect. Another thing is the album art. Though nicely done, it's a pretty big leap away from earlier Amon Amarth albums, which were not only more colorful, but also more descriptive. This is somewhat bland.\n",
        "\nSomebody said this about Amon Amarth once: Some bands sing about vikings. These guys ARE vikings.\n\n\n\"Versus the World\" is epic melodic death metal about Valhalla, Oden, Norse runes, anti-Christianity and all that fun stuff. Lyrically these guys are no better than fantasy bands like Blind Guardian (\"Amon Amarth\" is basically Mount Doom in Lord of the Rings), but they are a much tighter band than Blind Guardian, and much more ballsy. They still play epic melodic death/viking metal and they are still bitter as hell (see the album title), so it isn't a huge departure from the previous albums. The difference is that this album has a more melancholic feel to it, which works surprisingly well for such an intense band.\n\n\nHere's a sample of the lyrics:\n\n\"All you know will wither away\nAnd sink into the sea\nA new world will be born one day\nWhere everyone is free\"\n\n\"The Northern wind brings snow and ice\nHumans starve and freeze\nThe Fimbul winter has arrived\nAnd soon the world will cease to be\"\n\n\"I want to walk across the Rainbow Bridge\nAnd see my fathers in the golden hall\nThey beckon me to join their feast\nIn my dreams I hear their call\"\n\n\nAs you can see, \"Versus the World\" is intense, but also full of sorrowful moments. Overall, this is the best Amon Amarth album you can buy, or illegally download. First of all, the amount of boring speed runs is kept to a minimum and they have slowed down the tempos, allowing more moments for things to sink in and really register. Instead of leaving no reaction time like many death and thrash metal bands, they know precisely when to apply the force, which is after an emotion has been developed. This helps them build atmosphere, which many blitzcore bands forget to make use of. This really shows in \"Where Silent Gods Stand Guard,\" a song that gets the maximum emotional impact out of an epic chord progression and Johan Hegg's intense vocal performance. \"Versus the World\" contrasts an epic melody in the verse with the intense groove following the chorus, making the song more effective than the majority of death metal songs, because (to generalize) the lack of these contrasts sometimes produces a \"meh...\" reaction. The mid-tempo approach yields opuses like the heavy-hearted \"...And Soon the World Will Cease to Be.\" and similarly pessimistic moments.\n\n\nNow, I usually hate mid-tempo metal, because it often turns out to be a sell-out tactic, lacking any sort of substance. Or, it can reveal just how boring a musical style is when not played at an inhuman tempo (ie. Dragonforce). But on this album, the guitars take their time, building epic landscapes for Johan Hegg's viking tales about \"Death In Fire\" and Oden's ride \"Down the Slopes of Death.\" Amon Amarth create overwhelming melodic build-ups/passages, and then apply the full death metal fury of growled vocals, war drums, and savage guitars with awesome results. The drums and bass don't play a huge role in this, but they are definitely interesting at times (especially in that awesome groove of the title track). Every song is memorable; there is no filler as their approach succeeds most of the time.\n\n\nThis time around, the vikings are a bit more sad. And I like it! They are still tight and taut, with more epic than previously thought possible. Amon Amarth's riffs are still diamond-hard, but the melodies are outstanding and well thought out. The groove is mid-tempo through-out, but not the boring, incompetent kind that is usually expected. Don't misunderstand, this is still pretty fucking intense. Only now, the intensity isn't only channelled through anger and rage.\n",
        "\nGet ready to pillage and burn the towns of your enemies because Amon Amarth are back with a new set of glorious battle hymns entitled \u201cTwilight of the Thundergod\u201d. This album marks the 7th full-length release by the band in 10 years, and brings to mind a few things; Amon Amarth are consistent in the sense that their brand of powerful, viking-themed melodic death metal does not drastically change from album to album and also that they have been able to maintain the same, steady lineup for almost a decade. While their style hasn\u2019t really changed since \u201cOnce Sent from the Golden Hall\u201d, Amon Amarth have tweaked their music to create maximum impact, and \u201cTwilight of the Thundergod\u201d is their strongest effort overall so far.\n\n\nAmon Amarth start things off with the title track, which is a fast and hard hitting track that brings to mind the song \u201cCry of the Blackbirds\u201d from \u201cWith Oden on Our Side\u201d. The churning guitars create an epic, melodic, and powerful atmosphere while drummer Fredrik Andersson drives the rhythm along with his relentless double bass attack. Johan Hegg unleashes his monstrous roar, and he has never sounded better. His growls have become a little lower on this album, but maintain the intensity and clarity that Johan is known for. This song is perfect way to open the album. \n\n\nAmon Amarth then follow the opening track with two mid-paced songs, \u201cFree Will Sacrifice\u201d and \u201cGuardians of Asgaard\u201d. Both songs lose none of their bite or epic atmosphere, and feature memorable growl-along choruses. \u201cWhere Is Your God?\u201d sees the band return to the speedy, tremolo-picked, double bass fury of the title track, albeit with a darker tone. The track rages along much like \u201cAsator\u201d from their previous album. The next few songs are similar to the first four in that they follow the same aggressive but melodic formula perfected by Amon Amarth. The songs vary in tempo but are always intense and blood-pumping tunes.\n\n\nThe biggest and best surprise in the album comes in the song \u201cLive For the Kill\u201d. The song begins with all of the components that make up the speedy Amon Amarth song, including pounding double bass, searing rhythm guitar, and memorable lead guitar melodies. The song comes off as another killer anthem, but after the guitar solo towards the end of the track something happens; the entire band stops playing and a new instrument is introduced for the first time in Amon Amarth\u2019s history. What could it be? If you guessed strings in the form of Finland\u2019s Apocalyptica you are absolutely correct. Apocalyptica come in mimicking a lead guitar line from earlier in the song, and when it is Amon Amarth\u2019s turn to rejoin the action, the resulting remainder of the song becomes the most pleasing moment in an album that has no weak points or filler material.\n\n\nThe album comes to a close with the last track \u201cEmbrace the Endless Ocean\u201d. At nearly 7 minutes and containing a variety of tempos, this is the perfect way to close an epic musical journey that invokes images of vikings, Norse tales, longboats, and Ragnarok (as illustrated in the mind-blowing artwork).\n\n\nOnto the band\u2019s performance. \u201cTwilight of the Thundergod\u201d sees every member of Amon Amarth in top shape. As mentioned earlier, Johan Hegg has never sounded better. He growls with more conviction and passion than most vocalists could only dream of. He expanded his growling range to incorporate more lows on this album, and his efforts really pay off. The title track and \u201cFree Will Sacrifice\u201d highlight the power and clarity of his low growls, both featuring some of his lowest growling on any album. His midrange and high vocals are still as venomous as ever. \n\n\nFredrik Andersson once again delivers the goods and holds back nothing as he tears through the album\u2019s ten tracks like J\u00f6rmungandr (the sea serpent in the artwork) tears through ships. His double bass work is impressive and proves to be an important element of Amon Amarth\u2019s driving rhythm. Fredrik also complements his powerful style with tasteful cymbal work and tom fills. Ted Lundstr\u00f6m anchors the rest of the rhythm section with his style augmenting the drum attack.\n\n\nThe guitar work of Johan S\u00f6derberg and Olavi Mikkonen is nothing short of excellent. These Swedes know how to create the perfect balance of melody and aggression. The lead lines and solos are more melodic and epic this time around, but do not venture into sappy Gothenburg territory. The guitar solos are well thought out, adding additional emotion to the songs. Their power chords and low tremolo-picked rhythm parts provide plenty of low-end muscle to back the melodic guitar harmonies.\n\n\nThe production is excellent as well. The album as a whole has a more powerful and fuller sound than \u201cWith Oden on Our Side\u201d (not that there was anything wrong with that production). The first thing about the production that I noticed was that Fredrik\u2019s bass drums have a thicker and more natural sound this time around. The rest of the drum kit is nicely mixed as well. The guitars sound as big and powerful as ever, sporting a slightly more distorted and warmer tone. The low end of the guitar sound is appropriately pounding while the lead guitar sound is clear and bright. The production and mixing attains a great balance between every instrument, making sure that everything is clearly heard and no one instrument gets more attention and volume than the next.\n\n\n\u201cTwilight of the Thundergod\u201d sees Amon Amarth in top shape. They have made many great albums over the years, but they have never sounded better and more convincing. All of the songs shine in some way and there are no boring parts or fillers in this album. This album displays the consistent quality and unique style that we\u2019ve come to expect from Amon Amarth, coupled with better production and topped off with stellar artwork. If you\u2019re already a fan you know what this album is going to sound like, and if you\u2019re into melodic and aggressive metal I encourage you to check it out. Be sure to get the special edition with the bonus live album.\n",
        "\nAmon Amarth are a band reputed for being consistent. Whether this means earning some criticism for never changing their formula, or the rabid fandom of countless metalheads eating up every release, it seems to work just fine for them. I happen to love every one of their releases. I'm a massive fan of the band, but I am also aware that their albums suffer from repetition syndrome. Having said this, it was feared that Amon Amarth had peaked with last year's extraordinary \"With Oden On Our Side.\" The album perfectly blended crushing riffs with soaring melodies and the occasional ballad-esque song; the result was, in my eyes, a melodic death metal masterpiece. This year, the band has come up with an offering that, while not as truly memorable as WOOOS, manages to broaden their musical horizons while still delivering the same old ass kicking viking-tinged metal we know and love. Or maybe you don't.\n\nIn a recent interview with Chad Bowar, Johan Hegg was asked what the band had done to make \"Twilight\" different from their other releases. He said the most important difference was that they'd lifted the melodies in the mix, making them more prominent. From the beginning of the album, this is immediately obvious. Previous songs, such as \"Hermod's Ride to Hel\" off last year's album, have seen the melodic leads of Olavi and Johan being forced to compete with the drums and Johan's growls. The title track, however, shows us that the guitars have been given more room to demonstrate the impressive melodies these guitarists are capable of producing. Other songs such as \"Varyags of Miklagaard\" continue to showcase these soaring leads, and contribute a more grand atmosphere to the album. I would love to see \"Thousand Years of Oppression\" re-recorded with this new production technique. \n\nThe songs on \"Twilight of the Thunder God\" have not suffered or been \"toned down\" thanks to this new production technique, however. Not by any means. Johan's vocals are harsher than ever, and songs such as \"Where is Your God?\" (think a more guttural Asator) and \"Guardians of Asgaard\" demonstrate how brutal the band can still be. The lyrical themes have also been expanded from the simplistic, sometimes comical, lines of previous releases. The band's story-telling abilities have improved dramatically, without resorting to straight forward methods. \"The Hero\" in particular is an impressive piece with an awesome ending and story arch. Fredrik's drumming is still top-notch and provides a solid base for the rest of the band to work from. Perhaps lacking, though, is his masterful and varied work from previous tracks such as \"Death in Fire\" and \"Cry of the Black Birds.\" \n\nPutting aside the stronger presence of melody, there are more changes to Amon Amarth' sound on this album. \"Live For The Kill\" kicks off with an awesome intro, and some impressive guitar work. Seems like a standard Amon track.Then comes the completely unexpected cello break, provided by Finnish trio Apocalyptica. Amon Amarth have never done anything like this before, and the results are stunning. The guitar is a versatile instrument, but sometimes cannot provide the sheer emotional atmosphere invoked when classical instruments are brought into the mix. An overuse of this technique would ruin the album, but the band has been smart enough to only give us a taste. Following this track is the album's vast, almost progressive, end track; \"Embrace of the Endless Ocean.\" Bringing back the awesome tapping techniques used sparingly on \"Versus the World\", the guitarists not only give us some more excellent melodic work, but have also shifted their tone to a less 'metal' sound. The result is something entirely new for Amon Amarth, and hopefully a glimpse of what is to come.\n\n\"Twilight of the Thunder God\" is an excellent album. It delivers what is expected from Amon Amarth, while simultaneously incorporating new ideas and instrumentation. What prevents it from being a classic, however, is the ever-present filler track (\"No Fear For The Setting Sun) and nothing new from Fredrik in the percussion department. Even if you aren't a fan of the band's previous work, I suggest giving this album a try. That kickass cover art should be a welcome addition to any collection.\n",
        "\nThis seems to be Amon Amarth\u2019s most controversial album. Many see it as their weakest, while many others see it as the same Viking ass kickery the band have so consistently delivered. I see this as an underrated album. It isn\u2019t their best, nor their worst. It does appear to be largely overlooked as it was released in between two albums that are widely regarded as the bands two best.\n\nStylistically, it is similar to Versus The World, perhaps less melodic and more heavy. While generally still melodic, many of the riffs are faster and heavier on this album than previous. One thing that has improved with this release is epic atmosphere. Amon Amarth have always been epic, but not exclusively. In previous years, albums may have only had one or two songs with such an mood. This time around, it\u2019s everywhere. Be it the stunning false ending of An Ancient Sign Of Coming Storm, the spoken passage from Where Death Seems To Dwell, the memorable chorus of Pursuit Of Vikings, or the continuing story behind Arson and Once Sealed In Blood. As stated earlier, Fate Of Norns is a more heavy and intense approach to the music. Valkyries Ride and Beheading Of A King display intensity best. The riffs are catchy as hell, and the vocals are vicious.\n\nThis album is a lot of fun but not perfect. The extreme consistency of the music sometimes acts as a double edged sword. There are no bad or boring tracks, however when listened to all at once, the album begins to feel restrained and repetitive at times. I would much rather have this problem than an album teeming with filler tracks though. Despite this, Fate Of Norns has great replay value. It has some of their catchiest material (Pursuit Of Vikings) and some of their most epic (Arson).\n\nIf you\u2019re a fan of Amon Amarth\u2019s other work, this doesn\u2019t stray from the foundation the band have built in the past. Fate Of Norns is dark, cold, and Viking! If this is sounds interesting to you, I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll regret picking up this album.\n",
        "\nThe most consistent criticism I\u2019ve seen of Sweden\u2019s Amon Amarth is that they have consistently released the same album for the last ten years. No piece of evidence does more to disprove this theory than their 1998 debut full length \u201cOnce Sent From the Golden Hall\u201d. The sheer amount of growth in song writing from \u201cOnce Sent\u201d to their most recent \u201cWith Oden on Our Side\u201d proves that the Amon Amarth have been growing and improving over the last decade, not stagnating.\n\nThis of course is not to put down their debut. All of the elements that would later be hallmarks of Amon Amarth\u2019s Viking themed melodic death metal are here albeit in a much less polished fashion. All the epic melodic arrangements and slower military marches are here, but feel far more desperate and frantic. A great deal of this frenetic passion comes from Martin Lopez. Unlike the smooth jazzy style he would later employ during his long stint with Opeth, Lopez drives the tempo like a man in fear for his life. This adrenaline charged performance may result in the occasional slip in tempo, but in no way is a detriment to the album.\n\nOf course this is a heavy metal record so the drums are really only a support to the all mighty guitars. Here the guitars are indeed mighty. The production allows for a thunderous guitar sound, perfectly suiting for the charging melodies and driving rhythms that Amon Amarth are known for. \u201cVictorious March\u201d in particular features some of the greatest riffs the band has ever played such as the triumphant opening melody, or the brutal verse riff. The heavy presence of solos on this record also stands out from later Amon Amarth albums. These solos are perfect examples of how to play emotionally charged lead parts without taking away from the mood of the song, a trick many modern death metal bands could use some education in. It\u2019s a shame the production has driven the lead work so low in the mix.\n\nJohan Hegg is nowhere near as brutal as he later became, but what he lacks in skull crushing he makes up for in spades with passion. The man bellows, screams and shouts like the Vikings he sings about with a raw determination that is truly inspiring. His enunciation however is damaged as a result, making it difficult to make out exactly which adventure he is talking about, although it\u2019s safe to assume that some Christians are going to die by the time the album\u2019s over. \n\nThis is not Amon Amarth\u2019s best album. At this stage their ability to string together riffs was still under development and some songs, in particular \u201cAbandoned\u201d, suffer for it. The band\u2019s namesake song also drags on a bit, but every time I hear that battle sequence my heart flutters a little so I can\u2019t with any honestly knock them that hard for it. If you\u2019ve never heard Amon Amarth before this probably isn\u2019t the best place to start, but if you know you like them than there should be nothing stopping you to pick this one up.\n",
        "\nOnce Sent From The Golden Hall is Amon Amarth's debut album, and many people consider it this band's best work, therefore I was very excited when I bought this CD, expecting great things from it. \n\nAs soon as the music started, with the incredibly epic and fast Ride for Vengeance, I found myself headbanging next to the stereo. Besides the production (which is far from perfect, although it's not bad either), this very fast track displays many of the things you'll hear on this album: incredible speed, memorable riffs, a really AWESOME drumming and, last but definitely not least, an excellent vocal performance by Johan Hegg. All throughout the album, you'll hear the (almost) never-ending double pedal and the drums backing the epic riffs and melodies coming from the guitars, while Hegg growls and screams very well about revenge against Christians, viking raids, battles and so on. These amazing vocals can especially be noticed in The Dragons' Flight Across The Waves' last section (ROW LIKE THE WIND TO ATTACK!), or during the whole Without Fear (a real masterpiece), where Hegg mixes very good screaming and growling to some almost clean vocals. All of this while epic and fast solos or heavily distorted riffs, aided by the insane drumming, give the songs a brutal speed that can rarely be found in melodic death metal (and even the same band's latest releases haven't been as fast as this one).\n\nWhile the lyrics are nothing too complex (but man, they're fucking epic!), the way Hegg sings them is definitely one of the best things you can hear on this album. His very particular, \"viking\" growling is something unique and unheard in death metal, is something that really helps giving this album the amazing epic feel it's got. The songs are all very fast, and some are even quite similar between them, but you'll never get bored of this album, for its insanely quick pace doesn't give you the time to stop headbanging and get bored! The real exception here is Amon Amarth, which is the slowest track on the album. Its lyrics (excellently sang, as always) speak about the band itself, and they mostly do it with a slow, melodic rhythm. You'll be mesmerized by this song's main riff (reason for which it has also become the official Amon Amarth intro in live concerts), and although this song is the longest and the slowest one on the CD, you won't get bored of it. The effects in the central part of the track (with the sounds of men fighting) also give this song a distinct \"viking\" feel. \n\nThe last song on the CD is the title-track Once Sent From The Golden Hall, which returns to the very quick rhythms of the other songs. As a conclusion, I would say that this album is definitely a very good one, which will make your head bang from the first to the last track, and which will have you beg for more after it's ended. And so, I can confirm: this is one of the best Amon Amarth albums, if not the best overall, due to its extremely fast, epic rhythm, thing on which I have focused very much in this review (for it is the most noticeable thing on the whole CD) and also for Johan Hegg's excellent vocal performance. A must for any death metal (and especially melodic death metal) fan, this album is, in my opinion, very influential for the genre and will probably be considered as a \"starting point\" in the future. So, who said Vikings can't play death metal?\n",
        "\nMelodic death metal, as a term, often strikes fear into the hearts of metalheads everywhere. Bombarded with the mallcorish Children Of Bodom and In Flames in reference to this phrase, the metal community has, for the most part, tried to disown such a genre of metal. But not every melodic death metal band are power metal with extreme vocals.\n\nAmon Amarth are melodic death metal. They are death metal, except that there is quite a lot of melody. Not only that, but With Oden On Our Side is absolutely fantastic. It loses a few points for not being absolutely perfect and gains a few for being a great example of how to implant melody into death metal without losing the death metal appeal. \n\nIt's very difficult to pick a song that, above all others, stands out but after weeks of listening to this album I believe the most powerful track to be \"Asator\", thanks to its explosive chorus and Maidenesque solo. When the tremolo picking comes in and the speakers roar \"Fire! Burning in the skies!\", it becomes clear that this is THE band, and possibly THE album to launch traditional death metal (for that is what Amon Amarth are, first and foremost) into a stratospheric resurgence of activity. \nMost of the other tracks on the record are almost as strong, with perhaps only \"Cry Of The Black Birds\" and \"Hermod's Ride To Hel\" falling short of the rest although they are, by no means, weak tracks. They simply don't live up to the quality of the rest of the album, like \"Paranoid\" on Black Sabbath's album of the same name. Except that they're better songs than \"Paranoid\", don't worry.\n\nThe guitars have quite clean production, although it's definately not crystal clear as there is a touch of death metal grit. This holds true for the bass as well, although being lower in the mix, the bass will of course seem somewhat muddier. The drums hold a fairly significant place, being clearly audible but somewhat forgettable considering the strength of the guitar tracks, but they compliment the music very well indeed. The vocals, given the death metal genre, needed and received a very, very clean production to ensure easy(ish!) comprehension. In short, all of that means that there is nothing about the production that gets in the way of the music, with Amon Amarth having an overall sound approaching black metal in terms of atmosphere, power metal in terms of scope and death metal in terms of pure brutality. \n\n\n\nLet's talk about the lyrics! Or perhaps not. The lyrics are about Vikings and Norse Mythology and stuff. Some people like it, some don't and since lyrics are an almost universal part of modern music I've decided not to rate them in this review.\n\nTo look at what this album has going for it:\n\n- Excellent songwriting\n- A unique sound\n- Varied songs\n- Atmosphere\n- Brilliant vocals and instrumentation\n\nAnd in comparison, its wrongdoings:\n\n- Some songs aren't quite as good as others\n- Some people don't like death metal\n\n\nLooks like we have a winner.\n",
        "\nAmon Amarth... what a band. When I went off on my tangent about how much Sweden sucks in my Persuader review, I managed to completely forget about one of the greatest prospects from that ass of a country, Amon Amarth. To me, they have the Alpha and Omega, but none of the rest of the alphabet. What I mean by that is that their beginning and end are astounding, but the middle never goes much higher than \"a bit above mediocre\". Once Sent from the Golden Hall is their Alpha, and With Oden on our Sides is the Omega at this point in their careers. I really hope this isn't the last good album though, but so far this stands as the only amazing one since their debut.\n\nLets get one thing straight, this album is LOUD! Holy dick, I almost blew out my car speakers after buying this one. This adds nothing but positivity though, so don't think I'm knocking the production or anything. Most of the songs are slightly above mid pace (although there are songs like Asator that completely obliterate), and all are rife with melody. So I guess this could be classified as melodic death metal by definition, but it should never be grouped with the likes of At the Gates or In Flames, it is far more aggressive than anything they've ever pulled off. Johan Hegg is one of the better death growlers in the business right now. His wet, vicious, and throaty roar compliments the tales of bloody viking violence very well. You can actually see the poor chump getting his head split open in Valhall Awaits One while the vocalist stands there, wind from the storm on the battlefield blowing his hair and beard back, standing triumphantly with one arm slightly behind him, clenched fist, and the other arm holding the axe that is now fully embedded in his foe's skull while he lets out the mighty roar of \"VAAALHAALL AWAITS MEE.... WHEN I DIIIIIEEEE\". So in case you can't tell, the vocals are the highlight of this album. That's not to say there aren't great solos or melodies or that the drums aren't solid, they just don't stand out over Hegg's best performance to date.\n\nThe album opens with the aforementioned Valhall Awaits One, and it is one hell of an opener. It doesn't play around with a pretty intro, it just starts and kills you from the beginning. Lyrically, this is essentially just a five minute long, graphic description of somebody getting an axe driven through his forehead, but that is pretty much the manliest of all subjects one can possibly write a song about. It features a nice melodic solo, with plenty of memorable and equally melodic... well, melodies throughout. This also reminds you one of the reasons many people got into Amon Amarth in the first place, the riffs. These guys are masterful riff writers, and even when they were in their musical slump, the riffs were always heavy and memorable.\n\nRunes to my Memory, Gods of War Arise, Hermod's Ride to Hel Lokes Treachery part. I, and Under the Northern Star are all mid paced, but they are just as furious as the sheer speed in the title track or Cry of the Black Birds or the even more extreme speed of Asator. Asator ranks as my favorite song, not only on the album, but in Amon Amarth's entire discography. That's right, in front of fan favorites such as Death in Fire, Victorious March, or Releasing Surtur's Fire, Asator is the one song that just rips face from beginning to end with no apologies. It is ironically also the shortest song they have ever written, so maybe that means their songs tend to drag on usually?\n\nIn a way, yes. I hate to say it, but Gods of War Arise and Prediction of Warfare really go on for far too long. That is one of the only complaints on the album though. For the most part, the songs are catchy, the riffs are amazing, the melodies are memorable, the song structures vary and remain interesting. I've always been amazed by the sound they manage to get out of their guitars. The riffs are all really, REALLY thundering and crunchy. They pretty much cover and aspect of \"heavy\" that Black Sabbath might have forgotten to define. Most of them gallop, but they are almost always just..... great. It's hard to explain. Watch the video for Cry of the Black Birds if you don't understand what I'm saying.\n\nSo in the end, another A-. The last two songs bring the record down a bit, as does Gods of War Arise, but the sheer masculinity and godliness of Asator and Cry of the Blackbirds will more than make up for any shortcomings that you can find elsewhere. A definite recommendation for all death metal fans and anybody who loves viking metal (this isn't your typical folky viking band though, these guys are pure, balls to the wall, heavy fucking metal through and through).\n",
        "\nAmon Amarth is one of the most successful death metal bands in the industry. They have dominated metal-heads all over the globe with their Viking prowess without changing their image or sound like many bands do these days. Being their latest album \u2018With Odin On Our Side\u2019, is as good as it\u2019s going to get, In my opinion it is their best album after \u2018Versus The World\u2019.\n\n\nNow let\u2019s talk about Johan Hegg. In the previous albums\u2019 his vocals were quite good, harsh yet understandable with a little growl here and there. For some reason it was always overwhelmed by the guitar and drums, the vocals never got the attention that they deserved. You really had focus if you wanted to hear them properly, and sure they were there but were they noticed? All that has changed in \u2018With Odin on Our Side\u2019! The vocals overpower everything, and it sounds great! As for the lyrics, they too are kick ass, I mean come on! \u201cTHE FIRST BLOW MAKES THE HELMET CRACK! THE AXE CUT TO THE TEETH!\u201d. The one thing I love about the lyrics is that there is always a story, something that could be turned into a movie, something that authors could write a novel about, it truly is awe-inspiring.\n\n\nNow to the important bit, the actual music (not saying vocals aren\u2019t important, they are! but it\u2019s the music that counts). Most of the guitar work in the earlier albums starts of good and ends good, but for some strange reason there was always that void in the middle of most songs were the guitar would fall into some melody that wasn\u2019t heavy enough and lacked that punch, not saying it wasn\u2019t good but it had yet to be perfected: this void of strange melodies ruined the image of the songs, it\u2019s hard to explain but music says a thousand words. However in this album this is quite different, none of the tracks on \u2018With Odin on Our Side\u2019 fall into this once regular trap, all the melodies and riffs keep on pummeling away at your head till you cream yourself, the Bass is also a little more audible unlike the previous works. \n\nSolos are a must. By far the greatest solo on this album is the \u2018Asator\u2019 one, just under 25 seconds with quick finger work and a memorable tune, this masterpiece is a sure way to find yourself pulling out your air guitar and shredding along. And oh yes don\u2019t think that just because there is one amazing solo that there aren\u2019t going to be anymore, because my friend, this whole album has some of the most graceful solo\u2019s I\u2019ve heard in a long time, some that skillfully draw out out like one in \u2018Valhall Awaits Me\u2019 and some that just come in and dash off yet still bring the fire i.e. the \u2018Asator\u2019 solo. The guitar work is incredible on this album.\n\n\nThe Drums are in a whole different league of their own. Most of the songs are fast paced yet hold the symmetry line, so that it doesn\u2019t sound like Fred (A.A\u2019s drummer) is just swinging around aimlessly hitting the nearest piece and actually sounds like some sort of effort went into it, a lot of effort! The drum beats are flawlessly set out so that they don\u2019t bore you but instead regularly adjust to fit with the guitar work to bring about a sense of change to the atmosphere of the song. (A lot of death metal bands seem to keep a monotone of a drum beat in their songs; this on certain occasions really starts to bore me and doesn\u2019t really bring a feel to the song like A.A does). \n\nIn conclusion \u2018With Odin on Our Side\u2019 really brings the heat to the table, but the one thing that Amon Amarth really do best is bring an awesome atmosphere with their music in this album, like seriously if this album doesn\u2019t make you wanna pick up an axe and start hacking at your little brother, then I don\u2019t know what will. All up a 5 star album than everyone should listen to. \\m/\n",
        "\nYep, this is one of those albums that never leaves your CD player, you know all the words to all the songs, sings about Vikings, has the most badass front man in the world, and becomes an instant classic. This is also the perfect example of a masterpiece album late in a band's career, which is possibly the best they've ever recorded. Amon Amarth have been one of the longest, most respected and repeatedly successful death metal bands out there and with this 2006 full length release, With Oden On Our Side, they have proved all the naysayers of the Fate of Norns album wrong, all the naysayers that said it's impossible to release another good album for them, and proved that the Vikings still got it.\n\nEverything about Amon Amarth's career; the musicians, the songwriting and previous records all culminate to this record. This is the hard work of roughly a decade into this album. Of course Amon Amarth is far from calling it quits, but I think that they wanted to pull all the stops and make this the best damn Viking themed death metal album out there, and they did. With Oden On Our Side is by far one of the greatest accomplishments they've ever achieved, making an album full of so many classic songs, great musicianship and everything put together - all done with great enthusiasm and vigor. \n\nBeautifully bearded band leader Johan Hegg forces his way to victory singing about battle, dying and Norse mythology with the power of 10 men. He has such force in his voice that it is possibly the highlight of the album, his growling is top notch and probably the best he's ever done, he's on top of the game making a memorable performance with such classic parts in songs like Runes to My Memory where his growls are so melodic and emotional it hits home, or like in Astator where you almost feel his rage and fury. I think this is the most accessible his vocals have ever been on an Amon Amarth album. The guitars are the perfect blend of melody and still keeping the semi-raw and brutal feel of death metal and allowing for such great riffs (Runes to My Memory, Valhall Awaits Me, Gods of War Arise) and solos (Astator). Also on Runes to My Memory it contains possibly one the greatest most melodic yet pounding riffs I've ever heard. Olavi Mikkonen and Johan Soderberg know what they are doing and easily represent the death metal scene with the short but fast as hell solo in Astator and the riffing that will break you neck. \n\nTed Lundstrom on bass does a great job on this record, easily complimenting the guitars well with many moments of notoriety. Frederik Andersson behind the kit is the perfect man for Amon Amarth with much double bass godliness and showing such variety that many others don't rely on. Straight from the get go on the opener Valhall Awaits Me he makes a straight shot for death metal blasting away. He really shines on the fast and furious songs like Astator and shows much his style perfectly on Gods of War Arise and Cry of the Black Birds where it varies from fast to mid-tempo.\n\nThe individual songs on here are simply spectacular. From the opener to the closer there is not a single filler, single bad song, or single non-headbanger. I find myself constantly coming back and listening to this album all the time, not just one individual song but the entire song all the way through because every song is amazing here. Several here are instantly turned to concert staples to be played at every Amon Amarth show for eternity, such as Valhall Awaits Me, Runes to My Memory, Hermod's Ride to Hel, Astator, and Cry of the Blackbirds. I swear every time I listen to this album I have all the words to all the songs flying through my head at once they are all so catchy and all can be sung along with making this one of the catchiest albums I've ever heard.\n\nWith Oden On Our Side is a testament to Amon Amarth's ability to create good music, I still have yet to be disappointed by the Vikings. Quality music by quality musicians, this is the perfect blend of all that is great in death metal with great melody and easily accessible growled vocals. Whether headbanging until your neck snaps or singing along until your throat is bleeding, this is one of the greatest albums you'll find in melodic death metal, maybe in all of metal.\n",
        "\nIn my opinion this is the best release of 2006, and that is saying a lot. But this no-filler-disc of war, blood, and pagan worship blows everything else out of the water. Amon Amarth are a rare example of a band who has improved with time. Actually the only other obvious band that comes to mind is Behemoth. And the Norseman do not disappoint with their latest offering to hungry fans, With Oden On Our Side.\n\nMusic-wise With Oden On Our Side doesn\u2019t sound unlike their last several releases. It is perhaps a bit heavier than Fate of the Norns and still carries the warlike feel of Verses the World. The opening track, Valhall Awaits Me, will mesmerise the listener and drop them straight in the middle of a Viking pillage. One thing you might notice immediately is the masterful vocals by Johan Hegg. There isn\u2019t much to add to that other than he really shines on this album and is one of the best front men of modern metal. If you aren\u2019t convinced just look at that beard! The album carries out a theme with most of the lyrics consisting of battles and death. Gods Of War Arise will, no doubt, have you singing along with the immortal lines: \u201cSome seek shelter in the church/A refuge for those with faith/But we know how to smoke them out/A pyre will be raised.\u201d The album slows down a bit when we hear some melodic guitars and get a Norse mythology lesson with the notable track Hermod's Ride to Hel - Lokes Treachery, Part 1.\n\nMusically this album is very true to what Amon Amarth have become known for and I can only hope they continue down this path and continue making music for their Viking ancestors. The drums are fast and pummelling and the duel guitars are nothing short of captivating. The crisp production on this album is a vast improvement from Once Sent From The Golden Halls. There really is something for everybody on this album, from the heavy as hell Asator, to the beautifully melodic Hermod's Ride to Hel and Cry of the Blackbirds, to the epic ballad Under the Northern Star. \n\nI would strongly recommend With Oden On Our Side to any fans of melodic death metal, death metal, Viking metal, or anyone who has an interest in Norse mythology. So grab a pint of mead and give Amon Amarth the attention they deserve!\n",
        "\nThe only word to describe this album is EPIC. This is what we have since come to expect from Vikings Amon Amarth, though this stunning debut is still hailed by many (including me) as their best. \n\nProduction wise, it sounds exactly how it should - magnificent melodies on the guitars, thundering drums and of course the ripping, triumphant, screaming vocals. Most of the music on the album is based around the same sort of rhythm, to which I can easily imagine Nordic longboats battling across dark stormy seas. It is therefore the less frequent grooving war-march sections, the odd melancholy solo and the well-placed samples (such as tolling bells and swordfights) that really add spice to the album, making it nothing less than a wild ride!\n\nSomething of the pounding repetitive sections such as a few of the middle tracks really get your head banging, and some of the faster earlier tracks are brilliant - all without being over the top. I would usually expect from Viking metal some sort of pomp, but it is not so with this album - there is something very honest and basic about it that I really appreciate. I can also envisage this album never growing old in the metal world - I believe that there will always be a place for this album in the metal (golden) hall of fame. It has a certain ageless quality about it, something that can be accepted by the majority of Metallers, something which can be played between bands at a gig and no one will complain about. \n\nI recommend this album to anyone that is a fan of melodic music, there is something that is easily appreciative about the brilliant writing in these eight epic songs. The best Amon Amarth album in my opinion, and definitely the best starting point for newbies.\n",
        "\nPicture long glassy meadows filled to the brim with gigantic blonde-hair blue-eyed men with horned helmets and gigantic axes and swords torching down houses, stealing people\u2019s shit and generally kicking ass all over the place. How fucking awesome would it be to be one of those guys? Anyways, for those of us not of Nordic heritage, we still give tribute to this classic \u201cviking metal\u201d opus; Two discs (for those of us with the limited edition releases) of pure ass-kicking catchy head-banging brain-damaging brutality. What\u2019s not to like? \n\nOh, wait...\n\nI\u2019ll start by saying that the mixture of melodic kinda-folky-but-still-ballsy marching riffs and tremolo picking palm muting assaults are a great death metal combo. The rhythm and the tempo aren\u2019t on the high-end in comparison with many other death metal acts, but the drumming makes up well for it with the right usage of double-bass beats and almost tribal tom fills. The bass-work is simple but still good. Vocals are at their best grunting-quality. \n\nNow for the bad part: The lack of variety and the lack of awesome guitar solos. I love the chunky axe attacks, but they could have made a much better effort at throwing some of those in there. While this album may be filled to the brim with catchy riffs, one quickly loses the enthusiasm garnered by the first track as they seem to just make a piss-poor effort at throwing anything new or nearly as interesting at you around half-way into the album. \n\nRegardless, they get brownie points for putting on amazing live shows.\n",
        "\nFrom all the previous years of solid, albeit redundant, melodic death these guys have put out since they shattered the nine worlds, no one can debate the layer of intricate musicianship the group has stepped up. One thing to notice is the production, and by that I mean hear every instrument. With Fate Of Norns you had mediocre songs full of inconsistency which led to a less appealing sound all over. However, WOOOS achieves stand-out tracks with memorable tunes that are individually backed up with a prestigious presentation.\n\nPopular tracks are usually not the best tracks on most albums and here is no exception. Do not take it the wrong way though. \u201cRunes To My Memory\u201d and \u201cCry Of The Black Birds,\u201d the two hits on this album that garnish music videos, both incorporate and improve all of the previous tactics \u2013 traditional Norse riffs, lyrics of old, and a persuasive attitude \u2013 to outperform any previous hits these Swedes have unleashed on us. This only gets better though, as Amon Amarth conceived original plans in creating more catchy (though not sold-out) and laid back tunes like \u201cUnder The Northern Star\u201d and the mid-paced \u201cGods Of War Arise,\u201d which shares it\u2019s closest qualities with \u201cDeath In Fire\u201d off of Versus The World (though it still retains its own addicting sound).\n\nNo doubt Amon Amarth was aiming at a more riff-mesmerizing album, hence the accessibility in all the songs. Like I brought up earlier, the production allows the album to have a greater impact on the individual. All the instruments can clearly be heard without any serious distortion from the guitars \u2013 riffs or solos -, the drums \u2013 still in some cases tribal sounding - , and the bass \u2013 the sole reason why this album has a hotter, heavier, and tighter feeling that the others. You sure played hooky in school to play bass, Ted. A huge improvement lies in Johan\u2019s vocal leadership, as his voice delves deeper to a signature growl (one that was lost on Fate Of Norns). Of all the Melodic Death bands, Johan is really the only one retaining the traditional growl to an extent with success. By in large, he isn\u2019t embarrassed to sound like a beast on here.\n\nLyrically, Amon continues to cite strict influences to Scandinavia\u2019s past. Pillaging, religion, and nature are the norm once again. One usually doesn\u2019t get tired after such a repeated approach because the music each one is armed with becomes a new adventure or mission to the ears. Such a lyrical bounty is worth your time, as each one is a story to tell. Put down any book you\u2019re reading and listen to a tale Amon tell. \u201cGods Of War Arise\u201d and the title track, although already musically superior to the others, are my recommended listen.\n\nRegardless of preference, all listeners of melodic death metal will find something enjoyable on this release. All the tactics Amon have implemented are found on here and are refined so well that many have concluded the integrity the album holds. Under any circumstance, come in contact with this record to see Amon\u2019s refined style and you\u2019re sure to have Odin on your side soon enough.\n",
        "\nI am generally not a huge fan of the melodic death metal style because of its close connection to the Gothenburg scene, which emphasizes a combination of over-simplified melodic ideas repeated way too much and an extremely flat sounding vocal approach, devoid of any change in character or general flexibility. I have taken a liking to Amon Amarth because they don\u2019t suffer from these common trappings, and balance out simple melodies with the much needed changes to keep a song clocking in at over 4 minutes interesting.\n\nOf the songs on here two ended up appearing on the \u201cSorrow through the Nine Worlds\u201d EP, while the remaining track was kept for the debut LP \u201cOnce Sent from the Golden Hall\u201d. Aside from the production quality and a slight extension in the length of \u201cBurning Creation\u201d, the former songs are mostly unchanged and performed well. By contrast, \u201cWithout Fear\u201d is a good deal faster than the other two, features a somewhat less varied structure, and ultimately of a more triumphant character than the others. It is fitting that this song was not placed with the EP tracks, as the very titles of the two respective releases present two very different outlooks by this band, which is otherwise much more specialized than others in their genre in this regard.\n\nThis is a good demo to have if you are a core-fan of the band and wish to possess all of the versions of their recorded material. I obtained it along with the other 2 pre-Golden Hall releases on the Special Edition \u201cVersus the World\u201d release, which is the ideal way to get them and save money, not to mention the hassle of trying to find someone in possession of the original that is actually willing to part with it. This is an alternative take on the melodic death style that coincided with the Gothenburg scene, and one that I personally prefer, my own status as a power/prog fan non-withstanding.\n",
        "\nI have yet to hear the original master version of this EP, but from what I hear on the re-master provided on the \u201cVersus the World\u201d special edition bonus CD, Amon Amarth was a good deal ahead of their time. Although the music contained within possesses most of the repetitive ideas common to the melodic death style, as opposed to the thrash inspired technical acts of a few years before, it listens very much like a technical release in its structural complexity. The general flow of the album is quite fast, despite the mellow sense of woeful glory that the riffs and atmosphere illustrate, and listens quite differently from much of their studio works from start to finish.\n\nJohan Hegg\u2019s vocals are well realized, avoiding the flat and redundant monotone sound that has plagued some singers in the genre such as In Flames. He switches between a shrill shriek and a ballistic grunt quite well, giving the impression of a dialogue between an army of berserkers and a skilled commander reminding them of their purpose on the battle field. The music around him mostly submits to his superior presence, providing a background melody and accompaniment to his toneless words of Nordic myths and epic battles.\n\nThe songs listen well, each having a somewhat similar character, as tends to be the case with all of their studio releases. \u201cBurning Creation\u201d takes the lead in the guitar department, showcasing a wide range of varying sections, each dominated by a crushingly catchy yet repetitive pair of contrapuntal riffs. The leads on here are gloomy yet regal, impressing the ears with a dual sense of simplicity and skill. \u201cThe Arrival of the Fimbul Winter\u201d is the most simple in harmonic structure, yet contains a wide range of changes in tempo and atmosphere. \u201cThe Mighty Doors of the Spear God\u2019s Hall\u201d has as its principle riff probably the most memorable guitar line I\u2019ve heard in the melodic death sub-genre, this alone makes picking up this EP essential as it is not found on any of the LPs that followed.\n\nConsistent from start to finish, Amon Amarth\u2019s \u201cSorrow through the Nine Worlds\u201d is a must have for any fan of the band who has yet to hear it. Although I have yet to attain much of their earlier work between this release and \u201cVersus the World\u201d, thus far it is the best thing I\u2019ve heard out of them. If you can find the special edition of the \u2018Versus the World\u201d album, you\u2019ll save a good deal of money and get what is likely the best version of these songs. The dragon boats are upon the horizon, and the crater of Mount Doom is at the verge of another grand eruption.\n",
        "\nThis is Amon Amarth's first DVD, and it is the best metal DVD I have seen. Wrath of the Norseman features over seven hours of footage, and most of it is concert material.\n\nThe first disc is the largest gem here. The concert in Cologne is incredible, with nearly two hours of amazing music. They play a total of twenty-three songs all together, and not one of them is poorly played. Lots of pyro, which fits the band perfectly, especially in \" Releasing Surtr's Fire\", where pyro is used prominently. The lighting is brilliant, as well, complementing the music and the overall mood of each song. At one point an army of Norseman enters the stage and have a destructive battle. While this may seem cheesy to you, watch it. You will be impressed. The battle helps the show quite a bit, and fits with the concert.\n\nThere are tons of camera angles used during the show, focusing on the band mostly, and they don't focus on one member. They actually do a good job of getting each member camera time. The mix also sounds great, and if you have a good sound system, crank it up. Then it sounds just like you were seeing the band live and in person. The thing that surprised me the most was the great quality of both the music and the taping. The video is on par with a High-Quality production, and is done beautifully.\n\nAlso on disc one is the documentary The Vikings are Coming, which gives you a look at the band preparing for the Cologne show. It is quite entertaining, and lets you see into Amon Amarth off stage. A definite plus for the DVD.\n\nDisc two is two concerts: The Summer Blade and the Breeze festival. Blade shows the band at in a more raw light. I don't like it as much as the Cologne show, but it is still a solid performance. The sound mix is quite different from the Cologne show, and again, you'll have to listen for yourself to decide if you like it.\n\nThe Breeze is another high-quality performance. They play in front of a large crowd, and feed off them for the whole show. They play almost all-newer material, and this is pretty cool. The lighting is great, and they play most off the sings to perfection.\n\nDisc three has one good show: The Wacken open air. It is like the Summer Breeze, but larger, but they have more camera angles. Another don't miss performance.\n\nThis would be 100% if not for the\u201d Fate of Norns\" release show. They play at an undersized venue, and they don't seem to be as into it as other shows. They have more fuck -ups, and the crowd doesn't seem to be to interested.\n\nThe overall DVD is great, and you can always skip the release show. Probably will be the best Metal DVD for years to come. If you like Amon Amarth at all, get this. If you like metal at all, get this.\n",
        "\nAfter having to listen to Fate of Norns, it's safe to say that some of us grew skeptical about where Amon Amarth were headed. Had they finally lost steam, or were they just trying something new? Fate of Norns was certainly a more introspective and darker album on the band's half. Some fans however, myself included, saw the album as lazy, unmotivated, and uninteresting aside from 2 or 3 songs. So the question remained of whether the band would get back on track with writing barn-burning Viking anthems with the new album. This is a fucking comeback.\n\nThe first thing that launches this album into such a high status is the production job. It's not as shiny and glittery as Versus the World, but it's certainly better than the dirgy, hampered, demo-like qualities of Fate of Norns. Instead of either of those, the band have found an organic balance between the vastness and the more up-front sound used on the mentioned albums. The guitars certainly sound better: clearer, thicker, and heavier. Anders' drum sound also got a makeover, and sound more akin to The Crusher, but without the weird gating effects on the toms. The bass drum isn't as sterile this time either, and has more low-frequency punch to it.\n\nAnd just when you thought the band no longer improve on their formula, they did. With Oden on Our Side showcases the band's more melodic tendencies without sacrificing balls or adrenaline. \"Asator\" is a living testament to this; powered by rolling double bass drums and savagely low guitars, this song single-handedly beats out the ferocity of \"Releasing Surtur's Fire\" or \"Bloodshed.\" The chorus in the song is both catchy and merciless, with its highly melodic guitar runs. More mid-paced tunes like \"Cry of the Black Birds\" and \"Runes to My Memory\" highlight the apex of the band's epic sense while remaining highly accessible, as both of these songs have gone on to be singles. And of course, everything comes full force with the slower, epic tracks. \"Gods of War Arise\" and the title track are both huge in their scope, and the closer \"Prediction of Warfare\" balances a sense of urgency with chugging verses and elaborate guitar harmonies. Fate of Norns saw the exploration of more introspective Viking themes, and With Oden on Our Side shows the maturity of it, clearly shown on \"Under the Northern Star\" and \"Hermods Ride to Hel.\"\n\nAs a vocalist and lyricist, Johan continuously progresses. There are still strong ties to Norse myth, but this album sees the return of the brutal, bloody, gore-soaked pillages seen in the band's early career, such as on the opening cut, \"Valhall Awaits One.\" The second verse features lines like, \"I rip the axe from the head, covered in blood and brains/Leave the body dead/Ready to strike again.\" And it doesn't stop there. Other songs graphically describe the chaos that the Vikings brought upon their unfortunate enemies, including throwing them into slavery and burning their churches down while people are still inside. It all works perfectly in the head-swinging, violent, emotional, and ultimately epic context of the music.\n\nOverall, With Oden on Our Side is without question the band's best since Versus the World. Sure, there's only been one album between the former and this one, but on its own merits, With Oden on Our Side breathes new life into Amon Amarth's consistent sound.\n\nWhat fools we were to defy this band; well, at least what a fool I was. Pick up this album; a strong comeback, and one of the best of 2006.\n",
        "\nWe've all heard those bands that while not anything particularly awful or ear-grating, just don't seem to have anything in particular going for them that would be enough to lift them above the rest of the bands in the ever-growing mass of undistinguishable bands that make up the bulk of metal and music in general. Usually their media is limited to their personal myspace pages and the like or at the very best a record deal with a minor label, releasing albums noone will ever hail as, well, anything really, and then eventually fading out and being forgotton by everyone. Not all face the same fate though, some of these bands, despite their obvious shortcomings, will garner a following, often through a gimmick or quite a lot of promotion by their label, and continue to live on even after passing the haydays of their careers. While most of them are never that huge, some manage to weasel their way to the very top of the metal world. This is a very unfortunate event for people with taste everywhere, as once a band reaches that status, they will continue to gain fans on fame alone (case in point being Metallica). Amon Amarth is one of these bands.\n\nI first checked out Amon Amarth years ago because of the good things I kept hearing about them. Some people called it viking metal, some death metal and some melodic death metal. I thought, hey, I like all of those genres, how could I go wrong? I figured Versus The World would be a point good as any to start with as the cover art is fucking cool and since it was their newest release at the time.\n\nThe first track, Death In Fire, is actually pretty good. It's fun and catchy, definitely melodic death, yet not at all too clean and polished like most melodeath tends to be. Everything about this song is very powerful, the drums play a nice and catchy rhythm I did not expect to hear from a band of this sort. The main riff, which takes up the most attention in this song as there are only about 2 others and they're rather forgettable, could nearly be classified as epic (but not quite). The vocals are unapologetically testosterone driven and ballsy, and while they aren't the most original gruff voice in town they fit the music here. Ok, the middle part kind of sucks but the lead is good and not totally useless, and even if it doesn't display much technical skill it doesn't matter because who's expecting any from a melodeath band anyway? At this point I could definitely see myself screaming \u201dDeath in fire!\u201d in a drunken haze in a sweaty crowd of equally drunk metal enthusiasts at one of the many summer festivals around here where the emphasis is more on the beer than the music, taking a break from the drinking marathon that has at this point probably lasted several days already. \u201dLooking good so far\u201d, I thought to myself. \u201dPerhaps a little overbearing, but I'm sure that'll change once the album continues\u201d.\n\nAlas, no it did not change, and therein lies the problem. The problem is that nothing else changes either. This is all that the album has to offer. For The Stabwounds In Our Backs still presents some things of interest, though not nearly as much as Death In Fire, but once it's over the band has exhausted it's well of ideas. The very next track Where Silent Gods Stand Guard is really insufferable garbage, featuring such great ideas as a nearly whispered growl. With this guys voice, what the hell were they thinking? I wanted variation, sure, but this is just awful. All the band can do from here is descend further into a form of self-parody, trying to mimic what it already achieved with the first track. Do they manage to do it though? Nope, no riff from this point on comes off as particularly headbangable and no guitar solo stays interesting enough to warrant its existance. Even the drums that I dug back in Death In Fire start to get really annoying and monotonous, especially in Bloodshed where there is literally nothing else going on to listen to. The vocals are clearly the worst though. There's just so much I can take of that same, I dare say melodramatic, tone all the time. It got to the point that I developed a minor headache and found myself scowling for no reason at all. How they managed to make everything else but the very first track of the album sound so ungodlily dispirited is really abysmal to me.\n\nI think a big reason for the bands success is their accessibility. Most of the songs follow such a basic formula it's ridiculous. I'm not saying the poppy ABACB thing isn't followed by a lot of bands or that it's necessarily a bad thing but can't we have a little variation already? Honestly though, I can't remember if ALL the songs did follow that pattern, and I'm sure as hell not checking anymore because I'd be risking taking my life due to purgatory-level boredom. There is way too much filler in these songs, even when they're only about 5 minutes average. Just a lot of noise that hardly even qualifies as riffing is being made by the guitarists while the singer does his usual growl and that's it, everything here is seriously lacking in ideas. Even the \u201dviking\u201d melodies manage to incite little to no interest, they're thoroughly unmemorable. The song Thousand Years Of Opression makes a little effort in this department, though when the buildup is followed by a whole lot of nonsense vocals and then some more generic noise making it ruins the whole thing. And holy hell this band manages to be loud. I find it increasingly difficult to concentrate on the music because nothing at all is happening, just the luke-warm tidings of Mt. Dull. Versus the World still makes a decent ruckus but it fails to save the album as it has trouble carrying its own weight. Did they really think that they'd pull off having this little substance in the songs?\n\nI guess it could be said that they indeed did pull it off, seeing as how Amon Amarth is already a big name in the scene and growing still. This band may very well be the archetype of the kind of band that manages to carve themselves a niche and a market and decides to play it as safe as humanly possible. Judging by the material that I've heard from them they have not changed a thing during the total of their careers and this makes it even harder for me to understand the appeal of this band, I just cannot fathom why anyone would result to listening to this? Fine, not all of the music is that bad but there is no point in settling for the second-tier when there are a whole bunch of bands that are vastly better than Amon Amarth could ever hope to be out there, though most of them don't have the sellable pseudo-viking image these guys have to enable easy and obviously succesful marketing strategies. In music there is no need to compromise, you can afford to be picky in your listening habits. Which is exactly what I'm going to do by forgetting this album ever existed. I'll be more than fine with just Death In Fire.\n",
        "\nWhile 2001's The Crusher saw Amon Amarth charting slightly more brutal material, it hardly served as a turning point for the band. Though it was certainly another strong chapter in the band's discography, it didn't really bring anything new to the table or evolve on any ideas put on the table. Versus the World, however, sees a band who has long tread safe waters coming into their own niche and maturing into the band they are today. While definitely not anything experimental or \"progressive,\" this album shows the band's sound at its absolute peak on all levels.\n\nWhereas most bands rely on only one or two things to drive the overall sound forward, Amon Amarth come together as a full, cohesive unit to make a full listening experience. Every instrument relies on every other instrument; the drums rely on the guitars, and vice versa. Even moreso, the music seems centered around Johan's voals, which have reached a blooming point here. The clarity in his voice is astonishing, and he maintains a rough, gritty growl throughout the disc's duration that is wisely balanced with more mid-pitched raspy screams. A perfect example of this would be the album's title track, which finds the perfect equilibrium between more soaring, melodic passages and the first-pumping brutality that AA is known for. The band found a true balance here; most former albums by this band clearly segregated the fast from the slow, but that mold is clearly broken with \"Where Silent Gods Stand Guard,\" or \"Thousand Years of Oppression,\" which is just as hammering as it is beautiful. The slower moments seem to have been nurtured for longer here, which helps to take away the dullness of songs like \"Fall Through Ginnungagap.\" Musicality also seems to be a bigger focus here. While some of the older songs concentrated solely on melting your face off, there's some method to the madness here. Nothing ever becomes too overwhelming, which ensures that the album can be listened to the whole way through without the listener tiring. Overall, it seems like the band became better musicians and songwriters. That's really the only way I could describe it, anyway.\n\nOlavi and Johan's riffs are just one part of what makes this album brilliant. Not only have they learned new ways of songcraft, but they have also taken all of the old elements of their playing and improved upon them. Most noticeable to this is the barn-burner \"For the Stabwounds in Our Backs.\" It starts out slowly, giving the illusion that it could easily be another rendition of say, \"North Sea Storm\" or \"Annihilation of Hammerfest.\" But suddenly, a cascading drum fill leads into a mile-a-minute passage of lightning-paced double bass and impressive alternate picking. The song later descends into more melodic territory without sacrificing one bit of the wall of sound that established the beginning of the song. All of the evolutions in the guitars are what set this apart from the other albums, and is what makes this such a modern classic. Melodic runs are backed by drop-tune notes played in a flurry of tremolo picking; this creates a true sense of atmosphere, and gives the songs a huge boost in emotional and listenability factors. The soul-stirring climax of \"Thousand Years of Oppression\" is a clear example of this, as is the epic closing track.\n\nAnders receives a huge boost on this album. His drum sound is nothing short of stellar; the bass drum maintains enough low end to bludgeon without mercy on \"Down the Slopes of Death,\" while maintaining a tamed nature important for slower, more powerful moments where double bass isn't needed. The toms pound and boom like tribal war drums, as seen on the fist-pumping opening of the classic \"Death in Fire.\" The snare has also come a lot more out front in the mix, and maintains a sharp attack without sounding tinny or thin. There seems to be greater flair in style this time around, and some stabs at technicality without overstepping boundaries. The album's title track stands as one of his best performances as a drummer: he maintains incredible stamina on the double bass while playing independent patterns with his hands and keeping things fresh with plenty of fills and rolls.\n\nJohan as a vocalist hits his ultimate apex here, and I think many will agree. Not only has his degree of projection and power improved, as you can understand almost everything that leaves his mouth; but so has his voice. It's stronger and is well-rounded in vocal patterns than previous albums, and the lyrics help things out as well. The Crusher saw some of Johan's best lyrics to date, and Versus the World shows the man coming full circle. Balance is found between the call-to-arms anthems, (\"Death in Fire\") tales of bloodlust and revenge, (\"Thousand Years of Oppression,\" \"For the Stabwounds in Our Backs\") and the introspective side, which details Norse mythology. (\"...and Soon the World Will Cease to Be.\") It compliments the music perfectly, and is definitely another high point.\n\nProduction-wise, AA have never been better. The dense sound of The Crusher was a bit too beefy, and The Avenger seemed too thin: Versus the World is the solution. Ted's bass is perfectly audible and comes to the front of the mix without overwhelming the guitars, and it clearly holds a considerable amount of overdrive to add some grit to the sound. Anders' drums drive the structures forward as the guitars chug, and Johan's vocals are the icing on the cake. This is a very high standard of production for a metal band, which probably explains why Fate of Norns got slammed so bad for its production techniques.\n\nThis is the ultimate Amon Amarth record, and will probably get you hooked on the band. Everything guarantees to be a consistent, entertaining, fist-pumping and intense listening session. Prepare yourself. The Vikings are coming.\n",
        "\nHoly shit, this DVD is a monster. Offering over 7 hours worth of material and performances, AA's first DVD may very well be one of the best damn metal DVD's ever put out.\n\nDisc 1 is the undisputed centerpiece of the release. The show is the full performance at the Live Music Hall in Cologne, Germany, and the set list almost 2 hours long. Yes, 2 fucking hours of non-stop, adrenaline-rushing, fist-pumping metal. (22 songs in all, I think.) AA play both old classics and newer material, and split up the set list wisely. Songs from The Crusher and The Avenger sound especially great here; both of those releases had some slight problems in the production department, but live, the songs have a new sheen and sense of power to them. This is especially prevalent in \"Annihilation of Hammerfest\" and \"North Sea Storm\", but also works for faster songs like \"Bastards of a Lying Breed.\" Aside from the music, this show is very special. Pyro is used a lot here, and works perfectly in the band's musical scope. (Especially on \"Releasing Surtur's Fire,\" when the whole stage turns red.) The light show also helps out, as it compliments the music on many levels. And of course, I couldn't go without mentioning the interludes. As some ochestral interludes play at certain points in the set list, troupes of men dressed in Viking armor enter the stage and emulate battles. I know it seems cheesy and overdone, but it works amazingly. This is taken to another level when, right before \"Where Silent Gods Stand Guard,\" two grim-faced men men with torches in hand enter and light pyres in front of Anders' drum kit, and stand without moving a muscle whilst the band rip through the song. This is quite possibly one of the most entertaining shows I've watched in a while, and it will definitely bring out the Norseman in you.\n\nOf course, the show wouldn't be as good if the band itself didn't play well. Fortunately for us, the band pass that test with flying colors. There is a consistency and tightness present that isn't seen in many bands. AA actually sound like a unit playing live, rather than a group of musicians focusing on their seperate parts. This brings out the best in the music, and only helps to serve as a catalyst for the overall show. Johan sounds fierce and fiery here, especially on \"Ride For Vengeance\" and \"Releasing Surtur's Fire.\" I don't know exactly how they pull it off, but the band maintain high energy throughout the show, and so does the ravenous crowd. Both of the guitarists play incredibly here, and the leads, harmonies, and solos are spot-on. Johan shows his skill as a frontman and involves the crowd with the songs on many levels.\n\nOne thing that really helps this show is the video and sound mix; there are tons of camera angles to capture the band up-close, and some attention is given to the fans as well. Not only this, but the video quality is fucking incredible, almost on the level of a high-budget movie. I know that sounds exaggerated, but take one look and you won't disagree. The sound mix is punchy and clear, and doesn't sacrifice one bit of the band's sound. It almost makes me wish that a CD version of this show would have been released...\n\nAlso featured on Disc 1 is a 60-minute documentary, which gives fans a glimpse into preparations for the massive Cologne showm as well as what life on the road is like for the band. Some interviews are given with the band members, and even some of the band's road crew.\n\nDisc 2 features two performances: one Metal Blade anniversary festival, and the Summer Breeze festival. The Metal Blade festival shows the band on a more stripped-down and raw level, which can be good or bad depending on who you are. Here, the band play quite a different set list. Some of the newer songs are present, although \"Valkyries Ride\" seemed an odd choice for a new one to slap on the set list. The majority of the set, however, consists of older material. Really old material, including songs from the band's demo era. Even stranger is the band's choice to cover Six Feet Under's \"Revenge of the Zombie,\" which comes off surprisingly well. The sound mix here is significantly more raw than the Cologne show, but helps to bring out the more primal nature of the show. Obviously, with a smaller venue, there aren't as many camera angles either. Overall though, it's not a bad show, but pales in comparison to to Cologne show.\n\nSummer Breeze is another great show. The band play to a massive crowd in the thousands, and the sound quality truly expresses the epic nature of the music. All of the songs consist of newer material, the only old songs being \"Releasing Surtur's Fire\" and \"Victorious March.\" This aspect seems to help things out in a big way. Things seem to drag a tiny bit with too much old material, but the band seem hgih and wired with a wealth of new material. It's seen clearly that the crowd is into it, and the band feed off the crowd for the duration of the show. There is some great lighting here, and the size of the stage gives the band more room to move around.\n\nDisc 3 really only has one good thing to it, which is the Wacken Open Air Festival. This one is much like Summer Breeze, but bigger. Also, the camera shots and sound mix resemble the Cologne show a lot more, which adds a nearly music video-like feel to the whole concert. Here, the band play to a humongous crowd at 2 A.M., and rip through a slightly shorter set list of old and new material. Many of the songs are of the more barn-burner type, but the band never seem to tire in the midst of the constant speedfest.\n\nUnfortunately, I had to take off some points for the \"Fate of Norns\" release show. Bad sound, less than stellar performance, (a few noticeable fuck-ups here and there) undersized venue, and a rather disinterested crowd.\n\nBut hey, if you can get past 1 bad show and sit through this whole thing in one session, you're a trooper. \"Wrath of the Norsemen\" is a great expression of the band, and stands as one the greatest metal shows I've ever watched. If you're even slightly interested in AA, pick this up.\n",
        "\nPlease Don't get me wrong, I thoroughly enjoyed this album. Between the riffs, the theme, and the quality, I would say that it's quite good, and definitely worth a listen by all measurable standards. And besides, who doesn't enjoy a good dosage of Viking Fucking Metal? Nobody.\n\nOne quarrel that I have with Fate of Norns is the fact that it is too bland. Too repetitive. Too dull. Whatever word you choose to use, the fact is this: Amon Amarth could have done a better job with this album. I know that they have it in them. With Oden on Our Side showed us what they are truly capable of as a band. I don't think they showed us enough of the Norse fire that burns within them, that passion that comes from the gods of old.\n\nI loved the first few tracks of this album. An Ancient Sign of Coming Storm and Fate of Norns are definitely highlight tracks. Hegg's vocals, although reminiscent of Odin and Thor, are rough and not done as well as possible. The guitar work is heavy, brutal, intense, and epic. The drumming, although slightly monotonous and simple, goes well with the guitars and the vocals. Despite it's faults, this album is definitely a good listen and worth checking out or buying.\n\nI haven't heard enough of older Amon Amarth to compare it to this album, but from what I've heard this album is a dissapointment to die-hard fans of Viking Metal. If it was any other band, this album would be amazing. The fact that it is Amon Amarth, a band capable of god-like musical accomplishments, makes this album an 85 in my book.\n",
        "\nMy story with this album began about 4 years ago in my local FYE CD store as I was perusing the metal section for something to complement my growing collection of power metal releases. When I cam across a rather brilliant art work depicting a lone Viking warrior poised to impale the planet Earth with the fire\u2019s of Mount Doom as the audience for this epic battle, I naturally expected to hear grand anthems of glory and triumph on my first listen, and I did. However, as someone who was not predisposed to liking death metal, I was a bit surprised to find myself liking every single thing I heard.\n\nAmon Amarth play a blend of melodic death metal that is quite unique, combining down tempo doom tracks and high speed thrash beats to complement the usual perpetual atmosphere of blast beats and down tuned guitars. In fact, the only thing that keeps this band firmly in the death sub-genre Johan Hegg\u2019s voice, which unlike most vocalists in this particular style I\u2019m familiar with, doesn\u2019t sound one dimensional. He has the typical tinge to his voice that most Scandinavian death vocalists have, but successfully shifts the tone of his grunts and shrieks to avoid redundancy, as well as providing some well placed spoken parts on one or two songs.\n\nThis band also does well to avoid the trap of overusing the blast beat, a pitfall that is common in this style. \u201cDeath in Fire\u201d and \u201cAnd soon the world will cease to be\u201d are perfect examples of spot on section transitioning, going back and forth between the constant thud of the double kick drum to a toned down quasi-doom metal beat. Likewise, the high tempo thrasher \u201cFor the stabwounds in our backs\u201d cooks like an early MegaDeth song, transitions quickly, and rivals Nocturnal Rites\u2019 heavy edged riffing style. \n\nAnother strong point on here is the thematic stuff going on in the guitars, which is where the melodic side of the death metal coin. Unlike the brutal death style, these songs can actually leave an impression on you after your finished listening. \u201cWhere silent gods stand guard\u201d, \u201cAcross the rainbow bridge\u201d and \u201cThousand years of oppression\u201d are the catchiest of the bunch, containing plenty of melodic hooks in the guitar parts, and at certain moments even the tone of Hegg\u2019s voice can be recalled, despite the lack of a melody to hum.\n\nTo fans of the melo-death style, particularly those of you lost children who follow the Gothenburg scene; this is the real deal, spoken from someone who generally doesn\u2019t go for music with harsh vocals. When you listen to this album, you get an album, not a collection of 9 or 10 tracks that either repeat themselves over and over or meander for 4 to 6 minutes each. And for those of you core Amon Amarth fans out there who haven\u2019t gotten this album yet and are searching for their earlier demos and the \u201cSorrow throughout the nine worlds\u201d EP, there are still a few of those special edition double CDs left out there, believe me when I say that it is well worth the additional cost.\n",
        "\nThe Crusher is yet another album by Amon Amarth that proves that metal bands don't necessarily need to undergo major stylistic changes in order to improve. Truth be told, this album is hardly distinguishable from AA's two previous album. Sure, this album does see some fairly obvious changes in a few departments, but otherwise, the band stay true to their well-worn road of passionate and victorious death metal. The band's song structures, lyrics, or overall sound haven't taken any quantam leaps; thank God.\n\nIf there is one change out-front that is immediately noticeable, it's the album's production. The bass is a little more obscured this time around, the drums have a more direct and punchy sound that would come full circle on Versus the World, and the guitar tone is considerably more beefy and dense. This works to an advantage here, as the slower riffs are given more room to breathe, and the more thashed-out numbers like \"Bastards of a Lying Breed\" and \"Releasing Surtur's Fire\" swirl into massive walls of pounding, rage-filled noise. With the guitar tone and drum sound tweaked, everything sounds a bit more polished than before, with the exception of Johan's vocals; which seem to still maintain a rawness seen on previous albums. He doesn't use the growl as much here, though he certainly has evolved in performance and lyrical craft since the first album; instead, he uses a mid-pitched rasp/growl. \n\nThough the band have by no means changed much of their trademark sound, there are some subtleties that boost the album as a whole; compositions seem more fully developed, and the guitars collaborate wonderfully rather than play off each other. Genius melodic riffs power \"The Sound of Eight Hooves,\" and the slower songs like \"Annihilation of Hammerfest,\" which seemed to bring previous albums down, now contain a deeper sense of breadth and emotion. This may be due to the lyrics, which take a slight break from the \"burn and pillage\" mentality often seen for a more introspective mannerism of telling Norse lore and legends. Even the more brutal numbers seem more cohesive and clean-cut while maintaining the balls needed for this band. There is a greater sense of dynamics; \"The Fall Through Ginnungagap\" balances an overwhelming epic sense with a darker mid-section, while \"Annihilation of Hammerfest\" contains seemingly hope-filled riff work on the verses.\n\nAnders' drum work propels the rest of the band through thundering mid-paced sections, and just as easily through passages of blistering speed chock full of pummeling double bass. A perfect example is \"The Sound of Eight Hooves\", where a merciless verse is interplayed by gliding double bass, only to let up in the next passage with a shuffling tempo that still maintains intensity. The album's opening track and \"Risen From the Sea\" prove to be some of the best drum tracks Anders has ever lain to tape.\n\nOverall, The Crusher proves to be yet another incredible album by Amon Amarth. It's not really that different from anything else they've offered up, but that only helps it. The whole album proves for an interesting, consistent, and enjoyable listen the whole way through. \n\nFavorite tracks: \"Masters of War\", \"The Sound of Eight Hooves\", \"Releasing Surtur's Fire.\"\n",
        "\nHere's what you entered in the review body for copy and pasting purposes:\n\nI don't know why, but sometimes, I have bad feelings about songs or albums, even before having listened to it. I saw the cover art, and I didn't like it. I saw the song titles, and I didn't have a good feeling about those either. I really don't know why, but anyway, I'm being very negative towards this album (for a self-proclaimed AA-fanboy, that is), while I haven't said a word about how the album actually is.\n\nSo, the album kicks off with An Ancient Sign of Coming Storm. The riffs are pretty solid, and the drumming is pretty heavy and stuff but still the song is kinda mid paced. That's o.k., its still pretty sweet, but there's something missing. I don't know, it doesn't sound familiar, while it's definitely recognisable as Amon Amarth stuff. This is something which is bugging me throughout the entire album; the sound is just way different. I'm not sure, but I think I've read somewhere that they've moved to another studio. Anyway, I'm not a big fan of the sound, but, back to An Ancient Sign of Coming Storm: this song does kick ass. I gave it a couple more chances and I've already started to like it more. Moreover, the breakdown-thingy at 3:30 is actually really really cool.\n\nI know that this site isn't very fond of song-by-song reviews, but personally, I find them very useful, and I guess I'll just implement it anyway.\nWhere Death Seems To Dwell, is slightly comparable to Where Silent Gods Stand Guard, only it doesn't kick as much ass, not by a long shot. It's a bit more dramatic (like the entire album, actually. It gets you depressed, really), but it feels...bland...like its missing a magic AA ingredient. It doesn't have that viking feeling to it, they don't succeed in imagery through lyrics and music as good as they do in the older albums. I guess that pretty much sums up what I don't like about this album.\n\nIt doesn't make you (me, anyway) feel like a viking. Like I'm actually at the place which the song is about. Anyway back to the songs. Next in line is Fate of Norns, the title track, and the intro kicks-ass. Too bad the chorus doesn't. Its all just too dramatic. It doesn't fit the intro, which (in my ears) suggests a song about those annoying christians (or something similar), but then it breaks down to a lame-kinda riff in the chorus. Sadly. The songs topic is the same as Ride For Vengeance, but in Ride For Vengeance he kicks the murderers asses; in Fate of Norns he moarns and cries about the Norns' sad fate. Which isn't nearly as interesting as Ride For Vengeance.\n\nPursuit of Vikings also doesn't really feel \"complete\". Just like the rest of the songs, it doesn't feel good. I don't know how to explain it, but anyway, the moment where he shouts \"ODIN, GUIDE OUR SHIPS\" does kick major ass though.\n\nThe Valkyries Ride starts out...odd. Then it slows down, but the double-bass sounds generic and lame, and the entire song doesn't kick as much ass as they intended it to.\n\nIt's a shame, but I don't even feel like reviewing the rest of the songs individually. The drumming part before Beheading of a King is kinda cool, and overall, all of the songs are pretty much O.K., but none of them are really...great!\n\nExcept for the last one. Once sealed in blood has really really cool verses. The main riff is cool, the chorus is ok; this is how all songs on this album should be. And oh, the song is about revenge and getting some guys back for burning his friends alive (as described in Arson), and \"He will learn the meaning of pain\", stuff like this just kicks plain ass.\n\nThe album is good, but nothing special, which is too bad. I'd recommend older stuff from AA; the older the album, the better.\n\n\"One man down 29 to go\nConsider yourselves warned\nI'm coming for the rest of you\nAnd will have no remorse\"\n\nsweet.\n",
        "\nAfter the weaker album \u201cThe Fate Of Norns\u201d Amon Amarth shows once again that they\u2019re one of the best Melodic Death Metal bands in the world. \n\nThe best thing about this album is, that the powerful produced sound varies a lot so that this never gets boring. You can listen how often you want and you still will find new details that you didn\u2019t know. \n\nEven the drums alone are so great that you never can get enough of them. Fast and technical double basses, brutal crushed drums and slow stamping midtempo parts complete each other to a endless powerful fundament for each song. \nAnd then the guitars! The riffs are very fast most of the time. But they are still able to create that thick epic atmosphere with that Amon Amarth typical majestic mood. If you think that they just play some good melodic riffs, then you\u2019re wrong. They also play some of the most amazing solos I know. This solos are so emotional and they have so much power that you even will get goose pimples while listening. \nSo let me tell something about the bass guitar: Like in the most Death Metal bands the bass is almost not audible. But if you hear it, then you know that nothing in this band is just average. In the beginning of the eigth song, \u201cUnder The Northern Star\u201d, you can hear the bass and it\u2019s awesome, like everything else on this album, too. \nBut the best thing on this album is, that Hegg has developed his growls one more time. His voice reaches from ultra deep (almost grunting) growls to hoarse (almost screamed) growls. A variable growling is good for each band, but if the vocalist knows when the best time comes to go higher or deeper with his voice, then it\u2019s perfect. And Hegg knows how he has to use his growling skills. His voice is also responsible that each song gets this unmistakable \nAmon Amarth note. So he is the superior part here. \n\nIf you want to find a mistake on this album, you only can mention the first song \u201cValhall Awaits Me\u201d. It combines each positive aspect that I mentioned above, but it has a lack of atmosphere. \n\nThe absolute best song here is the already mentioned \u201cUnder The Northern Star\u201d. It is a rough ballad to the northern homeland. It is a mixture between epic Power Metal guitar sound (especially the solo at about three minutes sounds like Firewind or Hammerfall plays it) and the deep throaty growls of Hegg. So you can say that this is a Power/Death Metal ballad with a loomy atmosphere. A ultimate hymn to the home of the Vikings. \n\nFinal resume: A great album that is not as perfect as \u201cVersus The World\u201d was. But if you like Melodic Death Metal, then it is your fucking duty to get it!\n",
        "\nMany people, myself included, consider Amon Amarth's fifth album to be the lowpoint in their career. However, the fact that this release still manages to shit over the large majority of Melodic Death Metal releases out there is a testament to how good they are at what they do. \n\nOn their previous release, 'Vs the World', the speed and brutality was turned down a notch, and the sound of the album was focused more on epic riffing at a more crushing mid paced tempo. 'Fate of Norns' goes down this path a little more, with the same mid paced tempo intact, but the melodies much more epic and able to conjure an image in the listener's head as a whole. While this isn't the best approach for a band such as Amon Amarth to take, it shows the flexibility of their songwriting skills, as they proved that they can write both the fast, agressive tunes that took up a fair amount of their previous releases and the more midpaced, epic songs that they now write.\n\nEvidence of this is shown in the opening track, 'An Ancient Sign of Coming Storm', which begins with a growl from Johan Hegg before evolving into a crushing yet epic riff. 'Where Death Seems to Dwell' takes a different approach with an atmospheric albeit somewhat boring beginning which eventually turns into an enjoyable yet average riff halfway through. 'Fate of the Norns' is one of the more melodic songs on the album, with the guitars preferring to focus on tremolo sections which play out some great melodies. 'Pursuit of Vikings' is quite a simplistic yet catchy song, which is driven by a great riff that is sure to get the head banging. Up next is 'The Valkyries Ride', which undergoes a few changes throughout with the riffing being more brutal than on previous tracks. While I believe it is a little overrated, it still remains one of the best on the album. 'Beheading of a King' has copped some flak for being boring, and while I wouldn't call it that it still is considerably worse than the other tracks on the album. While the chorus is quite effective and has a nice melody to it, anything else from that lacks quality. 'Arson' is where the album picks up again. Probably the most melodic of the lot, the lyrics tell the story of some Vikings fighting the enemy from inside a house which is set on fire, with only one escaping. It's the longest song on the album yet doesn't get boring, as the melody present is really good, and there's an effective solo towards the end. 'Once Sealed in Blood' is tied lyrically to the previous track, and tells of the viking that escaped seeking revenge on the enemy who killed his friends. It contains some great riffing and is probably the fastest on the album.\n\nHowever, the album is far from perfect. I said this is Amon Amarth's weakest album previously, and there are a few factors which make it deserving of this title. The album can sound boring and restrained at times, as if they're not playing to their full capacity. While it only happens in a few songs it really brings the album down, as it seems that they're about to rip the chains off and erupt into an awesome fast paced riff, but the moment never comes. On a similar note, Johan Hegg's vocals aren't as aggressive as they were on previous albums. While they are still good and fit the themes of the songs, it would sound better overall if Hegg was giving it his full capacity. Finally, the riffing can be a bit average at times, which brings it a step down from 'Vs the World'. A lot of the time it's great, but then a bad riff will come and really stick out.\n\nWith all this considered however, 'Fate of the Norns' remains a great album in it's own right. It's epic, melodic, and crushing at the same time, and while it is the weakest of all the albums Amon Amarth have released, it is still better than a lot of the Melodic Death Metal releases today.\n",
        "\nAmon Amarth is one of those bands that can do no wrong. At least they haven't up till now.\n\nTheir EP \"Sorrow Throughout the Nine Worlds\", despite clocking just under 25 minutes, can count as a full-fledged record with five well-developed, mature tracks, and as such, I see it as their real debut. Now that makes for both a suprising fact, given that it's undoubtedly the band's best disc to this day, and an explanation, since most bands release their best stuff on their debuts. But the great thing about Amon Amarth is that they recognized they had hit upon a winning formula here, and thus stuck with it, making only a few minor adjustments to their sound over the years. Let's hope they keep it that way.\n\nNow I'm not quite a huge fan of melodic death metal; At The Gates, Dark Tranquillity, Arch Enemy, whatnot, it's not very much my cup of tea, apart from the odd quality song or sometimes even an entire album. Amon Amarth is, however, of an entirely different kind of melodic death and has one of the most recognizable sounds among contemporary extreme metal bands. Yes, their guitars are down-tuned, but it doesn't sound anywhere near as flaccid as it usually does. I guess you'll have to hear it before you know. What makes it so outstanding is the exquisite quality of the riffs, which consist almost entirely of dual guitar harmonies and tremolo picking, epic, melodic and emotional. In later albums they would sometimes shift more towards a rhythmic approach, see \"With Oden on Our Side\" for instance, but here, it's all tremolo-picked harmony, with a variation of drum patterns underneath it. But always straightforward and sincere, as is typically Amon Amarth - quite the opposite of Malmsteen and the likes. No infinite arpeggio ass-raping in here, just plain catchy tunes.\n\nNow having described Amon Amarth in general, I can't help but stating that \"Sorrow Throughout the Nine Worlds\" is the absolute top of all that on one small disc. The compositions here are actually more complex than on their later albums, though not in any kind of pretentious or overblown manner, and all five songs are as memorable as it could possibly get for the band.\n\nIt takes off with the title track, and does so with a bang. There you got it, Amon Amarth's characteristic twin guitar sound, no less. But there's more to the song than just that; there's a change around 2:00 and the song changes character, with the characteristic lead hopping in. On Amon Amarth's leads: some consider them as \"poor\", and if all you care for is shredding and scale-poop, they are. But shite are they effective! A guide on how to create effective solos. At 3:20 the song's \"chorus\" comes in, which is pretty emotional, I dare say. Solid track, which not simply \"hints\" at the band's \"later\" achievements, but which is simply the achievement itself.\n\n\"The Arrival Of The Fimbul Winter\", from their 1994 demo, is the second blow from the Viking hammer on here. Starts fast, slows down a bit, a bit of soloing again, then works its way to the main tune, which comes at 1:30, then reprises the opening riff and continues. Well, you can't say this ain't well-done. Best performance here is by vocalist Johan Hegg; the scream at 3:48 is just plain chilling. Take him away and you take most of the band's essence with it.\n\nThird is \"Burning Creation\", which turns out to be another solid track. (Which Amarth song doesn't?) The solo in here is slightly more complex as well. Oh yes, and the lyrics are all Viking stuff of course. I'm usually terrible at paying attention to them, but I can't recall a song by the band dealing with anything else than Vikings. Love it or hate it.\n\n\"The Mighty Doors Of The Speargod's Hall\" could be my favourite track on here, if it wasn't for the next one. Pretty heavy, going mid-paced for its first half, then after the Swedish words are sung picks up at 3:15 with a nicely complex tune, then continues mid-paced. Unlike some of their other tracks, this one hasn't a zilch of predictability.\n\nAnd then the definite milestone, which goes by the name of \"Under The Grayclouded Winter Sky\". Take everything I said above, then multiply it by at least three. Quintessential Amon Amarth song, if not their very best (this or \"Victorious March\"). Goes mid-paced for a while with a thundering riff, then takes an even more thundering riff after two minutes, and changes again after another two minutes. The tune coming in at 4:00 is catchy as fuck, and when the rhythm reprises, it will damn well grip you by the throat, unless you're dead or something. Holy shite. And it quits again with a bang, leaving room for you to put on \"The Avenger\" or so.\n\nYeah, this is not your average we-have-only-two-good-songs-so-we-can't-make-full-length-album EP. In short, if you like Amon Amarth, you need this. If you don't, you also need this.\n\nOn the production: I have the remastered version, and it doesn't sound anywhere near being a band's mere first decent recording effort. \"Army Of Darkness\", this is not. As a matter of fact, it's not very different from the production on their later stuff, better than \"Once Sent From The Golden Hall\"; clear, with enough emphasis on each instrument. Sometimes, the bass is lacking, but that's of course a matter of taste.\n",
        "\nWhat the fuck happened to Amon Amarth? After releasing the great album Versus The World everyone wanted to know if they are able to hold this great level. But what you can hear on Fate Of Norns is just disappointing. This is definitely the worst album they have released yet. \n\nOk, \u201cPursuit Of Vikings\u201d is a very catchy song with growl along refrain, good guitar melodies, pounding drums and Hegg\u2019s unmistakeable growls. And \u201cThe Valkyries Ride\u201d is the reason why I started listening Death Metal. Very aggressive with brutal growls and sawing riffs. It makes you imagine a bloody battle when suddenly the Valkyries come down to take the dead to Valhalla. Really amazing Death Metal! \n\nThe opener \u201cAn Ancient Sign Of Coming Storm\u201d is good, too. Sometimes pounding drums, nice riffs and the typical Hegg growls. But in other great songs of Amon Amarth the riffs are great and epic, not nice. And the drums are pounding the whole song, not sometimes. And even Hegg loses points here: His growls aren\u2019t aggressive like you know it from him. \n\nSo now you surely want to know why I call \u201cAn Ancient Sign Of Coming Storm\u201d a good song. Well, on this album, it\u2019s good. Because the other songs are simply crap. It sounds like a low produced demo release of some bored musicians. The riffs are shitty and boring, the bass is boring, the drums are boring and Hegg\u2019s growls have a real lack of aggression and he sounds bored, too! \n\nIf they were amateurs and this would be their first demo, you could say: It\u2019s listenable and Ok, but they have to become better. That\u2019s not enough for Amon Amarth!\n\nAnd be carefully with \u201cBeheading Of A King\u201d. This is just fucking crap! The shitty riffs and the growls are hacked to little pieces which don\u2019t fit together. It sounds like an outtake, recorded while the band was drunk. But I fear that they\u2019re serious with this. \n\nSo finally I would say: Amon Amarth have lost their face after releasing this, because it\u2019s just fucking crap! Putting the three good songs \u201cPursuit Of Vikings\u201d, \u201cThe Valkyries Ride\u201d and \u201cAn Ancient Sign Of Coming Storm\u201d on an EP would have been better.\n",
        "\nYes, Oden is indeed on the side of Amon Amarth. Before the new Amon Amarth, I could only get my Indian girlfriend to listen to Opeth, and newer Opeth at that. But she just needed to hear \"Hermod's Ride to Hel\" once to become a complete convert to the Norsemen's pounding, epic, stirring barnd of Viking death metal.\n\nNot only that, but I put a few tracks into her MP3 player, which she brought with her on a recent trip to India. Soon enough, her 11 YEAR OLD SISTER and MOM were completely hooked on 'Marth. When even little kids and older women half the world away request double-bass drenched tales of Nordic mythology with harsh vocals, you know the Swedes have done something right this time.\n\nThey have really developed their slower, melodic side to the point where guitar lines stick in your head like a double-bladed axe. I saw them live recently, and they can't quite get these melodies out in the forefront - but on the CD it sounds awesome. My only downside would be that there is certainly some repetition, but with Amon Amarth that shouldn't be a surprise. \n\nHighlights include the aforementioned \"Hermod's Ride to Hel,\" a fucking AMAZING track that tells a piece of the mythology that will hopefully have a part II and eventually (I'm assuming) end with Loki bound to a rock, poison dripping into his eyes. The last minute and half is the very definition of epic melody, and I memorized the lines between Hermod and the Hel guy immediately. Also good are \"Runes to My Memory,\" \"Gods of War\" (take that Christians, again!), the stirring title track (which suffers from some lyrical repetition), the ride-into-battle themed \"Cry of the Blackbirds,\" and the very cool and slow \"Under the Northern Star\" with a great vocal effect about halfway through.\n\nSo really, that's most of the tracks. It is quite easy to put it on from start to finish, and I find myself doing so at least twice a week. The lyrics are still good, though not up to some of their previous efforts. Get back to work on that gang, think more \"Hermod\" and less \"With Oden On Our Side.\" Nonetheless, I think this will most certainly help to break them big. I wouldn't be surprised to see Amon Amarth in the mainstream someday, though I'm sure these Vikings have the integrity to ride up that mainstream and plunder any monasteries on its banks.\n",
        "\n(Note: Originally written for Amazon.com on 3/6/2005.)\n\nI'm not saying this is a bad CD, not at all. I guess it's just the fact that a lot of pressure was put on the band to make a suitable follow-up to 2002's colossal \"Versus the World\", thus making the song structures seem a bit forced and uninspired. A lot of \"hype\" was put behind this CD, (most likely due to Metal Blade's ravenous marketing strategies to make the band more popular and mainstream) and that's where this CD falls a bit short. Yeah, it's Amon Amarth, the typical formula of booming drums, soaring guitar melodies, etc; but two huge things are missing; ATTITUDE and FEROCITY, among other things which aren't uncommon to be seen in AA's music. The whole album just feels worn-down, tired, uninspired, and lacking any genuine feeling or effort. The music has slowed down a lot, which leaves more room for songwriting, but the songwriting, too, has simplified to accessible verse-chorus structures, and the drums have lost that unpredictable \"octopus\" style edge to them, exception of the first track, and often result in boring mid-paced tempos with little fills or variety. Speaking of variety, that's another weak point here. Whereas \"Versus the World\" had both slow, epic songs, and the thrashy face-rippers, the majority of the album (if not all) is mid-tempo, creating a large dirge of redundancy. \n\nSome previous underground bands that went mainstream have gotten better to me, such as Soilwork or Mayhem. But the fact is, AA don't make commercially accessible music, and that's what is attempted here, and it just comes off as weak. There is no fist-clenched, teeth-gritting, pound-your-face-in type of AA to be found... This is definitely the \"grimmest\" of AA's albums though, and that's something I'll easily admit.\n\nHowever, this isn't to say this CD is \"bad\", just disappointing. And don't tell me I need to listen to this more just to \"get it\". I've had this album since the day it came out, and I have listened to it time and time again to let it grow on me, and never once has anything really stuck to me. Soilwork pulled off going mainstream going well because of their diversity in the music, and AA did the exact opposite. You would swear sometimes that you wouldn't know when the song changed. Despite all of my complaining, there are still some good songs, mainly the title track, the catchy \"The Pursuit of Vikings\" and the haunting \"Where Death Seems to Dwell\". But the thing is, there aren't many things here that stick in your head unlike previous AA material. There are no \"bad\" tracks per se, but nothing really sticks out. The whole album just kind of plods along at one pace, falling into boredom. Simply put, it just seems like a filler CD put out to satisfy public opinion and the record compaany. \n\nI hope this only happens one time to these guys...AA are far too talented to make music like this and fall so low. A bit of a disappointment... Maybe they just hit a rough spot, but who knows... Only time will tell.\n",
        "\nOnce again, Amon Amarth have returned with an album filled with aggressive songs which describe Viking melee in detail. The lyrics are perhaps not that varied, but that is really the only thing I am a little dissatisfied with on this release. However, three songs: \u201cAsator\u201d, \u201cUnder the North Star\u201d and \u201cHermod\u2019s Ride to Hel - Lokes Treachery part 1\u201d have slightly other themes and that is a good thing.\n\nI bought this album because of the very positive reviews I had read, and because I had heard \u201cRunes to my Memory\u201d, which I liked. I was positively surprised and Amon Amarth gained much more respect from me. I have only heard \u201cOnce Sent from the Golden Hall\u201d before, and it was not this good. \n\nOverall, this album is a solid rock-hard release with a base of distorted rhythm guitar and bass, which creates a heavy and speedy fundament for the songs. Because of this ongoing background music, the lead guitar is much more striking when it plays its melodies over the rest. This way to build up the music may seem very annoying for those who don\u2019t like metal, because if you don\u2019t really listen to this album, but only play it in the background, the music will only sound like noise. Inside this though, there are subtle and sophisticated melody parts. The cold, half-distorted, brutal and yet melodic lead guitar does a wonderful job.\n\nThe drumming is very effective in doing its task. The drums are in the background all the time, and before writing this review I had not even thought about them. But that is the best thing about them; in this kind of music, they should provide the backbone for the string instruments while they can be more prominent in Power or Heavy metal for example. The drums are however excellent for building on to the powerful whole of this album.\n\nThe vocals are very powerful and darker than those of growlers with more high-pitched voices, like Petri Lindroos for example. There is also a mix of the more bear-like growls and some which are a little more shrill, which is a nice tool to avoid monotony. The only problem with the vocals is connected with the lyrics. Not the content, but the way they are written. Almost all lyrics on this album are written with verses of four lines where the first rhymes with the third, and the second with the fourth. This is the easiest way to write lyrics, and often it works well, but if you restrict yourself to the use of this way of writing and try no other, it can sometimes make the song material a little repetitive. \n\nThe best song on this album is the closer \u201cPrediction of Warfare\u201d. Lyrically it manages to include some details which separate it from the other \u201cWe-Vikings-Slaughter-All-Enemies\u201d-lyrics. Musically, it contains a few really nice solos and the main riff is also a good one. Together with this one, four other songs are a little better than the rest. The varied \u201cRunes to my Memory\u201d, the fast \u201cAsator\u201d, the dark \u201cHermod\u2019s Ride to Hel\u201d and the epic \u201cUnder the Northern Star\u201d make up this group. The other four songs are a bit more monotonous and not as interesting, neither from a musical or lyrical perspective.\n\nAs a whole, this is a great release, which made me more positive towards both Amon Amarth as a band, and Melodic Death Metal as a genre. I will now check out some more of the earlier releases of this band, and see if I like them as much. If it is at all possible for you to tolerate growled vocals, buy this album!\n",
        "\nGather your axes, spears and swords! For the victorious men from the North hath returned from their campaings againt the followers of Christ!\n\nPersonally I can not see where this has any American school Death Metal, to me, and many other \"Asator\" sounds like traditional Scandinavian Death Metal. This may sound like a completley different band since they have gone back to their older more epic sound, instead of the more crushing midpace of Vs The World or Fate of Norns, also Johan said that they went for a more Once Sent From the Holden Hall sound. To me this is a great change as their previous lps lacked the power of their first 3.\n\nWhat we have here is more faster paced songs, as the other reviewers said that \"Under The Northern Star\" is the best song, this is my favourite track too, this is possibly the most melodic song that these vikings have ever produced! \"Hermod's Ride To Hel (Lokes Treachery Part 1)\" is a prime example of the faster epic sound, strong riffing with strong vocals.\n\nOver all this is a great disc, full of emotion, epic hymns of war, speed and also some slower passages to crush the Christian with. This bears the trademark of a classic Amon Amarth album with the epic yet still skull crushing riffs and leads of Olavi Mikkonen and Johan S\u00f6derberg. The booming drums of Fredrik Andersson, the pumping bass of Ted Lundstr\u00f6m and the bellowing Norse vocals of Johan Hegg\n",
        "\nI heard a lot of good things about this band and being a fan of viking and melodic death metal I decided to check them out. I am glad I did. I liked the album, which is the first I've listened to them, but I was a tad disappointed because even though I liked it a lot, I was expecting more based on how everyone praised this band. I listened to some more songs then from earlier albums, and it is true that while the style didn't change much over the course of the past few albums, this album does indeed sound weaker than what they have done in the past.\n\nThere are a lot of factors that make Amon Amarth as great as they are. One is great riffs, which they definitely do have. They also have some very memorable melodies which give the songs more atmosphere. The drumming is also very good, and it sounds right in the mix, giving the song a more full feeling. The vocals here are very good. The vocalist has a very strong, deep, and wet growl, meaning it sounds as if he has a lot of saliva in his throat. Another great thing about Amon Amarth has always been the lyrics. They are always a Viking theme, and usually tell some kind of tale. Amon Amarth's albums are usually the ones you listen to with the booklet in your hand to get the true emotion and feeling of the song. On this album however, while the lyrics are still very good, they don't seem to be as strong as on previous albums. Another good thing on this album is it seems Amon Amarth sacrificed the speed, but instead made the songs a bit heavier and more melodic which does add more atmosphere to the album which in my opinion is a good thing.\n\nThere are a lot of highlights on this album. The opener, \"An Ancient Sign of Coming Storm\" is a very strong and solid opener. While it is not very fast, it does have quite a bit of melody. \"The Fate of Norns\" is also good because of the awesome melodies, and the fact that it is a long song, meaning I get to enjoy it more. \"Pursuit of Vikings\" is probably the heaviest song on here, but it also has a lot of melody and great vocals which makes it one of the best on the album. The best song on this album though would have to be \"Arson\". It is the only epic song on the album and it is awesome. It isn't as heavy and it is slower paced, but the atmosphere and melodies on this song are simply amazing. The drumming on this song is also awesome, as it almost feels like its emphasizing the point of the guitars. The vocals are great, and the lyrics here are awesome as well, which tell about a battle. The solo towards the end of the song is also pretty well done and it is appreciated because we don't often hear Amon Amarth play solos.\n\nEven if this album doesn't seem to live up to its predecesors, its still worth the buy for any fan of viking of melodic death metal, and I will go ahead and purchase the rest of their discography. I also see they are due out with their next album soon so I am looking forward to that as well.\n",
        "\n\"Thanks\" because this release is a simple masterpiece from one of the greatest melodic death metal bands of our time. This being Amon Amarth's first EP one can only praise them for having released such beautiful material when they were only a \"beginner\" band. \n\nMusically this is quite different from their previous and later releases. Sorrow Throughout the Nine Worlds is extreemly melodic and fast, much more so than the following Amon Amarth albums. The many amazing riffs that compose each song follow eachother perfectly and all is very well coordinated with the vocals and drums. This all doesn't give the listener any time to get bored. \nWhat strikes me the most in this EP is the emotion which can be felt in the music and in Johan's vocals which are amazing all along. You'll notice that Johan's growls are more often high pitched than on the following albums, and thats not at all a bad point. He actually uses the high pitched vocals more often than his amazing capacity to growl low, and that sounds totally right with this release. As for the emotion, weither its in the guitar melodies or in Johan's singing, its omnipresent from start to finish. This intensity made me want to read the lyrics, even though I'm often disapointed when I do that for other bands. But the lyrics of this EP are truly amazing (like for most Amon Amarth lyrics) and they really carry out the emotion of the music as anyone would expect. These lyrics are quite different from those of other albums considering that in this one they are mostly inspired by stories from Norse Mythology whereas the other albums are about vikings and they hardly mention mythological stories.\nThe EP's highlights would be \"Sorrow Throughout the Nine Worlds\", \"The Mighty Doors of the Speargods Hall\" and \"Under the Greyclouded Winter Sky\".\n\nI recommend this release to all metalheads who can appreciate growling vocals and good melody. Unfortunately it isnt distributed anymore but you can find the material on the 2nd disk of the limited edition of the Versus the World album. But if you want a real copy, you might have to do like what I did and check out Ebay constantly for it. I eventually got it for about 30 euros but it was definately worth the money, and I was ready to pay much more to feel the pleasure of having such a masterpiece in my hands.\n",
        "\nI stumbled upon Amon Amarth only about two years ago, but these five Swedes immediately managed to grab my attention, and I have checked out most of their albums by now. \u201cFate of Norns\u201d is their fifth full-length album to date, and let me say it in advance: it\u2019s a darn good one!\n\nI know that many people \u2013 especially ardent supporters of Death Metal, I suppose \u2013 are not all that enthusiastic about this one as about some of their previous albums, the reason being mainly that \u201cFate of Norns\u201d doesn\u2019t feature any particularly fast songs, but focuses more on stomping rhythms and epic melodies.\n\nOverall, I think that apart from Johan Hegg\u2019s Death growls, which are as brilliant as always, the music on here is very much reminiscent of more \u201ctraditional\u201d (what a goofy term!) Metal bands such as Maiden or Priest. Which \u2013 unless your musical agenda is strictly limited to ultra-fast and brutal Death Metal, and the mere mention of these bands is enough to make you feel nauseated \u2013 is really not a bad thing at all, especially when it\u2019s done as tastefully as here.\n\nThe production is quite good, particularly if you happen to like HUGE double bass drums and lead guitars. The downside is that the snare gets drowned out by all the double bass mayhem sometimes, but that fits the music quite well and is not a serious point of criticism. The vocal delivery by front warrior Johan Hegg might be his best yet, that guy is definitely one of the band\u2019s greatest assets and perhaps the best vocalist in the whole Death Metal genre. Most importantly, however, the melodies that are featured in abundance in every song are killer, turning some of the cuts into hymns that are guaranteed to make you raise your drinking horns and/or ravage a couple of villages in Oden\u2019s honor!\n\nIn conclusion, while this is not Amon Amarth\u2019s strongest showing so far \u2013 that distinction goes to their debut \u201cOnce Sent from the Golden Hall\u201d, and while the guys may have played it a bit safe with this one, \u201cFate of Norns\u201d is still one hell of an album and a very worthy addition to their impressive background catalogue as well as to every metalhead\u2019s record collection. It will be very interesting to see in which direction the band is headed with regard to their next album, though, as they can\u2019t possibly become even more melodic. A little more variety really couldn\u2019t hurt!\n\nChoicest cuts: This band has not written a crappy song to date, and this album is no exception. The best ones on here are probably the opener \u201cAn Ancient Sign of Coming Storm\u201d, the crushing \u201cPursuit of Vikings\u201d, and the closer \u201cOnce Sealed in Blood\u201d.\n",
        "\nUpon hearing this album for the first time, my thoughts were \"This is a waste of my time!\" After another couple listens, I've decided it wasn't a total waste, but I still can't completely warm up to this melodic-death snoozefest. Every song on here makes me think of how bands like Carcass and At the Gates did slick, well-produced melodic death metal so much better over a decade ago. The music on here is standard, mid-paced Gothenburg \"death\" metal with no surprises, and dispite my general dislike of the genre, I liked what I heard coming from Amon Amarth. However, they may have changed my opinion with this disc. The album pretty much runs together like one long track, except for a few standouts - namely the title track and album closer \"Once Sealed In Blood\". However, two good songs does not an excellent record make, and as a result, \"Fate Of Norns\" will not be in constant rotation in my stereo. I know this band is capable of more(what I've heard off of \"Sorrow Throughout The Nine Worlds\" blows this away), but another album like this may cause me to totally lose interest in their output. If the Norns' fate was death by boredom, perhaps Amon Amarth is to blame.\n",
        "\nThroughout their entire career, Sweden\u2019s Amon Amarth has maintained a consistent level of performance. You can always be assured that every 18 months or so, AA will deliver another dose of stirring epic metal. Last year\u2019s \u2018Verses The World\u2019 disc was just about the best thing they\u2019ve ever done and was just the tonic needed in the face of the more lackluster 2002 album \u2018The Avenger\u2019. As a major fan of the band, I was extremely keen to see where AA would take their sound next. \n\nIt could be argued that Amon Amarth have hardly progressed since day one, and the more fickle metal supporter would have no qualms in saying that AA have pretty much written the same album over and over for the past five albums. There is some merit in that call, however I point out that as far as passionate epic metal that stirs the soul, Amon Amarth pretty much stand alone among the glut of other Swedish Melodic Death Metal acts. No one else does an epic Viking anthem quite like Amon Amarth. \n\n\u2018Fate of Norns\u2019 is pure Amon Amarth. However, as far as an extension on their sound it doesn\u2019t push any groundbreaking barriers - this more of a continuation if you will. AA took some major step with VTW in that they opted to back off on the brutality and speed factor. This allowed a heavier, more melodic sound to be attained, as well as exacerbating that essential uplifting atmosphere that their compositions conveyed. Whilst I believe that \u2018FON\u2019 doesn\u2019t have the passion or artistic flair that so enamored \u2018VTW\u2019 it is most certainly built upon the successful formula that \u2018VTW\u2019 portrayed. \n\nNo doubt, Amon Amarth is pretty comfortable with the style of music they now write. They see no reason to fix something that isn\u2019t broke - If you liked \u2018VTW\u2019 then you\u2019ll find \u2018Fate of Norns\u2019 to be a more than solid addition to the bands catalogue. Despite a less than convincing production and a less than instant set of songs, it displays every essential characteristic that AA is renowned for \u2013 mid tempo pacing, super melodic leads, harsh vocals and that majestic \u2018off to battle\u2019 atmosphere. But, and I warn you again, expect nothing more. \n\nAmon Amarth is still churning out their own brand of quality Viking Metal. But perhaps, it is a little on the \u2018safe\u2019 side. Fate of Norns is, possibly, not the monster it could have been (and it certainly doesn\u2019t match the strength of \u2018VTW\u2019), but long time fans will still revel in the epic anthems laid down here. Having said that, even the \u2018die-hards\u2019 patience might be tested if Amon Amarth don\u2019t come up with a reinvention of sorts on their next album.\n",
        "\nAmon Amarth.... Wow, what can I say? The gods of Death Metal never seems to make anyone disappointed. The overall sound on this CD is just perfect with very clean production. The opening track \"Death In Fire\" starts out with intense dumming that makes you feel like you're marching to a battlefield where you'll fight with the vikings for the mighty Oden. And BOOM, when the riff brakes the silence you can really feel how two great armies are fighting against eachother. When the chorus starts and Mr. Hegg roars \"Death In Fire\" you'll know that this is some very good stuff. Both melody and brutality in every move.\n\nI think you can guess what the lyrics are about. Yeah, you're right. They're all about vikings and war. Amon Amarth's vikingtheme is one of the best I've ever heard and seen, beautiful lyrics that definitely force you to sing along. \n\nThe album will continue in the same way like \"Death In Fire\". But when I had heard it a few times I felt that something was missing. This great CD seems to lack the brutality and speed of their earlier albums. Now I'm mostly thinking on \"Once Sent From The Golden Hall\" and \"The Avenger\". Sure, it's still a very good album. But I had rated it a little bit higher if it just had a little more speed. \n\nIf you're looking for some great Death Metal with a wonderful melodic touch you should absolutely check out Amon Amarth - \"Versus The World\". \n\nFavourite tracks;\n\"Death In Fire\"\n\"Where Silent Gods Stand Guard\"\n\"Across The Rainbow Bridge\" (A very epic song and one of my favourites with Amon Amarth)\n",
        "\nThe last two Amon Amarth albums did not really impress me all that much. \"The Crusher\" was OK, having a few really good songs but severely lacking something, and \"Versus The World\" lacked even more. But the viking metal maniacs have returned with a new album and a light that has not been seen since \"The Avenger\".\n\nThe songwriting has increased a hundred fold since \"Versus The World\", having overall better riffs and melodies. The speed of the \"Golden...\" days has disappeared (the fastest song - \"Beheading Of A King\" - is nowhere near the brutality of \"Metalwrath\" or \"Bastards Of A Lying Breed\") but the lack of speed is not an issue on this album. Most of the album is indeed midpaced, but with the many good riffs and melodic passages this results in a much more epic feel to the album. Every member of the band seems to be on top of their game in this album, something they have not done since \"The Avenger\".\n\nThe only weak song on here would have to be \"The Valkyries Ride\", only because it is subpar to the album (every album has one anyways right?). The main highlights would have to be \"The Fate Of Norns\", \"Once Sealed In Blood\" and the slower (even for this speed-free album!) epic \"Arson\".\n\nDiehard fans will obviously pick this up and enjoy it, but in my opinion this is the best thing they've released in a long while.\n",
        "\nAnother Amon Amarth album launched with a trademark viking 'Yaaaaaaaaargh' can't be a bad thing. All around, the characteristic Amon Amarth sound can easily be recognized. Nowhere on the album does the band experiment or otherwise stray from the path outlined by their four previous offerings. \n\nJohan Hegg's vocals are sometimes spoken and sound more thoughtful which isn't something that was featured as much on other albums but it isn't very noticeable since they're as deep as always. It fits the general mood of the album which is more on the mourning than on the vengeful side that was proeminent in Versus the World. The music is more melody-driven than their previous works, following the tone set by 'Where Silent Gods Stand Guard', a slower song that stood out on that album full of aggressive songs. The screams sound desperate on some songs, like the title track, \"The fate of Norns awaits us all, there's no way to escape\", which suits the emotional melodies, emotional in a sending a shiver down your spine only to better break your bones in half later way, of course. \n\nAll the songs have that same desperation meets reckless assault feel. They don't all seem to run together though, all possessing a distinctive melody, some with catchy parts to boot. So Amon Amarth are back with yet another slab of their unique folkish viking-inspired metal which, while it's nothing entirely new, is definitely worth hearing as the band manages to once again create music that never gets boring while staying within the boundaries of their particular style.\n",
        "\nThis is one of the albums that need to be listened to with a booklet of lyrics in front in order to attain the entire experience. Bal-Sagoth is another band of such characteristic. Although there are no epic stories such as on Bal-Sagoth\u2019s albums, Amon Amarth\u2019s albums are better appreciated when the lyrics are read and understood. The lyrics are a defining trait on this album as is the background melody, which is a predominant feature. The negative side of this is that it does get repetitious at times as the melody stays constant throughout.\n\nCompared to albums such as The Crusher, this album, in general, is not as energetic but it is not as noisy either. Some of the tracks, such as \u201cVs The World,\u201d do have a similar type of energetic flow to it with quick and violent spurts, as in the chorus where the lyrics \u201cVs the World\u201d are shouted adding the aggression to the album.\n\n\u201cThousand Years of Oppression,\u201d offers diversity between the general sounds that dominated the album until this point, with a relatively different compositional approach. This is apparent towards the beginning where the vocals are calmer and the instrumentals and melodies are more varied then the rest of the songs.\nAlthough this album does have a general, almost monotonous, feel to it, it does not hinder the overall satisfaction you get from listening to it. This is an energetic album with great lyrics whose only off-putting trait are the similar melodies, which are apparent throughout. The album ends with one of the highlight songs, \u201c...And Soon The World Will Cease To Be,\u201d which is much more melodic then the previous tracks and shows where the band will be going in the future albums.\n\nThis is a very solid album and is a worthwhile addition to most Metal collections. This is a must buy for fans of previous Amon Amarth albums as it offers a pleasurable listening experience and contains many head-banging tracks.\n",
        "\nAmon Amarth's Once Sent From the Golden Hall, is a solid debut. It is rooted firmly in the Gothenburg school, with melodic leads, growled vocals, and a very active double bass. A few things set them apart from the horde of bands in that style though.\n\nOne would be the lyrics. Amon Amarth is one of the few bands to apply viking lyrics to this style of music. It goes over well, as the lyrics combine with the energetic music to evoke an idealized image of viking warfare. The vocals themselves are a mix between death growls and more blackish rasps. \n\nHighlights include: The Dragons' Flight Across The Waves, which contains a battle cry near the end that will make even the most ardent pacifist want to pillage a few French villages; Victorious March, a controlled, militaristic anthem; and Friends Of The Suncross, the frenzied apex of the album.\n\nAfter Friends Of The Suncross, the album tends to drop off. The first five songs are the most memorable, although the interesting Amon Amarth, with its battle ambience, will recapture attention. The problem, and the only major flaw of the album, is that each song follows more or less the same pattern, and it starts wearing thin after a while. Many melodic death bands have this problem.\n\nBut, in the end, this is an enjoyable release that is worth the money and the time. Your CD player will be kept busy for a while, and while you won't gain any new perspectives on life, you will have a hella good time.\n",
        "\nCRUSHING VIKING DEATH METAL.\n\nThat term is synonymous with Amon Amarth, and the Swedes deliver just that with their latest, VERSUS THE WORLD, their best album since their first full-length, ONCE SENT FROM THE GOLDEN HALL.\n\nI have been excited about this album since Metal Blade released the opening track, \u201cDeath In Fire\u201d onto the internet several months ago. This track signifies everything Amon Amarth is about: epic lead melodies, a rhythm section that is the hammer of Thor himself, thundering double bass kicks, and of course, lyrical hymns sung high in praise to the mighty Norse warriors and Gods. What else can I say about this album except that it is at the level of excellence that we have come to expect from Amon Amarth?\n\nTwo slight musical changes really push this album to the forefront of Amon Amarth\u2019s catalog. First is the guitar tone, downtuned and with the perfect amount of distortion, creating some of the fullest, richest guitar work the band has laid down to date. I find the guitars on VERSUS THE WORLD to have more of the epic, melodic flair shared with ONCE SENT, but still crushingly heavy. Secondly, vocalist Johann Hegg growls deeper and fiercer than ever. Everything else is up to par musically; it amazes me how Amon Amarth can keep the same style over so many albums and yet each one remains fresh and enticing. These guys just know how to write great songs!\n\nWhile every track on VERSUS THE WORLD is very good, a couple of them especially stand out. First, the opener, \u201cDeath In Fire,\u201d which is everything a metalhead could dream for, as well as, \u201cWhere Silent Gods Stand Guard,\u201d with its driving chords and pummeling rhythm, as well as some great lead work. Finally \u201cThousand Years Oppression\u201d is a brooding, angry track sure to get your warrior\u2019s heart pounding.\n\nVERSUS THE WORLD is another example of the great talent that Amon Amarth have carried through all their albums. Fans of the band, new, old, and yet-to-be will certainly love this album, so grab your sword, your ale, and drink up with several of your best comrades-in-arms, crank this one up, and join Amon Amarth as they usher in the days of Viking glory once more.\n\n(Originally written by me for www.metal-rules.com, January, 2003)\n",
        "\nThis is the Amon Amarth album out their for the purists. Its their most raw work of all their albums. Once Sent From The Golden Hall is mostly the sound of their demo/ep days but more matured, talented, and structured. If your looking for a release by Amon Amarth in the likes of The Crusher and Versus The World, this release is definatly not for you. Some consider this to be their best work, I considerate it to be on par with The Crusher, but hard to compare it to that album because they both have sounds different from eachother.\n\nA noticable differance on this album as compared to newer Amon Amarth releases, is that Yohan sings with a much deaper voice. On The Crusher and Versus The World Mr. Hegg sings in a more coherant voice that sounds more gargled or that is coming from the back of his throat. On Once Sent From The Golden hall Yohan singing seems to origonate from deep within his throat or stomach. Its a very deep singing style filled with volume. You'll notice upon listening to this album that he doesn't limit himself to this style. At times where the music requires a more screaming style vocal, Yohan will sing more from the back of his throat with a sound that is not as deep. It sounds more like he is grasping for air and letting the emotion of the song take him over. As if the lyrics were what was happening to him at this moment and he was singing them to you, showing his heart to you. These moments are few and far between but when they happen its quite amazing and will make for a memorable moment for the listening. I know they give me goosebumps. The majority of the vocals are a more stabble singing style like I desribed before, very deep vocals that have a little rhyrhym to them. They serve very well to deliver the interesting, intense, and enjoyable lyrical themes. The singing can get very emotion at times, usually at the climax of the songs, somewhere in the middle or end. The most noticable vocal work on this album Is done on Ride For Vengeance and Without Fear, perhaps the two most memorable songs on the album. Ride For Vengence starts off fast and strong with the vocals, they deliver alot of intensity and rage. Without Fear has some moments of pure energy and passion when Yohan screams portraying a man dying. Very passionate and moving, he sings as though he is becoming the person in the song, especially in without fear. Vocal work is amazing, bottom line.\n\nThe guitar work is equally amazing, with tons of fast complex riffs and great solo's. The guitars work in an unusual way, the songs on Once Sent From The Golden Hall are not very centralized, so many guitar riffs are not repeated. This makes the songs interesting for that the guitars are ever changing throughout them, riffs are hardly repeated. There will be an attention grabing opening riff in a song, some more riffs throughout it that stand out while there is no singing, and a solo to top it off, all well done. The riffs sometimes take on an apocalyptic feel when they are slow, especially the opening riff of Amon Amarth (track 7). The general guitar work and riffs are heavy and fast. They drums play well with the guitars so the riffs have some added volume. Like I said the guitars don't carry the songs, they change alot and don't dictate how a song will sound. Most songs on here are have two main focuses, guitars and riffs, and the vocals. Each do something very interesting and can be apprieciated at the same time, they don't take a backseat to eachother. The range of the guitars is also to be noted, they can be choppy, heavy, and brutal, and also rhythmic and melodic, or a combination of these adjectives. Most of the time they are heavy or melodic, but they always sound great.\n\nThese songs have some very memorable moments, like the Ending of The Dragons' Flight Across The Waves has an intense and angry vocal chorus. Ride For Vengence will have a very fast a brutal intro that you will never forget and want more of. The middle to end of Amon Amarth becomes very passionate and emotional, the big draw of this song. Without fear has few great and memorable lines about halfway through the song. I would say each song on this album has something you will remember and make you want to listen to it time and time again. More specifically Ride For Vegeance and Without fear will stick in your heads as songs that you will come to this album for. The album starts out strong and goes out fighting (literally). This is for any straight foward death metal fan that likes a more heavy style of death metal. Its not brutal like some bands, but in its own way shows its brutality, mostly through lyrical themes. This album is flawless and timeless.\n",
        "\nWhat a tremendous album.... That's all that I kept saying to myself within the brief seconds it took me to take my headphones off my head. This album is definitely the best melodic death metal album ever produced. Viking themes, melody riffs, stupendous leads, good fast drumming, and great Viking theme lyrics screeched out by the blonde Viking of a vocalist, Johan Hegg.\n\nThe CD starts off with a bang (Death in fire) and ends in a melodic epic \"...And soon the world will cease to be.\" \"Death in fire\", kicks your ass right from the beginning with a war drum beat and a terrific melodic guitar riff. The songs on the album vary from fast brutal war like songs, to melodic songs, which even though are slow in pace still keep the overall aggression of Amon Amarth at full strength, such as tracks like, Down the Slopes of Death and Across the Rainbow Bridge.\n\nDrum wise, Fredrik Andersson keeps good pace with average double bass and in my own opinion, does not show as much talent on this CD as I think he could. The guitar players, Olavi Mikkonen and Johan Goderberg, keep the tempo up with very melodic riffage. Just check out the opening riff on \"For the stabwounds in our back\" to see what I mean. The Bass playing like in most death metal is barley even noticed. The thing that most impressed me about Amon Amarth was Johan Hegg, his screechy Viking yell impressed me very much, and his guttural death metal growl added variety to the mix.\n\nThis album had two noticeably terrific epic songs, \"...And soon the world will cease to be\" and \"Thousand years of oppression\". Both of which are terrific, but the slow build up and spoken word intro to \"Thousand years of oppression\" makes that song more enjoyable. With great guitar leads and lyrics it is by far the best soon on the CD.\n\nWell all in all, Amon Amarth brings to the table possibly the greatest Melodic Death album ever. Great leads, vocals and lyrics. Best tracks: Thousand Years of Oppression, Death in Fire, For the Stabwounds in our Backs, and (the triumphant war march song) Versus the World.\n",
        "\nIn today's death metal scene, consistency is an attribute sadly lacking - the only consistent bands, by and large, are those that start shitty and continue to be shitty for a long while after. It seems that most bands simply run out of ideas and disintegrate into a mass of pussified \"melodic\" riffs, mediocre vocals, and synthesized retardation. But there are still gems for the discerning death metal listenter - such as Amon Amarth.\n\nThe thing that makes this band great is that they took one over-arching idea blending Stockholm brutality and Gothenburg melody with an unhealthy dose of vicious Viking attitude - and then, get this, plugged a bunch of different riffs into it. This album, their second, runs a bit more melodic than their first full-length effort, but maintains a firm dedication to all that is loud, drunken, violent, and Norse.\n\nThe opening track, \"Bleed For Ancient Gods,\" is one of Amon Amarth's best songs, dynamic and up-tempo with skilled drumming and a high riff-count. The second chorus at 2:46 is perhaps the defining moment of this album - kicked off with a snarling \"War to us is holy!\" and then leading into the throat-ripping \"Sacrifice! Sacrifice! Sacrifice our blood for ancient gods!\" vocal tradeoff. The final \"Waaaaaaaaaarrrr! And then we kill!\" growl is quite fun too.\n\nAnother high point is closer \"Legend of A Banished Man,\" with a grim bass intro that conveys the image of waves swelling in the ocean - and then the main riff comes up, the \"dragon ship even more feared than the nail-ship Naglfar.\" \"Legend\" is a vicious mid-tempo bruiser featuring another of the most memorable lines in Amon Amarth's catalog - \"Run for your lives! Death has arrived!\" The epic, march-drum instrumental bit at 4:30 puts not just a cap on the album, but a steel helmet spotted with blood and dented from a mighty axe-blow.\n\nIn between these two highlights are five solid, solid tunes. \"God, His Son And Holy Whore\" is particularly worthy of notice, a churning bit of anti-Christian rage that easily qualifies for the \"KVLT-as-fuck\" category. And the title track is an epic of revenge, which drags a bit in the beginning but begins to really fucking SLAY around the four-minute mark. The closing solo is great, Johan Hegg's screams of \"DIE!\" around 4:30 show some of his full potential as one of the best growlers in death; he really starts to shine on The Crusher.\n\nBut that's another review. For now, here is a short, hard-hitting, death metal opus that works well as drinking music, moshing music, raping music, pillaging music, slaying-cowardly-men-of-Christ music, or really just about anything that invokes the spirit of drunken, hairy Norse pirates. You provide the beer and weaponry, and The Avenger will provide the favor of Odin.\n",
        "\nAmon Amarth is in a world of its own. The band continually puts out solid Viking/death metal albums, and Versus The World is no exception. When I first heard the opening bars of \"Death In Fire,\" I knew I was an Amon Amarth fan. The hypnotic, brutal 'wall of sound' style riffing, accentuated with thumping double kick drumming and some very haunting and well played lead work gives you the backbone of Amon Amarth. Add to that Johan Hegg's gutteral Viking growling, and you have yourself a very nice recipe for some kick-ass metal.\n\nFirst off, the vocals. Johan Hegg is recognized as one of the metal world's best growlers, and he is in tip-top shape on this record. Throughout the album, he lays down some very harsh but controlled growling, which at first is damn near impossible to understand, but after listening to this album many times, you can certainly pick out basically everything he's singing about. As far as the lyrical content goes, it's typical AA fare, viking mythology and war, and so on. The music fits the growled lyrics perfectly, nothing seems out of place with respect to that.\n\nOn axes (not real axes, even though these guys are vikings!) we have Olavi Mikkonen and Johan S\u00f6derberg. The riffs these guys lay down are positively punishing from start to finish. Anywhere from slower, melodic style riffs (\"Silent Gods\") to full on thrashy stuff (\"Stabwounds\") all of it is viking goodness. If you've heard AA, you know the style of riffs these guys employ, and they are always headache enducing. If you're new to AA, I hope you've got some Aspirin handy because these riffs are brutal, and if you listen to this album really loud, you'll probably have a headache at the end. The riffing is hypnotic, even though it is still headbang worthy. The riffs just sort of beat you into submission.\n\nAs far as solo guitar goes, both axemen take shots at laying down some lead work. It is used fairly sparingly, but always fits in nicely with the song. Don't expect any Dave Murray speed-soloing... it's very controlled, melodic type stuff, nicely accentuating the riffs.\n\nOn the 4-string, we have Ted Lundstr\u00f6m. The bass is solid, making a nice meaty Viking base for the hypnotic death riffing. At various points in the album, you can hear the bass rumble on it's own and it always sounds great. Don't expect any Steve Harris bass work here (too many Maiden references!) but it's still nicely played.\n\nFinally, behind the kit, we've got the double kick madness of Fredrik Andersson. This guy pounds the shit out of his drumkit for the entire album. Full on double kick is used about 95% of the time, with some great mix up chops here and there (\"Death In Fire\") This is mostly just typical death drumming, ripping double kick with alot of snare mashing. When he does go off on an original beat, it is always very solid and sounds great, always matching the riffs well. All in all, the instruments are excellently played.\n\nAs far as the songs themselves... well, they all completely kick ass. There's no filler here, no songs you'll be tempted to skip, since they are all in the same vein, but all have something different to offer.\n\nThe only place where the album loses points is due to fairly shoddy production. While it is an improvement over their earlier records, it's still not the best (yes, I know 98% of death metal albums are produced like crap) but the axes fuzz out alot, making it sort of grating.\n\nMetalest moment on the record: 3:00 of \"Versus The World.\" I dare anyone not to break their neck while listening to the next minute or so of the song.\n\nChoice cuts: All of it. Remember to keep the aspirin handy. Grab your axe, put on your helmet, we're goin' pillaging! And this is the soundtrack.\n",
        "\nBehold, the first chapter of what many consider to be a band incapable of failure. Words can't really express how much I love this album. If I was not already a fan when I heard it, \"Sorrow...\" would have certainly made me one. I'll try something new for this review though; a track by track review from start to finish. I feel a recording of this caliber deserves nothing less than the most in-depth description. \n\nBefore I get to that, I'd like to make one statement. I often have problems with EPs containing more filler (Samples, speech from band members etc) than actual music. And when they do have actual music, there are usually at least two half-assed studio outtake cover songs with a very poor sound. Let us commend Amon Amarth for not only releasing an EP of wholly original (which I mean in the very literal sense of the word, they sound like no one else!) and what's more, absolutely awe-inspiring material. \n\nAnd now, on to the real review... \n\nThe first song, Sorrow Throughout The Nine Worlds is an instantly catchy, rifftastic tale of the wayward viking Baldur who speaks to Odin in his dreams (Don't hold me to that, my knowledge of norse muthology is a little flaky). It does exactly what the first track of any disc is supposed to do; set the tone for the rest of the album and get your attention. It does a fine job of that as it doesn't really let up until the last second. This particular song also happens to have one of the most lethal bridge riffs ever penned by this band. The post chorus 'solo' is also of note. \n\nOn to the next, The Arrival of The Fimbul Winter. This song continues in the fashion demonstrated by track 1; fast and furious, but takes you through an unexpected meandering melodic mid-paced interlude after about a minute of death/thrashy goodness. Then, it picks back up and slaps you around like any good Amon Amarth tune should. Not the greatest on the album, but very solid nonetheless. \n\nTrack 3, Burning Creation seems to be the real bruiser here. The song is fast paced and intensely melodic. This song seems to have laid the foundation for later tunes such as \"Friends of The Suncross\" and \"Bastards of a Lying Breed\". I love it. \n\nOk, here is where things REALLY start to get good. The Mighty Doors of The Speargod's Hall is without doubt one of my favorite songs on this release, perhaps even of all of them. It opens with some galloping horses and then a nice pounding drum intro courtesy of Nico. It then kicks it up a notch with an ascending tremolo picked verse riff, which then becomes a completely crushing bridge riff at which point you are thinking \"Can this possibly get any better?!\" The answer is a resounding YES. These guys know no limits. The chorus is simply the most emotive and well rendered piece of music ever to come from a melodic Death Metal band. It conjures images of hordes of Viking warriors traversing some frozen plain returning home victorious from battle. Simply GOD-LIKE. \n\nAnd, good lord.....Finally the crowning jewel of Amon Amarth's discography...UNDER THE GREYCLOUDED WINTER SKY. This just has to be heard to be believed. I just don't know what else to say. It's THAT good. \n\nIf I had one qualm with this album, it would be a very slightly muddy production courtesy of an inexperienced Peter Tagtgren. But I don't give two shits about that. When music is this good, that supercedes everything else. And that's really what it's all about at the end of the day, isn't it? \n\nBuy, download, steal, beat up your grandmother, rape, murder, pillage....Do whatever it takes to get your hands on this absolute masterpiece.\n",
        "\nThis album is definatly worth owning and also a great buy since its still the price of a single cd but comes as a two disc st including Amon Amarth's first two demos and mini cd/EP. So its nice to have in the collection, since it has Amon Amarths earliest and latest work all on one album.\n\nThe type of death metal that Amon Amarth does on this album seem to be quite popular among alot of death metal bands formed in the last 5 -7 years. (Arch Enemy for example do this to). Amon Amarth combine two styles of death metal on Versus The World. They combine the brutal american style of death metal, heavy and fast, with the more technical melodic european style of death metal. At times on this album Amarth is just plain brutal, and at other times they come close to being as Technical as Death. The combination works well, with a nice balance of sheer brutality for headbanging and technical skill with melodies and riffs for enjoyment. \n\nThe drums on this album are fast and brutal as hell, and the bass also adds alot of volume to this album. On the opening track the intro with the drums is so damn powerful, with alot of attitude. The vocals are coherant but brutal, the singer knows how to prolong his singing and make his voice real deep, its very enjoyable. The chorus's in these songs are great two, very well done and with alot of attitude, especially in the title track Versus The World. \n\nIf this cd were just the music, I would give it somewhere in the mid 90' range, but since it comes with all these extra features (the demos and ep), the actuay quality and value of this cd is great. No reason not to buy this album if you don't like death metal, even thrash and heavy metal fans may enjoy this if they are looking for a death metal band to get into. The only flaw this album has that I can think of is that there is no extreme high point in it, its all equally a good album, which also can be viewed as good, but I always like to have one moment that stands out in an album, or several. There are times when it comes very close though. Definatly buy.\n",
        "\nOnce Sent From The Golden Hall is of course Amon Amarth\u2019s first full-length, and what a debut it was. Combining aggressive Melodic Death Metal, a raw approach to the production, and Viking lyrical themes, Once Sent From The Golden Hall is a unique offering that is solid from beginning to end.\n\nEssentially, Amon Amarth\u2019s main driving force in their songs is the melodies. Taking influence from Swedish Melodic Death bands as well as some Black Metal bands, the melodic guitar sections are truly memorable. The guitar sound is very raw, almost sounding like a thick rusty chainsaw, and this gives a superb contrast to what the guitars are actually playing. Of course there is usually some heavy riffing giving some back ground oomph, but the melodic parts are definitely in the forefront. Meanwhile the rhythm section pounds away with excellent precision, with the bass having a similar raw sound and with the drummer varying the patterns on a consistent basis. A lot of the songs are structured intelligently, without ever repeating any particular section too often and the longer songs such as \u201cVictorious March\u201d are almost epic and progressive in nature. The vocals meanwhile are very gruff, being somewhere in between the deep Death Metal growls and the more high-pitched Black Metal style\u2026 the tones are varied often and they fit the harsh sound of the music very well. If you care to read along to the Viking and Norse lyrics the songs will take on a more epic approach as well. Why is that? Most of them tell a story of battle, revenge, or betrayal; all that good stuff but in the aforementioned Viking setting. Likewise, you\u2019ll hear the feel of the music change in conjunction with the mood of the lyrics, thus I highly recommend you read along to the lyrics when listening to this CD because it really enhances the experience and you get the full effect from these masterfully written songs. The style and tempos of the songs are also varied nicely, with some being more brutal, \u201cRide For Vengeance\u201d; some being more epic, \u201cVictorious March\u201d; and some being more mid-paced and atmospheric, \u201cAbandoned\u201d.\n\nThis CD is close to perfect, only some sections in a couple songs are weaker than the rest but this is still an excellent release that fans of this style should check out. Some of the melodies on here have been stuck in my head for a long time and I would go as far to say that this is one of the best combinations of brutality and melody\u2026 and the fact that it is all done in a Viking setting only helps add to that.\n\nSong Highlights: Ride For Vengeance, Without Fear, Victorious March, Friends Of The Suncross, Once Sent From The Golden Hall.\n",
        "\nAmon Amarth does one thing: melodic yet brutal Viking death metal. And they do it better than anyone else. I had only heard one song by them before this album, the epic \"Victorious March.\" After that I was hooked, eagerly jumping into this album blindfolded. I wasn't disappointed. \n\nThe Avenger is an album that inspires one to grow a beard and take up arms against the Christian oppressors like no other. The twin guitar assault is the spear of Odin thrust into your heart, Johan Hegg's growling vocals are the battlecry of a thousand frenzied berserkers, the relentless doublekick echoes with the thunderclap of Mjolnir.\n\nThere is not a single weak point over the course of the album's duration. It opens with \"Bleed for Ancient Gods,\" a thrashing, pounding, furious sweeping battle anthem that stomps on your throat and establishes the defining credo of Amon Amarth with the chorus line, \"war to us is holy.\" The second track, \"The Last with Pagan Blood,\" twists the boot pressing on your jugular and doesn't let you think for one second the battle is over. This is definitely the stand out track among an entire album of stand out tracks. \"...Pagan Blood\" also conjures up some of the album's most vibrant imagery, an element Amon Amarth is most definitely not in short supply of. \n\n\"North Sea Storm,\" takes the battle to sea, again inspiring glorious imagery of Norsemen struggling against formidable enemies. This song also features the album's best solo. The title track is next, imparting a somber tale of brutal Viking retribution highlighted by another brilliant solo. In \"God, His Son, and Holy Whore,\" probably the fastest song, the band's unconditional hatred of the Christian faith manifests more clearly than anywhere else. \"Metalwrath\" is a fun metal anthem, cleverly working the band's previous song titles into the lyrics. \"Legend of a Banished Man\" caps off the album with the story of an invincible Viking warlord's return. \"Run for your lives, death has arrived...\" By now, any non-metalheads you have subjected to Amon Amarth's special brand of warlike malice should be whinging in protest and praying for your soul.\n\nAll in all, The Avenger is the best Viking metal album ever put out. Each song is a well-constructed epic tale of Nordic folklore, accompanied most approriately by the all best elements of the melodic death metal genre. This is the album that should inspire artists to paint vast murals depicting proud Viking warriors dying gloriously on the field of battle, slaughtering the Christian dogs till their swords fall from their grasp, cursing their enemies with their last gasping breath. There is no other band that sounds like Amon Amarth, no other band that so clearly brings to mind such striking imagery.\n\nThe album\u2019s one fault would be only this: it's too short. The Avenger clocks in at just over 36 minutes with only seven songs. It's a brief listen, though an intense one from start to finish. But considering how often these masterful architects pump out consistently great material, it\u2019s an easily forgivable fault.\n"
