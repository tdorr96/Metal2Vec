        "\nIt's hard to figure out why Quorthon felt the need to release this one. The only reasonable explanation I can give is: to release the unreleased tracks. The material that is worth giving a listen to only make up to the number of five, three of which we already know from the superb Blood On Ice. The remaining are the two of five unreleased tracks, namely Satan My Master and Witchcraft while the other three are useless. You may come to like In Nomine Satanas, anyway. The rest is compiled out of Requiem and Octagon stuff plus a sampler-alike from Hammerheart.\n\nThere are compilations that are worth obtaining no matter you own the complete discography of the artist. It doesn't even matter that these compilations contain no new or unreleased versions. You play it and it hammers you down to the ground since all the titans are grouped there together. In Jubileum III, this is not the case. It might have been better if Quorthon filled this up with Jubileum-leftover tracks from the first four albums. What he produces here is nothing but highlighting the downfall of Bathory in time, observable through the Jubileum serie.\n\nJubileum Volume III leaves a rather bittersweet taste, perhaps saved by the unreleased tracks and those taken from Blood on Ice, but it is ruined by twenty bitter minutes of stuff from the insufferable Requiem/Octagon duo. Not sure if he really had to put these monstrosities. No more than a collector's item, for one can live without the unreleased tracks in Jubileum III that are most probably thought by Quorthon as the main assets of this compilation.\n\nDespite representing the seediest era of their low hours, it is the compilation I enjoy the most of the trilogy, especially for the new songs Satan My Master and Witchcraft. Their first fifteen years are represented in this trilogy with that male goat from the self-titled debut on the cover. Quorthon wrote a variety of excellent stuff during his 21-year career, from immortal masterpieces to hulking clunkers that would stain a hitherto brilliant catalogue, something that showed he was just a human.\n",
        "\nIn a genre plagued by excessive tremolo picking, overlong and under-structured songs, poor performances and unoriginal themes where relatively very few acts manage to get it right, Bathory somehow perfected black metal almost a decade before black metal was a widely used term. This record exists as proof that black metal was never closer to its peak than right at the time of its invention, circa 1981-1986. But, you've probably heard this a million times before from every reviewer and metal blogger/youtuber on the planet, so I'll explain why I hold this album at such an iconic position. Firstly, it has a perfect run of 8 classic tracks. The record is short, standing at about 23 minutes if you skip the wind intros and outros, but the concise execution of these songs results in a very focused, controlled outcome. The album as a whole consists of simple song structures that are done very well, without ever overusing riffs or relying on lazy instrumental sections. Speaking of which, virtually every riff is amazing. Hades features possibly the best black metal riff ever written, and the standard doesn't fall much throughout the record. \n\nWhile side B definitely sounds more primitive, the songs are still evil and demented for 1984. When Bathory isn't bursting out macabre, eerie hooks and melodies, they boast a more epic, empowering sound, such as on Sacrifice and Necromansy which are my two personal favourites. These tracks also prove something about this record that defies the majority of black metal; the choruses are genuinely catchy and are supported by coherent motifs that, while extremely distorted, are exceptional. The vocals are something of an anomaly; Quorthon isn't spouting a low bark like his primary influence Cronos, or Tom G. Warrior, and he doesn't shriek like the second wave Norwegian bands. Instead, his vocals consist of a high-pitched growl that hasn't really ever been replicated, at least accurately. While his vocals are quite low in the mix, I think this matches the low-fi and spaced out atmosphere. On the topic of production, Bathory of course has a very raw sound, but not in a compressed or irritating way. If anything, every instrument has plenty of room, and the overdose of reverb and treble really does add to the dungeon-like aesthetic that makes this record so addictive. \n\nThe lead guitars are phenomenal, and the fact that Quorthon's performance is this staggeringly precise only foreshadows his excellence in songwriting on future releases. Each solo is a perfect mix of melodic and chaotic, with elements clearly influenced by NWOBHM bands as well as of course less controlled lead guitars by bands such as Venom and possibly Slayer. As for the drums, they are pretty standard, but it's clear that Quorthon was the main composer behind all of Bathory's material, and the other members just followed the guitars, which is exemplified by the lack of drum fills and overall univocal instrumentation. Bathory started their discography with a blueprint for thousands of bands to follow. This record's influence is inconceivable, and with good reason. The entire listen is infectious and impactful, possessing you into a 23 minute state of sonic euphoria. Bathory might not be the best album ever released, but it comes damn close.\n",
        "\nOh my god here comes another review full of ass eating to an indispensable album of the genre that has been praised all over the world.\n\nWell, did you know that Quorthon hated this album? Well maybe hating it is saying too much (although there were rumours that he did) but what it seems to be true is that he never listened to it again after it was released, when he was told that this album was perfect he replied that there was no such thing, he had this vision that each album represents a period of his life in which he was in, so he didn't find it very useful to listen to his old albums again. And it is true that each album represents a specific intention of the artist at the time, and this UTSOTBM represents what seems to me a unique moment in Bathory's approach to the songs, although still present in some part the feeling of the first two albums of showing an evil facet through fast and chaotic music, the third great work of Bathory shows a much more atmospheric but above all terrifying facet.\n\nThis is not only palpable in \"Nocternal Obeisance\" or in the intro of \"Call from the Grave\" where the sound of these is very low compared to the rest of the mix to cause a greater impact when the instruments come into action but we can find it in practically segments of it in ALL the songs, the intro of \"Equimanthorn\" starts with an electronic sound from which begins a riff in the form of a build up that reminds us of an accelerated version of the \"Jaws\" theme because of the way it hits so precisely. \"Chariots of Fire\" and \"13 Candles\" also have this disturbing start marked by an electronic tonality and with disturbing whispers in the case of the last one mentioned, and \"Of Doom...\" uses again the sudden instrumental beginning.Even the arguably fiercest song on the album \"Massacre\" has a distant ambient sound at 2:12. All this is far from being a coincidence and is more a unique peculiarity of this album in relation to the rest of Bathory's discography. If one takes this into consideration, the perception of some songs may change, \"Enter the Eternal Fire\" has always been seen as the first Bathory song to get into the realm of \"epicness\" but, although it shares elements that would later be developed in the later viking era of the band, to this day I perceive it more as a much slower and atmospheric focused song, that seeks to reinforce that terrifying subtext with heavy riffs, a remarkable sound of bells, and above all, by a heartbreaking vocal performance in the final segment where Quorthon really manages to transmit the agony and pain of the one succumbed by the eternal flames, an aspect truly more terrifying than epic in my eyes, there is no glory, only pain.\n\nAll these aspects that are carried throughout the album are the results of a much more mature and refined songwriting process, full of songs that move through the depth of their riffs that advance inexorably through our ears, with subtle but pronounced rhythm changes that increase the dynamism of each track in an exceptional way, as I write these words listening to the album I can't help but be fascinated by the profundity of each song in which I am unable not to repeat at least a couple of times before moving on to the next one. I know that both the debut album and the following one have their unconditional legion of fans who prefer it to this one, but to me these first two albums have a much less ambitious approach and often fall into a homogeneous structure throughout the whole listening, UTSOTBM is far from having this problem, each track has its own memorable aspects even though most of the songs have very similar compositions, it is here where Quorthon shows a lot of his ability as a songwriter, a facet that he polished with time as all geniuses do. \n\nAnd that's why it saddens me so much that this was the last album of the band with pure black metal essence, probably Quorthon felt that he had no more to offer with this style or he had no more interest in it, from here on Bathory's style was drifting between thrash and viking metal, this kind of sound was left without the possibility of being revived by a much more experienced Quorthon years later. Even so this album is clearly one of the highest peaks of the first wave of black metal, it is worth remembering from time to time how powerful its atmosphere, its riffs, the terror it infuses, and above all, the influence it had and still has and how nobody has managed to replicate it yet, some bands like Inquisition have managed to get very close to the sound of the first two albums, but 35 years later my ears have not yet come across any work that comes close to the unique points this one reaches. Unbeatable.\n",
        "\nWhen it comes to a band looking to welcome their old and not-so-old fans, the willingness to record new material and catch up on the scene can be a difficult task, especially if you aren't sure what direction your music is going to take. Quorthon returns to the studios after a five-year break, so he records Destroyer of Worlds, an irregular album with no defined identity or a rather ambiguous one that can leave an uncomfortable flavor on the listener. Will it offer new music in the vein of Blood On Ice or Hammerheart? That's apparently illusory, especially once you play and listen to Lake of Fire, a deceptive opener that actually has a memorable solo and will captivate many illusions to many who are looking forward to a deserving successor to Twilight of the Gods. Certainly, that song would fit nicely into the 1991 album, and as you progress, you realize that things aren't going quite right but still illusioned that everything will get better around the halfway point of this.\n\nMusically, there's a interesting mix of cuts: viking metal, groove metal, death 'n' roll and even bluesy sections. The vocal performances are also varied, too many for a single album, like the calmer vocal lines in Lake of Fire, Ode, Pestilence (the true one that lasts 06:50), Sudden Death, Day of Wrath; and blacker vocals on the title track and White Bones. This album had everything to win, but the weak production detracts from anyone who is open-minded and is willing to pay attention to the many facets of this record. When we see that the album is -supposedly- sequentially grouped into three groups, not even the first one manages to capture the attention since the title track, Ode and Pestilence try to emulate the viking era yet Lake of Fire does it forcefully. Honestly many of us asked for more Lake of Fires on here. There I realize that I'm really generous and partial, and many may disagree, but it's for the simple fact that I learned to like those four songs, as well as the last 8+ minute closers.\n\nI fully agree with Thunderwarrior91, there are three expendable fillers like \"109\", a headless flattened track that seems to come from a lost Sodom tape, one that Tom Angelripper wouldn't even bother to retrieve; then there's \"Bleeding\" (the true one that lasts 3:55) which seems to start out well but then deflates with that three-riff death 'n' groove crap, ridiculous to say the least; and finally \"Kill Kill Kill\", where Quorthon's voice looks unrecognizable in this faceless, suspicious Octagon remanent that wastes away such a song title. Indeed there are more irregular songs, but after naming those three lousy ones, at least others are tolerable: \"Krom\" is a nice and fun Motorhead-esque track while \"Death From Above\", \"Sudden Death\" and \"Liberty & Justice\" are nice groove/thrash shits decently executed by Bathory standards. The middle part of the album is ain't half bad, but it would flow well without the fillers.\n\nIn fact we find details that will disappoint anybody, like the autopilot drums in the title track; the opener presenting itself as the only really solid songwriting with the best solo on the album; the incredible amount of thrash, death 'n' groove tracks in the middle part that often seem to have no direction; the lifeless acoustic sections without the crystalline sound, far from having the magic of pieces like The Ravens or Man of Iron; and finally, the desperate attempt to end up the album with two epics that fail to remove the bad taste in mouth as they're far from being a sort of magnum opus. Many dispense with this album but I think it deserves a little more esteem as it is better than the Requiem/Octagon pair. What happened to me the first time I listened to this album is that it left me confused. You shouldn't listen to this if you still don't know Bathory because this is a clearly self-tribute or reference to the post-Hammerheart era with a much lower level, almost the entire album is average and the flow of songs can turn into a maddeningly inconsistent experience.\n",
        "\nPerhaps to analyze a scene like viking metal is a difficult aspect, as many don't consider it an independent genre and it's rather considered the bastard child of black metal and folk metal. Even within the Bathory catalog, both Nordlands differ from their/his early viking era and their elements are distant from what Bathory did musically at this point. A perceived detail at first glance is the inclusion of unorthodox instruments (which aren't prominent and rather ornament or function in the background) and the preference for higher speed and stridency instead of the doom/power orientation of the Hammerheart-Twilight era. The first chapter of Nordland marks the first solid offering in almost a decade, if we consider Blood On Ice a mere rescued old material that was re-released at the moment finally had to come to light. Fortunately, the guitar's tone acquires more force and Quorthon gets serious here, he ceases to be the unpolished Bathory that meandered in Blood On Ice and roamed through no-man's-land in Requiem and Octagon. Gone are those jovial releases that characterized the turbulent period of the 90s.\n\nPrelude, which could well be the soundtrack of some epic film, gives way to the title track whose tribal choruses serve as a prelude to the wildest, most frenetic ride accompanied by both frenetic drums at the beginning -and safer in the rest of the song- and riffs that pierce your eardrum in order to transport you to some frozen place in the land of the north and then, the mid-paced takes center stage for a safe but effective trip. The strange thing is it lacks a solo, but that doesn't take away from the charisma as long as you can headbang to the beat of the \u201cNordland\u201d chorus along with those tribal backing vocals. This is probably a recurring technique, to start with an apparent hint of violence and then going slow and steady, and while guitars and drums sound heavy, the voice is nonetheless calm and serene with no reaching guttural tones. Songs can be simple but effective, Quorthon is simply a solid composer who makes long songs not seem repetitive, so you get hooked at and manage to ignore that the song really lasts 9-10 minutes despite its simplicity.\n\nAfter that rhythmic offering, Vinterblot and Dragon's Breath focus more on folk/doom melodies, although Vinterblot picks up more the true epic, folkloric, nordic feeling reaching its climax with those tribal choruses and the subsequent melodic guitar that draws the mysticism of those bells in the background. The really good stuff comes with Ring of Gold, which sounds serene, captivating, motivating and with cleaner production, definitely one of the best acoustic tracks and one of the most glorious vocal performances from the one-man band. The album's production is polished, heavy (for both raucous and acoustic offerings) and like a true viking metal album, it's perfectly set with those majestic tribal voices that seem to come from the skies along with those natural ambient effects and the right rhythm/melody combination that pay tribute to nature and gods of Norse mythology. Forever Darkwoods is another giant very similar to the title track, although this one does manage to reach a more fixed course with a notable ending that breaks any scheme heard up at this point.\n\nWhen it comes to a homogeneous but versatile album at the same time, it's difficult to detail each song as some really obey predictable patterns while others barely manage to break some kind of scheme here and there. Vocals, guitar layers and production are the strengths that in turn reinforce the writing. This can be divided into several groups: monsters with convincing, frenzied, surprising hooks (Nordland, Foreverdark Woods, Broken Sword, Great Hall Awaits a Fallen Brother); emotional, unorthodox bridge tracks that would serve as soundtracks to a movie about vikings (Prelude, Ring of Gold, Heimfard); proto-doom tracks reminiscent of their mid-early period (Vinterblot, Dragon's Breath, Mother Earth Father Thunder). Some will be skeptical and half-hearted of this, but for us who love this band this is truly a surprise and a return to form. I always considered his discography impeccable, obviously without including Octagon and Requiem where Quorthon ventured into his solo days, in addition, he had made it clear that Twilight of the Gods would be the last chapter of his project. This record offers polished, visceral, dirty production, but also clean/crystalline ones whenever the song requires it, such as the acoustic cuts/sections. There may even be an imbalance between one song and the other, so it's advisable to listen from beginning to end as it's more than the sum of its parts.\n",
        "\nBathory of the 80s obviously received a cult status in the black metal circles. Each album of that period is praised, but \"The Return\" gets less worship than the others. Anyway, the album has strong sides. The debut of Bathory overall was like Venom and Mot\u00f6rhead on steroids. It was rawer, it had screaming and in meanwhile it was the first full-length of Bathory, thus there's no surprise in its historical importance. It was the great original, while \"The Return\" was billed as its follow-up. Yet there're noticeable differences between these albums.\n\nBathory became harsher on \"The Return\". The sound of the band was metalized. The album features elements, which would become common for black metal not only in sound, concept and vocals, but in songwriting. There would be more of these elements on \"Under the Sign of the Black Mark\", so that many would call it the first \"true\" black metal album of Bathory and thus in general. So, \"The Return\" is placed between the two albums, which are more important historically. It is a transmission between the two styles of the band. All this fact puts the opus in the shadow of its neighbors.\n\nHowever, \"The Return\" has some achievements too. Some call it the most sinister album of its time and that's fair enough. The debut of Bathory was majorly a piece of speed metal and it was punkish as hell. \"The Return\" has a thrash metal fundament. The debut was filled with rolling vibes, while \"The Return\" doesn't have that much of such stuff. \"The Return\" strikes with its evil nature. \"The Return\" features some full-loaded black metal tremolo-riffs. Also, the vocals are more extreme on it, as Quorthon's screaming became raspier and more abrasive.\n\n\"The Return\" is mostly mid-paced, but it sounds vigorous and slows down not often. The music is straightforward, simple and damn catchy. Early in the tracklist there's a one of the most powerful things, \"Born for Burning\", thus the album obsesses a listener quickly enough. Sometimes the music becomes quite grinding. The likes of \"The Wind of Mayhem\", \"Possessed\" and \"Sadist\" have a lot of wall-of-sound type of riffing. Such stuff makes Bathory sound like a complete black metal among many other artists of the 80s, which were pretty thrashy.\n\nThere're some rolling episodes, which are more common for the debut album. The likes of \"Bestial Lust\" and \"The Return of the Darkness and Evil\" sound that way. Yet, overall, the album attracts with the straightforward aggression, with the dark atmosphere. \"The Return\" was the most sinister work of its time, but it remains convincingly evil even today. That's not just a follow-up of the debut album, it's the progression of Bathory on its unholy path to the absolute extreme. \"The Return\" is an important part in the fundament of black metal. It's also a highly memorable work.\n",
        "\nIn 1982, Venom released their magnum opus \"Black Metal\", where they would coin the term black metal. At that point, though, black metal was used more for a thematic definition, so any album that had themes of Satanism and the occult would be classified as such. As for the musicality, Venom's \"Black Metal\" was still mainly thrash/speed metal, and sounded a lot like Mot\u00f6rhead. Regardless, Venom was considered the best black metal band you could listen to, and that no one would top them in their extremes. That is, until a certain band from Sweden came into the picture...\n\nThat's right, folks, if Venom wasn't the pioneer for the black metal sound, then Bathory's eponymous debut definitely pioneered it. Now while I may not be the first to acknowledge that, the self-titled album was revolutionary in many ways. Everything from the production, the riffs, the vocals, and even the lyrical themes were much more darker and rawer than anything Venom could've dreamed of. With all due respect to Venom, it wasn't them that started black metal. It was Bathory.\n\nBut enough of me rambling about Venom and Bathory. Let's get straight into the album itself. Right off the bat, you can tell this record is gonna be different from all the other records in 1984 from the first track \"Storm of Damnation\". The soft sounds of the winds and the subtle sound of bells and thunder create an atmosphere of darkness and mystery, a theme that would be present a lot in this album. We then move on to the next track \"Hades\", and things take on an even darker turn. One of the first things you'll notice is the production. \"Bathory\" used some raw and unfiltered production, so the guitars sound very distorted and quiet in the mix. The drums also have a thin sound in them, and their constant beating takes up much of the mix. The bass is pretty much nonexistent, as it's largely buried in the mix. This all sounds like a recipe for disaster, but its execution makes it all sound great. The noisy riffs sound fitting to the fast composition, and the chaotic drumming only enhances the raging atmosphere. The more technical riffs that play in the middle of the track even adds in a more powerful feeling in the tone. Despite clocking in at less than 3 minutes, \"Hades\" still packs a punch, and the same can be said to just about every track in this album. \"Bathory\" would use its raw production as an advantage, and it makes the instruments sound more darker than anything else at the time.\n\nBut what about the vocals? How are they gonna sound in this mix? Well let me introduce you to Quorthon, who's here to show off some terrifying vocals. His shouts are contained with shrieks and grunts, and he even growls at certain portions of the songs. One of the stronger examples of this would be in the track \"Raise the Dead\". The track's more doomful and gloomy composition gives the vocals more power, as Quorthon sounds more anxious and irate. His emphasis on some lines like \"Raise the Dead!\" also makes it sound more urgent, as he sounds like he's calling for his troops to bring back the dead. Unlike Cronos, who used more chants, Quorthon's screaming would be a game-changer in the new black metal sound.\n\nAnd then there's the lyrics. Venom's lyrics were dark, but Bathory would take the dark themes to a whole new level. A great example of this would be in the track \"Armageddon\", where this verse quotes:\n\nI swear the oath of blood\nAnd tear the virgin's flesh\nI gash the wounds of heaven\nAnd rides the wings of death\n\nThis verse talks about Quorthon swearing an oath of blood, presumably raping someone, and then riding to heaven to create some destruction. The descriptions of this verse sound more brutal and extreme than anything else at the time, and its wording makes it sound less angsty and more evil. Furthermore, the instrumentals and vocals would further execute these lyrics. This specific track goes for a slower, yet chaotic tone, and Quorthon's vocals sound more agonizing and terrorized. This gives the tone of the lyrics a more wicked tone, and makes the actions done feel even worse. The lyrics are written brilliantly, and the execution in the tracks makes it all sound ludicrous.\n\nSo yeah, what else can be said about this album besides being a game-changer? The instrumentals and production are more raw and chaotic, the vocals are more grueling and aggressive, and the lyrics are given more darker descriptions. Bathory would go on to release two more black metal albums named \"The Return......\" and \"Under the Sign of the Black Mark\", the former being more darker and the latter being more atmospheric. Even though Bathory later dropped the black metal style to create a new genre named viking metal, there is no doubt that Quorthon had revolutionized the black metal sound. Even if you prefer Bathory's later works, I still heavily recommend you give this historic album a listen.\n",
        "\nIf you're in the extreme metal scene, Bathory should be a familiar name to you. Quorthon has been a highly influential artist in the metal scene from day one, with his first three albums being one of the first to morph the raw and crazed black metal sound we know today. Starting with \"Blood Fire Death\", however, Quorthon would begin to experiment with some viking themes that would eventually morph into a new subgenre called viking metal, and his decision to go all the way with this then-new genre was very controversial at the time, since that would mean we won't hear the roaring shouts in \"Equimanthorn\" or the dark and gloomy atmosphere of \"The Return...\" ever again.\n\nThis leads us to 1996, where Quorthon decides to release a new album titled \"Blood on Ice\". The album's history dates back to 1989, where it was first recorded and was intended to be the original \"Blood Fire Death\". However, Quorthon never got to finish the recording until years later, and about 40% of the original recording would eventually make it into the final product. This release was also more of a breath of fresh air, since Bathory was experimenting with a thrash metal sound with \"Requiem\" and \"Octagon\", both of which were met with mixed and negative reviews from critics and especially fans. Because of this, \"Blood of Ice\" is considered a black sheep among the viking metal Bathory albums and, along with \"Destroyer of Worlds\", is considered by many to be one of the weaker albums in Bathory's diverse discography. Well I'd argue otherwise. While not as good as \"Hammerheart\" or \"Twilight of the Gods\", \"Blood on Ice\" still remains an excellent album.\n\nOne strong highlight of the album is the instruments. Bathory's instrumentals have mostly been excellent, and BOI is no exception. The guitars play these really powerful riffs that bring in an atmosphere of grandness and pride. The drums also mainly beat in slow, but precise patterns, and they sound great with its mighty sound. The bass is also a lot more audible than in the previous albums, and it is good at providing a foundation for the tracks. One great example of this would be the title track \"Blood on Ice\", where it has a heavy emphasis on the grandness of the atmosphere, and it is very fitting to the lyrics of a village being burned down. Other tracks that have excellent instruments would be in \"The Sword\", \"The Lake\", and \"Gods of Thunder of Wind and of Rain\". The instrumentals on this album are amazing, and they execute the vast and epic atmosphere just as good as most other Bathory albums.\n\nThe vocals are also good. Quorthon's vocals have always been versatile, ranging from the brutal shrieks from his black metal days to the more melodic singing in his viking metal days, and BOI in particular follows the latter. Quorthon's singing sounds great, and his prideful personality gives the vocals a more powerful and striking tone. One of the strongest vocal moments on this album would be in \"The Woodwoman\". Quorthon mixes in some chants along with the singing, and they mix perfectly with the track's more slow and immersive instruments. Quorthon also puts in a lot of emotion in this particular track, so his story about the woodwoman seem genuine. \"The Stallion\" and \"The Revenge of the Blood on Ice\" also have some strong vocals. The vocals may have some flaws in it, but they are still great.\n\nBut while the instruments and lyrics are great, the album's strongest element would be in the lyrics. \"Blood on Ice\" is a concept album about a boy being the only survivor of a brutal village raid, and he lives in a forest for 15 years before an one-eyed old man trains him to fulfill his destiny. Each track is an essential part of the story, and no track feels like filler at all. Not only that, but the lyrics themselves are also great. For example, in \"The Lake\", this verse quotes:\n\nThe one eyed old man told me that the face that I will see\nHas paralysed a thousand brave men sure of victory\nI cannot fight blindfolded and I'd freeze if I should see.\nSo I need to sacrifice my eyes to see all from within.\n\nThis verse is about the one-eyed old man telling the boy that the only way to see a certain face is if he \"sacrifices his eyes\". It sounds crazy, but later on in the story, we see that by throwing his eyes at the lake, his vision is greatly improved, and therefore, he will be able to see what he needs to see. There are a lot of these twists where you think it's gonna be bad, but it turns out to be better, and the execution is fantastic. So while there are a couple of aspects of the story that need some work, especially the lyrics to \"Man of Iron\", they're still excellent.\n\nSo with all of these reasons, it's easy to see why \"Blood on Ice\" is a fantastic album. The instrumentals sound epic and vast, the vocals are very melodic and flow well to the instruments, and the story about the boy finding his true destiny remains one of the greatest stories ever told in Bathory's discography. It's kinda a shame to see this album be pushed aside as a mediocre viking metal album, because it has a lot going for. If you want to hear a viking metal album that has some fantastic storytelling, \"Blood on Ice\" is an album I'd highly recommend.\n",
        "\nQuorthon died much too soon, no doubt about it, but his musical talent died even earlier. I don\u2019t want to be cynical, nevertheless, all albums after \u201cBlood Fire Death\u201d were a disappointment from my point of view. \u201cRequiem\u201d, equipped with a booklet whose print cost less than three cents, bleeds from many wounds. It seems to be created without any dedication, everything sounds cheap and sloppy. How much time took the recording of the 33 minutes long album? 35 minutes? Perhaps even this assumption is already too generous.\n\n\u201cRequiem\u201d features bulldozering yet clunky thrash with a more or less nerve-shattering production. Quorthon\u2019s voice sounds as raw and as sick as possible. We can be happy that the music does not trigger any emotions, because this vocal performance would kill them in a matter of seconds. Great riffs are conspicuous by their absence. Quorthon strangles the guitar violently and knows no mercy, but everything is done without rhyme or reason. The songs do not lack aggression, yet it is an ineffective aggression. Imagine a struggling child who is not able to hurt the asshole that stole its lolly and you probably get an idea about the kind of \u201cbrutality\u201d that Quorthon dishes up here.\n\nThe guitar sound is as awkward as it was on the second Bathory album, but back then it was somehow funny to listen to such an amateurish sound. Now it\u2019s just a painful experience. Not to mention the robotic drums that offer exclusively primitive rhythms. In view of this disaster, it is almost surprising that the bass is audible \u2013 it would be too much to say that the entire production sucks, but it also does not deserve any praise.\n\nGuys who want to know the number of good songs on \u201cRequiem\u201d must be kidding. All tracks pass by without any remarkable cool idea or memorable riff. Perhaps one can mention the closer in this context, because \u201cApocalypse\u201d surprises with a relatively coherent riff, but Quorthon has put the focus \u2013 almost in conformity with one of his classics \u2013 on total self-destruction and so it\u2019s just logical that the song\u2019s chorus is more or less going nowhere. Summing up, if you want to listen to a proper dose of angry noise, check this album. If you are not interested in brainless rubbish with sporadically occurring acceptable moments, stay away from \u201cRequiem\u201d. It lacks integrity, credibility and good music.\n",
        "\nI'm not really all that big on Bathory's first three albums, I prefer albums like Twilight of the Gods and Requiem. This album is kind of the reason why. It's good, the songs are fucking awesome, but the playing is pretty off for the most part.\n\nThe biggest and only issue I have with this is the drumming. When playing, (mainly skank beats) he doesn't manage to stay on time with the guitars, either falling half a beat below it or above it, and it REALLY stands out. Sometimes I wonder if my brain just isn't following the pattern fast enough, but by the time a last measure comes on, it gets even more fucked than it already is. As a drummer, this annoys me. You don't even need to be a drummer to be bothered by this, but reguardless; as a drummer, I'm not really liking this aspect at all. Lots of people really like the sloppy, off-time, edged playing on older albums, as it illuminates the raw and evil energy even more than before, which I absolutely understand and get completely. This isnt the album for that though. Sloppiness shouldn't belong here. I like rough playing when done correctly, but on this album the unpolished playing really ruins the potential and overall greatness of the songs. It would work so much better on the debut Bathory album, or any other albums that sound like that one, because it just naturally has a rough sound, and the un-perfect drumming would suit that album's aesthetic better. The Return...... has a far more refined sound in comparison to the debut, so on this album it does not fit at all. These songs really are super badass, evil, and will make you headbang, air drum, and air guitar while you listen. It might not be a GIANT bother, but the overall performance is simply jagged. I would fully enjoy this album if it wasn't so damn sloppy. The song \"Son of Damned\" is executed beautifully. It already has that sweet guitar sound with the charisma, but ALSO, the drumming is actually on time! No sloppy skank beats. Now THIS is how the whole album should sound. Few tracks are on time but most tracks are off time. Why couldn't they all be like Son of Damned? Oh well.\n\nThe guitars have a nice sound, and the fast speed riffing really compliments it well. The drum sound is nice as well and goes great with the sound of the guitar. All the tracks are awesomely composed with raw energy and nasty shrieking evil vocals to compliment and top it all off. I love these songs, BUT, they would be PERFECT if the drumming was on time and actually followed the same tempo as the guitar. This avoidable problem can be fixed in such LITTLE ways, yet it's a big issue.\n\nI really hope I dont get murdered by old school fans by saying that I wish the playing was perfect, but that's how I feel. Don't care about it being purposely unperfect and \"That's the reason why it's so good\", if every song was executed just as good as Son of Damned was, I'd have no problem at all. My issue would be nonexistent.\n\nSometimes the guitar can get a little reckless, but the drumming dominates it and keeps all the flaw on him rather than noticing the guitar messing up. The more that I listen to this, the more it grows on me and I start to care slightly less about the sloppy drumming, but even then; the presence of it stays.\n\nI understand that this is a 80's classic old school 1st wave black metal album with speed influence, but the sloppy performance that's mainly displayed by the drummer needs to be gone with. Trust me, I get it. \"The sloppy playing is what makes it good, it's special old school material.\" Yes, I'm aware and I agree with that, but not on this album. I would rate this higher if the drums were on time, simple as that. I do like this album, it's catchy and fucking badass, my only problem is that the drummer lacks the ability to stay on tempo a lot here.\n\nAwesome songs, sloppy and off-time drumming (for the most part).\n",
        "\nQuorthon's last opus contains elements accumulated from all those years of experience and all those masterful works, although evidently less from the first 3 and more from the latter works (besides Octagon/Requiem). It is easily labeled as Viking metal (if you use that label) together with his previous works that pioneered Viking themed metal. The music itself is mostly midpaced heavy metal with a large tendency to repeat 'massive' feeling riffs and establish and epic atmosphere. There are touches of doom, thrash, and Bathory's style of proto black metal.\n\nLike the previous Nordland, it begins with a very competently made intro that sets the mood, immediately transitioning to the grand intro of Blooded Shore, which goes from a simple power chord progression with a choir into an epic midpaced folky melody, before the signature Quorthon singing/shouting begins. The song remains on a constant upwards flowing melody, and could act as an post-intro intro to the rest. It feels like a grandiose announcement or opening, and flows into the next song with some ambiance and sea-sounds. The next track continues in the same midpaced fashion, but with a less grandiose feel. These songs don't exactly have a lot of variation within them (as does most of the album) but they are extremely good at establishing precisely the right atmosphere that I think Quorthon was going for, and all work together for the same goal.\n\nVinlandcontinues in the fashion of Blooded Shore in being more 'epic', but it only acts as a preparation for the first highlight of the album - The Land, which is easily one of the best Bathory tracks, from lyrics to the catchy intro melody and the massive riff afterwards. Speaking of massive - the guitar tone on this album, similarly to the previous Nordland, is fucking great. Extremely fitting for the atmosphere and adds to the impact of the simple but extremely well crafted riffs. The next track is significantly faster than anything before, and is placed in a very good spot for it, right after the conclusion of the first half with the strongest track so far. It draws inspiration from Quorthon's thrash/black releases, and is very good at that, before going into a slow acoustic part.\n\nThe following two tracks continue with the thrashier more aggressive feel, before the colossal track that is The Wheel of Sun. Although unplanned, this track is the perfect conclusion to Bathory's Viking era albums. Quorthon is a master of making extremely simple riffs feel significant and impactful, and making tracks over 10 minutes that have zero progressive noodling and other similar horseshit simply flow smoothly. \n\nDespite fusing so much, this album never feels inconsistent or messy, everything makes sense. Every track belongs here and contributes to the feel of the album. Most songs lean on a couple very powerful high impact riffs as well as choirs that create the glorious mood Quorthon's works are known for. Bathory continues to be by far the best Viking themed metal band, avoiding all the goofy bullshit that is associated with the genre.\n\nIt always makes me wonder what could have been.\n",
        "\nNowadays, pretty much all the pre-viking Bathory material is regarded as one of the main source and inspiration for the emerging black metal style of the 90s. However, back in the 80s, these albums were considered more or less thrash or speed metal. We could say that the self-titled record was a raw and primitive worship of Mot\u00f6head and that the \"The Return...\" is what Venom had done but pushed to the extreme. Both of these nonetheless achieved cult status and are both masterpieces, but this album reviewed here is a step further where Quorthon put his own non-metal influence into the music and began to create epic pieces that would later become his trademark in the viking metal records. The year 1986 was probably one of the hardest when it comes to the history of Bathory. Indeed, the album recording was delayed for quite a while due to not being able to find suitable members to put up the right line-up. Quorthon tried numerous times to get in touch with some drummers for instance, Artillery and Sodom's \"Witchhunter\" who even jammed with them for a plan of a US tour with Celtic Frost and Destruction. Since these ideas came to nothing, it would be the last time that Quorthon ever considered playing live with Bathory. The \"Under the Sign of the Black Mark\" album was finally released in May 1987.\n\nThe material featured on this album is more varied than one could think for a first time listen compared to the previous ones despite its brutal kick-off after the intro \"Nocternal Obeisance\". The first musical track, titled \"Massacre\" is one hell of a fast track with no fucks given. It's basically the sort of track that doesn't give a moment of breathing because of its incredible speed and this is obviously awesome. You also get to hear the harsh vocals of Quorthon at its peak on this particular record since afterwards it would start getting a little cleaner. The second track is where the general atmosphere of the album is displayed with \"Woman of Dark Desires\". This track is the first Bathory song that we can hear keyboards being used and It really enhance the evil feeling on this record. This song being about the countess was wrote because fans were asking what was the Bathory name about, thus Quorthon composing this one as a result in homage.\n\nOf course, this album made history of extreme metal for some reasons right? Well, just taking a listen to the most known tracks on it tells big. First, you have the timeless \"Call from the Grave\" that features one of the most epic atmosphere and guitar solo ever by Quorthon and then, the famous masterpiece \"Enter the Eternal Fire\". Being the first epic composition of Quorthon, that would mark the debut of a new experimentation on later albums. A very interesting fact about this song is that it was heavily influenced by Bathory's drummer at the time who was a fan of Manowar. This influence ended up on the music quite noticeably as you can easily compare the main beat with the latter band \"Hail to England\" song from the same title 1984 album. This inspiration didn't end there because it would eventually become a great part in the overall sound of Bathory. Anyway, more epicness can be found within this album with the grim \"13 candles\", it is more focused on the sinister ambiance than the speed while still keeping that intense aggression with those heavy as hell riffs. Useless to mention how fast and violent \"Equimanthorn\" and \"Chariots of Fire\" are, these are totally killer and the choruses are catchy like all the songs on the album actually.\n\nThe combination of those more sophisticated compositions and the other furious speed oriented numbers is what makes this album so varied. If we take a look at the production quality of this record, it's in fact less polished than the sound that was featured in the last album \"The Return....\" mainly because it was recorded in an actual studio rather than in the Heavenshore garage that basically limited the band regarding equipment and more. Fortunately, this is not even an issue at this point since the sound that ended up on this album fits perfectly with this genre of music and It was most likely this kind of production that influenced the lo-fi aspect of the 90s black metal scene. When it comes to the mix of the album, I would say that it's pretty well done to be quite honest since all the instruments are heard properly and nothing is getting buried whatsoever. The \"Under the Sign of the Black Mark\" album is also the last one to feature the evil lyrical concept as it was dropped shortly after for the viking themes.\n\nAll in all, after all those years that i've been listening to this album and pretty much all the Bathory's catalog, I have yet to find anything bad to say. The man was a pure genius and deserves every credits that belongs to him in regards to musical contribution to the metal genre. If you have never listened to this record yet, I'm really wondering what you are waiting for because in my opinion of course, every old school or extreme metal fans should know this masterpiece. It is truly the quintessential 80s black metal record that has all elements that was brought by a ton of bands later on. Quorthon's legacy lives on!\n\nFavourite tracks: \n\nCall from the Grave\nEnter the Eternal Fire\nWoman of Dark Desires\n13 Candles\n",
        "\nWhat does one say about Bathory? To most underground metal fans of the 80's the one-man show from Sweden was the absolute king of black metal, designing and forging the ground for all who followed after. To others? Well, Quorthon was one of the masters of the medium, so anyone who can't or won't recognize this isn't worth including here. After all, it's opinion if the man's music was any good; the fact that he laid all of the groundwork for the early 90's rise of the so-called second wave of black metal is fact, so it's indisputable.\n\nSome 35-years after this debut first slithered into the metal underground, Bathory has solidified its place in the annals of black metal history. Its coveted time in the grand halls of metal luminaries is not only well-deserved but necessary in the formation of at least two other genres. Black metal, from any era, country and sub-genre, owes a tremendous debt to Quorthon, without question. I understand well that Venom coined the phrase, had the album of the same name, yadda yadda. Venom's sound was rooted in NWOBHM and thrash \u2013 debate it if you like \u2013 and while the style and subject matter was firmly established, the sound was certainly cultivated by Bathory to the nth degree. No one screamed wails of perfect tortured anguish before Quorthon; no one else took barely-tuned guitars and managed to create a whole new area of heavy metal music that would stump, shock, and delight kids the globe over; no one in 1983 knew that metal history would forever be changed without benefit of expensive production, proper instruments, big label pushes or anything even close to positive reviews.\n\nThe underground would be the eternal judge and jury for these little pieces of art.\n\nI first heard Bathory early in 1985, my 13th year, by way of my wonderfully-departed neighbor, whose dubbed and store-bought tapes made my pre-teen mouth water. My education from Scott Preston will always be immeasurable to me, and this album was no different. What I managed to take in was some of the worst-sounding production I'd ever had the pleasure to hear. I had no idea something so badly muddled could leave such a resonating statement echoed ruefully among the ruins of the metal contingent over the last five decades. The cover alone, the coveted yellow (or white) goat's head surrounded by a sea of pitch black that long associates itself with heavy metal. What managed to come sputtering out of my headphones in such harsh and high-pitched messy tones were songs that would not only help define my slight, innocuous role in heavy metal's grand pantheon, but set me on a path from which I was never to again stray. Between this album and Venom's \"Black Metal\" I was home.\n\nBathory comes on like a runaway train, overused analogy forgiven, tumultuous and painstakingly raw with its pre-Pelle Ohlin \u201ccorpse sound\u201d in full effect from the first distorted chords of \u201cHades\u201d. Satanic imagery and romanticism aside, the screeching vocals, tinny guitars, non-existent bass, and haphazard drumming cast a dismal shadow over the underground music scene. By mid-1985, people were either impressed with Bathory or wondering aloud what the guy was medicated with; like it or not, Bathory was here. This record is rife with hooks and thin riffs that would later emerge on many a black metal catalog. Every song on this debut is absolute essential \u201cfirst-wave black metal\u201d, riding close the coattails of such masters of bleak and black imagery like Black Sabbath, Coven, Black Widow and the less dismal Motorhead. Possibly by accidental design, Bathory is a resignation to the whims of a colossal madman ripe in years, but old in vision. Songs like \u201cNecromansy\u201d, \u201cSacrifice\u201d, \u201cIn Conspiracy with Satan\u201d, and \u201cRaise the Dead\u201d cast considerable shadows on the peers of that time; no one was simply daring (or poor) enough to attempt this to such a memorable degree (while I, too, love Hellhammer the overall talent was to emerge later under the seminal Celtic Frost moniker). This is a record filled with horror movie visuals, biblical warnings, sexually-sadistic fantasies, and enough Halloween caricature to satisfy any ardent metalhead. What Quorthon managed to do, either by aforementioned accident or impetuous youthful design, was to set the bar so high with such low material that thousands of imitators have slapped on cheap dime store make up to mimic the \u201cblack metal mode\u201d in either accidental or deliberate servitude to him. Either way, this album, the finite areas of early black metal, was to stand and serve as a constant reminder that music is always a sincere rush of blood and passion, not always a technically sound foray into instrumental bliss.\n\nIt should also be noted that there two distinctively different versions of this recording going around. The coveted \u201cyellow goat\u201d version issued in 1000 copies is somewhat superior in sound, allowing for sharper tones and clearer sound all around. Once Black Mark decided to \u201cremaster\u201d it, the charm was lost, and the sound thickened to where it just doesn't sound organic anymore. Every copy of this post-yellow goat suffers the remastering fate, so unless you can plunk down the $1000-$2000 price tags on the vinyl or about $80 to $100 for the Combat cassette the flawed, albeit inoffensive remaster will have to suffice.\n\nBathory music is NOT for everybody, and, to be quite frank, it really shouldn't be. It's not designed for everybody \u2013 you shouldn't just waltz into this genre with patches you order from social media halfwits or shirts you can buy at the local hipster hangout in the mall. This is music for the truly fringe fan base: searchers, hopefuls, introspective and impressionable people in a time frame where impressionism was still a trait, not a symptom. Bathory's Bathory was a time, a place and feeling long before people with too much free time on their idle hands decided social media memes and cute cut-and-paste jokes were how this music should be seen and heard. When you hear this record for the first time, or even the thousandth time, you should always catch the feeling of it: dark, foreboding, evil, even comical fare with such tongue-in-cheek lyrics to be had deep in the songs. All of that should be Bathory.\n\nAnd it forever is. Lighting in a bottle.\n",
        "\nI absolutely adore Bathory. They (he technically, since it was only really one man, called Quorthon.) are my absolute favourite band of all time. I own all their records, even the somewhat rare Blood on Ice promo album that I managed to snag from my local radio station when I worked there! So when I came round to listening to this piece of re-recorded and old material dating back to the late 80's I was very excited to see where Bathory had gone after the admittedly terrible Requiem and Octagon double whammy. Well I was shocked, to tell you the truth! \n\nAfter reading the liner notes from the album's booklet I found out that Blood on Ice is a concept album that follows a young boy who's village is raided by horsemen clad in black and who slaughter all the men but carry all the women and children off to the far North. The boy survives by hiding up a tree and at the end he charges into the gates of Hell and defeats a great twin-headed serpent whilst also freeing the souls of those trapped there. OK, it is certainly a more interesting and strong story than can be said for a lot of other heavy metal concept albums. But I did notice a definite influence from Robert E. Howard's Conan the Barbarian novels. Still good though. Right, back to the music.\n\nThe last thing I had heard of Bathory was Twilight of the Gods in 1991, and also the last that main band member Quorthon thought it was going to be for his band (until the misfires that were Requiem and Octagon), that's why there's no spooky outro on Twilight of the Gods like there usually was on each subsequent Bathory record up until that point. Because Bathory wasn't going to return, Quorthon and Black Mark Productions decided to dump the Jubileum albums on us to ensure Bathory wasn't forgotten. For now...\n\nWell, I suppose that Quorthon couldn't contain himself, and Bathory returned in 1994 after 3 years off with a little album called Requiem. Utter faux thrash crap! Anyway, one year after that in 1995, he decided to have one more stab at thrash metal with Octagon. Even worse faux thrash crap!! I suppose Quorthon must have been feeling a bit disheartened with the response both Requiem and Octagon received because in 1996 he didn't actually release an album proper, he just \"dug into the archives\" to retrieve some material written in 1989, right after Blood Fire Death. As Quorthon wasn't entirely happy with this new material's musical direction (as it was, he felt, a drastic shift from Blood Fire Death) he shelved everything written and instead pumped out \"Hammerheart.\" \n\nSo, Blood on Ice isn't actually an album that was entirely written and recorded in 1996. Parts of it are from 1989 and there is some new material recorded in 1996, but I believe the majority is from 1989. So how is the actual music? Well for that we don't technically need to turn to Hammerheart or Twilight of the Gods since THIS album was supposed to be the first proper Bathory viking metal album. Is it as good as either of those albums I just mentioned? Well, if it came out first, perhaps this would be a different story but since it was released so late in the viking era of Bathory, after two subsequent masterpieces (Twilight and Hammerheart), it isn't quite the spectacle nor is it as majestic as I expected it would be.\n\nWe start things off with an action packed intro that concerns the raid of the young boy's village that moves the whole album's concept story into motion. It's short and only lasts for 1 minute and 40 seconds but then it leads into the the title track which was where I discovered that the majority of the problems with this album unfortunately lie. The production is a big part of those problems. The drums are of particular note; they sound like garbage. Really flat and tinny snare, horrendous sort of lo-fi sound to the cymbals and the toms all sound the same. I know of course that it was a machine programmed by Quorthon; but he could have done a much better job of it than this. \nAlong the way, I noticed sound issues with the song \"One-Eyed Old Man\" suffering serious problems at the guitar solo part. There is horrible crackling and volume issues where it sounds super compressed. Also, I gave the remastered version of this album a go to see if it fixes any of these grievances and it seemed to solve some of the serious peaking issues of sound levels on some songs, but then it all sounds like it was bass boosted to hell and back (and like the album was recorded in a submarine!!! Which it wasn't.) The remastered recording sounds so much worse. All of the Bathory remasters do. Bah, remastered my backside!! Of course, I don't know if that was Quorthon's intention when producing this record (and remastering it) to have this different confluence of sound quality and production values or not, but it all sounds so very amateurish regardless. Like seriously, here was a man who had been in the music industry since 1983, producing, playing and participating on so many musical albums and compositions, yet when given the perfect chance, nay, the perfect OPPORTUNITY to go back and flesh out this stuff on brand new equipment years later and to REALLY make this album come to life he instead he comes out with all this! I really cannot fathom the thought process here.\n\nAnyway, the album rumbles along at a mid to slow pace the entire time. The fastest track on Blood on Ice is the aptly named \"Gods of Thunder of Wind and of Rain\" as listening to it makes you feel like you are caught up in the middle of a thunderstorm, gale force wind and heavy rain all at the same time. Great! Another neat little thing is the way that the title track and the last track \"The Revenge of the Blood on Ice\" start the same way and carry similar traits and sound to each other. Like I said, it was a neat thing to bookend the album with. Quorthon's voice is a lot more loud, powerful and confident on this album than on Twilight of the Gods (no funny voice cracks or off-key moments anymore! For the most part) and he certainly handles calm, melodic and soothing songs like \"Man of Iron\" and \"The Ravens\" better than on either Hammerheart or Twilight of the Gods. Another thing to note is \"The Lake.\" The best song on Blood on Ice. It has one of the most powerful, uplifting and best choruses I have ever heard on a heavy metal record to date. An absolute banger of a track. Almost 7 minutes of brilliantly executed MUSIC. It doesn't actually get any better than this on Blood on Ice. The rest of the songs I haven't mentioned like \"The Sword\", \"The Stallion\", or \"The Woodwoman\" aren't really worth talking about much since to me personally they come across as filler songs, designed purely to set the musical backdrop for the story currently charging along through this album. \n\nSo where would I put Bathory's 9th semi-studio affair on my list? Just above Destroyer of Worlds. Yes, it isn't the greatest Bathory album recorded in my opinion, perhaps, like I said, if it was released properly back in 1989 and not redone 7 years later it may have been perfect. Who knows? All I do know is that Quorthon still remains a musical genius who created TRUE masterpieces in the shape of albums like Nordland II, The Return...... and Hammerheart and unfortunately I don't feel Blood on Ice deserves that label, yet. Maybe a few more years and a few more spins of this album might do the trick...\n",
        "\nThe first Bathory album is one of the very few albums that I can listen to a countless number of times, and still never cease to be amazed by it. Everything in this album, from the riffs, to the lyrics, to the primitive production is breath-taking. This album is a fiendish assault that destroys everything in fucking sight.\n\nThe riffs on this album are masterful. Influenced by the relentless thrashing of the first two Venom releases, Quorthon creates diabolic riff-filled anthems like 'Necromancy' and 'Reaper'. Even the simpler riffs like the ones found on the track 'In Conspiracy With Satan' are impressive and suit the lyrics and production perfectly. The tempo is slowed down to a grave-desecrating macabre ritual groove on 'Raise The Dead', before exploding back into the apocalyptic and mercilessly fast 'War'. The solos are awesome and akin to the ones you hear on albums like Slayer's immortal debut 'Show No Mercy'; thrashy and perfectly dissonant without becoming too wanky or tryhard.\n\nThe production is completely rotten, but thats what makes it so fucking evil! While it may seem like there is a hi-hat buried in the mix somewhere, I have read on numerous occasions that the kit on this album is a mere kick, snare and ride (but my ear tells me there's a crash somewhere in there too). The bass is a thick layer of death pounding away under the two guitar tracks, which are clearly being played through a tiny practice amp, yet somehow sound so fucking huge and badass on songs like 'Sacrifice'. I feel this is mostly because the bass is turned up so loud that the guitars and bass become one massive fucking sonic ambush in the sense that they are perfectly juxtaposing the way they are each EQ'd in the mix. Reverb has evidently been added in perfect moderation to help give this assault its huge sound.\n\nThe lyrics on this album are so awesome. Here is the first verse from my personal biggest highlight of the album, 'Sacrifice':\n\n\"I summon up the living dead,\nAnd demons in the sky\nI drink from chalice, warm and red\nAnd watched the virgin die\nPresent at ungodly births\nIn holy paradise\nI spread eternal dark on earth\nAnd rape mother of christ!\"\n\nSo sinister yet it manages not to sound try-hard or edgy, and it has aged well in the sense that it doesn't sound goofy or stupid 35 years later.\n\nAnd this is something that goes for everything about the album. 35 years later (as of this October) and this is still the evil, destructive black-thrash masterpiece that it was when it came out in '84. This album fucking rips and is a total classic that has influenced so many other fantastic releases.\n",
        "\nIt's already been over 15 years since the release of Bathory's final album, and the saddest thing to me is that Quorthon's Nordland saga seems to have been buried by his older masterpieces. To be quite honest, it does not really surprise me because albums such has \"Under the Sign of the Black Mark\", \"Blood Fire Death\" or \"Hammerheart\" are his most known releases. I can't deny how good all these albums are because Bathory being my all time favorite band, disliking his 80s and early 90s work is nonsense to me. However, after coming back from his music experimentation with his solo moniker simply named \"Quorthon\", he made a comeback album with the 2001 \"Destroyer of Worlds\". That album is far from being my favorite one, but still marked a partial return to the viking stuff while still having some songs that sounded like what we could hear in \"Octagon\" or \"Requiem\". The main idea on that album was to try to please both viking metal fans and the \"black/thrash/death\" metal fans. The following year, \"Nordland I\" was released and marked a total return to viking metal, a first since Blood on Ice, which was released in 1996, despite being recorded in 1989, but polished in 1995. Both Nordland I and II were recorded at the same period of time, but released one year after the other, thus Nordland II being released in 2003.\n\nThe \"Nordland\" saga in general features a more mature songwriting and overall sound. Being well experimented in the genre he created himself at the end of the 80s, Quorthon knew very well was he was doing when composing the tracks for these albums. Aside from the better produced sound compared to the older viking albums, a big difference is the use of folk instruments in the music. Quorthon messed with them in the studio and thought it sounded cool, and goddamn right he was! The addition of new instruments brought something unique to the sound in Nordland, and it's basically a perfect fit in the music played in Bathory. The vocals of Quorthon are also a bit different from the older viking albums of course. They are just more mature as well, but he still manage to put out emotions in his voice as much as before, and it's definitely not a thing to complain about. Just looking at the cover art (made by Necrolord) shows how awesome this album is, I struggled so many years to get my hands on this album shirt that it's not even funny.\n\nWell, one cannot say that Bathory left us with poor material. The \"Nordland II\" album has 10 tracks, but nine officials and we have an hour and few minutes of listening pleasure for the last part of the saga. \"Nordland I\" last instrumental track \"Heimfard\" made a good ending for the beginning of the part reviewed here. This album starts with \"Fanfare\", another epic instrumental that serve as an introduction. When I was younger, I always skipped those tracks, but now I always listen to them as they put you in the mood. If you listened to the first part of the saga, you will notice a slight difference in the sound as both albums were not mixed at the same time. Personally, I have a sound preference for \"Nordland II\", but it doesn't make the first part less good. As soon as the first \"real\" song kick-off, you will easily recognize Bathory's viking sound, but refreshed. \"Blooded Shore\" is exactly what you could have heard in albums such has Twilight of the Gods or Blood on Ice. It's epic, has the classic choirs and a mid-paced riff with a beat really nice and enjoyable to follow through.\n\nA new sound exclusively present on the \"Nordland\" albums appears in the second track called \"Sea Wolf\" with its folk elements that add even more epicness, mixed with the intense choirs. We can also hear Quorthon using different kind of vocals in the chorus, and useless to say how intense the instrumental part is at the end of the song with its guitar solo. Like most viking metal tracks released by Bathory, they are to me, for some reason, catchy as hell. Like \"The Land\" track is incredible, as well as the vocal performance on it, the lyrics are easy to get into and the melody is good as fuck. What is also cool in this album is the variety in style while still incorporating that atmosphere. Take for example \"Flash of the Silverhammer\" that has a main groovy riff compared to the other tracks, the kind of riff that I would never expect such a guitar riff mixed with epic choirs. Another surprising example of variety is the aggressive \"Death and Resurrection of a Northern Son\". This one has a fast-paced guitar riff that you could find in a speed/thrash song as well as the pretty intense drumming. Being the heaviest track of the album, it still has that epic atmosphere and a slow part in the middle that focus on the vocals, before returning to the aggressive riff.\n\n\"Nordland II\" also has two of the most epic Bathory song ever, which are \"The Messenger\" and \"The Wheel of Sun\", which is unfortunately the last Bathory song aswell... With a length of 10 and 12 minutes respectively, they goes in the same veins has legendary tracks such as \"One Rode to Asa Bay\", \"Shores in Flames\", or \"Twilight of the Gods\" and more. Both tracks has amazing unique melodies and vocal performances, but in my opinion, \"The Wheel of Sun\" is definitely the most emotional Bathory song in a long time, which makes it even more sad that it's Quorthon's last song. Listening to this song actually makes me sad every time mainly because of that, but also because of how emotional his voice sounds with the scream on the chorus. Other than that, the guitar work is flawless and everything here makes me realize why the guy is a legend.\n\nEven though most people listen only to the old records, I have to say that this album and the \"Nordland\" saga altogether is as good as the older viking metal albums. Maybe they are more known because of becoming classics over the time, but this album right here is definitely worthy of having the title of a masterpiece among the other records. Useless to say how much I recommend this album to experiment the true viking metal with. The legend that is Quorthon will live on, and like he would have said ... Hail the Hordes!\n\nFavorite tracks:\n\n\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00adAll of them\n",
        "\nAh yes, the \"lost\" Bathory album. It's also a concept album that alludes to Norse mythology. If you want more background information, look elsewhere, because under all the drama is an overlooked Viking gem.\n\nThe first thing to note is how wildly diverse this album is - giving further credence to Quorthon's incredible versatility: you have your typical hulking and slower paced viking fare (\"Blood on Ice\", \"The Lake\"); more traditional, slow, and melancholic folk (\"Man of Iron\", \"The Ravens\"); straightforward, fast, and flashy power metal (\"Gods of Thunder, of Wind and of Rain\"); and even a bit of punk/thrash (\"One Eyed Old Man\"). It all flows so effortlessly, making listening to the album straight through quite an entertaining experience. \n\nBeing varied is meaningless if the writer doesn't have the skill to back it up. Since this is Bathory we're talking about, of course it does. The compositions are catchy, even if it does feel like it we're treading old ground here and there (\"Revenge of the Blood on Ice\" is yet another \"Blood Fire Death\" clone. Well done, but a clone none the less). This album also hints at some of the greatness to come, like the folk masterpiece that is \"Ring of Gold\" to the emphasis on catchier tracks on Nordland I and II. I do wonder what other genres Quorthon could have conquered if he was given the time...\n\nThe actual performances, too, are impressive. I'd argue this album has Quorthon's best cleans, at least at points. His high end is way better here than it would be on the Nordland albums, at least in my opinion. I skimmed the concept album status briefly, but it works. It has a clear story, and Quorthon, excellent lyricist he was, tells it well. We also get to hear Quorthon say \"Yee Haw!\" on the last track, which if nothing else is amusing to picture. The other instruments are still excellent and up to Bathory par. Quorthon still has time to throw in his flashy solos, as if we expected anything else. Nothing feels out of place and everything comes together to create the cold landscape the title suggests. Well, almost.\n\nDespite the good playing, the production mars it a bit, especially on the drums. A gross over correction of Octagon, no doubt. At their best, the drums are too loud and distract from the cool vocal harmonies and riffs, and at their worst they completely overtake the song. Everything else sounds serviceable, but not nearly as good as the later albums. This probably has to do with the fact that half of this was recorded in the 80s and the rest was recorded in the 90s.\n\nIn any case, Blood on Ice was an album that still feels kind of lost, even after being released. It's rarely mentioned in comparison to its follow ups, both intended and actual. It was released in a dark era in the Bathory timeline and suffered as a result. Would the album have fared better if it was released when it was intended? No, I don't think so. This album gave us (arguably) Quorthon's greatest vocal performance (Hammerheart and Twilight of the Gods are frequently derided for Quorthon's less than stellar vocals). He also now knew what worked and what didn't.\n\nWhat I'm trying to say is Quorthon had the time to fix Blood on Ice, to make it something more than \"That black metal whackjob's made a crap Manowar record!\". \n\nIf only he had more... Hail Quorthon!\n\nHighlights:\n\"Man of Iron\"\n\"Gods of Thunder, of Wind and of Rain\"\n\"The Lake\"\n\nP.S. This is probably my favorite Necrolord cover, if for no other reason than it's not \"Evil Mansion #8125\".\n",
        "\nMake no presumptions from my review title, this album is very much a black metal release from Bathory, and a fascinating evolutionary milestone in the sub-genre. Whilst not as consistently grim as the eternal Under The Sign of the Black Mark, one can't overstate just how important in establishing black metal's identity this was. One would think from that delightfully primitive album title (you really can't get much more tersely brutal than that folks) that this would be more of the same from the previous year, if not faster and uglier. \n\nSo why even mention an album by a band that had practically nothing to do Bathory? Well because from a guitar tone perspective, that's what Blood Fire Death sound like. If you make your ears squint and load yourself up on enough booze, you could swear that this was Ride The Lighting from, well you know. I'm not gonna go so far as to say it's what Metallica should have put out after Kill em All, because I'm sure those supposed thrashers that didn't much care for the acoustic openings of Fade To Black are going to feel the same way about A Fine Day To Die and the title track. In fact, in Ian Christe's book Sounds of the Beast Quorthon was rather happy to be isolated from the thrash scene in general, \"We didn't have those types of pressures\u2014 so we were able to add acoustic guitars, backing harmony vocals and the sound of a seagull flying by. Slayer would never get away with that, but we could.\" (270) (Incidentally, this came out the same year as South of Heaven, whose final track does start acoustically. D'oh!)\n\nSo despite the album title, as well as having lyrics about raping angels and Jesus being the bastard son of heaven, Blood Fire Death isn't quite pitch black as it's three predecessors. This is the result of adding acoustic guitars, backing harmonies and a few heaping spoonfuls of native Swedish Viking culture, to which there was an authenticity we hadn't quite seen before in metal. Dungeons, dragons and vikings had always been side symptoms of the genre as a manifestation of Ronnie James Dio, but those were always more of an enthusiastic, yet imaginary romp through Frank Frazetta/Robert E Howard collaborations. Blood Fire Death drops us right smack on the fiery shores of Nordland. This album is very much ground zero for unironic, completely serious worship of Swedish viking culture in metal. Enslaved, Amon Amarth, Burzum and so many other artists owe a reasonable debt to this album.\n\nWe also see the irony in slightly less variety in the songwriting as a result of Quorthon choosing to expand his artistic palette. We have your raging thrashers (there's really no other way of describing them), the marching epics, and For All Those Who Died, which feels like a drunken jam of Tie Your Mother Down except nobody bothered to tell Quorthon he's putting copy-written music in his video. The Golden Walls of Heaven and Dies Irae belong in the first category, but they are slightly more dynamic with various time changes and intros. I also have to note that the main rhythm of the two epics is the same as the previous showstopper Enter The Eternal Fire. My love for the song was less about the tempo and more a perfect combination of atmosphere, production and riffs, but I can't complain too much about the use of the \"if it ain't broke, don't fix it\" formula.\n\nIf there is a complaint I have about this album, it's that this slightly altered presentation of the Bathory sound buries what I feel was the band's greatest strength towards acquiring new black metal fans: Quorthon's solos. They are noticeably buried in the mix. I'm of the general opinion that if you are the only guitarist in the band, you shouldn't have rhythm guitar tracks under your solos as they usually distract from the leads. If there are two guitarists in the band, make the rhythm just basic enough so that ear is drawn the lead no matter what (Iron Maiden were masters of this). The Golden Walls of Heaven in particular has a lead around 1:50 that sounds like the Pope's cardiovascular system is being ripped out, but you have to pay slightly more attention to hear it over, say the debut. Perhaps Quorthon's design aesthetic was to have the leads be the lamentations of the women, barely audible over the sounds of your enemies being crushed and driven before you.\n\nIn 1988, hot off the heels of Under The Sign of The Black Mark, I'm sure the Bathory hordes celebrated Blood Fire Death as more of the same, just with a bit more Nordic spice to the steak. But with hindsight being 20/20, it's quite clear Quorthon was evolving his outfit to something quite different, and the clearly shedded black metal skin could no longer be attached to the animal.....\n",
        "\nHello once again! Bathory, The Discography Review Part II is finally here! first things first, I like this album more than their self titled, as I said in my first review about Bathory's releases after the first. This album really in my opinion is their darkest and most EVIL release they have ever put out, and that is not just a play on the title of the album,happy accident haha. Anyways without further ado, I bring you BATHORY! THE RETURN... This album really laid down the foundation for the dark sound of black metal, for this album was way ahead of it's time. What I like about this album is it isn't afraid to scare the shit out of christian listeners with it's purposefully dark sound and lyrics.\n\nThe album really packs a punch for those just getting into black metal and is definitely a marvelous introduction to extreme metal as a whole for anyone who is interested. The album has a certain atmosphere as well as maintaining it's aggressive features from the previous album.This is the first first wave album that actually has an authentic black metal sound and incorporates all the themes of modern black metal. The vocals are evil and make the whole experience really creepy like black metal is meant to be. Even though Bathory's self titled album introduced the whole satanic lyrical concept, this album has a thick, dark atmosphere that outshines the factor of lyricism because most people don't pay all of their attention to the lyrics, especially when listening to black or death metal, they pay attention to how it sounds. \n\nThe sound of this album is what really makes it great to listen to because the production is excellent and it sounds like a demon (Named Quorthon) is on vocals. The guitar riffs and the vocals match perfectly and really emphasize the overall heaviness and darkness of the release. For being released in 1985, this album was like a look into the future for those following the first wave of black metal in the mid 80s because it was so intensely aggressive and heavy but still had that dark cult-ish sound that started in the late 70s and early 80s. The Return may not be my favorite album, but it's definitely up there with my most beloved albums of all time. When I first listened to this album, I had literal goosebumps because of how dark it is, just thinking about at the time made me shiver! To think that black metal started with just this one guy is pure fucking insanity. \n\nThe influence that The Return has on black metal and extreme metal as a whole is nearly indescribable because of the pure genius that went into it. The soul-sucking darkness and malevolent riffs will tear a new hole in your fucking heart. Every track on this album is a symbol of Quorthon's ingenuity when it comes to music, the 8 tracks that is album contains are all flawlessly written and produced like it was meant to be legendary but then again, unknowingly at the same time. This release, like most metal releases was most likely unwelcome in many households due to how dark it sounds. Even the album cover and logo are absolutely perfect and dark as it should be, but I've always wondered whose actually doing the artwork? The album covers for their entire discography look inhuman but sick at the same time.\n\nNow, I hate to, but I must discuss some of the \"negative\" qualities of this release (if there are any). The only thing I can really think of is kinda similar to the debut, sometimes there is a bit of monotony. With this album I don't mind as much because the entire album is supposed to sound dark and evil, so it is understandable that there is a lack of variety. The album focuses on two aspects : thrashing aggression and dark atmosphere. The intro, Revelation Of Doom really sets the atmosphere for the whole album and kinda gives away what genre this album is going to be. The atmosphere stays with the rest of the album and the vocals feed off the darkness. \n\nNow my favorite part! the positive qualities! Now, I would say \"Everything\" but this is a review and I have to be specific. But what I just said is kind of true, I have NO issues with this album whatsoever especially since I love every single album Bathory has ever released. This album has many good qualities, kind of repeating what I said before, but the atmosphere is an excellent quality and the aggressive thrash riffs make this entire album. Sound is EVERYTHING, and The Return has a way with dark and beautiful sounds. The album has a somewhat raw production, considering it was released in 1985 but it is still beautiful. \n\nTalking about my favorite band is somewhat difficult, because I want to say so many good things but don't want the review to be too long! I love this album and this band so much, I just have to say a lot about them both! Sadly, I must wrap the review up because I've said pretty much everything I can about the album. For anyone new to black metal, I highly recommend this diamond, it is a dark masterpiece with a lot to offer and you will not be disappointed.\n\nThank you for reading my review, and expect a part III to come here shortly because I am committed to reviewing the entire discography, album by album.\n",
        "\nSince Bathory is my #1 favorite band, it's only appropriate that I review their entire discography right? What kind of fan would I be if I didn't? I will be reviewing every single full length album, each album is a \"Part\" of the review in it's entirety. Bathory is my favorite band, not only because Forsberg took influence from hardcore punk, but because I consider them to be the very first black metal band. Quorthon's vocal range is astounding and he was what I like to call the riffmaster of black metal, he was an astonishingly impressive multi-instrumentalist and overall musician with a way of certain progression of style. But, without further ado I present to you the first part of Bathory, the Discography Review!\n\nThis will be my first review of an entire discography, (at least on here). Let me start by saying, that for this time this album was fucking dark and evil, I mean hardly any music sounded this purposefully blasphemous and satanic in every way known to man, it was high octane, aggressive, heavy, raw, primitive and downright fucking crazy! This album draws a shit ton of inspiration from hardcore and speed metal elements. This album was released when the concept of black metal was first being developed by those of 80s death, thrash and speed metal bands. Although black metal wasn't really a genre back then, this album really laid down the foundation for what it would end up sounding like, at least upon it's first emergence. Bathory's self titled along with many other gems of the era were pretty controversial considering the satanic imagery and dark sounding music was unwelcome in many households, especially in highly religious families.\n\nI will say this first, the album is not perfection by any means, no debut album is really perfect in any way. Although I love this band and their entire discography to death, this album is most definitely outshined by it's following releases. The album is beautifully aggressive and sick in it's own way, but there are some flaws, none that are really outstanding but there. The only issues I have with the release is the fact that it is a little bit monotonous at times, now I don't mind minimality with some bands but being that this is my absolute favorite I expect more. I listen to this album very often and I love it very much, but a lot of the songs have the same basic tone and feel like there is no variety, that could be just me when my mind is at rest but I honestly don't think it's that important. \n\nNow, let's talk about the good things this album has to offer, which is a lot and really outweighs any negative things pertaining to the release. The album is fast, easy to listen to and any old school metal junkie pretty much falls head over heels for the sound. The feeling I get with this release and why I love it so damn much is because it was the absolute genesis to quite possibly the most amazing music genre known to man. The album cover is eye-catching, the gold color looks promising and the logo is beautifully drawn and completes the album cover. Once you start listening, you feel that certain chill that today's black metal gives off while still taking in the bone-crunching thrash sound, which is very fascinating.\n\nI know that many people on this site absolutely despise black metal and probably Bathory, but even if you hate black metal with a burning passion, this album deserves massive amounts of credit and respect for influence on thrash as well as black metal. To discuss some of the track listings without doing track by track review I would just like to select a few highlight tracks that I consider to me my favorites out of the bunch. Hades : This track is simply GORGEOUS and really an excellent track for this album to open up with. This track really is a gem because it relates to the rest of the album almost perfectly and gets whoever is listening hooked! \n\nThe track draws you in in the first 10, no 5 seconds of the song and for any first time listeners it is a splendidly dark experience. Another great track is War, probably one of Bathory's more well-known songs, since many bands have covered it. It is both a popular choice and a dark masterpiece, Quorthon's vocals REALLY stand out and the instrumentation is simply phenomenal. My third highlight track is Raise The Dead, why you may ask? It's fucking psycho! This song really emphasizes the whole release and encapsulates what the record is in just a single 3 minute track, it is astounding how well done the track is produced and how the overall music sounds, that is why it is a highlight track. \n\nAs some additional thoughts on the album, I would like to discuss why out of all of Bathory's albums, this one is my LEAST favorite in the discography. This album had a lot going for it in 1984 and still does today, but I feel like the band got so much better as they went on, and their various influences on extreme metal have changed music forever. This album is my least favorite due to the fact it wasn't the first album of theirs I listened to. I started out on Bathory listening to Blood Fire Death, so at the time I wasn't paying much attention to it, after I listened to their debut drooling the entire time, I grew to love it, as well as fall in love with the band in general. What I really love about the album is that it isn't afraid to display the purest aggression humanly possible.\n\nTo wrap up the review I would like to give my respect to the remaining members of Bathory and an honourable rest in peace to Quorthon, who passed away when I was 4 years old. Part 2 is going to be on it's way, as soon as this review is approved.\n",
        "\nWell, ok. maybe power metal? Power doom? Doom power?\n\nI'll tell you what this album is not: Viking metal. There's no such goddamn thing as viking metal. Viking metal is the stupidest excuse ever conceived for a change from Slayer to Manowar I've ever heard. Folks with more conservative mindsets do have a term for this, and if I'm going to be brutally honest, I believe it's called selling out. That being said, I can understand not wanting to classify Hammerheart under those previously established subgenres. The fact is, this Bathory LP is so much more than a power metal or doom metal album. The way I see it, Hammerheart is Battle Hymns with a lower fidelity production, combined with a genuine affection for ancient heritage, and gargantuan barrels full of moonshine mead.\n\nOf particular note is Quorthon's newfound singing style. Yes, singing. We already saw him subtly move away from the black metal demon rasp style he helped innovate over the years on Blood Fire Death, and here he just baptizes himself in a more tonal style, though not necessarily an accomplished one. From a strictly technical standpoint, most people would probably call this some of the worst singing they've ever heard. Quorthon sounds like a raging belligerent hobo on the streets of Stockholm preaching on how Christianity raped the European culture. I'm sure some Pavoratti biographer could point out all the mistakes, bum notes, and times where the man is flat-out out of key. Isolated and taken out of context of the album, most would probably call this singing dreadful.\n\nBut within the context of the album, these vocals are the glue, nay, the molten steel which binds this album together like a sturdy viking ship. If Quorthon had listened back to his vocals, decided they weren't good enough and gotten someone like Halford, Dio, Dickinson or even Eric Adams to sing the lead vocals, it would be the musical equivalent of diluting the mead with a washtub. They are perfect for this album, giving it a true old-country authenticity that most nationalist musicians could only dream of. I'm not sure any of those men would be able to capture the pure northern soul expressed in Song To Hail Up High.\n\nAs for the rest of the album's sound, well, if you came to thrash or to hear anything remotely fast, you are going to be sorely, sorely disappointed. Perhaps one reason why people were quick to festoon this album with a new sub-genre because its pace is as slow as a giant vessel traversing the open sea, yet no one would dare ask if this was Candlemass or Pentagram. The song that can be considered the least slow here is Father To Son. Father To Son sails at the speed of Unleashed In The East's version of The Ripper, which might seem very uptempo, but the way it drudges along will make you think that it's slower than it actually is. Couple that with the three even slower songs preceding it, and the song feels more like a switch-up than an attempt to trim the sails for speed. Despite the obvious departure from the early Bathory albums, this is very much a natural progression from the direction Bathory began on Blood Fire Death.\n\nThe highlights of Hammerheart include Shores In Flames, Home of Once Brave and closing number One Rode To Asa Bay. The latter in particular is a massive tour-de-force of about Christianity's annihilation of native European culture, complete with the greatest guitar solo echoing a vocal melody I've ever heard (5:54). This song should be an absolute downer, a big pile of misery that leaves you angry and helpless against the power of religion. Bathory makes it into an almost joyous celebration about the wondrous birth of grand, brilliant new way of life, almost like a hailing of the Renaissance. Anyone who writes this off as swords and sorcery poppycock and not a wholly original continuation of Black Sabbath's moralizing of the ills of the world can take their yuppie Rolling Stone attitude and get an entire dragon-ship shoved right up their ass.\n\nHammerheart is the Nordic funeral of the black metal Bathory. If you can't accept them playing anything except lo-fi, treble-soaked bloody odes to Satan, this album may very well leave you cold. But if you're open minded enough to embrace the new direction (or perhaps just hate black metal), than this is an indispensable metal classic that is just as essential as Under The Sign of the Black Mark, Blood Fire Death, Nightfall and Holy Mountain. Yes, I meant to pool those together, and it should be very easy to see why.\n",
        "\nIf Count Cronos, Vampire Supreme was the Supreme Allied Commander of Lucifer's legions, Quorthon can be considered the renegade officer who broke off from the group and decided to start his own little faction because he didn't think the Count's methods were dastardly enough. That's all well and good, but you do look a little foolish and hypocritical when you lift war cries word for word.\n\n\"I gasp for air\nI scream for sight\nand fight against torment and dread\nCalling the vengeance\nI tear at the lid and\npromise to raise from the dead\"\n\n- Bathory, 1984\n\n\n\"My lungs gasp for air, my eyes scream for sight\nI promise the rise of my body this night\"\n\"I tear at the lid, my fingers they bleed\"\n\n- Venom, 1982\n\nBoth songs are called Raise The Dead, and both albums share another title called Sacrifice. Oops.\n\nIf this album were to come out today Bathory might have considered a laughing stock and possibly driven out of metal for such outright plagiarism. In this respect, we should be quite grateful for the inaccessibility of the underground because Bathory would not have been able to transform into the monster they would become. Nonetheless, for the reputation that this album has, you'd figure it would be more accomplished. For all the T-shirts and posing with this album cover akin to posing with the Holy Grail of metal, one wonders why The Return, Under The Sign of the Black Mark and even Blood Fire Death are considered anything accept failures to match the raw witchery of the debut. Except that that popular opinion and history consistently shows that while the first Bathory album is quality, it simply doesn't do what its successors do. Not to mention that that Storm of Damnation intro, atmospheric as fuck as it may be, just goes on for too long, especially when you realize it's a loop. You're scared for the first sixty seconds or so but you just want Hades to start already.\n\nBut one thing that is very apparent about Quorthon is that even here he is a much better musician than all three members of Venom combined. Granted that's not saying a whole lot, but all it takes is one cursory listen of the last half of Necromansy to realize that the man has more musical feeling in his fretboad than a majority of most traditional metal soloists. His solos are simple, melodic, yet very fierce. The man ain't afraid to shred either. Again, just listen to the chaos of Necromansy's solo as the final salvo switches to a Bloodlust/Phantom of the Opera style assault. The rhythm section is merely just a simple backing rhythm whether it be lightning fast, thrashy, or even arena rock-esque with Raise The Dead. If Quorthon would have put together a fabulously evil video for this song it would have been huge on MTV (or at least as huge as any of the Manowar videos were). Another subtle difference is the vocal tone of Quorthon as opposed to Venom. I wasn't making the military comparisons for the sake of senority. Cronos sounds as if he's giving a speech under a bloody, black satanic flag. But Quorthon's raspiness gives it almost a demon tone. Like an underling wanting to start a mutiny. Cronos at least kinda sounded like a human.\n\nThe Bathory debut is a very good album and an important stepping stone in black metal, but let's act not they stepped out of Venom's (or even Hellhammer's) shadow just yet. If you want this because you want to hear Venom but just don't feel like putting on Welcome To Hell or Black Metal, by all means get it. Not to mention as a black metal fan your collection is not complete without this album.\n\nRecommended Songs:\n\nWar\nReaper\nNecromansy\nRaise The Dead\n",
        "\nWhen someone so iconic, legendary, and influential leaves a void impossible to fill after his death, it's not uncommon for fans to rummage through some material that might appeal to them. In this case, it is a sequel that Quorthon recorded as a continuation of his previous album in Bathory. The project ended up unfinished though, as it was thought that Quorthon would record a series of offering until \"Nordland IV\". However, some people purported (even Quorthon himself) that the story ends here. Everything has an ending. Even with all that, Nordland II is still a great work where an emotive track called \"The Land\" highlights the album. And we can arguably agree that the mentioned song is one of Quorthon's magnum opus. There's practically a trace of explicit magic and pagan spirit of its early years in this release. The band continued to polish, with artisan patience, the idea of composing with progressive planes. This style of Bathory's songwriting modernized the album concept, in search of rhythms and environments that can flow naturally inside the mathematic instinct along with the import of scales from Scandinavian folk music.\n\nThe album has that powerful punch even in the beginning moments. This certain impact gives the album a character that seems to impose an impression that the whole offering was specially dedicated (again) to those who had waited (including yours truly), with hopes of listening to the legendary Swede again, for ten years. Listeners are enchanted on this stuff that doesn't leave you indifferent from the first second; because, unlike an ordinary disc, this record starts with a slow and heavy riff accompanied with vocal lines which transmit a lot of energy without much effort. The opening track itself is a piece of art in the same vein of previous Bathory album openers. This reminds me of a competition between Bathory's Storm of Damnation and Revelation of Doom, in which those two has the creepiest opener. But the creepy aspect disappears here and it opens to a new age style, announcing good aura. The roller coaster ride continues with songs which reflects majestic lead guitars and contains lyrics that will make you catch your breath once you abide by, because of its extreme emotions and physical resistance. The ending track is a proof that songs do not need to implant too much speed and extreme resources. That is why we find dynamic composition and varied structure in this release, plus it is full of vitality. The production itself is one of the raw ones you can find in the genre. That new age style mixed with old Bathory material is just great. It is rawer than Blood On Ice, but it\u2019s subservient in terms of songwriting.\n\nIf Bathory did rescue the scene during the late 90s with Blood on Ice, Quorthon rescued Bathory once more with this offering and end up reconquering the scene with an endorsed attitude. The band is reborn for a second time with a work that offers prodigious minutes of musical glory. Nine songs in which Quorthon demonstrated that he can still continue giving class regardless of the decade, thanks to moments in the album that will give the audiences nostalgia of Bathory's best classics without leaving aside the necessary renewal. It really feels good how the band had managed to sound like a full-fledged band, since the intentions were clear from the first chord, and Bathory held its stance throughout each piece of music. The instrumental verbiage, characteristic of Bathory, persists through a more paused eloquence which doesn't lose its appeal. I mean, a mosaic of rhythms that passes quickly by the ears which simply stands as a warning of the potential that this disc brings. The choirs sound powerful and it shines with their own lights.\n\nI think Nordland II is an easy record to listen to, but it takes several turns in our players to convince us how good it is. And that's not even calculating the countless arrangements and colors which are being discovered with each listening. It\u2019s an elaborate, complex, and very well cared-for production record. For die-hard fans of this style, the album can be considered as one of the great releases of Bathory for the last time. Fans of both the band and the genre won't regret to hear it. For those who are not into the genre and Bathory, it will be a good album to have in the library. Bathory condensed its most spectacular features, where melody matters as much as precision and fierceness. It has not been the pagan fantasy -the usual resource- which had given the most accurate ingredient to this final chapter. Instead, it is the love of Quorthon's culture and Norse mythology. Quorthon, an illustrious expression of Scandinavian folklore, simple and eternal, thanks for the tireless struggle against time and its advances.\n",
        "\nMany were overwhelmed by Quorthon's nearly decade of inactivity in the metal realm (Blood On Ice was recorded in the 80's), despite it all, his latest discs are not as popular as it deserves to be. It\u2019s an understandable situation, but it is still somewhat ungrateful. I say it because of the number of reviews for the band's latest albums. We don't really know, but we do know that popularity has nothing to do with the quality of certain discs. Obviously, I'm talking like many who was not satisfied with the previous release (I really liked it). In this disc, this band from the northern land give us a trip through different emotions and moods, and those natural instinctive state of mind show that this album was composed with a true passion for a not so appreciated style. Their discs are not just discs: they're journeys, stories, and experiences. A wonderful thing which in my case it has already been the soundtrack of many of my winters.\n\nThe first thing that I like to highlight about this offering is the great sound and production of the album as a whole, showing us a proposal that is rather sober and only focuses on the cleanliness of instrumental performances, a considerable improvement if you compare it with Destroyer of Worlds. Nordland I overflows with a class from the first minute. Folk passages introduce songs that, with environmental keyboards and strong riffs, it gives us a solid and elegant stuff in the vein to Home of Once Brave, as we can hear in the title track for example, with the weight that this comparison takes. Sometimes the listener can elucidate accelerated and no pauses moments, as the song progress, which shows us endless instrumental arrangements which adorn Quorthon's vocals accompanied by female vocals chanting grandiloquently that do nothing more than embellishing it and passing comfortably through different atmospheres that we like so much.\n\nYou probably think it's time to relive the old school with this release. You're right. Although its predecessor Destroyer of Worlds was received in a somewhat lukewarm passion, at this point is when the fans were reconnected with this proposal that Quorthon offered. This album brings back aggressiveness and frenetic solos\u2026 perfectly executed! If you liked Hammerheart, be assured that you will like this one. There are songs full of solos and they sounded as if the performer was schooling the public on how to do viking metal. If there is a viking/celtic metal school, these songs would be used to teach children the basic concepts of this style. Few things are more emotional than Quorthon in an acoustic performance. Tracks like Ring of Gold, Man of Iron, The Ravens, and Song to Hall Up High are set in a mood where the audiences would want to grab handkerchiefs. You may find that Quorthon had his best performance on this album with those mentioned songs above, but the rest of the materials in the record is good in its own right. Unfortunately, everything has its end, the closing track relaxes all neurons, particles, and any part of us that has been asking for water because of the intense emotions on the previous songs. Heimfard gives us a remarkably quiet inspired ending which reminds us that good viking metal is not always pure guitar playing. A good viking metal album is about compositional quality and the band's execution, a clear example given by Quorthon on this release which gives us a simple space of nostalgia and relaxation, simply a monumental closure for a monumental return.\n\nQuorthon may not be the best singer in the genre, but that man bequeathed his soul in the legacy that he left us, and nobody can take away that merit. Nobody is able to create a world as the Swede did, so many times imitated but never matched. Both the epic and black elements on this release hypnotizes me more than usual. Altogether, the tracks here are an excellent introduction to viking music, perhaps with a new age touch. We appreciate the apparition of orchestrations which accompany it as a backdrop, as well as the omnipresent acoustic guitar, the oscillations between chorus and vocals; and above all, the ability to produce suggestive and emotive melodies. We had to wait ten years to be able to hear Bathory's full power again, a time when we even thought that maybe we would never enjoy those tremendous riffs again which Tomas Forsberg's mind had bestowed upon us. Nobody can boast of having so many albums and classics which produce a collective catharsis as we such lived in this eleventh episode.\n",
        "\nIt is very well documented in metal that when a frontman changes his horizons, hordes of fans become disgusted with those changes; although there are numerous enthusiasts who venture to give a chance to something new. There are bands that do this type of experimentation and then they were able to pick everything up and pull through after. Others bands did experience it twice and had survived the first time, but not the next time (you say Octagon?). Five years after releasing the magnificent Blood On Ice, Quorthon, striving to please his fans, did offer us a diverse material, ranging from viking metal to retro thrash stuff. The Swede was one of those who did burn their bridges at cost of giving us hymns of rebellion. The production itself is neither good nor bad this time. It's just Bathory sounding like Bathory.\n\nBeginning with a great opener, it is a crushing and strident one that shows us the infallible identity of Bathory, and worthy to fit on a disc like Twilight of the Gods. Throughout the album, you can see Quorthon's vocals ability which is combined with a mixture of aggressiveness with a bluesy interlude that shows Quorthon's willingness to try new ways without damaging the project's armor. Without sounding like a transgression or a forced turn, this unique moment is an example of evolution that can be appreciated, especially considering that Bathory had to venture beyond its dominions in its last years. Yes, despite how good Nordland I & II were. Also, there are elements which coexist throughout the album, as the death 'n' roll song Krom, the death/groove impulsivity of Death From Above and the fun groove track Sudden Death. All these songs work fine in terms of riffs and solos. The 8+ minutes tracks are two sides of the same coin -like the first three songs- that bear witness to Bathory style, not necessarily in look for a communion point, but in taking advantage to the contrast in intensity transitions. This album, in addition to being pleasant in terms of the sound experience, is a concrete qualitative reference when it comes to imagining the versatile potential of Bathory's music.\n\nI don\u2019t recommend this to starters; this should rather be the last thing you should hear from this band. For some people, Quorthon was wrong for the third and last time. For others, this is simply a misunderstood work. Quorthon's insolence and daring to explore different sounds is more than remarkable. As if we talk about colors, surely this album would be a rainbow in terms of genre. This release can be seen as another enemy and is unquestionably forgotten in its chapter's history. And who knows, if not for Lake of Fire, we probably wouldn\u2019t have other great experimental classics. It\u2019s a striking album that shows Quorthon's versatility when we talk about writing songs in order to please his different fans. I even noticed that the weakest songs here were an improved version of what he had done in Requiem, and to a lesser extent, Octagon. The disc as a whole may be confusing and ambiguous, but you'll get used to it if you follow my tip of what to do with certain fillers, in the next paragraph.\n\nDestroyer of Worlds was a good response to the long wait for a new Bathory album, as well as a return to form, but in a viking/death/groove metal format. Perhaps for some people, this will not be a fundamental piece of the band's discography, but the solidity of this work is undeniable on the compositional level. The brutal and sometimes melodic sections mix in a way that doesn\u2019t lose the band's essence, so this work should be liked by those who followed them before, as well for those who know less about (maybe). After listening to the album a lot of times, I consider that the most disposable songs are 109, Kill Kill Kill and Bleeding. I did get the digital version of this record, and then I created my own tracklist based on 10 songs and 55 minutes. The album as a whole improves considerably and it is most certainly better than Octagon and Requiem.\n",
        "\nIt is a drama that Quorthon died much too soon, even though some of his works are really a pain in the ass. He was the chameleon of metal, his drastic stylistic changes were hard to understand but everybody with a predilection for great metal will find some jewels in Bathory's discography. \"Blood Fire Death\" belongs to the strongest efforts of Quorthon, at least for those who do not think that pure Viking metal is the ultimate sub genre.\n\nIt is a drama that the album did not continue the bloodline of the perfect \"Under the Sign of the Black Mark\". The songs are not too far away from those of the aforementioned monument. \"The Golden Walls of Heaven\" stands shoulder to shoulder with \"Massacre\", inter alia due to its straight verses. The stomping \"For All Those Who Died\" is a close relative of \"Call From the Grave\". Nevertheless, the more metallic sound and the longer duration of the single tracks give the album another flavor. Not to mention the elaborate and atmospheric intro which constitutes the acoustic complement of the classic artwork. Celestial choirs and whinnying horses make clear where Rob Darken once found his inspiration... Admittedly, the serious grandeur of the gatefold vinyl does not mean that the lone fighter is unable to make a joke. The beginning of \"Pace 'till Death\" picks up the squeaking riff of Venom's \"Teacher's Pet\". With a twinkle in his eyes, Quorthon sends greetings to his idols. But from an overall perspective, this is a much more serious work than the somewhat bizarre \"Under the Sign...\". \n\nIt is a drama that \"Blood Fire Death\" marks the point where the adventurous Swede began to lose his enthusiasm for sheer aggression. Let's face the ironic twist of fate: the two epic numbers of this album are absolutely brilliant, but in hindsight, they implemented the seed of lethargy in Quorthon's creative outputs. I know that many metal maniacs have built an altar for \"Hammerheart\" and \"Twilight of the Gods\", but I don't share this point of view, because the overly dignified approach has not much in common with the rebellious touch that made heavy metal to something special. However, I don't want to digress. \"Blood Fire Death\" cannot be blamed for lameness and with the exception of wide parts of the pretty noisy \"Dies Irae\", all songs have an exciting aura. (At least \"Dies Irae\" deserves the honour that its excerpt \"Even the heavens shall burn when we are gathered\" might have inspired Marduk in their search for a fitting album title.) \"For All Those Who Died\", for example, scores with its overarching vehemence. Sheer power crushes the audience, despite the comparatively stupid mid-tempo rumbling.\n\nIt is a drama that the best track of the full-length offers. Indeed, a more dramatic song is hardly imagineable. Switching between soft choirs, which are accompanied by an emotional guitar, and thunderous, painfully intensive metal pathos, the song develops an unbelievable power and one sees raging flames before the inner eye. Apart from this emotional rollercoaster, the guitar work is extremely strong and Quorthon sings and screams more passionate than ever before. It is time for great emotions at the latest when lines like \"With hair as white as snow / Hammer of steel / To set you free of your chains / And to lead you all / Where horses run free / And the souls of the ancient ones reign\" mark the title track's point of culmination. \"A Fine Day to Die\" does not stand in the shadow of the titanic closer. After a silent intro, the song explodes and harsh screams accompany brutal guitars. Space-filling leads roll out the carpet for Quorthon's hoarse, cruel and charismatic vocals. Finally, a melodic element is added as well.\n\nIt is a drama (but no unique event) that some media did not understand the greatness of \"Blood Fire Death\". The German Rock Hard spoke of ridiculous solos and hyper-perverse vocals while giving generously seven out of ten points. Okay, they tried to entertain the readers, but come on, stop writing - start your career as clown. I do not find any kind of ridiculous (but a lot of unleashed) solos and a kick in the ass of the mainstream is almost never \"hyper-perverse\", but a necessary act of resistance. The coarse and devastating production which lacks any form of nuances sets the right frame for such an act. Technical details are for wimps and maybe this was the thing that the joker of the Rock Hard was missing. But despite all these \"dramas\": the only truly tragic drama is the one I have already mentioned in the first sentence of this review. Quorthon, rest in peace.\n",
        "\nIt was panful to see Quorthon (R.I.P.) of all metal artists wandering aimlessly through the 90\u2019s and beyond, looking to hook himself to whichever metal current seemed like the big deal\u2026 the man who had laid the foundations for two wholesome genres within the metal field was roaming around in a hypnotized somnambul-like state, grabbing at anything that was floating nearby, trying some bashing old school thrash (\u201cRequiem\u201d) first to a mildly amusing effect, before flopping deplorably with the appaling, too-awful-to-be-described \u201cOctagon\u201d. The project he was running parallel to the Bathory career under his pseudonym wasn\u2019t much to talk about, a vehicle for the man\u2019s infatuations outside the extreme metal roster, but at least this stunt wasn\u2019t an embarrassment\u2026\n\nthen things went back to normal with \u201cBlood on Ice\u201d, and it became only too clear that this was the sound that suited the man the most\u2026 then why the album reviewed here? Instead of destroying all competition at the dawn of the new millennium with another ode to the Viking Gods, our Swedish friend decided to mix it up by making allusions to all possible styles he had gotten involved with until that point, and not only, the resultant mish-mash an awkward and not a consistently enjoyable fare. \n\n\u201cLake of Fire\u201d, while being an imposing epic opener, is totally misleading as this isn\u2019t going to be a faithful sequel to the preceding opus although the title-track still keeps the Viking doomy tension up with its officiant battle-rousing rhythms, not to mention \u201cOde\u201d, a supreme elegiac doomster that must have been left out of \u201cTwilight of the Gods\u201d, also featuring one of the man\u2019s finest vocal showings. If the rest of the album had followed this pattern, we would have had a minor masterpiece; alas, comes \u201cBleeding\u201d, and this effort starts \u201cbleeding\u201d with some sloppily assembled thrash Quorthon, immediately after his notable performance behind the mike, following with horrible improvised raven-like croaks. The music starts making more sense later, but nothing above the mediocre output of hundreds of underground thrash practitioners from the 80\u2019s. \n\nBack to the epic doomy odes with \u201cPestilence\u201d the listener still trying to adjust to this fairly uneven combination, and \u201c109\u201d may help him/her in this train of thought with its fast thrashing, headbanging riffage. Again nothing that wouldn\u2019t be forgotten almost immediately to which \u201cDeath from Above\u201d adds more with its misguided quasi-thrashy configurations which scarily remind of the disastrous \u201cOctagon\u201d. \u201cKrom\u201d is a short rock-ish non-sense again looking at the octagonal recording (remember the Kiss cover of \u201cDeuce\u201d on it), and from this moment onward the fans will start departing, also seriously pulled back by the groovy alternative charade that is \u201cLiberty & Justice\u201d. \u201cKill Kill Kill\u201d is noisy industrial that would have sat well on Ministry\u2019s \u201cPsalm 69\u201d, but here it simply doesn\u2019t pair well with anything in the vicinity, least of all with \u201cSudden Death\u201d, another pointless rockabilia nodding towards the Seattle wave (Alice in Chains, Soundgarden). \u201cWhite Bones\u201d is a confusing saga as it doesn\u2019t become clear during its 8.5-min what exactly Quorthon wants to achieve with it; is it epic, is it progressive, is it doom, is it romantic lyricism (check the sprawling balladic epitaph), is it even some form of more ponderous thrash\u2026 it can pass for all of those, sounding like a very pale copy of the similarly-styled numbers from the gargantuan \u201cBlood, Fire, Death\u201d. No second guessing on \u201cDay of Wrath\u201d, though, Quorthon wrapping on this amalgam the way he started it, with academic epic doom that will keep the fans nodding in uncertain approval for over 8-min. \n\nThrowing everything available into the furnace has never worked, and it didn\u2019t work for Quorthon either. The valiant pioneer from the 80\u2019s was lost, condemned to a brief creative purgatory, conveniently started at the beginning of a new millennium when there were clear signs that the old school was going to come back to the front. Not the worst situation to find oneself in, but it was expected a lot more from the father of two genres as his enthusiasm about the restoration of the retro metal canons wasn\u2019t very big at this particular stage. At least half the time is wasted in absolutely pointless references to the past decade having in mind that Quorthon has never fully belonged there, the thrashy outbursts having no nostalgic value whatsoever provided that there already were full-fledged tributes to the genre released. It\u2019s only the epic Viking hymns that may capture the attention, but again with so much ballast thrown around the fan may have second, even third and why not fourth or fifth, thoughts before he/she sets his/her mind on wading through this very diverse, and not in such a good way for a large portion of the time, opus. \n\nAn identity crisis of some sorts? No, I don\u2019t think so; not in this case. A careless nonchalant attitude towards the scene largely caused by the man\u2019s sudden interest in music outside the extreme metal arena\u2026 possible. Many would have packed up and left ages ago with such a voluminous contribution to the metal industry, bathing in underground glory by doing at the same time meaningless 9-5 jobs. No, not our hero; he wasn\u2019t destined to lead an ordinary life. And he had to rise; again, but not with dubious, overblown musical mixtures of the dishevelled \u201canything goes\u201d type, but by embracing his cultural heritage, and by sticking with it all the way to\u2026 \n\ntwo colossal odes to his homeland and ancestors was more than the fan could ask for. Quorthon delivered as his last contribution to the world he helped shape with so much vision, dedication, and manic devotion. He played the Wanderer for a bit, but it\u2019s easy to act as such when you know that you would invariably appear, sooner or later, as the Victor on the other end.\n",
        "\nOne of stages which metal has been passed is the viking metal; which is a genre that tries to portray the moments, history and religion of vikings, being Bathory the pioneer or main precursor since the rhythm they use is an epic, troubadour feeling that makes you think \"Wow, I'm listening to the heavy rhythm of vikings\". I present you one of the albums which Bathory got to their cusp with. I also like the cover art, almost all songs are described there. Blood on Ice was recorded in 1989 but released in 1996, because when it was recorded, the band was very focused in black metal and Quorthon, the band's creative leader (rest in peace), thought this wouldn't work and fans wouldn't like it, but after a while, he polished his project and went on sale seven years later. Sincerely, I'd wish this album were the successor of Twilights of the Gods, so this band could've got a flawless catalog that every fan would boast having \"their first seven albums\". But not, this album came after constant pressures by fans and after releasing two retro-thrash discs.\n\nThe rhythms are perfect, they're coquettish as I normally like, overwhelming and epic as fuck, although sometimes slowed down in \"Man of Iron\" or \"The Ravens\", but that's perfect because it lets you rest from so many crazy epics and lets you think what's happened there. Although the production isn't raw and polished like their predecessors, the songwriting is pretty exceptional, enjoyable from start to finish, like a cinematographic trip while you listening to story. Quorthon gives us an awesome heavy metal stuff with a proto-viking touch which will accompany the child in his epic battles against outsiders. \"Intro\" means the introduction to work, a small instrumental piece that presents a well-developed exercise, like a cinema beginning. It doesn't take too long when the most rhythmic, elegant riffs do us enter to \"Blood on Ice\" and then, we've got entirely acoustic passages like \"Man of Iron\" and \"The Ravens\", which only add variety and novelty to the album. \"The Woodwoman\" and \"The Lake\" have exceptional performances (both vocals and acoustic intro) that give an emotivity and portray a purely viking ambient. As if war preparations were concerned, the potent and powerful \"The Revenge\" gives the way to great end that the story deserves, which gathers the album essence in ten minutes.\n\nWhat would happen if this album had the same production as in \"Twilight of the Gods\" or that in \"Nordland\"? Surely, this one would've got the same estimation as those, also a massive recognition from the fans, which unfortunately didn't happen because this is a very underrated album, probably because it's interspersed between their worst albums. As I said, this album should've been released in 1994 or so, but everything affects to estimation that unconditional fan can grant to this, you probably prefer the \"Nordlands\" above this one, but anyway, this represents an essential puzzle about their viking records. Just like the missing link, as our friend hells_unicorn said, there's always a connector that unifies the pieces and explains everything, and this album is the connector between their early twins Hammerheart/Twilight and the later Nordland saga, which constitutes a collection of five albums representing the genre, being \"Blood Fire Death\" only a reminiscence of that.\n\nAgain, some people don't like this album and they despise it due to its technique or different sound. I must tell you, I disagree; therefore, I think I have the authority to defend this release, which was the saw that did split into two pieces the big steel beam that supported the grunge in 90s, along with Burzum's \"Filosofem\", also my favorite album from that year. The instrumental section has an exceptional job, especially on Vvnorth's druming and Quorthon's guitar playing, since his guitar riffs are fucking bastard, as well as the beautiful during the harmonious arpeggios in \"The Ravens\". With this masterpiece, we find again a melodic beginning, as if they told us the moments lived by the child and by all us, converted into a majestic experience that will be fought in a legendary world along with our hero, mounted on galloping guitars and epic drums. Also with the most hopeful choruses and perhaps the most successful album from their early viking era (1990, 1991, 1996). And this is friends, a clear example of how music makes us free, free to imagine, to create and to adorn the world for us. This has been my story... what's yours? Thanks for reading me.\n",
        "\nI\u2019m just going to cut to the chase: Twilight of the Gods is literally the greatest thing in the history of anything ever. It is an incredible front to back masterpiece, with every song in its place and every song having something to offer. It is one of metal\u2019s finest albums, the pinnacle of what viking metal has to offer, and finally, the greatest Bathory album of all time. What makes this album so great? Is it the best vocal performance Quorthon ever gave? The complex yet driving songwriting? The immensely immersive amount of atmosphere? The production? The inspiring and poetic lyrics? Well, yes to all of those. However, it\u2019s the sum of those things that makes this album truly a masterpiece: emotion. Emotion is a fantastic gauge of quality. While bad music makes you feel nothing and good music can make you feel familiar emotions, great music is able to make you feel something you\u2019ve never felt before. The artist can do whatever the hell he wants to your emotions. \n\nThis is the entirety of the ride through Twilight Of The Gods. Quorthon spans a number of different emotions here. He strikes fear in Song of Blood, and then proceeds to inspire courage in the very same song. Through Blood By Thunder instills an almost religious fervor, and Under The Runes a solemn fearlessness. Blood And Iron gives the listener an overwhelming sense of awestruck at it\u2019s epic tale, while the titanic title track is a tragic lamentation at the state of society that truly pulls at the heartstrings. To Enter Your Mountain summons a feeling of righteous defiance as well as a lifelike sense of adventure. Finally, Hammerheart gives the listener that unique sense of satisfaction that you only get on your deathbed while you see the Valkyries coming to take you away to the Hall up High. All of this together creates one of the most effective and believably epic, beautiful and inspiring listening experiences of all time.\n\nSonically and lyrically, it\u2019s rather different from the other four of it\u2019s kind in Bathory\u2019s catalog. The entire album has this incredibly unique spiritual quality, which is remarkably sincere and authentic. The album has greater use of acoustic guitars and choirs, giving the album an almost religious sound. The viking religion of course. The entire album is mid-tempo as well, which ends up making it feel less like a metal album, which is actually key to this album\u2019s greatness. Quorthon\u2019s vocals are one of the biggest pieces of the puzzle. He actually became a good singer, while his incredible delivery from this album's predecessor remains. The result is an extremely impassioned performance with remarkable conviction, and a great singing voice. It\u2019s this vocal performance, Quorthon\u2019s best to date, that strongly contributes to the album\u2019s unique sound. Rather than being raw and haphazard like Hammerheart and the Nordlands, or sharp like Blood On Ice, Twilight Of The Gods is gentle to the touch and forgiving, but very firm and robust underneath. It\u2019s the softest Bathory album, with it\u2019s acoustic guitars and strong sense of melody, but heavy and complex all the same, with hints of technicality and many a hard-hitting riff.\n\nIf nothing else, this album just has some damn good songs. Twilight of the Gods is a 14-minute epic with quite possibly the best use of choirs in all of metal, with a constantly building atmosphere that gives me chills every time I hear it. Through Blood By Thunder is a fantastic feel-good anthem of sorts, while Blood and Iron is a ballsy 10 minute epic with storytelling lyrics. Under The Runes is incredibly bad ass, and is oftentimes the favorite of people who don't like this album. To Enter Your Mountain is incredibly catchy, while Song Of Blood is the darkest, heaviest and most ominous song from this era of Bathory. Finally, Hammerheart is an incredibly beautiful and heart-wrenching ballad based off of Gustav Holst's Jupiter, The Bringer Of Jollity from his The Planets suite.\n\nTechnically, Twilight Of The Gods is Quorthon at top form. The production, while not as clear, only adds to the music. It\u2019s the murkiness, and occasional mud that makes some of the album's moments hit so hard. The choirs in the title track wouldn\u2019t be effective, the atmosphere of Song Of Blood wouldn\u2019t be so potent, Through Blood By Thunder wouldn\u2019t be so uplifting, and so on. The mixing is fantastic as well, with every instrument at a perfect volume, and the less audible bass giving the album it\u2019s obligatory thickness. While technically kind of terrible, the production in effect couldn\u2019t be better. Quorthon himself is on fire as well, with his guitar playing and vocals at top form. Some of his best soloing can be found here, and the acoustic guitar is almost timeless. He also gives one of metal\u2019s greatest vocal performances ever, delivering more emotion than some vocalists do in their entire careers, in addition to a much cleaner and prettier timbre, instead of sounding like Cartman with throat cancer.\n\nIn conclusion, Twilight Of The Gods is nothing short of a masterpiece. Every single song on the album is 10/10, and every one of them is impeccably written and performed, with masterful lyrics and incredible use of atmosphere and emotion. This album is such a divergence from the notion of metal as well. Rather than being a kickass riff fest, or even just an atmospheric journey that you might get from this end of the black metal spectrum, it is truly a work of sonic art that transcends the tropes of any genre. It has masterful emotional portrayals, tales of mythic proportions and even important messages, on top of many riffs and melodies worth remembering. Even though the album is 57 minutes long, it feels closer to 45, as every second of it has something incredible to offer. It\u2019s one of the best written, most potent, inspiring, well crafted and beautiful albums ever created. The album is a pure journey, and absolutely Quorthon\u2019s true masterpiece.\n",
        "\nIf this album was meant to be a joke, then I want to kill my humour. Quorthon (R.I.P.) has produced many acoustic curiosities, but it would be a euphemism to describe \"Octagon\" as a curiosity. It lacks of charm, character, mysticism and - to get to the nitty-gritty - good or even acceptable tunes. Already the stylistic classification is problematic. Is this post thrash? Is it a slack form of noisecore? Is it music at all?\n\nWell, Quorthon intends to raise some hell and, unlike \"Twilight of the Gods\" or \"Hammerheart\", the album does not offer consensus metal. So far, so good. But the mostly rapid yet completely stupid hammering of the drum computer (?) as well as the total absence of intelligent guitar work lead to a devastating overall picture. There are no sharp riffs and no compelling leads, but solos without rhyme or reason in abundance. Most songs seem to be based on only one tone and this is nothing but a shame. Velocity alone is no crucial factor and the first five tracks confirm this statement impressively. \"Century\" slows down the pace, but its substandard, somehow uninspired riffing also fails to draw the attention of the listener. By the way, the track is insubstantial (and the same applies for most parts of the album). Believe me, despite its non-excessive duration of four minutes, \"Century\" is just too long.\n\nLet's leave the song material to its own devices and have a look at the mix. It must be better than the musical content, everything else is unimaginable. But I never had much fantasy and so it is no surprise that the flat, brittle, undifferentiated, slightly dissonant and noisy production sucks. Especially the guitars have a somewhat unnatural and annoying sound. Be that as it may, the expressionless vocals are not better. Quorthon reaches his all time low in \"Schizianity\". His clean vocals are crude enough to make the whole extreme metal community fall on its knees and cry bitterly. But I freely admit that the lyrics are simply true. \"The world is so full of fools\" - and I am one of them, because I bought this trash.\n\n\"War Supply\" has a part that remotely resembles a chorus and this is enough in order to be the \"best\" piece, if we leave the cover version out of consideration. At this point, it is time to ask for compassion for Paul Stanley and Gene Simmons. Yes, they wrote many mediocre tracks and nevertheless, they became millionaires. Thus, there is actually no reason for compassion. But even incomprehensibly rich men do not deserve that one of their songs is part of \"Octagon\". \"Deuce\" shows that pretty solid riffs can be helpful in order to pen a hard rock / metal song... I will never understand Quorthon's intention behind \"Octagon\". And no, my rating is not a joke.\n",
        "\nOne tends to notice that of the early Bathory records, the self titled and Under The Sign of the Black Mark get the most praise. This one gets suspiciously ignored. Usually the complaints are lauded at the production. I certainly hope these aren\u2019t the same people that love Transilvanian Hunger and Filosofem for their minimalism, because minimalism is sort of a point for black metal. Yes the production and the guitar sound is a little odd, but that doesn\u2019t stop it from being a great record. You could almost argue that this is the first true black metal album because while the ideas aren\u2019t as streamlined as on Black Mark, most of the Venom tendencies are gone, and the fast sections are played faster than Slayer would ever hope to do, even in 1985! Songwriting wise, it\u2019s has a tad more variety than the first album, but it\u2019s not the plethora of different ideas as on Black Mark. In fact that\u2019s pretty much this album in a nutshell, better than the first album, but not quite as good as the one that came after it.\n\nThere are definitely some moments on here that can be considered thrash. Born For Burning seems more like it belongs on Show No Mercy or Infernal Overkill than Worship Him. But that's A-Ok because Show No Mercy fucking owns. Who said thrash tendencies were a bad thing? There's the thrash break in Sadist, which is a rev up the mosh-pit moment if I've ever heard one. Bestial Lust is kinda thrashy but with more of a speed metal feel to it, almost like something that Exodus would have written for Bonded By Blood Rite of Darkness/Reap of Evil (yes its one song dammit) is certainly the most dynamic track which certainly feature thrash moments both fast and slow, just behold the practically triple time transition into the songs second half, followed by the breakdown that is so minimalist yet so heavy the musicians themselves seemed to forget where the time was. Then of course, there is the album's finest moment, the title track, which just rips face, flesh and bone with that intro riff. Plus who could forget that anthem like chorus? Anyone who felt traditional song-structures had no place in black metal is a fucking idiot, and this is exhibit A.\n\nOf course, the lead guitar is excellent. It is simple, yet fierce. It is shredding, yet melodic. Virtuosity will always have a place in metal, but sometimes its better to do what is necessary. Quorthon's lead guitar style can best be described as imagining Eric Clapton was born a decade or so later in Sweden and had a penchant for virgin sacrifices. At times there seems like there are only maybe 3 or 4 notes total in his solos but he utilizes them very effectively. Inversely, it seems as though Stefan Larsson and Andreas can barely meet the necessary competency for their instruments. Yet, the struggling rhythm section fits the album perfectly. This is what truly gives this album its black mark. Especially during the fast songs like Total Destruction; such an effort to gel yet not quite establishes an off-center feel which will make first time, as well as veteran listeners extremely uneasy. Of course this approach would be perfected on Pleasure To Kill but now I'm just discussing measly semantics. \n\nIf there is a flaw here its that the intro, Revelation of Doom just goes on for too long, similar to the previous album's intro track. There's establishing atmosphere and then there's overcooking the chicken to the point where its dryer than a scorpion's cunt. Although at least this time it's more dynamic, relying on feedback and tortured screams and not just the same blustery day loop on repeat. Quorthon would hit the sweet spot with Nocturnal Obeisance, under a minute, which sets up the vicious scare perfectly.\n\nThe Return (of the Darkness & Evil) is one of two albums I would recommend newcomers to Bathory and black metal purchase first. While the debut has an infamous reputation, there was still a low rent Venom feel that it never completely shook off. But this? This is where black metal gained the blueprint which everyone afterwards would follow.\n\nRecommended tracks:\nThe Return of The Darkness & Evil\nBorn For Burning\nRite of Darkness/Reap of Evil\n",
        "\nTwilight of the Gods is the successor to the definitive album of Bathory's \"Viking era\", Hammerheart. Hammerheart was an epic, triumphant album that struck hard as steel, seemingly trying to usher in a new era of Bathory's discography. Unfortunately, it's sequel, Twilight of the Gods is somewhat underwhelming in comparison.\n\nThe title track opens the album with a fairly soft, atmospheric theme. At this point, it seems like a less foreboding, premonition inducing version of \"Shores in Flames\", the track that opened Hammerheart. Then, the choral arrangements, drum machine, and acoustic guitars come in, creating a very repetitive, trance-inducing section. This is where the album already starts to fall back from the high standards of its predecessor. The sound is sort of hard to explain, best described as \"washed away\". It doesn't carry the distinctive sound of Bathory. Fortunately, this is one of the worst tracks on the album. \"Blood and Iron\" is a straight up masterpiece, consisting of a beautiful acoustic solo followed by some of Bathory's heaviest, most menacing riffs. Twilight of the Gods is often denounced as the least aggressive Bathory album, and while it may lack intense drumming and harsh vocals, some of these riffs are pretty fucking heavy, creating a \"wall of sound\" so to speak.\n\nTwilight of the Gods definitely slows things down a bit from what they were before. There is little black metal or thrash metal influence to be found here; instead it has been replaced by doom and power metal, with slower, more melodic riffing. There is also one outlier, \"Under the Runes\". It sounds very classic in nature, hearkening back to late 70s with its weird new wave riff. Quorthon's now virtually completely clean vocals intensify this aesthetic; he sounds like the singer of a glam metal band like Def Leppard almost. I think that Twilight of the Gods showcases his weakest vocal performance. Technically speaking, Quorthon has never been a \"good\" singer, being unable to moderate his pitch well, but generally he has compensated for that in his ability to scream powerfully. His softer approach here just makes him sound awkward. \n\nIn conclusion, while I don't like saying it, Twilight of the Gods is Bathory's weakest Viking metal album. In all honesty, it used to blow me away, maybe my tastes have matured, or maybe I have just listened to it way too much. Either way, despite it having a few great songs, it is inarguably plagued by inconsistency. It's definitely something a Bathory fan should hear at least once, but if you want a true masterpiece, go with Hammerheart or either of the Nordland albums.\n",
        "\nAfter Bathory released the masterpiece that was Under the Sign of the Black Mark, they were left with a big void to fill musically. The album written to fill this role was Blood Fire Death. This album is often hailed as the \"first Viking metal album\" and recognised as influential for this reason, and while this isn't really any sort of departure from black metal, it is still a monumental album and representative of a transitional period for Bathory.\n\nA classically inspired choral opening, entitled \"Odens Ride over Nordland\", begins the album, giving it a dark, pseudo-religious aesthetic due to the piece's resemblance to choral church music. Then, the slow, marching battle anthem \"A Fine Day to Die\" comes in, first with some acoustics and more choral work, and then the heavy riffs and chilling screams. This track makes it immediately clear why this album is heralded amongst black metal fans. It is essentially a war anthem of sorts. The production is not as good as it was when it reached its epitome on Under the Sign of the Black Mark, but it's close and still fitting for the album. It is a bit less typical of Bathory, but still dark, brutal and menacing.\n\nMusically, Blood Fire Death contains more tempo related extremes, being laden with both thrashy stuff and more room inspired stuff, even more so than its predecessor. The songs are more militant, dealing more with war, battle, and death than Satanism, Hell, and the other more mainstream Occult musings of earlier Bathory. The, music itself, being more violent and less eerie fits these lyrics themes well. The appearance of Nordic themes has yet to come into full fruition, with only some vague references to Norse deities being found on this album. If \"war metal\" were an actual genre, this album would be hailed as it's roots. When one hears the chorus of \"The Golden Walls of Heaven\" or \"Holocaust\", they cannot help but be charged with fearsome energy.\n\nTwo new musicians appear on Blood Fire Death. Vvornth on drums Kothaar on bass. The former is an insane drummer. He pounds the shit out of the drumset, creating some violent blastbeats mixed in with more straightforward, yet forceful parts. When listening to Bathory, my main focus is usually on the atmosphere, vocals, and lyrics, however Vvornth is definitely an unsung great of the drum world, and adds another element to this album. Quorthon's vocals have lost some of their morbid edge, in favor of a more standard, yet more violent sound. He doesn't sound as evil as he used to here, though I'm not sure if the more evil sound would even fit on Blood Fire Death.\n\nIf you are interested in black metal, even to the slightest, Blood Fire Death (along with almost all of Bathory's discography), is a necessity in your emporium of black metal records.\n",
        "\nRequiem is another example of a failed comeback album. Many bands do this a lot, after either softening or changing their styles. After the sort of half-hearted Twilight of the Gods came out, Bathory sort of fell to ashes for the time being, with Quorthon then favouring his solo project. When he decided to return to Bathory, the result was a less than triumphant comeback album, Requiem. This album is generally regarded as a fuckup in Bathory's discography, and generally a piss poor album, however, one should think about one thing. What if this were released in the 80s alongside albums like Kreator's Pleasure to Kill. It would likely have been hailed as an influential thrash masterpiece, and possibly an important element of the conception of black metal. Unfortunately, however, it's sound did not resonate well with most metal fans.\n\nRequiem is a very stripped down blackened thrash metal album, and it follows an almost punk-like underground ethic. There is also some discernible death metal influence here, with the blastbeats and thrash riffs slowing into heavy grooves. The production is dismal and empty, however it happens to work masterfully here. It sounds like what one would expect to hear after looking at the field of crushed skulls on the album cover-it's raw, thrashy, militant extreme metal. This is a very fitting return to a more brutal sound after the softer Twilight of the Gods. Quorthon's vocals strive to achieve a black metal rasp, however his voice seems a little burnt out by this point, and comes off as a very unique cigarette laden scream.\n\nLyrically, one could consider this to be an extreme regression. The epic, Pagan themed lyrics of the previous two albums, and the macabre imagery of the ones before that is gone in favour of lines like \"Holy Jesus fucking Christ, forgive my fucking head, it's full of doubts and questions, did you really raise the dead?\". While he does sound immature, these lines are fun and at times make very valid points. No one can argue against how much fun it is to sing along with the belligerent chorus of \"War Machine\", one of the best songs on the album. Other highlights include \"Crosstitution\" \"Pax Vobiscum\", and the more death metal sounding \"Distinguish to Kill\" and \"Apocalypse\".\n\nWhile Requiem is not hailed as a masterpiece, and honestly it has no reason to be amongst Bathory's higher opuses, it is still a worthwhile album to listen to.\n",
        "\nAs far as Viking material goes, it seemed that Hammerheart and Twilight of the Gods had drained Quorthon of creative energy. Thus, he released two good blackened thrash albums, and also put out the excellent Blood on Ice, which consisted of old material, some harvested straight from the demo tape and some re-recorded. Destroyer of Worlds marks Quorthon's attempt at releasing a triumphant return to the Nordic sound.\n\nDestroyer of Worlds is introduced with \"Lake of Fire\". The song begins with a very simple and obvious acoustic intro, then it becomes a slow, plodding doom march that edges on going somewhere, but in the end goes nowhere. A few sections reminisce slightly on his earlier music, but for the most part, this song just seems desperate. The title track is next, and it's grooving riffs and fucking awesome lyrics render it to being a fairly good song. Unfortunately, after the next track, the album begins to fall apart into something caught in the rift between black metal and groove metal.\n\nMost of the riffs on Destroyer of Worlds are actually very heavy and energizing, and they are almost reminiscent of groove metal bands like Pantera or Lamb of God. This catchy style is not bad at all, but it creates some inconsistency against the more epic stuff found on the album. Some of these tracks, especially \"Death from Above\", \"Kill Kill Kill\", and \"Krom\" are quite fun to listen to. The lyrics on Destroyer of Worlds mostly deal with the problems that plague society, mainly war and nuclear weapons. His writing style has seemingly returned to the realm of maturity after his stint with writing lines such as \"Eat my shit, suck my dick\". He employs some excellent descriptive imagery, especially on the title track. Quorthon's vocal delivery isn't very good here. His voice itself is standard fare when it comes to his clean singing, however the production masks it. He still uses some screams as well. These are not, however, his horrifying black metal screams, they are more in the vein of the flat raspy shouts he did during his thrash era, with some distortion added for effect.\n\nOne of the biggest problems with Destroyer of Worlds is its length. It is in fact Bathory's longest album, and is over an hour long, which would be okay if this were an hour or masterful black metal or Viking metal, but no, the majority of this album is occupied by groove/death type stuff. Many of these songs work well on their own, but in the context of an hour long album, they become boring and monotonous.\n\nDestroyer of the Worlds is not the kind of album you listen to in its entirety. It's more something to buy digitally and pick out whatever song you want to listen to at the time. Honestly, there isn't a bad song on this album, save for \"Lake of Fire\", it's just that the album isn't cohesive enough to listen to in full.\n",
        "\nThe year 1985 was overall one of the greatest in the history of heavy metal music. Tons of bands were spawning around the globe and bringing many different sound perspectives. Bathory were among them, and really succeeded, to say the least. Here we see the release of their second studio album called \"The Return......\", and as Quorthon said, the full title is \"The Return of the Darkness and Evil\". This name totally represent what you would expect from the album just by looking at the cover art. Let's say that when listening to this album, you are not in the same game anymore then the self-titled album. In 1985 saw a great competition going on, which was who play the most evil, satanic, dark and aggressive music in the metal scene?\n\nWell, now that Bathory had an album out, they were a known act in the underground scene and had already a fan base. Quorthon looked up what was going on elsewhere on the globe, other bands such as Slayer, Kreator, Sodom, Destruction, Celtic Frost were also part of the game. After hearing tracks from bands like those, he decided to choose another path and change the sound for that record by doing something that was more original. That was quite successful, because this album sounds totally different from what was going on by this time. It definitely beat out all releases of that year in terms of evilness and darkness, from there comes a more realistic way of defining the black metal genre that the scenes of the 90s used as an influence later on.\n\nThe album begins with an typical intro like on the previous one, but \"Revelation of Doom\" is even darker and I may also add a better fit into the atmosphere intended for the album. After getting you into obscurity, the album kick off with the song \"Total Destruction\", and this is probably one of the best way to blow off the listener with speed, aggression, brutality and even with catchy passages. All the songs featured on the album have a short length, averaging the 3 minutes. There's one exception though, the track \"Born for Burning\" show us with a 5 minutes the progress made in the band by gaining experience in songwriting. It's basically the only song without a fast-paced tempo, but contain one of the most memorable lyrics and chorus of the album. While tracks such as \"Bestial Lust (Bitch)\" still have similarities with what you can hear on the first record. The sound and production quality on \"The Return......\" is somewhat better than on the s/t. This album wasn't recorded in the \"Heaven Shore Studio\" and is the only exception of all the recordings of Bathory during the 80s. Instead, this one was done in the same studio as the two tracks from the \"Scandinavian Metal Attack\" compilation album. The \"The Return of the Darkness and Evil\" track also appeared on the compilation, but was played much slower than the actual version on the official record.\n\nMusically speaking, It's an overall improvement in every way, distancing himself abit from the Motorhead influence, the guitar playing of Quorthon is again top notch and still contains the cool improvised solos, the drums are even better than before. There we have some cool drumming beats actually, just a listen to \"Total Destruction\" and \"Reap of Evil\" will show you what I mean. The bass guitar this time is now correctly audible, I can even say that it's one of the best mixed album of its genre... It's just the perfect atmosphere and tone, it wouldn't have been so good without this sort of production. Quorthon's vocals are darker and evil with small added backing vocals in some songs that you will notice easily. While lyrically similar to its predecessor, he added some personal touch to it, like sex fantasies he had with a girl if i can say it that way... But in general, it's a bit more worked and shows some brilliant words in its own blasphemic art.\n\nIn closing, I absolutely recommend anyone who are into the darker side of metal music to look up to this album. It has often been hidden below its successor \"Under The Sign of the Black Mark\" as the incontestable black metal album of the 80s, but \"The Return......\" definitely helped to define the genre and is worthy of being considered as a classic and must heard album. Clocking at nearly 37 minutes with its fantastic 11 tracks, it's a well worthy time spent and memorable enough to listen to it over and over again.\n\nHighlights :\n\nBestial Lust (Bitch)\nBorn for Burning\nReap of Evil\nThe Wind of Mayhem\nTotal Destruction\n",
        "\nNordland II rocks considerably harder than their predecessors, like Destroyers of World, which, although bearing a good number of excellent songs on it, seemed to be thematically and musically inconsistent, with no discernible rhyme or reason to their ordering. Not so with this record which virtually every song on this disc is cut from the same epic vein. This helps the album maintain a steady flow throughout its duration, making it undoubtedly, one of the most consistent record in Bathory's discography. Listening can prove a chore for the impatient fan, but the attentive listener will feel the brooding atmosphere seep into their skull by the third song. This album builds on the sonic landscapes presented in albums such as Nordland I or Blood On Ice, but also somewhat throwback to an older sound. It is a beautiful, rich combination of wonderful music and poetic lyrics that make sense.\n\nNordland II, as the album title says, is the second part of Nordland saga, and therefore it shows again the epic viking ambient and Nordic nature. It's a very good record with a lot of guitar riffs, plus great drum that adds an invaluable worth of basic instruments, and everything accompanied by keyboards that show a great job in making music, totally atmospheric. Quorthon's voice is in form, never fast but always trying to give that message of majesty in the stories narrated. As if it were something planned, this album goes very well for the end of Bathory's life chapter, simple act of complex life.\n\nThe album begins with \"Blooded Shore\", this one opens up with a fairly northern riff and some work from the choir, Quorthon gives us a nice piece of guitar-driven music. His vocals are pretty much same as always, although he may be at his finest on this song, he sings it all pretty aggressively, although we're talking clean vocals here. No more black metal screams of old. \"Sea Wolf\" is another highlight which has some nice folk-style keys throughout and again utilizes the choir sounds. Then \"Vinland\" opens up with sounds of sea/ocean, and kicks into possibly the heaviest and most crushing riff on the entire record. I'd also say this is the single best guitar performance on the album, it includes some orchestral sounds and the best chorus on the album. Quorthon's vocals are nearly as strong as good here as on the second track, but this is probably my favorite one.\n\nThough it's less extreme than its beginnings, this is a more polished, elegant, gleaming pagan metal. This album has a lot of main riffs that are very strong and crunchy, and the choirs are once again, used in the background to give the song some substance. Through verses, Quorthon almost sounds like he wants to give us some black metal vocals, but maintains a very raspy version of clean singing. You can tell he's really into the lyrics, by the way he forcefully delivers them on this album, the songs are carried by the verses and the bridge, which are very dark and almost black metal oriented in itself. Admittedly, there is some keyboard work here that feels somewhere \"norse\", and the choir kept to still project the viking metal style.\n\nThe shocking reality and quality of his lyrics and music are awe-inspiring and just plain good. Quorthon being the only consistent member of Bathory throughout the band's tenure since 1983, he has been the only solid part of this band and all credit goes to him. The only disappointment being that he couldn't continue to make brilliant music. Do you want Bathory? 'Hammerheart' and 'Twilight of the Gods' or 'Blood on Ice' are still remembered as untouchable? Nothing I do will make you remember the past? Well, let's go to the past, fuck. That's what Quorthon thinks, and he does, the icon can't stop being an icon. Before Bathory's last war cry, the father of black and viking metal, the master of shadows, says goodbye of this world, that so much has contributed to metal. His gift: \"Nordland II\". A good sequel/saga that you can find in the genre. Admiration forever.\n",
        "\nBathory was not the coolest band in 1991. In fact, to be honest, poor sales and a metal community that was infatuated with other styles, left in the scene one of the best formations of all time. Reason? Many. But above all, the success of Metallica and that of Nirvana overshadowed everything. It seemed like it didn't give a damn what you edited that year if you weren't James \"Fucking\" Hetfield or Kurt \"Fucked\" Cobain. And Quorthon, poor fellow, had to yield ground to those bands. Still a master, but a master!\n\nQuorthon opened the doors, others came in later. This album is simply put classic. Yeah, there's a few bands that are influenced by Quorthon and say that Bathory is the band that they sound like most, but other than Falkenbach and maybe a few others, NOBODY can pull it off like Quorthon. His viking metal trademark is one-and-only, and can't be recreated to this extent of brilliance. I also think the variety in the riffs is the best in this album. The title track is a great song and one of my all time favorites.\n\nThe opener \u201cTwilight of the Gods\u201d is a great song with a great acoustic intro. Leads very well into heavy part of it, which is epic, exciting, and downright glorious. Definitely one of the most quintessential viking metal songs ever. \"Blood And Iron\" is a 'medieval' thematic that many metal band has to have, and this one is right up there with Blind Guardian's epics. Awesome semi-distorted acoustic intro leading into a nice and long song with an awesome rhythm. \u201cBond Of Blood\u201d starts off with some sounds that seem to be coming from a viking village, and leads into chorus with a heavy guitar tone. Then comes the heaviest part, the riff after this part is an absolutely skull-crushing riff that is extremely catchy. It's pretty much repeated throughout the whole song adding heaviness. It's fair to say this is the most solid song here.\n\nThis album has a high-quality stuff that offers some acoustic sections and Quorthon talking/singing to Norse gods. With nice drums intro, harmonic chorus and an impeccable guitar work with heavy, catchy and pounding rhythm, and awesome soloing. The only little problem with some songs is that they seem to drag on the same idea for too long, which Quorthon obviously improved upon in his later albums. And is why many liked Nordland I and Blood On Ice more than this album. Meanwhile, I think the two Nordland releases are a realization of this type of music, is by far the better sequel for Quorthon to take. They took this album's idea further with the addition of even more layered guitars and there are more layers besides that aren't guitars. I think Quorthon said he'd like to move away from guitars altogether, but that's not really possible. If so, I'm sure my true metal instincts would have something to say. But, as a wise man once said, if it rocks, it rocks.\n\nAt first, I didn't like Quorthon's voice change, which was noticed in the previous album. After many years, I learned to enjoy the album as for what is, and I loved it. Bathory. One of the most sensible viking metal acts ever, a consistent, innovative and brutal act that seems to bring all the right qualities of good viking metal together. This album being Bathory's finest. Without any doubt, Quorthon has created a viking metal masterpiece and has engraved his name among the great metal pioneers in history, and this album is a proof of that.\n",
        "\nQuorthon, the Grandfather of Epic. That enigmatic and seclusive genius who created some of the first (and best) black metal in history and later went on to pursue heroic Viking themes, thus being an ancestor for two metal subgenres: black metal and Viking metal (though I hate the term). All this was done through his first-born, baptized in fire and ice with a name that strikes fear in the feeble and is honored by metalheads across the world: the mighty Bathory. If you don\u2019t know Bathory or haven\u2019t listened to them extensively, making them one of your life\u2019s musical priorities \u2013 do it. Now.\n\n\u201cBlood on Ice\u201d, or parts of it, was originally recorded in 1989 when Quorthon\u2019s Viking longship was just making its first raids to the shores of the metal scene. The songs being in Q\u2019s mind all too different from Bathory\u2019s previous material, they were set aside for the moment. Instead, he recorded and released the immortal classics \u201cHammerheart\u201d and \u201cTwilight of the Gods\u201d, which had a somewhat rawer vibe to them and made the transition from the band\u2019s BM roots smoother. And finally, in 1996, \u201cBlood on Ice\u201d was finalized\u2026\n\nThis album is one of the most Epic metal albums ever recorded. Yes, it deserves the capital E. I\u2019ll explain the style of music found now. Bear with me \u2013 blackened viking heavy metal with a grandiose aura of Wagnerian proportions manifesting a saga of fire and steel. Yeah. I know, categorizing sucks but now you probably understand what it sounds like. Sort of. All songs are great, and some hold purely amazing qualities of composition and arranging, such as \u201cThe Lake\u201d. This fantastic anthem is catchy as hell, with a dark atmosphere perfectly reflecting the lyrics, heightened by background choirs and ambient guitar leads, and to cap it off \u2013 as strong a chorus as there has ever been in the realm of metal. And what\u2019s most impressive about all of this is that Quorthon managed to fit all the pieces together in the best way possible, so that transitions between parts are not just smooth or natural, they just couldn\u2019t be done in any other way. It just has to be just like it is. The sing-along factor of the tracks overall on \u201cBoI\u201d is so high that there should be a fucking karaoke version of this motherfucker.\n\nSpeaking of singing along: if I\u2019d score the passion, feeling, and conviction in Q\u2019s vocals, I\u2019d give him an 11 out of 10. Unluckily, he\u2019s so off-key at times (for example the 1st verse of \u201cThe Stallion\u201d) that even Enrique Iglesias cringed when I played a few songs to him. Yes, I know Enrique. He\u2019s my manwhore. Meaning, I rent his ass to people and take the money. Too bad he starts singing after a while, most clients can\u2019t bear the noise. Back to Quorthon\u2019s vox \u2013 there\u2019s no growling or shrieking on \u201cBoI\u201d, only mid- to high-pitched melodic heavy metal vox which sound mighty fine for the most part. Almost all of the time, or at least more than half, there are \u201cAaaaaahh\u201d or \u201cOooooohh\u201d choirs in the background, enveloping the songs in epicness, epicity and epichood. Sometimes Q gets a nice rasp/distortion to his voice, and sometimes he gets something else, which is not at all as pleasant. To say the least, he sounds raw \u2013 but he fucking means every syllable.\n\n\"Blood on Ice\" is a concept album. You might have guessed that by now. It\u2019s a tale of a boy whose village is ravaged, his family killed, his life destroyed \u2013 and his quest for revenge. He gathers heroic things like strength, wisdom and a sword and sets upon a trip to hell to avenge the fallen. Sounds familiar? Yeah\u2026 it\u2019s Conan all over again. Also, Quorthon borrowed a lot from both the Viking and German mythologies so most of the stuff feels like you\u2019ve heard it all before. Still, the epicness wins you over with such tasteful lines such as:\n\n\u201dCreator of life. Guardian of the dead.\nGoddess of battle and war.\nAll of yee watch me. My sword by my side.\nProudly I sit on my horse.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m serious. The tale is so macho it makes your dick hard just by reading it, and twice its normal size if you dare sing along. I do it all the time while performing in the sack. Quorthon writes at length (six pages) in the booklet about the record\u2019s historical aspects, recording details and influences. All you could possibly want to know about it. This, combined with all the lyrics, with written introductions to every song that tie the saga together, make the booklet more valuable than on most records.\n\nWhat about the sound on \"Blood on Ice\"? An album's production in itself has no value, it\u2019s how well it works with the song material that counts. So what do we get here? Well\u2026 The drums sound like a drum machine, with lots of reverb. The choirs sound far away, with lots of reverb. The guitars sound frizzy and fuzzy, with lots of reverb. The acoustic guitars sound like acoustic guitars. With lots of reverb. There\u2019s a lot of stuff going on here, and there\u2019s lots of reverb all over the place. Sounds\u2026chaotic? Yes, a bit. Indistinct? Actually, not that much. All the hits by the drum machine are so clearly punctuated that you never lose the beat or sense of rhythm. The sound canvas is instead huge and epic, but the lo-fi recording makes everything sound raw. Sounds like a pretty good production for this record to me.\n\nThe guitars are not as dominant as on most metal albums, many riffs are doubled by the choirs and the guitars often bring a supportive chordal texture more than a leading role. Ambient guitar leads and melodies are found aplenty, but they\u2019re seldom in-your-face. Acoustic guitars come to the forefront much more when they kick in and bring a great heathen atmosphere. Whatever that is. Some not-so-well-played solos play their part but nothing more. All in all, guitars are just another piece in Quorthon\u2019s puzzle, not bigger than the other instruments. But the riffs, oh man \u2013 the riffs!! The bass contributes nothing mind-blowing, but very melodic playing and some cool solo interludes (5:51 on \u201cThe Revenge of the Blood on Ice\u201d).\n\nThe drums sound, as mentioned, like a drum machine. I guess it is a drum machine, although Quorthon mentions drum kit placements and whatnot here and there when speaking about the recording sessions. Q liked to lie a lot, though, we all know that. I\u2019m going with my ears on this one and calling it a drum machine. It\u2019s programmed OK, and there are many \u201cI feel the need to air drum\u201d-parts, but that\u2019s mainly due to the songwriting and not as much the drum arrangements. Still, nothing wrong here. Except that it\u2019s a fucking machine.\n\nThe cover art was done by Kristian W\u00e5hlin aka Necrolord, who, as we all know, knows how to paint. This one has a drawback though; it\u2019s quite chaotic, as KW tried to get as many parts of the saga as possible into one picture. It\u2019s still quite nice, with a flaming penis and all. Huh? Oh, right. A flaming sword. Bummer.\n\nWhile \u201cBlood on Ice\u201d wasn\u2019t released during the pinnacle of Bathory\u2019s viking era, I still rate it as high on the classic scale as \u201cHammerheart\u201d. In fact, \u201cBoI\u201d is my favorite Bathory album. Its bombastic and epic arrangements coupled with the superb songwriting make for a match in heaven/hell (your choice). If there ever was a viking metal album that was worth purchasing, it\u2019s this one. Served with chilled mead and raw meat. Vegans fuck off.\n",
        "\nBathory is a band that has gone through many changes since its creation in 1983. The early album helped give birth to black metal and in 1988 Bathory released Blood Fire Death, which created a new sub-genre in the metal, the viking metal. The greatest boss, the most ambitious architect of epic-astral riffs, Quorthon, returns with the second installment of \"Nordland\", the record that marked the return of the viking sound to Bathory.\n\nNordland II returns us to the best Bathory. Recreating the mystical era, the time when Venom meets Conan. Demons, swords, violence, villages in flames, pain, passion, adventures... and Quorthon converted again into the style's messiah, the maximum guru. The guitars sound very heavy, a bit fuzzy, but still great, when he hits those power chords you realize why they call them POWER chords. The drums sound good, no problem there, the only problem I have with this album is that on a few of the songs I can not hear Quorthon singing, at all, and on this album I think his vocals sound the best out of all of Bathory's albums.\n\nThe album begins with \u201cFanfare\u201d which is an all synth song that drags on for three and a half minutes, only about one maybe two minutes of this song is needed. Next is my personal favorite \u201cThe Land\u201d, which is the pinnacle of the album, during its six minutes it never slows down or gets boring. \"Death and Resurrection of a Northern Son\" and \"The Messenger\" are very memorable, as long as you accept that you\u2019ve already heard the songs a thousand times before, are songs that sound more true metal than the fucking Manowar\u2019s Louder Than Hell.\n\nThis is Bathory's last album and one of most underrated albums along with Blood On Ice, this second part shows a difference in songwriting compared to past works. Some like Blood On Ice were mainly used always both heavy and soft elements in their songs, but on this album we get heavy with tons of cool vocals. A lot of these songs caught my eye with a first listen, which is great because some of their previous works (Destroyer of Worlds) took me longer to dig. There is a vast amount of good songs on here, and everything seems to be in the music for the right reasons.\n\nQuorthon lits fire to the heart of warring army with discs like Hammerheart, Blood Fire Death, Twilight of the Gods or the later Blood on Ice. Even \"Nordland\" was praised. Nordland II is a very epic album featuring lyrics describing viking battles and nature. Overall it's a very good album with many great riffs and solos, beautiful keyboard/synth work and great vocals, all done by Quorthon. Nordland II is a great epic album and I would recommend it to anyone how is into viking/folk music. Navigating the same seas in which battles were once fought, Quorthon rewards us the Nordland saga and says goodbye with this effort. A great way to close Bathory's career.\n\nStandout Songs:\nBlooded Shores, Sea Wolf, The Land, The Messenger, Wheel of Sun\n",
        "\nBathory had released several inconsistent albums in a big span of time, except Blood On Ice, and expectations had to be low after Destroyer of Worlds. Before I first listened to this I didn't really know what to think, then I gave it a chance. And well, the follow-up was unexpected, this album is just strong. The songs are inspired, and when compared to the albums that came before, this is one of the biggest surprises in metal. Almost every song on here sounds great and the production also is the best.\n\nQuorthon makes full use of chanting on this album and it works beautifully. They help add to the epic atmosphere of the album greatly. The best example of atmosphere on the record would have to be \"Foreverdark Woods\", the acoustic instruments and sound effects make you feel as if you're traveling through the woods.\n\n\u201cNordland\u201d is one of my favorite songs on the album, starts off with some choir chants, then punches in with some heavy riffs and pounding drums. Then into a really catchy, almost folksy riff. Then continues to pummel you with more killer riffs. \"Ring of Gold\" is just beautiful, I know Quorthon doesn't have the best vocals in the world, but on this song his vocals are amazing, he's not Bruce Dickinson, but he can hold a note. This is all acoustic, the overlapping guitars and vocals are what make this song so great, and the beat to it is just great, it's amazing. \"Broken Sword\" starts off with a nice acoustic intro on top of some waves on the shores then slams in with some killer thrash riffs. The fastest song on the album. \"Great Hall Awaits a Fallen Brother\" is thrashy at the start, then gets into some slower riffs in the chorus, with some choir singing along with him, then gets slower the rest of the song.\n\nYou float through the waters on a boat, wrapped in a heavy fur garb. The longboat draws nearer to the frozen land before you. On a mountain, you see a dragon perched near the top. After landing your ship you walk through the woods to a snowy field being drenched with blood as a battle is waged upon it. As you cross over this cold land you are mesmerized by its beauty. This is the feeling I get when I listen to Nordland I, one of the many works of genius by master songsmith, Quorthon. He proves once again that he is the master of this form of music with the first half of the Nordland saga. As with the other viking albums, the rhythm guitar on this blends together in a beautiful, hypnotic way that leaves you unable to draw yourself out of the music. Listening to it makes you feel as if you are being taken to another land.\n\nThis album has turned out to be one of my most loved pieces of music in my collection. I think this album surpasses even Hammerheart. If you liked any of Bathory's viking material, or if you like music period, you owe it to yourself to listen to this album.\n\nStandout Songs: Nordland, Vinterblot, Ring of Gold, Foreverdark Woods, Broken Sword.\n",
        "\nBlack metal fans will no doubt hail this album above the self-titled debut for a number of reasons. The Return abandons the punk/thrash offerings of the previous effort and delves into somewhat unchartered territory, at the time into a more definitive, deconstructivist black metal style. It is an obvious derivative for vintage Immortal, yet another example of Bathory's influence as a first wave black metal band. The compositions are much longer, with more atmosphere and more varied structural components, even including some polyrhythmic elements.\n\nThe Return also introduces some ritualistic, layered guitar work that would serve as fodder for many second wave bands, the most noticeable being Burzum. The lyrics are written in all persons and have gotten more 'evil', this time around, with concepts of lust and overt sadism thrown into the mix, a diversification from the declarative tone and slightly one-dimensional wash of Quorthon's previous work.\n\n\"Revelation of Doom\" is by far the longest intro, standing at over 3 minutes. Totally blows Storm of Damnation away from the previous album, and sets and even darker mood than any other Bathory intro would achieve. Evil is one word that sums up \"Possessed\", this is total speed and aggression, nothing more and nothing less. I couldn't have thought of a better title for a song such as this, the chorus is insane, as Quorthon tones his growl into that of the devil himself, and the ending solo is mind blowing. \"Bestial Lust\" was dedicated to a girl that Quorthon fucked who was actually into bestial sex. The song is thriving with speed, aggression and pure lust, one of the definite highlights of the \u00e1lbum. Quorthon's shouts in \"Reap of Evil\", just as a total thrash assault breaks out onto the listener. Yeah, it does slow down a bit afterward, only to make way for a spoken narrative that sounds as if it came up from hell itself. Overall, this one hell is a thrashing work of art.\n\nThe songs are much faster and more aggressive and indeed amazing, but \"only\" in the literal sense of the term. Beyond its intimidating qualities and historical value, probably there are not many ingredients that make it interesting for most demanding metalheads. The drums are obsessed and invariable and the solos are totality unpresentable, especially in \"The Wind of Mayhem\". Quorthon, with his irreproachable and thundering throat, fulfills his function by far, remembering Cronus a bit, but without the lascivious point and with much darker tint.\n\nBut above all, The Return is an essential album, like his other 80's albums, and its influence is apparent, even to the greenest black metal follower. Bathory has opened the gates of hell.\n",
        "\nLet me start by saying I've no problem go for this sort of vocals, and I say that Quorthon is also the best example of this vocal style, also I must admit that this album is very strong. I can say the same for Bathory's previous two albums, that stuff also does float my viking boat. I would recommend Twilight Of The Gods to fans of Manowar, as the viking theme succeeds in bridging the two styles of music. This is, after all, how I discovered the viking metal of Bathory. But we're left with a problem. Although this record falls safely into the category of true metal, I have heard stories of opposing Bathory factions taking this to various extremes, the followers of Bathory's black metal and viking metal accordingly.\n\nNonetheless, this one is incredible. It's not the raw Bathory seen in The Return and the debut, it's not the new sound they brought on Under the Sign of the Black Mark. It's epic Bathory. After the successful \"Hammerheart\", the leader Quorthon brings the vikings back with this gem. The theme of this brilliant album that was started on \"Blood Fire Death\", shows the true progression from the old satanic themes that dominate the first three albums. This album contains all the elements needed for true epic music: atmospheric chorus, catchy leads, excellent vocals, mid-paced sections and interesting lyrics. The acoustic melodies on this album are prevalent and fit in very well with the theme of vikings.\n\nThe powerful \"Twilight Of The Gods\" kicks off with a slow acoustic guitar melody, and then kicks into a full blown viking attack, featuring crushing guitars, heavy drums and clean vocals. It is evident that throughout the songs several guitar tracks were recorded, and this song ends with an atmospheric acoustic outro. It's also the longest song ever recorded by Bathory. \"Through Blood By Thunder\" also contains acoustic guitar melodies accompanied by underlying distorted guitars, making the intro sound far better and raw. After a few moments, your ears are infiltrated with epic riffs, crushing leads and screaming clean war cries. Contains a chorus singing behind Quorthon's war-torn voice adding to the epic feel. This song alone makes one feel like strapping on some viking boots and armor and raising a sword to Odin himself. \"To Enter Your Mountain\" is one of the highlights on this wonderful album. Several layers of acoustic and electric guitars are audible throughout the entire song, with excellent and tasty drumming that prevail in this track and the choruses are full and melodic.\n\nThe production on this album is very raw, and couldn't be better fitted. If this album was to have modern high technology recording, I'm sure it would be worse of an album. Twilight Of The Gods is flawless by all metal standards. If you happen to be the kind of person who doesn\u2019t like this kind of vocals, you should either learn to overlook it or love it. I say that because if you ignore this album because of the vocals, then you are missing some very special music. I wasn\u2019t too keen on this album's vocals at first, but I learned to fall in love with it because at the time I hadn\u2019t heard vocals like it before.\n\nHowever, I commend Quorthon for his efforts to live the true viking spirit through music. Hail to Odin!\n",
        "\nBathory, the lethal and mystical band from the lethal and mystical Quorthon, master and lord of almost everything that has been born in the kingdom of european black metal, was confronted in 1988 to one of the most important moments in the development of Bathory's music. And not only Quorthon\u2019s music. The black metal world, still primitive, wild and controlling, was going to experience changes, to mutate, to become more accurate, more epic and unhealthy than ever. Bearer of an intense musical seed, the swede wanted to enter in our souls, to corrupt them, to teach a nihilistic and poetic world, bloody and astral.\n\nThe music is, in itself, rather simplistic, but every riff is memorable. The guitars are a brilliant mix of thrash metal speed, death metal riffs and distortion, and black metal soloing. The bass is rather audible throughout every track and provides the onslaught with the rhythm needed to keep you listening along. Even the drums are ranking high on the scales of perfection, they aren't a constant double-bass assault, but rather, more of a blend of all the genres Bathory is associated with. Each song carries a different drum beat, if the guitar riffs are thrash-oriented, the drums will accompany them with a thrash blastbeat, and so on, so forth. It's the beginning of the viking era with many remaining elements of the Black Metal. The quality of the music is the same as the previous album, but with some arrangements and sophistication, and the vocals are still fast and dirty.\n\nThe lyrics are a big step up from the Satanist lyrics the band had penned for their self-titled album and the few that followed. Finding a more personal inspiration, Quorthon took to his heritage and wrote down odes to his pagan forefathers and their gods, but didn't drop the anti-christianity theme, as can be seen in \"The Golden Walls of Heaven\". As for the vocal performance, they're raspy but easy to understand if you have an ear for scream vocals.\n\n\u201cA Fine Day To Die\u201d is the first epic that includes viking elements, which posteriorly perfected in Hammerheart. And like Enter The Eternal Fire, it was one of the first songs to enter in the long and epic atmosphere. It begins with acoustic guitars and whispering voices, then explodes with blasting guitars. A great song mixed with silent places but noisy and hard points. \u201cBlood Fire Death\u201d is unbeatable. It starts with a choir and acoustic guitars, then guitars are going very loud and sound very coordinated. At the end is going slowly again with the same acoustic guitars as in the beginning. One of the best and essential black/viking masterpieces.\n\nAll in all, if you do not have this album, you're missing out. It is a classic metal and is an album that cannot be missing in your collection. It was with this album that Quorthon scored his high water mark with the theme of odinist paganism. If the epic move is your thing and you love to feel, to notice the pressure of a musical note in the soul, and you would sell to your mother to touch the pure adventure, to smell and to taste the past and to live a total viking war, Blood Fire Death awaits you.\n",
        "\nBathory is legend in our fief. As much as the names can be like Iron Maiden, Slayer, Venom or Death. Other bands like Enslaved, Darkthrone, Immortal, Dimmu Borgir, Emperor or Satyricon owes their lives to Mr. Quorthon. No more no less. The viking metal owes its birth to a multitude of factors and past bands, but the total icon of the fief, the name that sums up the viking idiosyncrasy in the metal kingdom is that of Bathory.\n\nBlood On Ice has been recorded in 1989, just after \"Blood Fire Death\", but the disc decided to sleep and not be edited. One can imagine the young Quorthon furtively assembling the bits and pieces, knowing he was onto something exciting. Sadly, Quorthon underestimated his own abilities and left the album unfinished until 1996. As a result, the first proper Viking metal album wasn't actually released until the basic concept had already solidified into a working genre.\n\nSure, \"Blood Fire Death\" might be the first Viking metal album thematically, but \"Blood on Ice\" took the concept much further, making the distinction between blazing thrashy black metal and heroic Viking metal far more apparent. It's a concept album about a young Norse hero traveling far and wide to avenge the death of his family. Clearly Qurothon had seen \"Conan the Barbarian.\" It's a frosty affair, big and bold, deliberately paced epic metal with shades of folk and mood-setting samples (snorting horses, forging of swords, clashing of weapons and old men rapping about ancient Norse prophecies). With its mechanical drum sound and generally mid-tempo gallop, the album sometimes sounds for medieval enthusiasts. It's a primitive affair, with simple songs and a fucked-up production, and yet, beautifully inspired, metal taken to new heights of epic grandeur.\n\nBecause it was deemed unsuitable for release, the sound, re-mastered though it may be, is raw, clumsy and flat. Quorthon was new to the whole singing thing, and his voice is wildly uneven. But when he really pushes it, as he does on \"The Lake,\" his voice is as resounding and powerful as the best metal has to offer. He does a great job warbling his way through balls out heavy metal thrash fests like \"One Eyed Old Man.\" But it's ultimately the untested honesty of his singing that sets it apart, lacking range but dripping authenticity. This is not some tongue-in-cheek irony-laden entertainment, but a sincere and convincing performance.\n\n\"Blood on Ice\" might have been buried, but it still served a purpose; it was the prototype for the balls to the wall folk-inflected metal sound that future bands (Falkenbach, Einherjer, Thyfring, Enslaved, etc.) would draw on. The album suggests the frosty outer limits of black metal, the possibilities that lay beyond self-imposed Satanism and evil posturing. By pulling in elements from folk music, Norse mythology and Manowar, Quorthon single-handedly created (forged?) Viking metal.\n",
        "\n1996. Quorthon finally decides to release this masterpiece after it's been dusting since 1989. This is as good as Hammerheart. True magic viking atmosphere flows through this album, and Quorthon does his best clean vocal performance up to date. Oftentimes, this album reminds me of Manowar, though it is a lot better than anything I've ever heard by them. Quorthon's got the epic-feeling, sword-wielding aspects of the music and lyrics down pat.\n\nBlood On Ice is yet another strong Viking record from the man who loved to bring back the horned helmets and mead horns every time he failed to bring a new style to the Bathory catalog with any success. Thankfully, this is a rather good release that is claimed to have been fixed up from the vaults with many new parts added on and old mixed repaired. The songs also continues in the vein of Hammerheart and Twilight Of The Gods.\n\nFor the most part, this disc contains awesome mid-paced metal with epic choruses. There's also a fair amount of acoustic guitar on this album, which I am a big fan of. Many songs also contain some special effects of some sort, such as horses galloping, water flowing, etc. The album also has a couple of cool solos courtesy of Quorthon, a great guitar work here. The story is also interesting: a young boy who sees his village destroyed by nasty men, and grows up in the forests and gets together all the gear he needs to teach those bastards a right royal lesson. A truly epic story with a truly epic sound and feel to it.\n\nThe music itself is quite interesting. Naturally beginning with a short introduction to set the mood, the epic-feeling title track kicks off with a catchy riff. It's very dark and is a perfect way to open this album with. The same riff and basically the same song will re-occur as the last track on this disc, except with a different arrangement, but also cool at the same time. The album then takes its only downhill with \"One Eyed Old Man\" after a short acoustic song. It's a little strange, but after that the album just gets better and better with superb songs like \"The Stallion\", \"Gods of Thunder of Wind and of Rain\" and one of the best viking-metal songs ever done: \"The Lake\".\n\nIt has great liner notes, containing the full conceptual story and all of the lyrics. There's also some elaborate art on the cover art, which is cool. This album is very underrated, it matches with Hammerheart for sure. If you checked Hammerheart out and liked it, then you must check this album out, it's totally awesome.\n",
        "\n\"Destroyer of Worlds\" was the last regular Bathory album that I bought. Quorthon (R.I.P.) had tortured his audience with a sadistic consequence for more than a decade. From my blackened thrash metal point of view, already \"Hammerheart\" and \"Twilight of the Gods\" had been rather boring, but the true milestones of horror were known by other names. \"Requiem\" and \"Octagon\", both as charming as an anal enema, had ruined the once fantastic reputation of Quorthon in an unforeseen manner. But lo and behold, \"Destroyer of Worlds\" starts in a surprisingly strong manner. \"Lake of Fire\" conveys an intensive atmosphere of desperation and sadness while scoring with an authentic heaviness and the haunting chorus. The song builds a bridge to Quorthon's Viking era and I want to go even a step further. In my humble opinion, this sluggish colossus is the best Viking track of Bathory. The following title track appears as a thunder which rumbles in the distance. Sinister background choirs coalesce with simple melody lines and the overall result is anything else but mediocre. Two good songs in a row? Is this really an album of the late Quorthon?\n\nHowever, a rude awakening follows. The longer the album progresses, the more Quorthon seems to be confused. He wanders cheerfully through great musical valleys of creative nothingness without realizing that he gets lost in the most barren landscapes. We who have no other option than to follow his crude route are irritated. \"Pestilence\": gruesome, dissonant barking meets incredibly meaningless guitars. \"Bleeding\": don't know what to say. Whenever I want to listen to these seven minutes, I fall asleep after the first 90 seconds. I just can confirm that these 90 seconds deliver slow-moving, tedious and uninspired sounds. \"109\": a mixture of an industrialized beginning with extremely simple-minded guitars and a fast-paced second part with average lines. Well, it's time to stop this list of terror. It does not make sense to go into any more detail. The album just passes by, intelligent song titles (\"Kill, Kill, Kill\") alternate with absolutely pointless solos or primitive leads. My last hope was that \"Liberty and Justice\" could be a cover of Agnostic Front. To translate a German proverb: \"hope is the last to die\". But it dies.\n\nDo I need to provide you with information concerning the production? The more or less thrashing songs sound noisy, the dark atmosphere of the first two songs fades away quickly and leaves nothing but a bloodless, synthetic and emotionless appearance. Aggravating this situation, the clean vocals of \"Sudden Death\" indicate a serious illness of the artist and the strange keyboard effects support this impression. Tragically, exactly this song could had been another little highlight due to its actually decent riffs and its smooth flow. But I must admit that terms such as \"highlights\" are absolutely inappropriate in the context of \"Destroyer of Worlds\". Anyway, the final challenge is to endure the last two songs with a playtime of 17 minutes in total. Marathon of cruelty! \"White Bones\" sucks, inter alia because of its blousy part. \"Day of Wrath\" sucks as well, although it does not insult the listener with another blues sequence. The prototypical Viking song fails to deliver opulence or grandeur; absolute lameness is the name of the game. Forget it! Despite its good start, \"Destroyer of Worlds\" defended the pretty miserable status quo of Quorthon, no more, no less. I will probably never listen to the Nordland albums.\n",
        "\nIt is interesting that Bathory's most popular masterpiece was also their transition work. Blood Fire Death still lends itself more to the dirty blackthrash of their early period, but the lavish Viking folk arrangements and epic scope created a stark contrast. Part of the reason why Blood Fire Death stands the test of time so well is that Quorthon didn't compromise one style for the other. While the sound from Hammerheart onward softened the bite, Blood Fire Death features the highbrow and primitive alike coming together, triumphantly colliding against one another in a clash becoming of the gods themselves.\n\nThe fan debate between early/latter eras of Bathory has been exhausted, but it is nice that an album like Blood Fire Death exists to cater to the whims of either side. While I usually find myself approaching \"transition\" albums with a little hesitation, it's only because most artists have a rough time grasping a new style the first time around. It doesn't appear as if Quorthon had this problem. \"Odens Ride over Nordland\" and \"A Fine Day to Die\" segue together perfectly as if Quorthon had been meant to invoke the Norse pantheon all along-- and it's clear that he was. The album's deep cuts all rely on the familiar blackthrash assault, but even they sound more sophisticated than the raw evil of albums past. The full circle return to sprawling epic metal on the title track gives the two styles a surprising sense of coherence. Where the Bathory worshippers I've heard capitalize on one era over another, I'm not sure I've heard one that manages to bring both sides together in full force. Blood Fire Death is definitely less outwardly sophisticated than some of the latter Bathory albums, but this album would be by far the hardest to properly replicate.\n\n\"A Fine Day to Die\" and \"Blood Fire Death\" are the most ambitious undertakings Bathory had taken to date. Although they may pale in comparison to the scope of, say, \"Twilight of the Gods\", the raw bite in these tracks creates a niche of their own. As much as I love the Viking era, the rancid \"evilness\" of Bathory's early stuff would be missed. It's hard to call anything on Blood Fire Death truly evil compared to the first three records but the balance of deep arrangement and rawness counts for a lot here. Acoustic guitar and a tense choral backdrop complements dark riffs that wouldn't have needed the support to stand out on their own. Although the thrashier tunes from \"The Golden Walls of Heaven\" to \"Dies Irae\" are a considerable change of pace, the rawness throughout gives Blood Fire Death a surprising coherence. Surprisingly, it was actually tougher to get into these shorter thrash songs. They're fast, to-the-point and ravenous, but don't offer the same immediate earworms. At this point I can remember the blackthrash pieces just as clearly. It's similar to my initial impression of Reign in Blood; at the start, I could only recall the album's bookends \"Angel of Death\" and \"Raining Blood\". It took some time before the rest of the album impressed its classic status upon me.\n\nAlthough I love Blood Fire Death for its combination of highbrow ambitions with raw means, the production does stand out as one of the album's weaker points. The guitars unfortunately aren't quite as brilliantly vile-sounding as they used to be (appropriately so, I guess) and the production isn't sure whether it wants to be lo-fi or clear, so it does a mediocre job at both. Maybe most glaring of all are the album's drums, which somehow seem to collect the weaker elements of real and programmed drum performances-- at times thin and samey, other times conspicuously imprecise and human. \n\nPerformancewise, it is Quorthon himself who makes Blood Fire Death as good as it is. His grizzly vocals on \"A Fine Day to Die\" are a fitting combination of the styles. As the aggressive guitars clatter into the vast choral backup, he sings melody with the same harsh gruffness of his black metal vocals... With regard to that end of his performance, I remember thinking on numerous playthroughs that Quorthon's blackened snarl in still probably unmatched in years since. His screams on \"For All Those Who Died\" are completely primitive and ravenous sounding. In this and other ways, Blood Fire Death does sound like a place where all of Bathory's best elements regardless of era decided to meet and say hello to each other. While more singularly focused albums like Twilight of the Gods may have had a more lasting impact on me, I don't think it's out of place to call this album that made Bathory truly immortal for all time to come.\n",
        "\n\"Viking metal\" is among the most hotly-debated terms in the metal world, and with good reason. It lacks clear definition, and what is unambiguously an example to one person can be irrelevant to the genre in the eyes of another. Certainly Amon Amarth, with their near-radio ready choruses and top-tier production values cannot be the same genre as the frenetic, iconoclastic Enslaved. Yet Amon Amarth is the quintessential Viking metal band, and Frost is heralded as a landmark release in the genre. So what, then, is Viking metal? In my opinion, there is only one answer: Hammerheart.\n\nI'll confess up-front that I am biased in writing this - the album is my all-time favorite, metal or otherwise. I do truly believe, however, that there is something special about Hammerheart that has never been successfully imitated or topped. Its broad scope is - rightfully - lauded by many as a bold move that shouldn't have paid off, but ultimately did. Going from the lo-fi chaos of black metal to anything remotely resembling this album is no mean feat, and pulling it off with only one album in between the two styles would seem an impossibility. Yet Quorthon accomplished this with nothing but a drum machine and a producer to help him out.\n\nA common criticism of the album (and the band in general) is that Quorthon's interest in Viking myth and Nordic paganism is just that - an interest. Purists decry the band's 'Viking trilogy' as disingenuous and irrelevant to the burgeoning Odinist movement that has taken hold in many extreme metal subcultures. And the purists have a point: Bathory was, like it or not, very image-conscious. In the '80s, when the Satanic scare was at its peak, Bathory wore black leather and sang odes to Asmodeus. Once the temporary thrill of Satanism died out in the '80s, Quorthon reinvented himself and his project in the image of the Vikings. \n\nYet I don't think this is necessarily a bad thing. Much can be said about the authenticity of true pagan bands, but in a scene tainted by white supremacy and neo-fascism (here's looking at you, Varg), it can be a relief to hear something utterly Scandinavian that doesn't feel racially biased. Hammerheart rightfully celebrates historical Nordic tradition rather than decrying the multiculturalism of today.\n\nThe fact of the matter is metal has always had a component of fantasy. Some prefer Manowar while others opt for Dragonforce, but it's pretty hard to be a metalhead and not listen to bands who simply tell stories. But Quorthon's storytelling abilities seem to far exceed many of his contemporaries, and indeed many of his successors. Despite the perceived illegitimacy of his pagan proclivity, Quorthon sounds sincere for the entirety of the album. \n\nHe isn't the best singer (he's not very good, honestly) but what he lacks in prowess he makes up for in effort. To his credit, he's approximately in tune all the way through, and his occasional cracks and hiccups make the vocals sound more like the gruff Viking warrior that he tries to evoke. And occasionally, something goes very right: his vocals in Song to Hall Up High are haunting, particularly in the final chorus, and when the choral \"shores in flames\" chant of the eponymous song gives way to a passionately screamed \"Fire!\", it's hard not to quake in your boots. \n\nMore evocative than even his best vocals are the guitars. With a drum machine and an ostensibly synthesized bass backing up his amateurish vocals, Quorthon has a lot to make up for on the six-string - a feat he more than accomplishes. The opening passage of \"Shores In Flames\" is without a doubt the most emotionally moving lead line I have ever heard. Its open, resonant chords and the rawness of the lightly overdriven guitar make for an introduction that has never been matched, in metal or anywhere else. Soon enough, it gives way to palm-muted heavy metal riffing that matches the thunder of the drums and the tension of the lyrics. \n\nThe main riff of the song is a very real contender for the most memorable riff in all metal music, and Quorthon is a master of restraint and release - he plays the riff for just long enough, just enough times that it defines the long opener without becoming boring or expected. \"Valhalla\" makes use of a similar song structure, but with guitar parts more suited to the driving pace of the track. Classical-inflected acoustics set apart \"Song to Hall Up High\" from the rest of the album, but the wistful tonality and pensive chord progression keep the listener firmly rooted in the Viking theme. Album closer \"One Rode to Asa Bay\" is one final 10-minute epic, complete with a haunting yet aggressive riff that mirrors Quorthon's lament to the Christian imperializaion of a once-proud Viking land.\n\nLyrically, this is Bathory's all-time high. Quorthon wrote some exceptional lyrics throughout each of his project's disparate periods, but Hammerheart is his only album with a lyric sheet that reads like poetry. Evoking the skalds of his homeland's distant past, he sings of heroic victory and of equally heroic defeat. His paeans to Thor and Odin read far more sincerely than they were written, untarnished by Quorthon's less-than-stellar grasp of English. \n\nIt is with a limited degree of objectivity that I can recognize some of Hammerheart's issues - for every vocal line that Quorthon nails, there are surely three that find him stretching his already limited range and dropping out of key, and a few riffs throughout the record sound pilfered from the annals of underground metal. Yet despite its faults, the record did something few others have done - it defined a genre. Hammerheart is not folk metal, nor black metal, nor even power metal. It's simply a powerful Nordic narrative told in the only way Quorthon knew how. \n\nThough Amon Amarth and Kampfar may carry the Viking metal torch today, they and their ilk could not have existed without the unlikely masterpiece that is Hammerheart. Its scope is broader than can possibly be expected from an album whose entire run doesn't even hit an hour - the amount of content that Quorthon fit into an album of average length is remarkable.\n\nFor the sake of realism, I will assert merely that this is Bathory's best by far, and the singular triumph of Viking metal. But reducing it to that feels like a concession. I don't just think this is the best Viking metal album. I think this is the best heavy metal album of all time.\n",
        "\n\"The Return......\" is in a difficult situation. It is framed by the groundbreaking debut and Quorthon's undisputed masterpiece \"Under the Sign of the Black Mark\". Compared with these mind-blowing classics, \"The Return\" (forgive me for neglecting the dots from now on) is eking out a meagre existence. But in relation to any other album of Quorthon, his second work is a real gem, a magnificent triumph of creativity and relevance. As a matter of course, Viking fans will disagree. Well, I admit that \"Blood Fire Death\" houses two fantastic tracks, but seen through the eyes of a black / thrash fan, Bathory never reached the form of their first three albums again. Only a few early non-album tracks such as \"Satan My Master\" or \"Burning Leather\" trample some pieces of \"The Return\" into the dust. \n\nThe atmospheric cover was an eye-catcher. Back in 1985, it distinguished itself from many artworks that showed bloodthirsty or ugly scenarios. Nevertheless, this was the only element of \"The Return\", which \"normal\" people would have described as aesthetic. Anyway, sick weirdos find a lot more nice details. In terms of music, Quorthon was still influenced by Venom. Songs like \"Bestial Lust (Bitch)\" could not hide the fact that he had drunken from Cronos' chalice, which had naturally been filled with a very exquisite cocktail of blood, sperm and alcohol. Lines like \"She is hot and drives me wild and still she is open wide / Just when this torture seems to end / She is there to drain my sove again\" were obviously inspired by tracks such as \"Lady Lust\" and the laughter at the beginning also indicated Quorthon's inspiration. Additionally, the break between \"Rite of Darkness\" and \"Reap of Evil\" was a slavish imitation of the bridge that connected \"Buried Alive\" and \"Raise the Dead\". Yet it has to be said that he had begun to emancipate himself. A certain number of tracks did not show an evident link between his and Venom's approach. \n\nThe songs were still aggressive, but less grim than that of the debut. The dull yet more or less unique guitar sound created a less satanic aura, but this does not mean that \"The Return\" lacked of power or violence. Quorthon had nothing but contempt for any kind of filigree or fragile lines and he tortured his guitar in a very coarse way. Nevertheless, he knew how to impress the audience. Despite or exactly because of the primitiveness of his riffs, songs like the programmatic \"Total Destruction\" with its staccato riffs and vocals or the furious and impulsive \"The Winds of Mayhem\" hit the nail on the head in the most efficient manner. Not to mention the most evil number of the album; the sombre title track built a bridge to the most malicious pieces of the debut. Its density, ferocity and cruelty set new standards. If Quorthon had intended to demonstrate his affinity for sonic bestiality, then he was absolutely successful, no doubt at all. Nevertheless and almost unbelievable, there exists an even better version of this song; Cruel Force, please allow me this patriotic remark, have proven that Quorthon was not fully aware of the potential of his own composition.\n\nIn comparison with the obstinate yet totally excellent debut, the Swedish lone wolf offered more variable song patterns. A few number of breaks was incorporated and tempo changes also occurred every now and then. Perhaps due to this slightly more fastidious approach, not each and every track sent me shivers down my spine. However, the album had some very dark vibes and, when excluding the completely useless intro, it did not suffer from any manifest fillers. Even the almost amateurish awkwardness of the main riff of \"Sadist (Tormentor)\" had a certain charm, although the song fought a losing battle in comparison with the highlights of \"The Return\". Speaking of the best tracks, I have forgotten to mention the inquisitorial \"Born for Burning\", a relatively relaxed mid-tempo piece with catchy riffs. Only its ending was a little bit too long. So what. \"The Return\" was a strong full-length, neither flawlessly produced - just think of the guitar sound and the vocals with an extra dose of reverb on it - nor compositionally sophisticated, but highly effective. Anyway, Bathory's larger-than-life album was yet to come. Rest in piece, Quorthon.\n",
        "\nAs we are all well aware, Bathory was one of the most important bands in the extreme metal scene. This band managed to pioneer two genres of music, releasing both of those genres' first albums. Of course, we are talking about black metal and Viking metal. \"Twilight of the Gods\" was supposed to be the final Bathory album but Quorthon would eventually return only 3 years later to release the seventh Bathory album, \"Requiem\". His sound for this release changed a bit but was it an evolution? No, although \"Requiem\" is an average thrash metal album, \"Octagon\" is one of the worst thrash albums I've ever heard.\n\nWatered-down is probably the best description I can give this album. I often wonder just what Quorthon was thinking here. Clearly this was meant to be a retro-thrash album paying homage to many of the genre's forefathers; the 1990s was not a kind decade to thrash metal, with many of the bands changing their sound away from thrash in favor of \"less extreme\" genres. Kreator, Metallica, Megadeth, Anthrax, and Destruction, and many others all fell victim to this, and some bands actually managed to pull it off. More often than not, it didn't work. So why would Quorthon change TO a thrash sound during the genre's deteriorating years?\n\nThis could have been a great thrash album, no doubt. Quorthon was definitely a legendary musician and he could have easily made a great album like he had many time in the past, as well as future after this release. He just didn't seem to put in any effort here. The guitars sound like absolute crap in terms of tone and the riffs are very juvenile and poorly composed. The production is raw and dirty but not in a good way. Instead, it sounds far too tinny and disgusting. As I said earlier, everything sounds far too watered-down. The solos here are ridiculously bad. \"33 Something\" is one of the most horrendous songs on here both musically and lyrically. Not only are the riffs boring and uninspired, but the \"eat my shit, suck my dick\" lyrics really don't help the song at all. The music here is very messy and all over the place, but not in a technical, wanky way. Plus, the guitars are actually second to the drums in terms of volume.\n\nThe drums are definitely the loudest of all the instruments here and usually, that's a bad thing. In this case, however, it is still a bad thing. They follow the typical thrash formula of mostly d-beat, hardcore influenced drumming, and really don't do anything out of the ordinary or impressive for that matter. The fact that the drumming is boring is actually only second to that damn volume issue. Y'all thought \"St. Anger\" drums were bad? Nope. This was far worse. Way too tinny and plastic-sounding.\n\nThe vocals aren't QUITE as terrible. Quorthon uses a shout technique and here, he just sounds tired, and while they are probably one of the better parts of the entire release, they still pale in comparison to every other Bathory album. I can't say much more but lyrically this album is just a huge joke. Aside from that lyrical passage earlier mentioned, everything is just juvenile:\n\n\"As your spirit slips away and Earth drinks from your blood.\nThe irony is that the last thing you'll think is - \"Oh my God!\".\nWhen your...\nWar Supply. War Supply. War Supply.\nNot until that mine has torn you in two you'll\nthink just fucking \"why\" - \"War Supply\"\n\nCome on, man. These lyrics come from the guy that wrote those classic Viking albums of \"Blood Fire Death\", \"Hammerheart\", and \"Twilight of the Gods\"? It's unbelievable but thankfully he dropped this sound on following albums.\n\nThis is easily the worst Bathory album and one of the worst thrash metal albums, period. I advise everyone to steer clear of this unless you HAVE to listen to his entire catalogue. It's your funeral.\n",
        "\nWhen you're reviewing an album that is definitely a classic and so many people have already given their input on it, it's really hard to say anything that hasn't already been said. This is the case for Bathory's legendary self-titled 1984 debut album. With this release, Quorthon and Co. managed to create an entirely new genre. What we have here isn't something overly technical or musically sophisticated and that's perfectly okay, as this album needs none of those things. Venom coined the term \"Black Metal\" with their 1982 album but with this release, Bathory released the first actual album in the black metal genre. To call this album influential is an understatement and, rightfully so, it is almost universally loved by many fans of extreme metal.\n\nIt becomes apparent right away the music is meant to be destructive and raw. The guitar tone is dirty. Very, very dirty. So dirty it makes Miley Cyrus look clean. Its absolutely ear piercing and pretty damn thin to the point where if it were a razor, you'd slice your hand open upon touching it. Most of the riffs are fast-paced and aggressive. \"Hades\" is the first song after the \"Storm of Damnation\" intro track that appears on represses of the album. This song's riffs, like many others, tend to sound very close to early thrash metal and speed metal. It's not like Venom but something far darker and much more raw, with the riffs thrashing like an angry child that just wanted some godsdamn ice cream! These riffs really don't sound all that complex but like I mentioned earlier, the lack of complexity is one of the album's charms and is a fairly comment element in black metal. There are solos on this album as well although they sound very primitive and quite simplistic, as do most of the actual riffs as well. Something a lot of people have picked up on is how the song \"Necromansy\" was \"stolen\" by Burzum. The riff in this track appears on Varg's track \"War\", which also shares its name with a song on this album. I'm not going to say he \"ripped off\" Bathory here, but it's clear this was an influence and hard to deny it. Although this is the first black metal album and it certainly fits the genre, songs like those mentioned before and \"Sacrifice\", especially, definitely boast their fair share of thrash riffs. \n\nAt this point, Bathory was not a solo project specifically belonging to Quorthon. Stefan Larsson preformed drums on this album and Rickard \"Ribban\" Bergman played the bass as a session musician. The drums here are controlled and kept extremely simple and to the point. The drum lines are mostly d-beat punk patterns heard in plenty of early thrash/speed metal bands at this time and sometimes they speed up a bit. There are a few moments of blast beats here but really the drums manage to stick to a thrashier, more rocking pattern. He's not doing any flashy stuff here and it keeps well with the flow of the music. Had he ended up going overboard it would most likely have derailed the entire affair. The bass is audible in some instances like within the track \"Hades\" and that kind of sucks in this case, because some cool basslines really would have helped this early proto-black metal sound quite a bit. It's not a flaw that drags the album down in quality, thankfully. \n\nBathory was the first band to use this inhuman vocal style. Other bands like the aforementioned Venom featured harsher vocals, with Cronos sounding like some sort of possessed demonic madman, but Quorthon took it to an entirely new level. This here is one of the earliest examples of extreme, harsh vocals. His shrieks and screams are horrifying and, I guarantee you, many people that heard this for the first time upon its release shat themselves. Even while so many bands have since adopted this style of vocals, Quorthon's plagued screams of death still freak me out a bit when I listen to this album. Of course this is not a bad thing. This music was not meant to be tame and controlled. During the song \"Reaper\" he sounds especially demented. I\u2019m not sure why this track sticks out more to me, but it always has. \n\nIn terms of Bathory\u2019s black metal era containing this album, \u201cThe Return\u2026\u201d released in 1985, and \u201cUnder the Sign of the Black Mark\u201d released in 1987, I\u2019d say this is his finest. It\u2019s not very often a band\u2019s debut is their best work, but it does happen. Also, I will say I enjoy his Viking era a bit more than his black metal one. Regardless, Bathory is an anomaly that managed to completely pioneer two genres: black metal and Viking metal. While bands like Metallica and Anthrax were thrashing about and more extreme bands like Slayer and Sodom were also in the earlier stages of their careers, Bathory was doing something beyond evil and beyond innovative. This took that thrash sound and made it far more horrifying. It may be simple, but \u201cBathory\u201d is one of the most important black metal albums ever. Why wouldn\u2019t it be? It was the first!\n",
        "\nBathory is widely known as a pioneer of two genres of music: black metal and Viking metal. He released his first album in 1984 which I consider to be the absolute first black metal album and, four years later in 1988, he released a prototype to the Viking metal genre with \"Blood Fire Death\". This album contained the first Viking metal tracks to ever be recorded but was still firmly rooted in black metal at the same time. It wouldn't be until 1990 with the album \"Hammerheart\" that Quarthon finally transitioned Bathory fully into the Viking metal sound and created something truly breathtaking that would be completely perfected with the final album in Bathory's \"Viking\" trilogy, \"Twilight of the Gods\". This give new meaning to the word \"epic\". This is usually seen as the lesser of the three albums by many and while I still hold \"Blood Fire Death\" and \"Hammerheart\" in the highest of regards, \"Twilight of the Gods\" is the epitome of Viking-era Bathory, and probably Bathory overall.\n\nThis album begins with the title-track of \"Twilight of the Gods\", and clocks in at 14 minutes in length. The song follows a slower pace, similar to that of \"Hammerheart\" with songs like \"Shores in Flames\", and choir vocals soar like a Valkyrie readying for The Wild Hunt. This is the longest track on the album and the most epic. Why wouldn't it be? It bears the name of the album itself. The acoustic guitars are absolutely magnificent and add to the heroic atmosphere, combining beauty with epic metal. The solo in this song doesn't flaunt its technicality, rather boasting an elegant atmospheric beauty that became synonymous with Quorthon's Viking metal albums. \n\nAlthough the title track opens up this album perfectly, both in the overall theme and musical structure, it is not my favorite song on the album. \"Through Blood by Thunder\" and \"Blood and Iron\" both tie for that honor. They both open up with the exact same guitar riff, although the one in \"Through Blood by Thunder\" features an undistorted electric guitar, while \"Blood and Iron\" utilizes an acoustic guitar. Both of these songs execute their respective styles beautifully. \"Blood and Iron\" is the longer of the two and thus, it sounds a bit more epic. The pace remains slow and hypnotic by showcasing an evident influence of epic doom metal. This seems to be a central musical idea throughout the album, of course. This is the least black metal-sounding Viking album Quorthon had produced at this time. The drumming is especially simple and focuses on overall groove rather than technicality. This is the case with all of the songs throughout the album and while it doesn't change much, it really doesn't lessen the quality of the music. \n\nIt seems that Quorthon's clean vocals had improved a bit from \"Hammerheart\", to my ears, anyway. He sounds more heroic and comfortable with his vocals. However, it also seems that his performance here has been panned by quite a few listeners, as well. I guess different people have different opinions. I've never thought he was a particularly great singer anyway but here, he sounds more natural and comfortable, and less awkward, not that he was bad to begin with, of course. The lyrics to this album are also top notch and themes of epic tales of battle, nature, and Viking mythology are perfected here. The lyrics aren't necessarily complex in syntax, as Qurothon is Swedish and English would be a second language, but they still evoke the heroic atmosphere:\n\n\"Though death may await me on the battlefield\nI die to go on but by the great hail I will go,\nI am marching under the runes\"\n\nSee? They're simple but still follow the epic themes and we can understand them clearly due to his improved clean singing being the primary vocal style throughout the album.\n\nWhile Bathory has always had a strong discography disregarding the second album of his fairly watered-down thrash metal era, \"Twilight of the Gods\" remains his strongest original Viking-era album and may be his strongest overall. I'd rate this among the best albums of all time and every time I listen to it I get the same feeling I have always gotten, and images of epic battles in the North.\n",
        "\nI have read that all \"guitars\" on \"Under the Sign of the Black Mark\" are synthesizers. I guess this was only a promotion gimmick that I just do not understand. I have also read that Quorthon (R.I.P.) hated this album. Without doubt, this was just another promotion gimmick that I do not understand as well. To be honest, I don't give a damn about all these rumours. Bathory's third album is the mother of so many further works and its phenomenal status remains unaffected, even if a totally fucked up nerd with greasy hair would discover that the drums were just cow bells, played by a drunken Bavarian farmer.\n\n\"Under the Sign of the Black Mark\" possesses all that you can expect in abundance, but its greatest advantage is the dark aura of the album. Despite its computerized production, it cannot be beaten in terms of atmosphere and spirituality. In particular the gigantic \"Enter the Eternal Fire\" casts its spell on the listener. This epic masterpiece impresses not only with the perseverance of its glorious main riff and the dramatic configuration. The catchiness of the melody, the massive sound, the spooky keyboard line that sets in at 5:25 and the menacing ending that thrives on the desperate vocals of mastermind Quorthon, each and every detail contributes in an outstanding manner to these perfect seven minutes. 30 years after the release of the song, it is still amazing to hear how the combination of an almost solemn atmosphere and the unholy dedication works. Inter alia Darkthrone paid tribute to this monumental piece. To be more accurate, they made the attempt to pay tribute, but they were doomed to failure. Their (unofficial) cover version is called \"To Walk the Eternal Fields\" and was part of \"Under a Funeral Moon\". Heavily influenced by Quorthon, the Norwegians presented the same compositional approach with the same dominating riff. Nevertheless, they were miles away from the splendour of Bathory, not only because of the disastrous sound of their record. A lesser known band, Quintessenz from Germany, made it better. Their \"Iron Hammer Sacrifice\", especially its second half, also worships Quorthon's titanic anthem, but it is a very well executed and respectful homage.\n\nTo my great surprise, the mid-paced tracks like the aforementioned anthem left and still leave a greater impact than the tunes which set the focus on speed. \"13 Candles\", another unswervingly stomping track, is also mainly based on a simple guitar hookline. Quorthon shows once again that he is able to create terrifying yet overwhelming riffs that unite two demands that have been in conflict until then. On the one hand, they are extremely catchy and easily to internalize. On the other hand, it remains a mystery to me that they never wear out. Their creator is dead, but they have survived. Apart from this fascinating detail, all mid-tempo pieces shine with great choruses, the proper amount of almost primitive yet highly intriguing melodies and suitable lyrics that increase the diabolic aura. Not to mention the massive sound. It reveals its full effect during the mid-paced songs, because the guitars have more room to demonstrate their force. Admittedly, the production suffers a little bit from sterility, but the extraordinary mix is a kind of unique selling point at the same time. Yet this is almost just a side issue in view of the overwhelming song material. \n\nI have already praised the less rapid tunes, but this does not mean that I wish to neglect the high speed eruptions. Although it would not have been necessary, Quorthon follows the clich\u00e9 to start the album with the fastest track and \"Massacre\" is anything else but an unsuitable name for this brief orgy of violence. But the equally rabid \"Chariots of Fire\" or the extremely massive closer \"Of Doom...\" are not intimidated by this furious opening. In particular the final number with its relatively bulky riffing is a real monster. Quorthon, obviously gone crazy, delivers a very passionate vocal performance and the ending with the howling guitars and the heavily pounding drums reminds me of the glorious outro of \"Hell Awaits\". This is a pretty decent album from a fairly important band called Slayer, you may have heard this name occasionally... Nonetheless, Venom have been the greatest influence of the Swedish lone wolf, consciously or unconsciously. \"Call From the Grave\", another stomping mid-tempo jewel with very charismatic vocals and a sprawling guitar solo that seemingly opens the gates to eternity, builds a bridge to \"Buried Alive\" and \"Woman of Dark Desires\" lies naturally in close proximity to \"Countess Bathory\". To create a higher degree of difference, I hereby dedicate \"Woman of Dark Desires\" to the beautiful woman of my (more or less) dark desires. Too bad that they will never come true.\n\nThe artwork has a slightly comical touch, but its massive rocks represent the monolithic songs at the same time fittingly. The lyrics are printed on the inner sleeve of the original album and, to put it politely, Quorthon's English skills left room for improvement at that time. He realized that \"Now the hour is comed\", while \"someone allways\" wins in a \"peacefull\" valley. But these mistakes paled beside the fact that the lyrical contents strengthened the partly dark, partly violent approach of the tracks. Their fascinating aura was not based on grammar or spelling. I recommend you to do yourself a favour. Put the album on your turntable, start the record player, turn out the light and listen to this metallic bombardment without thinking about the authenticity of the guitar sound. Enough written. \"Under the Sign of the Black Mark\" is pure cult.\n",
        "\nBathory\u00b4s debut had a ridiculous playtime. Its design was almost painfully reduced to the essentials. Additionally, Quorthon (R.I.P.) made no secret of the fact that he was heavily inspired by Venom. His song formula was very simple and the album got the award for the most primitive drumming of all times. Furthermore, the lyrics glorified violence and sucked completely. Please do not expect me to go into details. Yet it is a fact that this album influenced legions of metal musicians and that alone is an excellent thing. But it gets even better, because all these aforementioned shortcomings paled beside the aura of the album. Its uncompromising approach, its stubborn bigotry and its youthful excessiveness merged with each other and a beast emerged from the primordial soup of black metal. \"Bathory\" must be seen less as a debut but rather as a statement. This groundbreaking album is the manifesto of evil.\n\nYou must be able to afford to be primitive at times. Quorthon\u00b4s musical (and lyrical) primitiveness knew no boundaries. But nobody took care of this situation, because his riffs and his malignance were capable to challenge Venom and Slayer at the same time. Of course, Quorthon did not need more than one riff per song. Everything else would have been a waste of resources. But each and every of the eight riffs was provocative, lethal and brilliant. With an outrageous explosiveness, the guitar salvos angrily burst out of the speakers. Filled with hatred and even more hatred, the unholy vocals heralded nothing less than the end of the world. In this lyrical context, \"Armageddon\" or \"War\" chose a global approach, while \"Reaper\" set the focus on individual destruction. To be honest, the lyrics of the later made me feel slightly desperate in view of its extremely moronic lines like \"Every virgin needs a rape\". \n\nLyrical content aside, the average speed was remarkable. Six songs were mercilessly rushing forward, only \"Necromansy\" and \"Raise the Dead\" followed a less furious approach. Especially the latter one added a certain amount of atmosphere. The funeral bells at the beginning transferred the listener on an autumnal cemetery and the subsequent riff was fairly melodic and ironclad at the same time. To put it very politely, the lyrics were slightly influenced by Venom\u00b4s \"Buried Alive\". Please compare Bathory\u00b4s \"I gasp for air / I scream for sight\" with Venom\u00b4s \"My lungs gasp for air / My eyes scream for sight\" and form your own opinion. I see a minimal similarity, but maybe I am just a pedantic bureaucrat? The line \"I tear at the lid\" was also cribbed by Cronos. But everything is allowed as long as the result is right. And \"Raise the Dead\", there is no doubt about it, belonged to the best tracks of one of the best albums in terms of black metal.\n\nThe B side was slightly stronger than the first half. The extremely energizing riff of \"Armageddon\" and its minimalist yet absolutely effective bridge attacked the neck musculature of every headbanger and \"In Conspiracy with Satan\" appeared as a sonic hellfire. Not to mention the elemental sounds of Quorthon during the one-word-chorus of \"War\". But under the bottom line, I also appreciate the songs of the A side very much.\n\nWhen subtracting the overlong wind intro of the relentless opener \"Hades\", the album surprised with a playtime of less than 24 minutes. A long time after its release, I read in an interview with Quorthon that he had been quite unsure whether it was a good idea to put such a short \"full-length\" on the market. But it has been shown that most metalheads are intelligent people (I am the exception to the rule). They were therefore focused on quality and not on quantity. Well, we can discuss whether the production shines with high quality. It was reduced to the necessary minimum, but - unlike the songs - it offered a very individual sound. I guess that attributes like raw, perfidious and infringing describe the production in a suitable way. However, the mix formed an indissoluble unit with the songs. Long story short, \"Bathory\" still marks a unique masterpiece of a lone wolf that acted both instinctively and successful. Its place in history is guaranteed.\n",
        "\nAh, Bathory, one of the first black metal bands the world has ever known. By the time Norwegian black metal inspired by Bathory and other bands such as Venom and Celtic Frost released their first full-length albums, Bathory was almost a completely different band from the dark and evil-sounding group that it used to be. The release of \"Blood Fire Death\" in 1988 would signal a major change in Bathory's sound until, finally, we get \"Hammerheart\". Unlike when most bands change their sound, Bathory's new style at that time was just as good (or perhaps even better) than its old one. \n\nThe Satanic lyrical themes that boosted the creative minds of Mayhem and Darkthrone and others is long gone and with them the diabolical and dirge-like evil atmosphere that dominated Bathory's sound. While \"Blood Fire Death\" introduced Bathory's fans to the proud songs of Vikings, it would be \"Hammerheart\" that would further drive them into their imaginations. What takes the place of evilness is the theme of Viking warriors, which at the time of \"Hammerheart\"'s release was a topic hardly looked at by musicians. Today we've got tons and tons of bands that center themselves around Vikings and Norse mythology and we've got the creative songwriting and musicianship of good ol' Quorthon to thank for that. \n\nLyrical themes isn't the only thing new with Bathory. Previous albums were typical of early black metal, featuring abrasive and aggressive, yet haunting and eerie chord patterns sometimes played at blast beat speed with many of them not lasting any more than five minutes. \"Hammerheart\" changes all of that, giving us long opuses such as \"One Rode to Asa Bay\" and \"Shores in Flames\". They are just two examples of songs that also carry a powerful and majestic energy as opposed to a dark and ominous one. When paired with the lyrical theme of the mighty Norsemen, they give Bathory a fresh new start as a band that revolutionized metal. It's proof that Bathory helped create not only black metal, but also Viking metal. \n\nIf any of you are looking for any song that remotely resembles anything from \"Under the Sign of the Black Mark\", you're not gonna find it here. Don't let that turn you away, however, so let the breathtaking nature of the music fill you with awe. That breathtaking nature can convey a variety of emotions, each corresponding to the songs' subject matter. Said emotions can range from mighty and magnificent, like the Viking warriors themselves in \"Baptised in Fire and Ice\" to haunting and somber like the arrival of Christianity to the Nordic lands conveyed in \"One Rode to Asa Bay\". The 11-minute opus, \"Shores in Flames\", starts out as soft and calm, yet builds up to a strong and majestic song. To further cement the mood of some of the songs, Quorthon uses much less of the raspy and gruff vocals that dominated earlier albums and uses more melody in his voice, sometimes singing cleanly in a somewhat baritone manner. It would be that baritone voice that captures the mystique of the mighty warriors of the North. He also barely even growls.This shows how much Bathory has evolved and matured. The band had gone from raw and evil to more melodic and mighty in a matter of only a two albums. \n\nIt's amazing to see how a band that had already cemented its style changed completely and still managed to make their new style sound good. Bathory's story is an example of successfully becoming a different band without displeasing people. When most new bands change their signature sound, it's usually in a desperate bid to sell records and gain fans, thus selling out. Bathory definitely did not sell out by recording \"Hammerheart\". Instead, they gave themselves a fresh new start and a new sound that would follow them until the end of their time.\n",
        "\nWhat haven't been said about this album already? It's been almost universally hailed and I've yet to hear anyone into metal dislike the first Bathory album. If I were to describe this record in a few words I would say that it's raw and simplistic. During this review these words often came to mind in describing what's on here. \n\nThe songs on here are all fantastic with their simple yet defined and strong riffs. All of them built around easy verse/chorus structures much in the same vein as Venom and Mot\u00f6rhead (the bands this album most often is compared to \u2013 and for good reasons). This in no way deteriorates from the experience but instead makes every song readily acceptable and all of them feels like a hit track. The songs, due to their structure and tonality are somewhat similar but the quality is so high that the similarity doesn't come of as a problem.\n\nQuorthon's vocals are some of my favourite screeches in metal and on this album his voice has this perfect balance between demonic howl, teen angst and and sleazy rock 'n' roll charm. If they ever would have played live I think that Quorthon would strut along the stage like he owned it \u2013 like any good rock/metal front-man should. \n\nThe music on the other hand is a bit sloppier. As mentioned the songs are good and Quorthons guitar playing is proficient but the rest of the band really only goes through the motions. The bass is barely audible and for the most times follows the guitar or play the root. In some places the bass does something different like for example in the chorus of 'In conspiracy with Satan' which is nice in it's simplicity. The drums, too, are kept to the bare minimum and never stray from variations on simple rock beats and some kind sloppy proto-blastbeat, that I call the one-beat (I don't know if it has a proper name) where snare, kick and cymbals are all struck at the same time on every beat. Simple stuff indeed but it has charm and tons of it. The sound is so raw and energetic that I can't do anything else than surrender to the awesomeness that these tracks have. This is probably the best ever debut album and one of the absolutely best albums ever, in any genre. \n\nThe one and only real complaint that I have is that on my release [the 2003 remaster] the intro 'Storm of Damnation' and 'Hades' are the same track. When listening to the full album this is no problem but sometimes I only want to hear Hades and don't really feel like waiting for it. That, however, does not deteriorate the supreme quality of this album. \n\nBest tracks: Raise the Dead, Hades, Necromansy\nWorst tracks: none, not even Storm of Damnation is bad.\n",
        "\nBlood, Fire, Death for me is the be-all-end-all prototype and all-mighty lord reigning over both viking and black metal. That album absolutely captivated me from the first listen. That being said, Quorthon may not have yet been ready to truly take the lead into full Viking ambiance at the time. With Hammerheart (God, if that isn\u2019t the most masculine, fist pumping title, I don\u2019t know what is), he strapped on his horned helm and galloped in full speed.\n\nThese songs are absolutely epic. 6 proper tracks that run from 6.5 to 11 minutes and one outro. The guitar sound is gritty, but it is the driving force of the songs. No fiddles or flutes here. Expect a lot of slow, plodding power chords backed by a pretty steady 4:4 time drumming. I\u2019m not sure how much of the simplicity is purposeful and how much has to due with the fact that this is a one man band. This being a first, ideas may not yet have surfaced for other elements. But don\u2019t get me wrong: it works. This feels no less epic to me than Amon Amarth or Ensiferum.\n\nThere is some fanfare to be noted. Most of the tracks sport a charming synthesizer used to mimic monk-like chanting. This helps fill out the sound and add to the guitar melody. Quorthon also throws in a few other atmospherics such as galloping hooves, clashing swords, and other relevant sound effects. While the sound is much clearer than say, Darkthrone, it is definitely low fi. But it wouldn\u2019t be the same album without it. The reverb and absence of polish give it not only a sense of charm, but also make me feel even more transported to another time. I feel like I am listening to warriors singing songs of battle around a campfire. The genuineness is unmatched. Aside from the few solos, what the guitars may lack in dynamics Quorthon makes up for in some really interesting vocal hooks.\n\nI do have two flaws I would like to mention. The first is that there is one drawback to this \u201cgenuineness.\u201d Quorthon has never been a strong singer. He tries to reach notes that are outside of his range, which results in frequent straining. It is not as cringe-inducing to me as on Nordland II, but there are definitely some difficult moments. But in some ways this adds to the feeling that the songs are sung by simple men going to war.\n\nThe second flaw is Baptised in Fire and Ice. While not a bad song, it just feels of much lower caliber than the other tracks. Something is missing, and for such a badass title, I was expecting more.\n\nOther than that, this is a masterpiece. If you consider yourself a Viking metal aficionado, this album is required listening. Make sure to listen to Blood, Fire, Death and possibly Nordland I as well. Fans of this will also likely be interested in Ensiferum, Amon Amarth, Borknagar, Enslaved, Equilibrium, Heidevolk, Manegarm, Moonsorrow, and Windir to name a few.\n",
        "\nBathory's \"Twilight of the Gods\" is an absolute gem and a landmark in the historical development of black metal. It continues with the unique style of of epic Pagan metal first heard on \"Hammerheart\" and develops it to full fruition. Although common by now, back in 1991 no one else was playing music remotely like this. The path that groups like Burzum and Emperor would later take - rebelling against traditional song structures and creating adventurous sequences of complimentary musical passages led by guitar melodies instead of vocals, owes much of its inspiration to Bathory's 1988-1991 creative peak. Beginning with \"Blood Fire Death\" and culminating on \"Twilight of the Gods\", Bathory introduced the concept of epic grandeur into black metal music, altering its course forever. \n\nThis is considered by many as one of Bathory's \"lightest\" releases, a description that has always mystified me. To my ears this is one of the most sincerely heavy albums ever created - maybe not in terms of tempo, surface level aggression or musical flash - but definitely so in terms of the emotional weight of the music. Some would even argue that it isn't even black metal due to its reliance on slower tempos, acoustic guitars, and clean vocals. However, the common traits of all great black metal - mysticism, Romanticism, and adventurous song structures are all present.\n\n\"Twlight of the Gods\" begins with an incredible title track, possibly Bathory's finest hour as well as one of the greatest songs in the entire black metal genre. The first half is focused around a \"Hammerheart\"-paced slow, heavy groove accompanied by backing choral voices. The song gradually builds in intensity like a slowly spreading fire until around the nine minute mark, when it abruptly fades out into an acoustic interlude, gradually building again into one of Quorthon's trademark guitar solos - slow, tasteful, and passionate if not overly technical. The last third of the song is mostly acoustic, the sound of the world gradually coming back to life after the flaming destruction of an apocalyptic conflict, or perhaps just an epitaph. \n\nAlthough none of the other songs on the album are as good as the opener, it's far from being a one hit wonder. Most of the following songs are around the 6-7 minute mark, driven by the same sort of slow and heavy riffs that characterized \"Hammerheart\", although this time around, there are gentle acoustic guitar melodies played simultaneously over the heavy riffs. This gives a great dichotomy and distinct identity to the music, and helps tie the longer songs together. Many bands, from Satyricon to Agalloch are doing this now, but it all began here. Some of the best of these can be heard in \"Blood And Iron\" and \"To Enter Your Mountain\". \n\nDrumming is straightforward but effective - simple rock grooves that follow the music and do not embellish. It doesn't feel like a drum machine, but it doesn't feel 100% natural either. It's most likely a heavily triggered kit, or some V-drums being played. As a drummer, I would have preferred to hear a more organic drum sound to fit the music, but I'm sure Quorthon did the best he could with the means available.\n\nWe also see Quorthon's strongest clean vocal performance, much improved from \"Hammerheart\". He'll never be known as a great singer, but the unseemly nasal rasp of his performance on \"Hammerheart\" has been cleaned up and he sounds more confident and mature this time around. Not only the singing, but the lyrics being sung are better than anything before - Quorthon obviously put a lot of time and thought into the lyrics, writing not just the usual fantasy material but a relevant warning of what happens when the world abandons the old ways. It's honestly quite rare to see lyrics of this quality in metal, especially from someone writing in what is not their native language.\n\nOverall, this is an incredibly reflective, passionate and mature album. Many listeners, having heard nothing but juvenile nonsense performed under the banner of Pagan metal, may find the more highbrow and adult nature of \"Twilight of the Gods\" boring at first, but with age and maturity they will no doubt come into a greater appreciation of its subtle beauty.\n\nIt should also be warned that this is an album that you really have to be in the mood to enjoy. Sit down and give your entire attention to it when listening. It's not the kind of thing you want to spin in the background or put a few songs on a playlist; it's so ponderous that it really demands ones' full attention to be appreciated. Although it's one of my favorite black metal albums of all time, second only to \"Hvis Lyset Tar Oss\", there are some times when I put it on, get a couple minutes in, and just say \"no, not now\" and throw on something else. But when one is in the proper receptive mood for it, there is almost nothing better.\n",
        "\n\u201c\u2026beyond the mountains where the wind cries out its pain\u2026\u201d\n\nRound two. And a round two made possible often means something went right in the first. Some familiar names from the original\u2019s fight card last year sign on again, if not to further enlarge their fan bases, then to bask in the magnificence of an even more stunning jacket pictorial, this time Philip Carl Wahlbom\u2019s 1855 painting, Gustav II Adolf's Death at the Battle of Lutzen (only a featured section; the wide view just may be the very definition of breathtaking art, but this work deserves way more than my mere word). It woulda been a shot in the foot if Tyfon cheapskated out and followed Vol. 1\u2019s art with Thor\u2019s sense of Unchained. \n\nA trio of Swedes, namely Trash, Oz, and Bathory, give us some familiarity to cling to while we find out if there are any campfire stories to be shared about the basically groundless Biscaya, Mentzer, and Highscore (the first two also Swedish while Highscore may as well be from southern Utah for all the high hills of info I can\u2019t find on \u2018em). As a purchaser of the first attack, it was nice to feel the safety net of Oz and Bathory beneath me as I plunked this down in view of the cash register. Sometimes warm fuzzies like these throw cold water on any hesitancy a trip to the checkout counter may have. \n\nAgain we\u2019re handed more tracks that already decorate homes on other discs, grooves cheap with not one, but both selections from four bands, and really, the only way to justify digging the cash out for this is if those homesteads are ones you haven\u2019t visited yet, and believe me, that was entirely possible. \n\nOnce more, stalwart Oz is wisely the first to fight, \u201cThird Warning\u201d (named after their \u201984 lp) entering the fray with the well-produced brawn and occult-singed appeal the quintet were known for during this time. Over on side two, despite being head honcho of its own \u201984 hard-to-come-by ep, off-anthem gem \u201cTurn the Cross Upside Down\u201d will use this compilation as a semi-remote vacation cottage where, along with its main house ep, it will hide out from the world, at least for awhile. Obviously no complaints are lodged against these two. \n\nBiscaya is this volume\u2019s Spitfire surprise, kidnapping two from their \u201983 self-titled lp (on big shot RCA, no less) which, incidentally, still hasn\u2019t been noticed to this day. Somewhat of a shame since colorfully-driven \u201cRockin\u2019 Vehicles\u201d and especially total meat n\u2019 potatoes \u201cHowl in the Sky\u201d are two of the best that could even consider waging war against Oz and Bathory. Something on the bizarre side is this five-piece\u2019s unabashed use of off-color keyboard variants, from those with lofty, horn-like drama to a gaggle of mutating corny ones that can be found goofing up a song like \u201cOn the Loose\u201d by progressive rockers Saga, sad stains on an admittedly cool tune. These songs, however, are quite strong enough to drown out their own distractions. \n\nThere was little doubt Mentzer was a member\u2019s last name (why else would anyone bother?), and Christer Mentzer is that guy, a vocalist who already fronted Silver Mountain\u2019s stage to promote their \u201984 Universe lp. The band\u2019s double feature is exclusive stock here primarily because outside of this sleepy-eyed pair, Mentzer as a band did little more than what statues do. Their point of inclusion beats the shit outta me as well, \u2018cos the more awake \u201cVoodoo\u201d is mid-measured, failed hit-fodder still inkling with far-off likeability that maybe Vanadium or Anthem would\u2019ve invented, yet is a dangerous creature compared to 15mph disc finale (?!) cruiser \u201cRussian Roulette\u201d. I\u2019ll personally give it a dollar if it swallows a bullet. \n\nIn other great news, more Trash has piled up to block exposure for more interesting bands, another two song heap blown in from \u201983\u2019s Watch Out, made up of the playfully AC/DC-ish \u201cBombay Mail\u201d and the slow, bluesy road to boredom known as \u201cDrop and Die\u201d. With patience gone with the wind, I wish they\u2019d take their own advice. \n\nThe most clandestine band here by tons is weirdly-named Highscore, another surprise that, while not quite reaching the score of Biscaya, does its part to affect the heaven/hell band ratio these compilations have been silently competing for and slide favor to this volume in terms of good-to-bad band (but not necessarily song) quality. Apparently deemed unworthy of the Archives (which I should correct), Highscore\u2019s sole tunes (apparently anywhere as far as I can tell) only strafe hard rock\u2019s radar when they\u2019re not flying out of its range altogether. The energy of \u201cPower Drinks\u201d is slower than its shaken up namesake and tears a page from more methodical and serious diaries possibly kept by a dryer Keel or manlier Vandenburg. \u201cKnock the Boss\u201d, however, puts money where its grinning mouth is and snaps with momentum and enthusiasm leaked from wetter Keel and perhaps a happy Black Rose. \n\nWasn\u2019t gonna wait \u2018til the end this time to heave Bathory into the fire, but there\u2019s more to say about their damnation stinking up things than usual. Basically, here their din is freshly-tormented and thrash-feral - the ultimate update for anyone who thought the black bibles they contributed to Vol. 1 were still cool regardless of their lack of legendary Bathory ferocity that would arrive with the self-titled debut released toward the end of a finally thrash-infused \u201884. Well, here's the proof of Quorthon having his ear to the grindstone when his first taste of thrash metal (likely) swarmed over him. His response to this new genre\u2019s savagery is spelled out here in big 'ol letters - the influence is nothing short of palpable; metal's most recent style explodes within \u201cHades\u201d and \u201cWar\u201d, and both are easily more sloppily viral as they speed untamed and way closer to out of control, resulting in making Vol. 1's Motor-Venom-souled duo seem almost stuffy and outdated in comparison. In light of the band's new scathing style, it seems (and sounds) almost silly to stand Bathory next to their contemporaries here. I mean, imagine the disc was a show billed with this line-up. Who\u2019d be out of place by a mile? \n\nY\u2019know that \u201983/\u201984 change in metal weather I always seem to be babbling about in reviews, that \u201983 heat-up period of \u201884\u2019s future, toothier generation of sweathogs to come? Well, unwittingly documented by the collective Scandinavian Metal Attacks is my longwinded case-in-point as well as a conveniently clear example made sonic by Quorthon and his two cronies - a before/after picture of style. Vol. 1 is Bathory\u2019s before picture, showing a mentality that could only capture ideas that were already out there - well-worn traditional and however worked-over and heated up speed and power metal had gotten. Vol. 2 is the after image taken not even a year later (with their debut yellow goat released in Oct. '84), showing the 'band' indeed discovered a sound-altering wellspring along the way, a tumultuous body of aqua apparently hidden well enough that the majority didn't catch on 'til '85. (Re)Born from this is a leaner, more agile and more ferocious Bathory...one of the few entities stoking the furnace of \u201984\u2019s new steaming design. \n\nThat wellspring? Thrash metal, of course. \n\n\u201c\u2026prince of darkness leads us all, strike the Christian down\u2026\u201d\n",
        "\n\u201c\u2026don\u2019t be afraid, don\u2019t run away\u2026\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not often you find a metal compilation titled to beat around the bush. Nah, it usually hits you like a rock, or in direct relevance to the musical style here, a cannonball \u2013 Metal Massacre, Metallic Storm, Speed Metal Hell, Thrash Metal Attack, Skull Thrash Zone, German Metal Fighters, and the wonderfully clear in all meaning and intent, Scandinavian Metal Attack. It\u2019s not one you\u2019d want to lay across the back of a baseball jersey, but it\u2019s great all the same. \n\nA tag like Scandinavian Metal Attack is meant to get the shagheads through the door that you know would revel in such an event (and of course with the additional hope that this number is legion). Another hope, albeit secondarily, is it\u2019ll pique the primal curiosity of the casual rocketeer who isn\u2019t immediately frightened away by it. Then when the final aesthetic is a front cover emblazoned with M\u00e5rten Eskil Winge\u2019s painting Tors Strid Med J\u00e4ttarna (Thor\u2019s Fight with the Giants) that will surely trumpet the bearded honor of every northern-born spirit with a mead-filled horn in his hand, then maybe, just maybe, a copy or two might find its way outta the store if it isn\u2019t carelessly flipped past on the record rack. The big picture is that any compilation\u2019s name or jacket magic is the small picture, the stroll to home plate where the batter\u2019s box awaits, that chalked-out rectangle where the real game lives and breathes. It\u2019s there bands dig in their cleats, spit sixteen times, and wait breathlessly to avoid that breaking ball to the groin. \n\nRecorded and collected mostly during 1984\u2019s first pitch of January and released shortly afterward in March, it was an attack launched around the time when major changes were rewriting metal\u2019s rulebook, stylistically from whatever known pitching passed for early speed and power metal to the unknown future fields of thrash metal and its 90+ mph fastballs. Ultimately, however, SMA is a little too early to really catch a glimpse of metal\u2019s newer uniforms, but one or two of its players are squinting like hell to see \u2018em. The others\u2026well, I think some are almost playing a different sport. \n\nFor this collection, pre-played content seems par for the course, with a few groups having previously released albums in the big leagues from where a song or two (from more than one band) has been loaned out to fill grooves here. An example is the game\u2019s opening swing which doubles as the title of Oz\u2019s \u201983 lp, Fire in the Brain. While this cool n\u2019 catchily-chorused single, as well as their upper deck home run \u201cSearch Lights\u201d, could be viewed as reruns from the Finlandians\u2019 last season, they do a helluva job brightening up the disc\u2019s highlight reel, frankly more so than just about anyone else. \n\nAnother pair of momentarily-traded players, Swedes this time, are Trash\u2019s \u201cNo More Rock Tonight\u201d and \u201cWatch Out\u201d, titled after their \u201983 debut. Because this five-piece pretty much fouls out, we luckily only have to witness their hard rock trot back to the dugout, and while Trash probably isn\u2019t trash definitively, things around here would be better off if they trotted outta this game and down to the showers. \n\nExclusive appearances from Sweden\u2019s Spitfire somewhat surprise and win over this fan, not only with the burly traditional swing of their bat, but the noticeable effort that sends \u2018em up the base path. \u201cEyes of Storm\u201d at first seems like it\u2019s gonna whiff behind its lightly-plucked ballad trance and a swingin\u2019 n\u2019 missin\u2019 set o\u2019 pipes that are kinda off-key and come close to mewling, however a well-timed shot to the gear shift gets things going along with some seedier vocals and carries on over to \u201cCrazy Living\u201d and its Tyrant-like (GER), compellingly simple rhythmic drama. \n\nYo! Zero Nine! What is this, backyard badminton? Despite a pair of \u201982 full-lengthers and a batting helmet full of singles, this Finnish sextet bless two new ones unto the collection with the MTV C-grade \u201cUnder the Sun\u201d and micro-metalized \u201cWalk Away\u201d, which would rock their sooner-than-later \u201984 lp Headline and anything else they\u2019d ever do (as recent as \u201909) further into oblivion. Please tell me, why this band? Did it involve slipping a stuffed envelope under the door of the men\u2019s room? I mean, Trash can stay if these guys drown in the shower instead. Consider this compilation penalized 09% metal points for wasting shelter on this crapola. \n\nLeft, of course, is the cackling wyrd of Bathory, easily the most relished and renown relic of the roster, adjectives proven by the sands of time that, by this time, haven\u2019t yet been turned to coal by the debut\u2019s goat breath. A team of three (fleshed out by drummer Van McBurger and bassist Freddan) partake in the summoning, yet who else but Quorthon wields the black cold-iron club to clock these early, manageable, Venom-injected, demo-less, pre-thrash, pre-official ghosts of \u201cThe Return of Darkness and Evil\u201d and scarce personal fave, \u201cSacrifice\u201d, into unlit alcoves of the ball park. Consequently, it\u2019s these lost candles that have burned this ten-tracker into the memories of most Bathory hunters.\n\nClearly this attack isn\u2019t lacking some weaklings banished to the bottom of the batting order, but its overall hitting average translates to a 3-fer-5 night, which isn\u2019t something to sell the franchise over. Held aloft on shoulders are Oz and Bathory while their families proudly wave from the bleachers, meanwhile the decently-performing Spitfire throw up a few hi-fives and unexpectedly vanish from the festivities. The rest\u2026well\u2026whatever. Zero Nine as a draft choice for this is still a mystery to me as no relation seems to exist between the other acts or the label. Same goes for Spitfire, but at least they pulled the ball for some hits, and if anything, their unnatural lack of history should mystify anyone who gives a hoot. \n\nAs for the others, the connections are pretty simple. The record label Tyfon Grammofon, which financed Oz\u2019s \u201982 debut, was founded by Borje Forsberg, who would very shortly plant the flag of Black Mark Productions, the label that released Trash\u2019s \u201983 debut. He\u2019s also Quorthon\u2019s \u2018ol man. Y\u2019see, the baseball diamond comes full circle. I guess.\n\nFun fact 89d (-2): my favorite compilation title ever is Witchery Spellbinders, an Aussie from \u201975 that\u2019s also the first ever v/a to feature the electrical burns of AC/DC. \n\n\u201c\u2026you\u2019ve still got the strength to start up the black metal storm\u2026\u201d\n",
        "\nI worship Bathory. They were one of the finest bands EVER and for sure I can admit that the first six (the Great Six) albums, which Quorthon has composed and recorded were unique and perfectly magnificent pieces of metal music. And the fact that Bathory has been changing the sound and style so much between all these records doesn\u2019t break that impression. At the same time I must admit that \u201cTwilight of the Gods\u201d is also the last Bathory record, which I truly, deeply worship, as I am not so enthusiastic about either \u201cOctagon\u201d or \u201cRequiem\u201d and then the last three full lengths (\u201cBlood On Ice\u201d and \u201cNordland I & II\u201d) are OK, but don\u2019t match the quality of the Great Six at all.\n\nBut that\u2019s another story, for another review, here I am going to write something about \u201cTwilight of the Gods\u201d \u2013 LP, which once more proved that the music of Bathory is eternal and matchless. Obviously it will be pointless to compare this sixth LP to the trilogy of first three albums of Bathory, as musically and lyrically they\u2019re just totally different (but all amazing in their own way). You all know that with \u201cBlood Fire Death\u201d and \u201cHammerheart\u201d Quorthon has started his Viking trilogy, but even when we compare \u201cTwilight of the Gods\u201d to \u201cBlood\u2026\u201d the difference in the musical direction is quite huge, but at the same time I feel like with this album Quorthon has reached the peak of what he intended to achieve in his Viking trilogy and completed something truly unique and awesome. And he did so by composing the most easily listenable and almost progressive rock metal music, which could have been a great disappointment for the fans of Bathory\u2019s earlier albums, if it wasn\u2019t for the fact that the feeling, the atmosphere and the composition on \u201cTwilight of the Gods\u201d remained absolutely fantastic. And even if this LP isn\u2019t aggressive at all and is so melancholic and catchy, it still catches my heart every time I listen to it.\n\nI mentioned that the album is easily listenable\u2026 it damn is. It is almost radio friendly, if only radios were playing long, melancholic metal songs. Quorthon has really changed the basics of his songs on \u201cTwilight of the Gods\u201d. First of all he concentrated on the clean vocals in the entirety of the album. Sure, he has already used them a lot on \u201cHammerheart\u201d (another album I worship), but \u201cTwilight of the Gods\u201d is devoid of any more aggressive vocals (and riffs). But it is not a failure, as Quorthon has had really fantastic voice, which fitted the epic music perfectly, so I cannot imagine now \u201cTwilight of the Gods\u201d without such style of singing. It just wouldn\u2019t sound right, especially as the music is also sometimes way different to the previous albums. Forget any black metal riffing from \u201cUnder the Sign of Black Mark\u201d or sharp, thrashing pieces from \u201cBlood Fire Death\u201d. This is truly epic and impressive playing, based mainly on the acoustic guitar, which basically fills the entire album, playing along the electric guitars just like bass and drums. And I wouldn\u2019t even be surprised if \u201cTwilight of the Gods\u201d was actually composed on the acoustic guitar\u2026 Anyway, the final result is truly amazing. These acoustics give the album a special sombre feeling; they add to it some kind of folk music touch or the classic progressive rock feeling. All in all they also make the whole sound less aggressive and more easily understandable, clearer and thus I think that even those, who don\u2019t like the metal music would like this album, especially as it is filled with many hooks, memorable, heroic, catchy choruses and almost melancholic, sad, yearning feelings. I must admit that \u201cTwilight of the Gods\u201d is in my opinion by far the most epic and most majestic album in the history of metal music.\n\nAnd to start your album with 14 minutes long epic tune such as \u201cTwilight of the Gods\u201d is something what only Quorthon could have done. This song alone \u2013 with its prologue and epilogue - for sure is one of the highlights of this LP and perfectly represents the entire album, as it just has everything what makes \u201cTwilight of the Gods\u201d to be such a significant, unique LP. Plenty of long, instrumental passages, including some acoustic pieces, many epic and majestic riffs and totally possessing chorus part\u2026 and of course that fantastic clean singing of Quorthon. He may be playing one motif (killer riff!!!!) for most part of the song, but the way it is arranged and composed, with all those acoustics and everything else around it makes it sound just impressive and involving. It is just a delight for my ears and I love the way the songs are structured, how they progress and build the atmosphere and the whole tension, not just within one song, but also through the entire album. When holding the lyrics sheet and reading the texts it is again almost like a journey through the distant past years (although the title track tells more about the modern days I think) and if you close your eyes you can almost see these landscapes and visions, which Quorthon described in his lyrics. Fantastic feeling. And the music is just spotless, as all songs from side A are just impressive and faultless, starting with the epic opening anthem through \u201cThrough Blood by Thunder\u201d, which is almost like a rage and more angry track and to \u201cBlood and Iron\u201d, which may be the least favourite of all three songs from side A, but which brings some memorable moments as well, especially the impressive opening theme has stayed in my mind.\n\nBut side B has even more killer tunes starting with \u201cUnder the Runes\u201d, which is based on a riff, which sounds like a hard rock riff, but played in more epic and majestic way. Then we have two excellent pieces \u201cTo Enter the Mountain\u201d and \u201cBond of Blood\u201d, which are the quintessence of Bathory on this album. And finally the whole album finishes with \u201cHammerheart\u201d and this epic tune surprises a lot. It basically is a classical music theme titled \u201cSaturn\u201d, originally composed by an English composer Gustav Holst, to which Quorthon added the vocals\u2026 and well, well, the final effect is thunderous. It is just an epic tune, very sad and it almost sounds like a farewell \u2013 and it was supposed to be one, as \u201cTwilight of the Gods\u201d was meant to be the final Bathory release (and when listening to \u201cRequiem\u201d and \u201cOctagon\u201d I wish it was). Just as I always get quite nostalgic and emotional when listening to \u201cSong to Hall up High\u201d from the previous LP, these same feelings come back with \u201cHammerheart\u201d and words like \u201c\u2026Now that the wind called my name and my star had faded now hardly a glimpse up in the empty space and the wise one-eyed great father in the sky stilled my flame\u2026 The vast gates to hall up high shall stand open wide and welcome you with all its within and Oden shall hail us bearers of a pounding hammerheart\u2026\u201d. Hail Quorthon!\nStandout tracks: \u201cTwilight of the Gods\u201d, \u201cThrough Blood by Thunder\u201d, \u201cHammerheart\u201d, \u201cTo Enter the Mountain\u201d\nFinal rate: 90/100\n",
        "\n\u201cHammerheart\u201d \u2013 it is for sure one of the most influential albums in the history of the metal music; one, which brought something completely new to it \u2013 a concept based on the Scandinavian mythology of the Vikings\u2026 Already \u201cBlood Fire Death\u201d had started it, but it was on \u201cHammerheart\u201d, where Quorthon has fully based his work on the Norse legacy, with every song telling the story about it. And when you listen to \u201cHammerheart\u201d you can truly feel that with every second of the album \u2013 with the atmosphere of the music, with the lyrics\u2026 It is a great experience, when you listen to \u201cHammerheart\u201d and at the same read the texts, so you can feel the whole atmosphere\u2026 And when looking at the front artwork, it is like \u201coh yeah, amazing!\u201d \u2013 it is an old painting titled \u201cThe Funeral of a Viking\u201d done by an English artist Francis Dicksee; absolutely amazing piece of work, very detailed and perfect, dramatic painting\u2026\n\nBathory\u2019s music has changed and transformed a lot since the debut LP \u201cBathory\u201d, but despite all these changes I still love it and consider the Viking albums of Quorthon as some of the most phenomenal stuff ever composed by the metal bands. Why? Well, just listen to it, for fuck sake. The music is so passionate, so emotional that every time I listen to it I feel like the aura of it fills me and is so real\u2026 The way Quorthon transformed all the feelings and that medieval, heathen magic into the sounds is just unbelievable and bloody effective and I dare to say that no other band have ever achieved such a thrilling effect. When listening to such LPs as \u201cHammerheart\u201d or \u201cTwilight of the Gods\u201d you simply feel the atmosphere with all the heart and move back in time to the ancient days, living it fully, and even if you\u2019re not Scandinavian it actually starts to mean something to you. With such amazing anthems as \u201cShores in Flames\u201d, \u201cSong to Hall up High\u201d, \u201cHome of Once Brave\u201d and \u201cOne Rode to Asa Bay\u201d it becomes fully involving, epic, emotional and essential listen. \n\nI guess a lot of respect should go for Quorthon\u2019s vocals on the album. Long gone are the times of black metal, which the band has played in its beginnings, becoming more and more harmonious, epic, easier to listen to and way less harsh and obscure\u2026 And together with the change of the music the vocals have developed a lot. Quorthon stopped using his harsh, throaty voice, opting for absolutely phenomenal way of clean singing; one which fits the music perfectly, in my opinion, as it is as epic and as melodic as the music itself, fitting the sounds impressively well. Actually, in my humble opinion, the vocals are the main force of the album! They seem to carry the whole tension and emotions, as well as the melodies, while sometimes the riffing is almost in the second plan, like in \u201cHome of the Brave\u201d \u2013 would this song sound so damn excellent and effective if the vocals were different? I think it wouldn\u2019t be even half as good. And the same goes really for the whole album.\n\nMusically \u201cHammerheart\u201d goes even deeper into what later have been called Viking metal than \u201cBlood Fire Death\u201d\u2026 While the previous LP had some truly unique, epic anthems such as \u201cA Fine Day to Die\u201d and \u201cBlood Fire Death\u201d (which are some of my favourite metal tracks of all time!), it still held a number of more aggressive, almost thrashy songs, which if were recorded badly would surely fit the debut LP without a problem. \u201cHammerheart\u201d has been completely devoid of such aggressive and fast songs, being fully dedicated to slow or mid paced monumental, majestic metal. This way I think it sounds like a more complete and conceptual work, where everything fits together better\u2026 And the songs, which I have mentioned earlier, and which are on side B of the vinyl, are a prime and most perfect example of what \u201cHammerheart\u201d is\u2026 \u201cSong to Hall up High\u201d is an acoustic song, with some emotional singing of Quorthon, one which may sound odd and sort of like a monumental Viking ballad, but I love it anyway and I find is as very, very memorable tune\u2026 The ending part of it, with the final verse is just beautiful and I can listen to it over and over again, hailing Quorthon for such a great music. And then there\u2019s \u201cHome of Once Brave\u201d \u2013 and what a fantastic song that is. It is very powerful, very catchy and majestic, with some absolutely splendid vocal arrangements, while the musical background is quite simple and classic Bathory, but here that simplicity of the structure is unimportant, if you hear some truly bombastic and epic riffs and drumming, plus these absolutely phenomenal vocals. And \u201cOne Rode to Asa Bay\u201d is a ten minute long piece of monumental, epic work, which puts bands like Manowar to the shame. I just love it and I always have the old video for this song in my mind when I hear it \u2013 great stuff about the christianization of Scandinavia\u2026 But mentioning only these three tracks when speaking of \u201cHammerheart\u201d is not enough, as the whole LP is just excellent and perfectly arranged, composed and performed, with such tunes as \u201cShores in Flames\u201d, \u201cBaptised in Fire and Ice\u201d, \u201cValhalla\u201d or \u201cFather to Son\u201d.\n\nI think the most emotional part of \u201cHammerheart\u201d is when I read the lines: \u201cNorthern wind take my song up high, to the Hall of glory in the sky, so its gates shall greet me open wide when my time has come to die \u2026\u201d from the beautiful acoustic \u201cSong to Hall up High\u201d\u2026 It is very emotional, as Quorthon has died and it feels like a great anthem and tribute to this amazing musician, who, I am sure, had been greeted by his ancestors with all the glory. For such moments \u201cHammerheart\u201d is just a timeless classic album \u2013 yet another in the great discography of Bathory.\nStandout tracks: \u201cSong to Hall up High\u201d, \u201cHome of Once Brave\u201d, \u201cOne Rode to Asa Bay\u201d, \u201cShores In Flames\u201d\nFinal rate: 90/100\n",
        "\nI already stated in my other review that \u201cUnder the Sign of Black Mark\u201d is definitely my favourite Bathory LP and also one of my fave metal albums of all times\u2026 but Quorthon, through the years of Bathory existence, managed to compose and record several amazing LPs and if one would ask me which another LP of his I like most then I guess it would be \u201cBlood Fire Death\u201d. Hmm, obviously the choice if pretty difficult, as there\u2019s that amazing originator of what we know as nowadays black metal (at least in my opinion) called \u201cThe Return\u2026\u201d and there\u2019s also the great epic \u201cTwilight of the Gods\u201d. But I think \u201cBlood Fire Death\u201d is slightly better than these two \u2013 and \u201cHammerheart\u201d \u2013 mainly because this album has some of my favourite Bathory songs, so this is why I would choose this one. Anyway, \u201cBlood Fire Death\u201d should be mentioned as one of the most influential and significant metal albums of all times, not only due to the music it contains, but also because who knows, if this LP hasn\u2019t started something what nowadays everybody knows as \u201cViking metal\u201d \u2013 which is basically any sort of metal music, dealing with Viking myths and other Nordic stuff in the lyrics. Prior to that album Bathory was dealing with satanic and dark matters, with \u201cBlood Fire Death\u201d Quorthon changed some of his lyrics creating something totally new to the scene! At least I don\u2019t know about any other band, which would explore the Vikings theme so much before\u2026 OK, maybe there isn\u2019t as much of this stuff on this LP as on the future Bathory records, but surely it\u2019s the first time they\u2019ve appeared! I can only honour and admire Quorthon\u2019s impact on the evolution of the metal scene \u2013 first his early works have been a great influence on Norwegian black metal and then he created and influenced another group of bands \u2013 mainly Scandinavian \u2013 for something different once more. What a creative person he was\u2026\n\nAnyway, \u201cBlood Fire Death\u201d, released back in 1988, is the fourth album of Quorthon and one, which \u2013 just as any other previous release of his \u2013 brings yet another change in the sound of Bathory. I mean, if you listen to all three previous records it will be certain that none of them sounds like its predecessors and each brings something different to the sound and style of the band. Starting with Venom-esque self titled debut, then going through more darker and utterly evil \u201cThe Return\u2026\u201d and finishing off with wonderfully catchy, but epic, dark and evil and way better composed \u201cUnder the Sign of Black Mark\u201d \u2013 each LP is different. But \u201cBlood Fire Death\u201d is something way diverse and once more Quorthon just turned into completely different direction than anybody would expect. From one hand the album has a handful of savage and fast thrash metal songs and from the other there are some monumental, more melodic and almost beautiful songs, which take the epic side of the previous LP into another dimension.\n\nI guess my - and everybody else\u2019s \u2013 favourite songs from \u201cBlood Fire Death\u201d would definitely be the title track and \u201cA Fine Day to Die\u201d\u2026 The latter song \u2013 opened by a three minute long introduction called \u201cOdens Ride Over Nordland\u201d \u2013 is one of the finest nine minutes, which Quorthon has ever composed. This song is just perfect, the riffs are just amazing, so are the vocals and more so I just love the way the whole song has been built, how it develops and creates the tension, keeping the listener with the mouth open in amazement. Long part of this track can really be instrumental, but it still brings the attention and is catchy as hell. And would anyone in the times of \u201cThe Return\u2026\u201d expect Bathory to open the album with an acoustic guitar and clean vocals, creating rather peaceful aura, before the first truly heavy and epic riff begin? Combined with the lyrics dealing about the warriors going to the battle it surely feels almost like a fantastic movie soundtrack\u2026 just close your eyes and you can see the men, standing in the battlefield, roaring and holding swords, axes or spears, ready to fight or die: \u201c\u2026Along the black mountainside scattered, by the campfires awaiting the dawn two times a hundred men in battles, tried by the steel in the arrow axe and the sword\u2026\u201d. Another epic and impressive song is the title track\u2026 this one finishes the album in very similar vein to the opener \u201cA Fine Way to Die\u201d and trust me, it is equally thrilling and memorable as \u201cA Fine Day to Die\u201d!!!! The riffs in this song are just excellent; again this is very long song \u2013 10 minutes, so it is the longest one \u2013 opened by a short acoustic theme, soon joined by thunderous drumming and heavy riff; basically whole song has one main riff (one of Quorthon\u2019s best!!!!!!!!), accompanied by some keyboards, but with lots of variations during the song\u2026 The song structure is simple, but so damn effective and one of a kind, unique as hell and I always get shivers, when I listen to it! And the vocals of Quorthon in it are just excellent! They\u2019re way cleaner and more melodic than his usual harsh, raw voice and also more understandable, something he\u2019ll continue doing on the future albums. And again, you can just close your eyes to watch Ragnarok and all that Nordic stuff\u2026 so awesome! And finally I should mention \"For All Those Who Died\" \u2013 this song I think has pretty strong heavy metal influence, with that mid paced, catchy riff and simple drumming\u2026 It may not feel too complicated and also not as epic as the two tracks I mentioned above, but it is so damn catchy, so wonderfully memorable that it surely belongs to the finest moments of \u201cBlood Fire Death\u201d.\n\nIn between those monumental and epic tunes \u201cBlood Fire Death\u201d contains also a number of very aggressive and fast thrashing songs, which is a bit of a surprise, as I guess they literally can take you back to Bathory\u2019s beginnings, only on \u201cBlood Fire Death\u201d the sound is way better \u2013 even if it feels a bit chaotic in those fast songs \u2013 and they\u2019ve progressed a lot, they not as primitive anymore, if I can say so. Listen to \u201cThe Golden Walls of Heaven\u201d \u2013 man, drums just doesn\u2019t slow down there almost at all, except one fragment really, they\u2019re just beating the skin mercilessly with the same, fast tempo all the time, accompanied by great fast riffing and cacophonic guitar leads. Personally though I prefer \"Pace 'Till Death\" and \u201cHolocaust\u201d \u2013 if we speak of the side A of the vinyl - which are just excellent songs. The first verse of the \"Pace 'Till Death\" lyrics says everything about these two songs\u2019 attitude: \u201cOh I hit top speed, still it's much too slow\u2026\u201d hehe! Yeah, these are fast fuckers, relentless and maybe a bit messy here and there, but I like such stuff a lot. \u201cHolocaust\u201d is just insane, barbaric and it definitely is the fastest song, which Bathory have ever recorded, in my opinion. \"\u2026Mirror mirror on the wall I'm the fastest of them all!!!!!!\u201d hehe!!!!!\n\nBut of course most of the fans would worship Bathory mainly for the epic music and \u201cBlood Fire Death\u201d delivers a couple of stunning songs from this style\u2026 In my opinion even if this LP is not quite as phenomenal as \u201cUnder the Sign of Black Mark\u201d it still contains a couple of my favourite Bathory songs. And even if the likes of \u201cThe Golden Walls of Heaven\u201d quality wise aren\u2019t as good, it is good enough to just have this LP in the collection and build an altar for it \u2013 if you already haven\u2019t got the whole Bathory chapel in your basement! Oh, and obviously as everybody knows the lyrics to \"The Golden Walls of Heaven\" and \"Dies Irae\" are acrostics: the first letters of each line spell out words, namely \"SATAN\" and \"CHRIST THE BASTARD SON OF HEAVEN\". Can it get any more classic and cult? I don\u2019t think so!! Hail Bathory!\nStandout tracks: \u201cA Fine Day to Die\u201d, \u201cBlood Fire Death\u201d, \"For All Those Who Died\", \u201cDies Irae\u201d\nFinal rate: 90/100\n",
        "\nPeople sometimes ask in the interviews about the top ten (or five he!) of metal albums of all time. And usually the questioned musician would say \u201coh, it is impossible to say just ten, if there are so, so many amazing albums\u201d. I totally agree with it, it is just impossible to name just few LPs, if metal history is 30 years old or more and during this period there were thousands of albums released and among them there are so many absolutely astonishing LPs... But if I was about to make such impossible list, then I am sure that I know at least five LPs, which would just have to be there\u2026 sometimes more due to the memories, which I have about them than the actual musical value (which is still brilliant, anyway!). One of such LPs would definitely be Bathory\u2019s third opus \u201cUnder the Sign of Black Mark\u201d. I do realize that most people would like either \u201cBathory\u201d or \u201cHammerheart\u201d or \u201cBlood Fire Death\u201d LPs more, and sure, they are also fantastic, but for me \u201cUnder the Sign of Black Mark\u201d is the most thrilling and perfectly composed and arranged piece of Quorthon\u2019s music. It was also my first encounter with his music and that happened I think back in 1993, maybe 1994. At that time I knew only very few black metal bands \u2013 Beherit and Blasphemy, which I didn\u2019t like at all, and Darkthrone (\u201cUnder the Funeral Moon\u201d) and Burzum (\u201cHvis Lyset Tar Oss\u201d), which I liked way more, mainly due to that incredibly dark and ghoulish atmosphere of these albums (I wasn\u2019t so much into their raw production at that time)\u2026 And then someone taped me \u201cUnder the Sign of Black Mark\u201d\u2026 well, I have been hooked by this album immediately, even if I was more into death metal at that time. But there was something truly unique about Bathory\u2019s third album, what I liked so much. Later on, around 1997-98, when I had a two piece black metal project with my friend, we started to play three or four songs of this LP, so much influence it had on us. The feeling when playing them was amazing. So, not only \u201cUnder the Sign of Black Mark\u201d is just amazing musically, but also it gives me a lot of good memories. This is why I consider it to be one of my top ten albums of all times, even if I don\u2019t know if making such list is possible at all.\n\nComposition wise \u201cUnder the Sign of Black Mark\u201d is pure perfection; an album, which delivers a collection of astonishing, quite often almost catchy, but devastatingly dark and eerie songs. But that\u2019s not all; even the order of tracks, how they\u2019ve been putted together, seems to be carefully thought through, so the album starts with a pure destruction of \u201cMassacre\u201d, then goes through such classics of atmospheric, epic black metal as \u201cWoman of Dark Desires\u201d or \u201cEnter the Eternal Fire\u201d, to finish with such gloomy songs as\u201d13 Candles\u201d and \u201cOf Doom\u201d. When listening to \u201cUnder the Sign of Black Mark\u201d I must admit that the production of this album is definitely my favourite one from all three albums, which Bathory has released so far. Both previous LPs were much rawer and almost primitive in many ways, while \u201cUnder the Sign of Black Mark\u201d is much heavier and aggressive, but also open for those atmospheric parts, which this LP is filled with. I mean no way would \u201cBathory\u201d \u2013 with the sound it has - be able to have such song as \u201cCall from the Grave\u201d and make it sound so powerful, but dark and eerie, with its fantastic, melodic guitar solos and all the stuff like keyboards in another songs. More so, I must also say that while the guitar sound is just excellent for my taste here, also Quorthon\u2019s voice is just fantastic. OK, it always was, really, especially on \u201cThe Return\u2026\u201d, but his voice on \u201cUnder the Sign of Black Mark\u201d is even rougher and more powerful, at the same time it\u2019s quite understandable and with some brilliant arrangements. Really, when I listen to \u201cUnder the Sign of Black Mark\u201d I just cannot think of ANYTHING, what would be done wrong. From start to finish this LP is perfect. Pure masterpiece\u2026\n\nIt\u2019s also just impossible to pick up two or three songs from \u201cUnder the Sign of Black Mark\u201d and call them standout tracks. Each song is brilliant, each offers something truly exceptional and each has perfect arrangements, riffs, vocals\u2026 \u201cMassacre\u201d opens this album and is fast as fuckin hell, very brutal, uncompromising black metal song and then \u201cWoman of Dark Desires\u201d and \u201cCall from the Grave\u201d are more epic and atmospheric, with fuckin hooks all the way through. Once you\u2019ll hear it, you\u2019ll remember those riffs until the end of your miserable life, trust me! And then \u201cEquimanthorn\u201d will strike again with faster, viciously powerful riffing... and that awesome chorus part\u2026 you just wanna fuckin scream \u201cEquimanthorn!!!!!!!!!!!!\u201d! And this is how side A finish and when you\u2019ll hear it, you may understand what I meant when I wrote that the order of track is not accidental here!\n\nAnd I would think that it couldn\u2019t get any better than side A, but that is until \u201cEnter the Eternal Fire\u201d opens side B\u2026 and man, isn\u2019t it one of the best black metal anthems of all times??!! The riffing in it is just mighty and the atmosphere\u2026 well, it is gloomy, sinister and the whole effect is even deeper with the bells tolling. The impression is just huge, more so because the structure of this song is quite simple, I mean it is basically based on one main riff, where Quorthon just toys with it, changing the tempos or whatever\u2026 Well, you don\u2019t need much to compose a masterpiece. \u201c13 Candles\u201d is another truly exceptional song, one with similar sort of riffing as the one from \u201cEnter the\u2026\u201d or \u201cCall from the Grave\u201d, which doesn\u2019t mean it is exactly the same, only structure wise it also is pretty simple, with basically just one or two riffs, similar tempo and that infectious catchiness. And in case if you don\u2019t have enough then \u201cOf Doom\u201d will massacre you with probably the most insane, vicious, mayhemic, fast and uncompromising riffing from the whole LP. I really, really like this song a lot!\n\nWhile finishing this review and paying a tribute to Quorthon and his third album, I must also point out how brilliant and fast this composer was evolving and progressing. I mean just listen to \u201cBathory\u201d and then \u201cUnder the Sign of Black Mark\u201d. The difference is big, but from the other hand this third LP still has some traces of Bathory\u2019s old style. More so, I must also notice that the debut was nothing more or less but a Venom / Motorhead influenced black \u2018n\u2019 roll sort of stuff, but just take a listen, which way did Cronos and Venom go and how the Bathory style was developing. Isn\u2019t it one of the examples of \u201cthe student becomes the master\u201d thing? For me Bathory was always way better than Venom and such LPs as \u201cUnder the Sign of Black Mark\u201d only proves me right. I\u2019ve been listening to it for almost 20 years now and still I feel thrills like it was my first time, it just doesn\u2019t get boring. This definitely is one of my top ten metal albums of all time and one, which just must be in everyone\u2019s collection, best on vinyl, if you ask me!\nStandout tracks: ALL OF THEM!!!\nFinal rate: 100 / 100\n",
        "\n1986 was a year of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster, but somewhere else at that time, far in the North of the European continent, in Sweden, the freezing winds and Northern darkness has brought something maybe not as radioactive and lethal as that nuclear force, which the Eastern wind was bringing from the Ukrainian territory back then, but surely equally destructive\u2026 Bathory has finally spawned their second LP, \u201cThe Return\u2026\u201d!!! It was only a year after the release of Bathory\u2019s highly acclaimed self titled debut LP, but from the first listen one can notice a development in Quorthon\u2019s music. While the first LP was more or less Venom and Motorhead worship (although I have no idea whether Quorthon was actually ever influenced by Venom or not), but played in more evil and faster way, then \u201cThe Return\u2026\u201d came out as even more obscure, more malevolent, vicious and evil record. When I listen to \u201cThe Return\u2026\u201d I can clearly see, where the Norwegian sound of black metal mainly came from. I mean the riffing, as well as the harsh, raw, shrieking vocals and utterly dark and raw production of this second album of Bathory must have been the main source of influence for the whole early 90\u2019s generation of Norwegian bands, including Darkthrone, Satyricon, Hades, Burzum, etc. That itself is enough proof I guess for importance of \u201cThe Return\u2026\u201d and surely if anyone wants to know where the sound of the second wave of black metal come from, he must go back to the real roots of it and this album is an obvious choice.\n\nI don\u2019t think that \u201cThe Return\u2026\u201d is yet a perfect record (such definitely is \u201cUnder the Sign of Black Mark\u201d, in my opinion, an utter black metal masterpiece). There are few parts where I can say that the level of brilliance is not exactly there on the top, but only slightly, as all in all this album nails me down to the floor right from its very beginning, which is a creepy intro, \u201cRevelation of Doom\u201d, up to its final and also definite finest moment, which is \u201cThe Return of the Darkness and Evil\u201d. That sole song is enough reason to get this album, as in my opinion it belongs to the most memorable and finest, most important tracks in the history of metal music. I sincerely can say that I love this track; its simple, but effective riffs and structures and obviously every time I listen to it I just must scream the lyrics from the chorus part. This is what I call cult. Another song which stands above the rest is \u201cBorn for Burning\u201d. Think what you want, but for me this is essential early Bathory and definitely this particular track holds some of the best riffs and ideas Quorthon had in that early period of Bathory's existence. Again, a very memorable, catchy as fuck chorus and again a very morbid and obscure atmosphere. Phenomenal stuff!\n\nBut honestly I could mention almost the entire track list here and each of these songs is great. Take \u201cTotal Destruction\u201d for instance \u2013 a barbaric, violent, and totally aggressive demonstration of what Bathory was all about. And \u201cBestial Lust (Bitch)\u201d is a clear continuation of the style from the first record, again with the strong resemblance to some Venom all the way through. I can assume that some of you may feel slightly pushed away by the primitiveness of songs like \u201cPossessed\u201d\u2026this one, maybe my least favourite song from the whole LP, has almost troglodytic riffing and the whole structure of this track is as simple as it can only be, but it doesn\u2019t really matter as the atmosphere, which Bathory managed to create here, is one of a kind. And if one\u2019s a bit bored by this song, then maybe \u201cThe Rite of Darkness\u201d and \u201cSon of the Damned\u201d will make you feel better? Also, I must say that I really like what Quorthon\u2019s vocals are like on \u201cThe Return\u2026\u201d. They\u2019re very harsh, raw, and utterly morbid, the kind of singing that fits the obscure music perfectly. Total destruction it is!\n\nStandout tracks: \u201cThe Return of the Darkness and Evil\u201d, \u201cBorn for Burning\u201d, \u201cTotal Destruction\u201d.\nFinal rate: 89/100\n",
        "\n\u201cThursday 7th June, 2012 will mark eight seemingly long years since one of the world's most talented and ambitious musicians left this cruel world\u201d. Of course, that's what any devoted fan of Bathory mainman Quorthon (AKA Tomas Ace Forsberg) and his work will probably tell you. Is it any surprise that the last known album under his belt is one based on a Viking concept then? Certainly not. For anyone who has heard the supremely spectacular black metal force of 'Under the Sign of the Black Mark', the triumphant aggression and victorious sounds of 'Blood Fire Death' or the sorrowful yet still significant 'Hammerheart' albums however, these eight years will not have passed without grief and mourning. It may seem a slight exaggeration to say so, but Quorthon has been loved (and perhaps worshipped) by the metal world ever since the raw madness and evil destruction of Bathory's debut album hit international shores back in 1984.\n\nThis introduction merely signifies the build-up to Bathory's last (but not least) release, 'Nordland II'. The second part to the apparent four-album concept that Quorthon had prepared to unleash upon the world certainly seems an interesting one. Those who have heard 'Nordland I' will by now have either listened to 'Nordland II' or disowned it completely, and that may only be determined by whether you believe Quorthon still had it in him over twenty years after his first musical outputs or the fact that his vocals and musicianship is, well, just horrible. Plenty will have eventually given up on Bathory for the latter of these two reasons, but one thing stands clearly head and shoulders above the rest: The concept never gets boring.\n\nWhereas 'Nordland I' covered mostly Norse mythology, perhaps being what most of Quorthon's lyrical content has ever been based around, 'Nordland II' returns simply to the excessive use of Viking folklore and victorious events. No, it does not involve Quorthon repeating his raspy scream on the extremely aggressive track 'War' (WAAAAARRRR YEEEAAHHHHH WAARRRRRGHHH!!!). What it does contain a lot of is extremely good songwriting, but you will naturally expect this from listening to other Bathory albums of the same concept.\n\nThe album itself is slightly longer in total than its predecessor, but that doesn't mean to say it isn't as exciting or indeed as accessible. Whilst the album's introduction, 'Fanfare' is perhaps a little too atmospheric for its own good, there is plenty to be admired here. You will know that Quorthon loved to work with choirs, as on albums even as early as 'Blood Fire Death' and 'Hammerheart', and on 'Nordland II', he doesn't waste any time taking advantage of this. However, the album isn't exactly helped when Quorthon tries to sing in synchronization with these choirs, and especially when he tries to hit too high a note. This is because the obvious weakness that has been recurring in his vocals ever since he first sang harmoniously on 'Hammerheart' is also shown on this album. My point here is that, not only is Quorthon's voice the one true downside of this album, it also brings down the quality of songs such as 'Blooded Shores' and 'Vinland', making the album seem incomplete. If it was the choir work that only sang, and Quorthon stuck perhaps to sorting out everything else (bar his own singing), then 'Nordland II' would be infinitely better than it actually is.\n\nOne other negative aspect of the album is, however hard you may try to ignore it, the production itself. The performance of every guitar note, drum roll or instance of atmospheric sounds is astounding on here, but once again, the performance lets the album down almost too much to be regarded as anything else but a decent effort. It can't be ignored that the very well executed guitar solos and the thundering drums are marred by a half-hearted production quality, and even though Quorthon had the best intentions of making this album as unique as it could be, he really should have paid more attention to the sound. However, you could also argue that the production was made this way to reflect a Viking-like atmosphere, which is understandably relevant thanks to the lyrical themes themselves.\n\n\u201cSo 'Nordland II' doesn't sound like a very good album at all, does it?\u201d. I expected some of you may be asking this having read the first half of this review, but don't worry, because what keeps this album from falling flat on its face is the absolutely brilliant songwriting and very significant song structures. As said before, each and every song flows with such beauty and power that it really is hard to forget the music itself. On 'Blooded Shores' and 'The Land' Quorthon uses choirs to represent such victorious yet harmonious sounds, that one could almost forget the muddy production and focus on the excellent songwriting itself. Of course, Quorthon is no stranger to thundering guitar work and equally as powerful drum work, as on the epic songs of 'Hammerheart' and 'Twilight of the Gods'. On the eye-opening epic 'The Land' and sprawling overture 'The Wheel of Sun', guitars weave their way through every minute like its their last, and not a note is out of place. The drums, whilst not particularly sophisticated, also contribute to the power and grandiosity contained within each solitary anthem on 'Nordland II'. This is no different to Bathory's past releases, but it certainly has been enhanced.\n\nAnother similarly advantageous highlight of 'Nordland II' is the lyrical content itself. You will be asking yourselves \u201cWell of course the lyrical content's a highlight!\u201d for sure, but what is special about the lyrical content here is that it contains a certain sense of being higher in power than anyone else. Here's a few examples:\n\nThis land is mine to the end of time\nnone it shall claim or conquer\nthe mountains high : the endless sky\nthe forests and the sea (The Land)\n\nShields I have crushed with my sword\nwomen have I pleased endless nights\non foreign coast my brother did fall\nhe now dines in hall up high (Sea Wolf)\n\nAs you can see, Quorthon does not let up on the importance of being a Viking warrior at all. 'The Land' is but one important example of the significance of the 'Land' itself, this time being 'Nordland'. 'Sea Wolf' shows the importance of being a Viking warrior, and also the pleasures of 'pleasuring' women. It is yet another traditional aspect of the genre that Quorthon has managed to enhance to an almost unforgettable level, and yet fans of the band may still cast this off as \u201cjust another Bathory album\u201d.\n\nSo is this Bathory's best album? Perhaps not. But whereas it could have been improved in a lot of areas, it could also have been much worse than it actually is. Some may say the rating given for this album is too high, but it is entirely justified on the album itself, and not merely the significance of his entire career as a musician. Perhaps right now, Quorthon has already released the other half of the 'Nordland' album series in Valhalla. If he has, this other half may well have been a distinct improvement on 'Nordland I' and 'Nordland II'. For those who prefer the Bathory of the early days, you may or may not like this album at all. For those who wish to hear the last pieces of music he made before Quorthon's untimely death, you may listen to 'Nordland II' with caution, but also pride. Pride that he didn't make a completely horrible album. Because on this evidence, Quorthon exited the world in a truly memorable way, and one that would not make others forget about him.\n",
        "\nOkay, where do I even begin with this? This is the album that has founded the black metal scene. By far, it is also one of the most important albums to have in any heavy metal collection known to mankind. This was the first full length album release by Bathory and by far possibly the greatest in my opinion. It may sound weird that I think that this was the band's best work for that this was just a cheap, low budget, garage style production project, but truly it set the definite meaning to the sound of black metal. Many often site Venom's album Black Metal as the foundation of the genre but really this set it right in musical terminology. In this Album you got everything that any black metal band would do in their career. Fast paced music followed by shrieking guitars that sound like static, muffled blast beat drumming (which in my opinion sounds like a guy getting punched in the face repetitively but deepened to the fullest), deeply distorted bass that is almost unheard of, and most importantly, the revolutionary inhuman death shriek vocals performed by Quorthon, the true father of black metal and viking metal. But by far this is one of my favorite albums that I ever listened to and goes as one of my favorite works of black metal ever to be released.\n\nNow, this album is truly revolutionary for its time since no music like this was produced like this for a year as early as 1984. At the time, Quorthon, the lead front man and multi instrumentalist for the band, was 17 years old when he made this album. Despite the fact the reason for its production was primarily flawed through the lack of budget, yet he could perfectly pull off the sound if it too still sound raw, awesome, and brutal beyond belief. This album went down in history as an icon for extreme metal back in the 80s and so much more of a reputation it deserves. but the things I personally love about this album is not only the music, but the effort and inspiration it was for me to become a solo musician myself (work in progress). For a bunch of crazy ass Swedish kids to make an album so amazing placed me in the field myself as for the fact that they could pull it off and soon evolve to be even greater as the years would go by. \n\nThe music is beyond amazing. You start off with an eerie intro (a running gag for the band) in which entitled as \"Storm of Damnation\" is a dark atmospheric piece were ambient noise is combined with the sound effects of a harsh whirling storm of death. Also, every so often a bell chime goes off (which is actually the sound of the London clock tower) comes in and makes the scene only more haunting. It runs on for some three or so minutes being the third longest track on the album but truly sets the mood of it and of what is expected of the album. That in which is the quintessence of darkness and evil. Then it forms to the song \"Hades\" afterwards which is by far my favorite song on the track and perhaps maybe even my favorite Bathory song. The extreme lead guitar riff is phenomenally brutal, catchy, and faster than anything I heard for music released back then. The drums come in blast beating ferociously and once Quorthon's voice sounds the stage, shivers and fears are sent to the listener who dared to pick up the album. If you are like me, you will find yourself playing this song again and again like I did so many times in the past. Then there is the song \"Reaper\" which is a very Venom-orientated like song yet still pulls off better effect for black metal then they did. It's catchy, brutal, and all death-like. Really, if you are into necrophilia, you'll love this song as the song even interprets the Reaper's fetishes for dead women's flesh. Then there is the song \"Necromansy\" (yes it was spelled wrong on a misprint for a reason look it up) which is slower than the other songs for that the drums are calmer but the guitar and bass still sticks true to being awesome. It's the longest song out of these two to three and three quarters length songs but you will regret nothing once you here the amazing guitar solo at the end which runs nearly for a minute length or so. The there is the song \"Sacrifice\" a re-recorded edit track that originally came from the Scandinavian Metal Attack split as a more thrash/ speed metal orientated song. Still none of the less one of the best songs on the album. The drums return the repetitive crazy thrash beat as the guitars pull off amazing riffs that one can easily identify, rather than some black metal bands that tend to have the issue of using monotonous rhythms and riffs to the point where every song sounds the same, well in this case Bathory is the total opposite of that. \n\nThe second half of the album starts with the song \"In a Conspiracy with Satan\" which is a short song but terrifyingly brutal like the others. The song is all about going to hell and witnessing its wrath inflicted from the devil. Rather explicit, yet goes as one of the fastest songs in the album. The there is \"Armageddon\" a self explanatory song that every heavy metal band writes a song based on doomsday and the apocalypse. But the shrieking guitar distortion is really high on this song for that the riff spams again and again until it gets to the middle where it has a death/ doom metal based approach. The drums as thrashing violent like ever before the bass so deep and eerie as so the terrifying vocals makes this song very intriguing, yet not the dominate piece to this album, it's more like last minute filler but still sounds great. Then there is the song \"Raise the Dead\" which was not meant to be a Venom cover but its own song itself. This song starts off differently and has a more technically ambient approach to it like the intro. It starts off as an echoing gong going off and as it fades away one can hear a heart beat go on and off. Until then, the guitars come in and begin the song. A more rock based drum beat is incorporated and is slow like the 4th track but still pulls off great music and composition. The vocals are more snarly than the usual daemonic death shrieks, but none of the less it makes Quorthon sound like a zombie coming out from the grave commanding other zombies to arise with him in grand power. This song also runs nearly four minutes yet not enough to exceed but still goes as one of the longest tracks. The there is the song \"War\" which Varg Vikernes of Burzum clearly stole the chorus from for his song by the same title, but that's a different story. This is probably the shortest song yet the one of the fastest of the others and basically finishes before you know it. The guitar solo is epically amazing and intense like every other guitar solo on the album which nearly every song incorporates, and the funny part is many black metal bands that came after Bathory hardly used them at all. But still an awesome song it is and goes as another favorite. Then there is an outro called \"The Winds of Mayhem\" which only runs twenty six seconds and it somehow appears on like every single Bathory album released for no really good reason (another running gag I guess). It's basically a dark ambient keyboard solo of this eerie ghost like choir/ wind noise while a bass drum monotonously and slowly beats every few seconds later. It fades away gradually and so the album ends, unless you decide to play it again and soon play the shit out of it like I did and continue to do on my iPod. \n\nTo sum up, this album rocks. It is pure fucking black metal at its best and for the first black metal based release it deserves much praise. Yes the band got better musically over time especially when they moved to viking metal like in \"Blood, Fire, Death\" \"Hammerheart\" and \"Twilight of the Gods\" but still this goes in for his black metal trilogy. Note: Look up \"The Return....\" and \"Under the Sign of the Black Mark.\" These albums keep true to the black metal sound of things and are too amazing and beyond extreme. Overall, I dedicate this review to all listeners and especially to Quorthon who passed away 2004. R.I.P. See you in Valhalla. P.S. isn't that goat on the front cover just absolutely cute or what? But yeah I demand you all to buy this album or download it somewhere and listen to it. One cannot be a Bathory fan, collector, or even a true black metal fan without listening to and or having possession of this record. Overall, this is one of the best things I have ever listened to in my entire life. Rock out and hail to true black metal my friends. And get this record now.\n",
        "\nRight, to start off with let me make one thing clear, I am a complete and utter Bathory nut. They are the greatest band ever and Quorthon is a fucking musical genius. Hell, I even have a few Bathory tattoos! So this ranking is NOT for the music. That would get 100%, even though if I was compiling it, I would have picked different tracks, but then again if you asked 1000 Bathory fans to compile their favourite songs, you'd probably get 3000 different compilations! No, this review is for the entire package, and it is a COMPLETE. WASTED. OPPORTUNITY.\n\nWithin this package you get 3 cds worth of various Bathory songs from across all albums and also some Quorthon songs, but NOTHING unreleased. The dvd is of the hard to find One Rode to Asa Bay promo, an MTV interview, and home video footage of Quorthon on a promo tour of Europe for the Hammerheart album. This is packaged in a normal jewel case. \nFinally, you have a book that's the same size as a cd that looks at the history of Bathory with lyrics, songs, photos, etc.\n\nOK, let us deal with the good points first as I am a positive type of guy. The dvd is obviously the best thing in this package, containing the hard to find One Rode to Asa Bay promo video. Also included is an MTV interview when they call him Quorthorn (how hard is it to get someone's name correct?) and discuss the Hammerheart album. Finally, there are some nice home videos by Boss of Quorthon on a promotional tour for Hammerheart. It's interesting to watch & to also see some of the fashion styles of the fans!\n\nOne Rode to Asa Bay doesn't really contain Quorthon & his two hired hands a great deal, but has the story of the song acted out (something that Moonsorrow borrowed for their Jumaltan video). It's a nice video, though nothing amazing.\n\nThe 3 cds are good in that they cover, which is all aspects of Bathory's past as well as Quorthon's solo stuff. There are even the covers by Bathory of Ace of Spades & War Pigs and by Quorthon of The Beatles' Sleeping & the Sex Pistols. War Pigs is pretty faithful to the original, but Ace of Spades is slowed down considerably & sounds utterly epic! A great cover that's very different. There's nothing much to say about the Bathory originals, only that you do get a shorter version by a few minutes of Wheel of Sun on here, so I guess that makes it kind of exclusive, though I have no idea why they did this! Finally, you also get the Silverwing track that Quorthon did with his sister Jennie Tebler. It's a cool song, though one that takes a little bit of time to get into. The start is a bit odd, backwards & forwards almost & the sound is quite dry. You also get her version of Song to Hall Up High. It's not too bad, but I prefer the original. The music has not changed, but Quorthon's vocals have been removed & hers added.\n\nThe book is also quite cool. It has (the start of) a History of Bathory, some photos, a list of all Bathory songs in alphabetical order (OK, I'm sad, but I like this!) and also all the lyrics to the songs used on here.\n\nSo that's the good. Unfortunately, now the bad. And this is much longer! Firstly, the box itself. It is made out of some flimsy cardboard much like a cereal box, although that might be doing cereal boxes an injustice! Why couldn't have it have been a harder cardboard & laminated? Or made from wood (like the box sets Century Media did for Unleashed & others a few years ago), or metal, or leather? Well, let us just say that they could have done a much better job on that.\n\nSecondly, the cds. The song choices are pretty good, though could be better, however for some bizarre reason they have decided to split up Odens Rides Over Nordland & A Fine Day To Die. Now these 2 tracks segue together perfectly. AS THEY WERE MEANT TO! Putting a couple of tracks in between just doesn't make any sense, frankly. Also most importantly, THERE ARE NO UNRELEASED SONGS! That is a massive disappointment. As a tribute to Quorthon over 3 discs, you would have thought 1 disc could be obscure & unreleased songs. I have read that Boss will not release any unreleased Bathory songs until he dies. I wish that he would reconsider that!\n\nThe packaging of the cds is also horrible. Not much thought seemed to have been given to the type face colour & the background, ending up in an eye-straining headache-inducing mess. Also, each cd's inlay card is just 1 sheet - front cover up front & track listing on the back. No lyrics or other info. I assume that this is because all of this info is in the booklet that comes with the package, however if you got the cds individually I think that you would feel cheated.\n\nThirdly, the book. As I said this is quite cool, but the history of Bathory contained therein is what was published on the website, chronologically in sections, and because Quorthon died before it was finished, it is no way near complete. So whilst it's nice to have something, it is rather lopsided and doesn't go into any detail on the later albums. \n\nFinally, though the dvd is good & a welcome 'proper' release of One to Asa Bay video, I can't help feeling that this could have been more too. A history of Bathory would have been good along with interviews with bands that he has influenced. There certainly would be a lot of these! Perhaps even some live covers of Bathory stuff. All this would have been great if they had been included.\n\nSo all in all, if you have never heard of Bathory & wanted to hear what they sound like, this certainly would cover every style that they/he played, and so is a good introduction. However, for those of us who have every album by Bathory, the only reason to get this set is the dvd.\n\nFinally, ever noticed the figure on the front cover has 2 right hands....?\n",
        "\nThis album is downright essential for all black metal fans, and highly recommended for the rest of metal kind. Sure, I can talk about the historical importance of this album and how it helped shape the extreme metal scenes rising at the time. I can mention how nearly every person credited with forming the genre of black metal can be seen in one picture or another with this album cover on their t-shirt. But does that matter as much as the fact that this album fucking kills? No. Rocking riffs is all this album is and the strained neck will be your badge for surviving its wrath.\n\nThe thing with this album, that makes it so perplexing is how simple it is. Every song only has like one riff, with like one lead break of squealing rapid notes with muffled drums and bass and angry rough screech over top of it. Every song follows basically this same formula. But each song is memorable, and every song gets stuck in your head, and every song makes you thrash. And that is the magic of this album. It's simplicity is what makes it so effective. If I ever want a quick metal shit fit on a walk or whatever, this album offers me 8 tracks they'll do just that. It's quick, to the point, and awesome.\n\nThe only real flaw with this album, and I'm not the first to realize it, is the intro track, Storm of Damnation, goes on for too long. Admittedly, the first listen I listened to the whole thing in eager anticipation for the metal blitzing to follow, but the effectiveness of the intro wears off RAPIDLY. Really, the track should've been shortened to like 30 to 60 seconds, and the album should've been an e.p. In a perfect world we would've got the awesome tracks left off the album for one reason or another like Witchcraft or Satan my Master. But what can we do?\n\nBut after the intro, it's 23 minutes of metal bliss. No weak tracks. No weak riffs. Just turn up your speakers and have fun. Hades is probably my favourite, as the main riff skitters through my ears forcing my arm to raise and do the sign of the horns, and my head to bang. Reaper picks things up with a classic speed metal riff that would make Venom feel like chumps. Necromansy is one of the real highlights of this album, with the riff that would be tweaked into the one on Burzum's War, and lyrics about as evil as you can get for that time or any. Heil satanic majesty! The groove and speed of this song makes it one of the most infectious, get stuck in your head kind of songs in all of Bathory's distinguished repertoire. No wonder Varg Vikernes took it for his own.\n\nSacrifice has some real groove to it and keeps the speed assault going. MOTHER OF CHRIIIIISSSST! In Conspiracy With Satan is probably the weakest song on here, and that's saying something, because it is still an awesome track. It has some sweet lead breaks, but the main riff is probably the least memorable on here. But the title was always funny to me. I'm in cahoots with SATAN! Armageddon has some dark lyrics to match its ferocity. It truly is the sound of 'gashing the virgins flesh'. Raise the Dead is the slower track of the album, and it stands as one of the high points of the album. The underlying bass groove is downright infectious. Ending with a sudden gong smash, fading right into the ending song, War.\n\nWar is just what you want in an ending song. Really fast, singing about lightning and earthquakes amidst a grand battlefield, and an easy to scream along with chorus. The outro is naught nut a few seconds of wind and a thud thud of the drums, telling you that you have survived. This album is one I will never tire of, and one that really should be in your collection. If it was more complete, and with a shorter intro, I'd easily give it the coveted three digits. But It's quick passing, even with a three minute track of whistling reverb with some bell chimes, leaves me wanting a little more. But still essential.\n\nFor taking some of that old school speed metal and making that much rawer and violent, Bathory's historical debut gets a 93 out of 100, or a five out of five.\nHighlights:\nHades\nNecromansy\nRaise the Dead\nReaper\nWar\nSacrifice\nArmageddon\n",
        "\nBathory is a band turly deserving of the accolades that is bestowed upon it. The pure genius of it's creator Quorthon has gone on unrivaled since the release of their self-titled debut. Not one but TWO awesome genres, black metal and viking metal, were spawned form this single musician. 'Nordland I' is what I believe was that point in history when Bathory released their magnum opus, the single album Quorthon found his true sound. This when Bathory became more than what it was. This is the true viking metal album.\n\nIt kicks off with an epic intro, filled with awesome keyboards and a teaser to Quorthon's new and improved voice. He sings with an incredible level of clarity, worthy of an award presented by Odin himself. He truly has come a long way since that debut album, and this is a perfect example. The album breaks into the title track, a song I've never been able to keep away from. This track is an excellent buffet of epic-sounding riffs, a spirit-lifting atmosphere, and that BEAUTIFUL voice! Even better, the entire album is like this. But it doesn't sound all the same. It keeps you on your toes, which helps keep the album refreshing and interesting. And the riffs! Oh my god, I cannot remember the last time I heard guitar parts as excellently crafted and written as these. The atmosphere is amazing on this album, and when I say spirit-lifting, I meant it. Upon listening to this album, I felt like I could dominate the entire world, with only Thor's hammer to guide me. The tracks all have this uplifting spirit to them, and it's just mind-blowing.\n\nThe sound of all the instruments makes this album essential to be played at high volumes, especially with headphones. The guitar tones are heavy and full, unlike previous Bathory releases, where the tone is trebly and one-dimensional. The drums are precise and keep the pace going beautifully while having a awesome, galloping feel to them. While keyboards aren't something Bathory is known for, but they shine like you wouldn't believe on this release. With what sounds like a full on chorus in the background, and thundering bass drums in the background, this is album is Quorthon's most musically ambitous, and it's hard to deny it.\n\nI don't think anybody really saw this coming, despite his previous viking metal releases, but I do think Quorthon eventually had some kind of idea in his mind for this. His musical genius would've taken him to such greater heights if he hadn't of passed away. As a deep admirer of him and his body of work both with Bathory and solo, I dedicate this review in his memory. R.I.P. Qurothon. This was truly your greatest accomplishment.\n",
        "\nI usually detest the concept of putting the first athlete/band/album of it\u2019s kind as the best of it's kind. Just because you\u2019re the first doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re the best. But in the case of Bathory, I have to make an exception. It is still the greatest Black Metal album of all time. Yes of course there has been brilliant work in the field done since then, Storm of The Light\u2019s Bane, Sons of Northern Darkness, Hvis Lyset Tar Oss, In The Nightside Eclipse and Under A Funeral Moon are all very worthy of the title of classic black metal. Yet none of those albums do what this one does for me. This album was to black metal what Run DMC\u2019s Raising Hell was to hip hop. It wasn\u2019t necessarily the first of it\u2019s kind, as plenty of artists before were laying down the ground work (Venom, Mercyful Fate and Celtic Frost w/black metal, Grandmaster Flash & The Furious Five, The Treacherous Three and Doug E. Fresh & Slick Rick for hip hop), but it was the first objectively and unequivocally great black metal album, giving it an identity, a voice, an a guitar tone uglier than a naked, feces covered Rosie O Donnell. But the most innovative feature UTSOTBM gave to black metal is its variety. Despite the change in sound on this Blood Fire Death, there are more separate song ideas here than there were there. \n\nAfter an absolutely bleak and terrifying intro that drops you into a black canyon you sense a dark unseen force circling you waiting for the right moment to strike, a brief moment of silence to lure you into a false sense of security and then...\n\nMAAAAASSSSACRRRRRRREEEE! An absolutely vicious, blackened speed metal song that bowls you over that\u2019s already faster than anything on Reign In Blood. Woman of Dark Desires again follows the Dark Angel ideology of \u201cdon\u2019t slow it down, just switch it up.\u201d It\u2019s still fast, but it\u2019s still super heavy. It\u2019s something of an anthem for black metal fans both figuratively and literally as it features an excellent call to arms chorus. Then comes the solo, which is violent melodic bliss. This was the first Bathory album I\u2019d ever heard, and while I had some reservations about the sound, one of the things that immediately disarmed me was the lead guitar work. As bizarre as this may sound, Quorthon was the Eric Clapton of extreme metal. His solos weren\u2019t that shreddy, but the feel was off the charts. \n\nCall From The Grave slows things down to an arena rock groove, all it needs is a Z-grade music video of Bathory playing in Louisiana Superdome playing to 70,000 demons from the first five layers from hell. After that, Equimanthorn has an intro resembling Jaws before bringing proceedings back to full speed before switching to one of the grooviest metal breakdowns ever (groove with class, mind you). The screaming of the songs title near the end puts the big red cherry on top, and that leads us into the album\u2019s finest moment, Enter The Eternal Fire. This is the sound of the earth opening up and hell breaking loose to a marching rhythm. The backbone of the song is a simple riff that is just good enough to repeat over and over again, while still keeping the listener at full attention. That is no small feat. Even Sabbath would be criticized for letting a riff ride for too long.\n\nChariots of Fire is more fast black metal that the genre would become known for, 13 Candles is midpaced headbanging greatness so drenched in so much Satanism Anton La Vey cums so hard he poops a little. And the whole thing is capped off with ...Of Doom...the fastest song on the album which practically matches Burning Of Sodom (Dark Angel) in speed! Everything about this song is fast, especially the vocals. I\u2019m surprised Quorthon\u2019s tongue didn\u2019t yell \u201cfuck this!\u201d and jump out of his mouth running away screaming. The album fades out, which I usually detest but the song ends on such a high level of intensity it doesn\u2019t matter.\n\nIt is solely because of this album that I had to respect black metal. Is it any wonder that the likes of Darkthrone, Mayhem, Burzum chose to kick off the second wave by completely ripping it off?

        "\nAs previously noted, Bathory is a band that came to my attention posthumously, in spite of being an avid consumer of its contemporaries for more than 10 years prior. The road that led me there began with the last 2 testaments of their greatness, the \u201cNordland\u201d series, an unfinished series of albums that while not in and of themselves stylistically influential, nonetheless represent the culmination of a still relatively young style that traces its roots back to this same band 15 years prior. It takes into account not only the first official releases that kicked it off in \u201cHammerheart\u201d and \u201cTwilight Of The Gods\u201d, but also some elements of the transitional effort of \u201cBlood Fire Death\u201d that was still mostly lodged in the band earlier, extreme thrash days.\n\nIt is important to note that while these two albums are classified by the Viking metal genre, they are a bit different from many of the bands that go by this label today. Quorthon\u2019s lead vocal approach, while gritty and rough, does not mirror the toneless barks and mutterings that were a staple of the 2nd wave of black metal that he also influenced, a style which is still readily employed by Ensiferum despite coming to a level of mainstream prominence. The background choirs that are also a staple of this style are heavily reverb laden and give the album a slight 80s flavor, as is the case with the drum and keyboard production. The only thing about this album that really fits with the 2000s paradigm is the guitar character, which has a cold combination of crunch and fuzz that is actually fairly similar to the latter day Immortal releases that fairly closely coincided with this.\n\nIn comparison to its predecessor, \u201cNordland II\u201d could be likened to a mirror reflection with a slightly darker tint. The overall pacing and scheme of things is the same, but the folk and acoustic elements have been downplayed slightly in favor of a more bombastic, film score approach of a grand dragon boat off to the distant horizon. Such slow yet striking anthems of seafaring quests in \u201cBlooded Shore\u201d and \u201cThe Land\u201d marry together the dense atmospheric layering of vocals and droning guitar and keyboard melodies with a steady groove to create a veritable tapestry of glorious imagery. \u201cDeath And Resurrection Of A Northern Star\u201d brings in the faster, thrashing element with an agitated vengeance while still maintaining that Manowar-based pomp that characterized \u201cHammerheart\u201d, and also shows Quorthon gritting up his voice a bit more.\n\nThe really pivotal goods that this album delivers, however, is actually saved until the latter half of the album in two riveting 10 minute plus epics. As is the case with most in this style, the longer these songs go (to a point of course), the better they tend to be, and \u201cThe Messenger\u201d proves to be one of the better examples of how great ideas deserve repetition and a very gradual development. For anyone wonders where Ensiferum got longwinded classics like \u201cHeathen Throne\u201d, look no further than this towering example of droning melodies and pummeling grooves. But the absolute high point is \u201cThe Wheel Of Sun\u201d, a spellbinding epic of changing seasons that begins from a modest clean guitar intro and grows into a colossal celebration of Norse landscapes. Through its entire 12 minute duration, this song perfectly recaptures the massive atmosphere accomplished on \u201cTwilight Of The Gods\u201d album, right down to the slightly blues/rock infused principle riff that channels \u201cBlood And Iron\u201d to a fault.\n\nThis is a fine end, albeit an unfortunately incomplete one, to the Bathory legacy, showcasing a man\u2019s work coming full circle from where it left off at the close of the 80s, where metal music came into prominence and ushered in more than a decade of world changing music. If there were an elite group of artists whose portraits should appear next to the metal name in any encyclopedia or lexicon, Quorthon\u2019s would share space alongside the likes of Ronnie James Dio and Tony Iommi. While much of his music tends to be polarizing because of the radically different influences that shaped it over the years, the \u201cNordland\u201d albums stand as his most accessible works, and followers of metal of all stripes should definitely give these a spin.\n",
        "\nFinally, a Bathory collection which doesn't suck? Well, that all really depends on what format you choose to acquire it in, and what exactly it is you're looking for in such a fan package. For example, if I were to break it down into the three independent CDs which one can still seemingly purchase from Black Mark, it doesn't carry a lot of weight. But the full deal, with the poster, booklet, and bonus DVD is quite comprehensive in both CD and LP formats, and thus the preferred option. Surely this is superior to the awful Katalog comp or the individual Jubileum releases, but there are a number of what I'd consider strange omissions and the same miasma of incompleteness that populated the latter.\n\nFirst off, you're getting a considerable number of remastered tracks, spanning the 1984 self titled debut through the 2003 swan song Nordland II. I've never had significant personal issues with the production of anything Quorthon had released for Bathory, just minor nitpicks, so this is not a major boon in my opinion, yet the fact that they're all given the treatment helps gel them together as a unified collection, despite the studio production variance of their roots. Choices are pretty good, with important cuts like \"Blood Fire Death\", \"A Fine Day to Die\", \"Enter the Eternal Fire\", \"Raise the Dead\" and such scattered about the three discs, but the selection is far from restricted to the classics, so you've got examples of the mid-90s thrash mediocrity (\"War Machine\") and a boat load of inclusions from the more recent Nordland sagas.\n\nThere are also quite a number of covers here, which were originally recorded throughout the Bathory canon, some appearing on various editions of full-length releases and some I'd never heard before. Some of the choices are very obvious, like \"Ace of Spades\" or \"War Pigs\" which are not that impressive other than getting to hear Quorthon's uneven accent. I found the KISS tributes to be much more entertaining and obscure choices, in particular \"Black Diamond\" which really benefits from the power placed in its translation. Lastly, though, you've got a pair of covers from the Quorthon solo career, namely \"God Save the Queen\" (Sex Pistols) and \"I'm Only Sleeping (Beatles), and I didn't really enjoy them outside of appreciating the guy's obviously eclectic tastes. A few of the originals from the two solo albums are likewise present, like the heavy rock track \"I've Had it Coming\" or the atmospheric \"Boy\" with all its samples. Despite my disdain for the albums in general, these are not poor representations, though I would have clipped them in favor of more raw Bathory.\n\nThe songs with his sister Jennie Tebler are much less appealing. \"Silverwing\" is pretty boring crunch rock ala Evanescence with the female vocals flowing over them. Once they enter into a harmony, it's not so bad, but the solo strands of her voice sound like a miserable wannabe of Lacuna Coil or The Gathering. Nor do I much care for her version of \"Song to Hall Up High\", which closes out the third and last audio disc. It would have been far cooler, and really reflected a sense of completeness if the demo and rare tracks from the Jubileum collections had been gathered here. Still in print, perhaps, but considering the price for this boxed set it would not have set them back so much, and ultimately it might have spared the fans from wasting their money on the older collections if they hadn't already. So, some omissions that would dramatically improved the value of In Memory of Quorthon, but in the end you're still getting about 45 tracks, all remastered, so at least some minimum effort was applied by Black Mark.\n\nFinally, there are the perks and 'omake box' goodies that usually come with these media boxed sets. The poster is absolutely retarded, nothing more than an advertisement for the set that you just purchased with a classic pic of Quorthon. I would have rather it just included the latter. The booklet itself is enormous, a pretty comprehensive biography with lots of photos and notes, but not necessarily anything novel or unexpected if you'd been following his career. The DVD itself is not brimming with content, just the full video for \"One Road to Asa Bay\" which is little more than a bunch of guys in armor, costume, riding a horse, etc all quite slowly to the roiling pace of the music; an MTV interview clip in which he discusses his transition from the occult lyrical focus of his earlier years to the folksier Norse mythology, and some random promotional footage also from the same 1990 era. Nothing too impressive here, least of all the video, but it's a decent add on for the diehard who might feel the urge to occasionally listen to his/her hero speak.\n\nNeedless to say, if you can get your hands on this collection, it stands head and shoulders above its predecessors. I wish it had more to it, and I'm sure everyone does, but as far as a posthumous memorial, it's comprehensive enough not to disappoint. I wouldn't say it was worth purchasing if you already own all the studio albums, but even then, if you want to show more financial support to honor the legend, it's far more reasonable than Jubileum or the needless Katalog. You are getting SOMETHING for your money here, which is more than I can say for a large percentage of shit-eating collections put out for major bands. As of 2011, a nice vinyl box also became available which includes a picture disc of the whole Bathory s/t. Keep that in mind when you're mining eBay, since the format is all the rage and very likely to become a collectible of high value.\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nAfter the split personality of Destroyer of Worlds, it was rather nice that Quorthon would return to a singular vision for its successor, the first half of his Nordland saga. If you couldn't already guess through a glance at the cover image, that vision entails a straight return to the Viking metal aesthetics of prior works Hammerheart, Twilight of the Gods, and the 'lost' album Blood On Ice. Only here, Quorthon has written a more substantial treatise on the subject, since both sides of the project total over two hours of material, and there are none of the banal pure thrash regressions that crippled Destroyer of Worlds. In fact, I feel like this first Nordland is perhaps the point at which he best expresses this style. Not that it's the best of his Norse journeys by a long shot, but because he gives it the ample space in which it needs to breathe.\n\nNordland I is very well paced to provide its narrative in the span of an hour. The intro passage \"Prelude\" is meticulously crafted to draw the listener into its antiquity, with blazing horns, war drums and the soaring clean choirs that had become a hallmark of Bathory since the late 80s. You can burn Necrolord's artwork into your mind, close your eyes, access headphones and then become a direct participant in Quorthon's Romanticized translation of old. With \"Nordland\" itself, the appropriate pomp and strength arrives with a thudding, mid-paced metal rhythm and drums that place it aesthetically between the climes of the muscle metal Manowar and the slower, intended swan song of Norwegians Immortal (Sons of Northern Darkness) who themselves owe Bathory a great deal for its influence upon their own career. Folksy dual melodies adorn its crested waves, and Quorthon uses a deeper clean vocal throughout the verses which showcases his own willingness to grow, even if his sum presence is still rough around the edges.\n\nBut \"Nordland\" is also symptomatic of one of the downsides of this extensive work: the lack of appreciable variation through its lengthier tracks. With a duration over 9 minutes, I would have liked to hear more happen in this piece outside of the predictable melodic progressions and the same, studied tempo. The same could be said for other swollen ingredients to the album, like \"Foreverdark Woods\". Its promising intro sequences features glinting acoustics, mouth harps and pretty much the perfect setup, but once the distortion is introduced you're just hearing the same chords repeatedly, a practice that might have worked in Quorthon's formative shift into the territory (Blood Fire Death), where the darkness and furor of the writing felt so desolate, fresh and hypnotic, but here it's just rather painted by numbers. No surprises wait in store for the listener through any of these longer tracks, and in this they differ from the stories upon which they draw their inspiration.\n\nReally, Nordland is almost exclusively playing it 'safe', a practice treasured by some and trashed by others. Not a deal breaker for me, however, and I do admire that Quorthon has incorporated some faster material here sans resorting to the regrettable thrashing of the mid-90s Octagon. \"Broken Sword\" has a nice thrust to it courtesy of the driving double bass, as does the brute speed metal introducing \"Great Hall Awaits a Fallen Brother\", and the pair lends a well needed respite from the slogging pace of the contents leading up to it. Again, especially in the latter piece, Tomas plays with vocal potential, a clean melodic tone applied to the verse. Far from his best singing, but it functions well enough to discern that he's not a total hack, and this is the best of the longer pieces on the album, though it too only experiences a few shifts in tempo and could easily have been better packed. Shorter tracks like \"Vinterblot\" and \"Mother Earth Father Thunder\" don't suffer as much from the lack of variation, but they're really just covering the familiar ground of Blood On Ice and Twilight of the Gods without offering much embellishment.\n\nSpecial mention should be made for \"Ring of Gold\", one of Bathory's best pure folk songs since the anthem \"Hammerheart\", and the acoustic guitars and vocal arrangements here feel lush and absorbing against the sparse samples in the background. In general, I find Nordland to be very well produced, rich and atmospheric, emblematic of Quorthon's mastery of this particular style. The drums don't suffer from the offsetting splash effect on Blood On Ice, and the mix is rich on various layers of depth, where Twilight of the Gods was perhaps an inkling too clean. There is a sense of airy fulfillment here which is sure to sate fans of those albums, and I think it's the best effort from Bathory beyond the year 1990, but not necessarily in contention with his rabidly influential works in the first 5-6 years. More of the same, perhaps 'too much' more, but a solid foundation for an hour of daydreaming that holds up after a decade.\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nReleased about 5 months after Nordland I, Bathory would not leave us waiting long for what was originally intended to be the second of four total chapters in the Nordland saga. Unfortunately, as we all now know, that would not turn out to be the case. Quorthon's tragic passing in the following year (2004) would retroactively establish Nordland II as the grand finale of one of the most important and influential legacies in all of metal. No pressure, right? Well, perhaps its not remotely fair to judge the record on such grounds, and I won't, but there is no escaping the fact that it often feels like a bunch of leftovers from the previous effort, or rather that he front loaded the content to the series and intended the garner interest on momentum alone with diminishing returns.\n\nNot that Nordland II is necessarily a negative experience. In fact, I feel that tracks such as \"Sea Wolf\" and \"Blooded Shore\" create quite a cloud of nostalgia for the Hammerheart album, and I admire the grit he exhibits in his vocal performance here and elsewhere on this sequel. Slow, pendulous heavy metal hammer riffs drowned in choirs, synthesized organs and steady drums that create a dramatic subtext to the sailing, drawn out voices in the late bridge of \"Sea Wolf\". Chunky momentum and crashing chords dialed straight back to the late 80s glories. I also feel that some of the longer tracks like the 10 minute \"The Messenger\" (with that incredible, simple melody) and the 12 minute \"The Wheel of Sun\" with its leaden grooves and gleaming spikes of zephyr-like guitars, are far better at balancing their content and shifting necessary gears of composition thank some of the whales from the previous album.\n\nThere are also no crappy thrash tracks like there were on Destroyer of Worlds. The closest the record comes is \"Flash of the Silverhammer\" a mid-paced chugger which reminds me of the older, primal doom/thrash crunch of their countrymen Memory Garden, making decent use of the vocals to carry what otherwise might be a dullard. Like Nordland I, there's an 8 minute tune which makes good use of a propulsive, brutal into (\"Death and Resurrection of a Northern Son\"), but I don't exactly love this song, and along with other middling fare like \"The Land\" or the desolate \"Vinland\" I just feel like it treads on previous ground. With Hammerheart, Blood Fire Death, Twilight of the Gods, Blood on Ice and Nordland I already out in circulation, I got the impression of rinsing and repeating here, which I'm sure might have stretched out its welcome if the ensuing chapters were to manifest without significant deviations.\n\nIn the end, as usual, evaluation comes down to the songs. Some of their older albums had them in spades, but Nordland II doesn't really have much to recommend it unless you're obsessed with its stylistic and spiritual forebears and demand more of the same. I'll grant that there are a few epic climaxes here, and an atmosphere which sparks up fond memories for the influential storms Quorthon rode in on, but it's not an album I would choose over others in the canon. Let's face it: the guy more or less created two massive, enduring substrata of the extreme metal realm, and both within a brief span of years. About 13 years after that period, nothing innovative or really interesting had manifest from Bathory. But he had nothing more to prove, and so he resigned himself to small tweaks on the existing formula. I like the simplicity of the lyrics here, their dependable imagery and adherence to the atmosphere or the songwriting.\n\nBut where Blood Fire Death summoned up an eternal wrath from my soul, called my imagination to war forever, this album is more or less a pleasant fjord surfing experience with a few gut wrenching moments of anger. A functional successor to Nordland I, and not a regrettable experience, but not a source for much fascination.\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nCall me a late bloomer if you must, but in spite of getting into metal during my early teens in the mid 1990s, I did not discover Bathory until about a year after Quorthon passed on. During this time I began correspondence with a few musicians who were big into the Viking metal scene, and thus I came to the first logical place one would go circa 2005, the Nordland albums. What was immediately striking was a fascination with how similar it sounded to some earlier Manowar songs I\u2019d heard years back, yet the dose of epic majesty, raw production and mostly slower tempo was so concentrated that it struck me as something entirely different at the same time. While it didn\u2019t quite take to me completely given my general aversion to low-fi recordings, it grew into an appreciation for Bathory\u2019s entire back catalog, even and eventually the black metal releases of the mid 80s.\n\nIn retrospect, while discovering this band through their last 2 albums was one way to approach them, it wasn\u2019t until after hearing the rest of the discography that I fully comprehend where they stood. Of the two, \u201cNordland I\u201d leans a bit closer to the heavier, darker aesthetic of \u201cHammerheart\u201d, but with a slightly modern flavor in the guitar sound still left over from the band\u2019s 90s thrash period and \u201cDestroyer Of Worlds\u201d. The crunch of the guitars is about as frosty and fuzz-drenched as middle era Immortal, but combined together with a grand mixture of backing vocal choirs, acoustic guitar passages and thudding drums to paint a vivid picture of endless skies hanging above a snow kissed landscape of mountains and trees. While older incarnations of Bathory\u2019s Viking style brought forth a very particular storyline of Norse legends and lore, this is an album born of much broader and generalized sense of the north, as if becoming an all-encompassing biography of the entire land.\n\nNot one to shy away from recognizing the changing musical landscape around him, Quorthon brings with this new approach to musical creation a strong helping of folksy elements that acknowledges the innovative works of bands like Suidakra and Ensiferum. \u201cForeverdark Woods\u201d takes a particularly blatant occasion to employ some period instruments (including a Jew\u2019s Harp) to bring in that retrospective flavor into the mix, while still largely maintaining the early heavy metal tendencies of Bathory\u2019s base Viking sound, including the mostly blues infused guitar solos. \u201cBroken Sword\u201d also employs a beautifully sorrowful flute line alongside the typical acoustic guitar passage during the intro, though it ends up erupting into a violent rage of speed metal, though maintaining a consonant melodic contour, almost as if seeking a compromise between the different musical worlds that were \u201cBlood Fire Death\u201d and \u201cHammerheart\u201d. \u201cRing Of Gold\u201d takes a fully serene, all acoustic route, but never fails to stay interesting amid a variety of instruments layered over Quorthon\u2019s working class clean vocal approach.\n\nInterestingly enough, the surprises don\u2019t really end with the 3 radically different songs mentioned previously, but rather the whole album reveals itself as a classic novel with numerous plot twists. \u201c\u201dGreat Hall Awaits A Fallen Brother\u201d has a rather basic speed metal riff to it, yet manages to evolve itself into a multifaceted epic that bridges a faster side of Bathory that was avoided on earlier Viking incarnations or compartmentalized into the more thrash metal offerings of \u201cDestroyer Of Worlds\u201d. \u201cDragon\u2019s Breath\u201d actually plugs away on a rather modern sounding doom riff that sounds more appropriate to mid 90s works than \u201cHammerheart\u201d, yet the surrounding elements softens it to the point of feeling more like a blizzard than a hail storm. The only songs on here to really have an all out retro feel to them are \u201cVinterblot\u201d, \u201cMother Earth, Father Thunder\u201d and the title song, all of which stick closer to a \u201cBlood On Ice\u201d sound where atmosphere trumps aggression.\n\nIt might be somewhat presumptuous to give this album an edge over \u201cHammerheart\u201d, but that is the general impression that I\u2019m left with after spending a good bit of time with both albums. \u201cNordland I\u201d accomplishes something which the other lacked in overall focus, and actually presents a somewhat more logical evolution from the transitional point of \u201cBlood Fire Death\u201d to what now is treated as the Viking metal sub-genre. Quorthon is one of few artists in this craft that has generally not lost his edge with the passage of time, and fits the role of a metal sage of sorts in this capacity, though he died a bit young to fully take on the image of an elder in the same way that Ronnie James Dio had. Even if left unfinished, the Nordland series is a grandiose testament to one man\u2019s quest to make music on his own terms, and it is worthy of all the praise it garners.\n",
        "\nDestroyer of Worlds is an aural exhibition of an important, almost constantly evolving artist who had at long last firmly settled into a particular style, or rather two particular styles, and thus it bears some striking similarities to both the past Bathory canons of the glorious Hammerheart, Twilight of the Gods and Blood On Ice Viking heavy metal trilogy, and the sodden and boring thrash that Quorthon thought for some reason he'd dial in during the mid 90s. The roots of both are set in the grimier blackness of Quorthon's youth, but now structurally manifest through either an emphasis on soaring male choirs, lead guitars reminiscent of the slower Manowar fare, and simplistic riffs that do not exactly inspire outside of their presentation as an atmospheric component; or in lame duck, barreling thrash rhythms that seem effectively pedestrian in intent and impact.\n\nThe problems I ran into with this album stem largely from its clear division of content. If one were to glance back at the discography, nothing here is necessarily new or out of place, but there is a crippling inconsistency to how the album flows as a whole. Sorrowful, plodding sequences like \"Ode\" or \"Destroyer of Worlds\" provide nostalgia for Hammerheart or Twilight of the Gods, but then you've got the clear delineation between that and a piece like \"Death from Above\", which while not as miserable as, say, Octagon, is at best fueled by mediocrity, cliche and a guitar riff that some random groove/thrash bar band in 1994 might have thrown together at a moment's notice. To Quorthon's credit, he at least tries to create a bridge between these two forces, this ying and yang: you'll hear some atmosphere, distant synths and such in a few of the thrash bits, but then you've got others like \"Liberty and Justice\" or the pure groove shite \"Sudden Death\" which amount to nothing more than massive crap stains over any potential the album might have woven.\n\nDestroyer of Worlds is in dire need of a clipping, so swelled is it with middling content, so teemed with tripe. Not only the 6-7 shoddy bludgeoning thrashers (which, in addition to those mentioned include \"109\", \"Pestilence\", and the darker and mildly less annoying \"Krom\"); but also a few of the more spacious, drawn out pieces. For example, the 8+ minute closers \"White Bones\" and \"Day of Wrath\" seem rather dull and bloated: the former impregnated with some pedantic groove metal rhythms in the bridge, the latter for its almost Pink Floyd like progression and inane self-referential lyrics in the third verse. You know you're really running out of ideas when this happens, and this is yet another flaw with Destroyer. It retreads numerous prior trends in Quorthon's composition, but it offers no superior or even interesting slant on any of them...\n\nI'm not willing to entirely throw this album under the bus. It's more of a weak and confused effort than one actively terrible, but at its best, even songs like \"Ode\", \"Lake of Fire\" and the title track are underwhelming, average shadows of past glories. The album never feels as if it's transitional, whereas just about every important step of the past felt exciting and revolutionary. Many other bands had by this point taken up the Norse mythos crown conceptually (Enslaved, Amon Amarth etc), so it makes sense that Quorthon was no longer exclusively focused there lyrically, but despite the broader prose, the music itself is not reflective of such expansion. The production values are fairly level throughout, the boxy and dense guitar tone and vocals being consistent even when he's shifting ranges, but as an album it feels both redundant and conflicted, indecisive about the next steps and thus suckling at the teat of prior missteps and majesties.\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nNot more than a year after Bathory temporarily hung it up, Black Mark decided why not have 1 collection of great songs in a jumbled order when there can be 2 for twice the buying price. While the economics of this decision become a bit more bizarre given the customer demographic being played to, it does present that label with another opportunity to provide the black masses with yet another helping of rarities to sate the otherwise insatiable appetite for more after the party was apparently over (curse you, accursed 90s). But the question is does the cuisine measure up to the sensibilities of the patrons?\n\nWhile sequels generally tend not to measure up to their predecessors, this is one of those occasional exceptions where the rule doesn\u2019t apply. Yes, what occurs here is the same mishmash of blackened thrash madness from the first 3 albums with an equally proportional representation from the Viking era, to the point where the goal seemed to be an interchangeable selection of songs in terms of pacing and style. But the overall song selection here is just a little bit stronger (particularly with the inclusion of the massive title song from \u201cTwilight Of The Gods\u201d closing things off and the near equally riveting Manowar inspired \u201cOne Rode To Asa Bay\u201d near the beginning), and the extra offerings are just a little bit sweeter to the refined, thrash metal pallet.\n\nAs was the case before, the extras represent the earlier incarnation of Bathory that is largely responsible for what was starting to come out of Norway at this time like an avalanche through the lands of fimbulwinter. The lead off song \u201cThe Return Of The Darkness And Evil\u201d in its original Scandinavian Metal Attack form, along with the previously unheard \u201cDie In Fire\u201d march out Quorthon\u2019s early influences ala Motorhead, churning out a longer and darker version of \u201cOverkill\u201d in the former, and a similarly blues heavy speed metal number in the latter. The other odd song out \u201cBurnin\u2019 Leather\u201d may seem a rehash of 1983 Metallica or Judas Priest, but the musical result sounds like it was born during the \u201cUnder The Sign Of The Black Mark\u201d sessions, being possessed of the same grim guitar crunch and massive drum backdrop that paved the way for \u201cDe Mysteriis Dom Sathanas\u201d.\n\nThe verdict here is mostly the same as was the case with part 1, save the fact that the song selection is a bit more coherent, though the same can\u2019t be said for how the songs are ordered and the overall coherence of putting the \u201cHammerheart\u201d and \u201cTwilight Of The Gods\u201d material in with the earlier stuff. While these would still have been inferior to a simple, singular release of all the rarities on a single album, both of these would have been better from a playability standpoint had the Viking and black metal stuff been put on separate releases. Still, given that these are obviously aimed at the rabid followers that tend to make up the vast majority of Bathory\u2019s fan base, the advice is to buy cheap.\n",
        "\nUsually a greatest hits compilation is something that a band gets after they\u2019ve either broken up, or otherwise gone on an extensive hiatus. In one sense, this makes sense since it serves the dual function of keeping the band alive in terms of releases and keeps the money flowing in to the labels that supported the bands (though simple reissues with bonus tracks would accomplish this much better). Considering that Bathory was thought to be over by the time the \u201cJubileum\u201d series started coming out, the early 90s were the ideal time for this to occur, and thankfully Quorthon had a few surprises that didn\u2019t make it onto these compilations to make them worth getting, though they are dispersed in such a fashion that they do the minimal job in counteracting what is otherwise a standard best of release.\n\nThe first part of this 3 part release series highlights all of the places gone from the band\u2019s inception until 1991, and therein lays the problem. While putting together a compilation spanning several albums is generally the preferred route, here Black Mark decided to jumble together some very incompatible songs, no doubt leading to confusion for anyone not familiar with the band. All of the bonus material is stuff from the band\u2019s blackened thrash days, save the opening instrumental \u201cRider At The Gate Of Dawn\u201d, which sounds like it could have been the intro to \u201cHammerheart\u201d with all the orchestrated pomp and sounds akin to warriors charging. Coupling this with the mostly Viking oriented material on \u201cBlood Fir e Death\u201d and a handful of songs from the two later albums that show the Manowar influences something fierce, the entire thing comes off as a bit schizophrenic.\n\nHowever, from a quality standpoint, every individual song on here is an absolute gem and the bonus material doesn\u2019t fall short from blending in with the rest. The song brought in from the Scandinavian Metal Attack compilation \u201cSacrifice\u201d sounds like a blackened reinterpretation of Motorhead\u2019s \u201cIron Fist\u201d, speeding at a fast yet intelligible tempo with a rock oriented riff set that lends credence to Quorthon\u2019s claim of being more influenced by Lemmy and company than by Venom. \u201cCrawl To Your Cross\u201d reeks of a nasty blackened thrash character with a slightly crisper edge that would have perfectly fit on \u201cBlood Fire Death\u201d, but was written after and ultimately not used. And the raw, under-produced bruiser \u201cYou Don\u2019t Move Me (I Don\u2019t Give A Fuck)\u201d brings on a more punk edge to Quorthon\u2019s early speed metal approach, and sounds more in line with the band\u2019s self-titled debut, but with less intelligible ravings that somewhat resemble his vocal approach on \u201cRequiem\u201d.\n\nMy usual tendency is to judge a compilation solely on the bonus material since I\u2019ve always ended up procuring the entire discographies of any bands I encounter. But on this particular one it is necessary to also look at both the individual strength of the previously released material, and also the compatibility factor from all the eras of a band in congress. In this respect, \u201cJubileum I\u201d comes up a bit short in this regard, as does the one that followed since it took the same basic approach, but it is still an essential pickup for completists, which most of Bathory\u2019s audience tends to fall under, and it fairs well just as a compilation in itself. Definitely try to shop for a low price or seek these songs individually for download where possible, but it is definitely worth it no matter which way you go about it.\n",
        "\nOne has to wonder if there is an actual cap on how many times a band can reinvent itself, or an individual musician for that matter. But apparently for Quorthon, this limit would be imposed on him by a short life rather than any shortcoming in his imagination, as he was all over the map between his various incarnations of Bathory and his solo project from 1989 to his untimely end in 2004. Within the context of a stylistic shift, his return to the studio after a 4 year absence (counting his 1997 album \u201cPurity Of Essence\u201d) can be most compared to \u201cBlood Fire Death\u201d in that showed a band trying to move away from a thrash sound and toward a Viking sound, but being more the former than the latter. However, the difference lay in what kind of thrash metal was being departed from, as the modern, raw, hardcore infused characters of \u201cRequiem\u201d and \u201cOctagon\u201d were quite different from Bathory\u2019s blackened early days.\n\nTo put it plainly, \u201cDestroyer Of Worlds\u201d is all over the place. Some have rightly pointed out that this album could come off as being a compilation to anyone not familiar with Bathory\u2019s work, with the exception of a largely consistent production character that is aggressive, but notably less raucous and low-fi compared to \u201cRequiem\u201d. The shifting back and forth between thrash, punk and Manowar influences is quite jarring, as are the seemingly random lyrical subjects that range from apocalyptic themes to ice hockey. But the musical back and forth between what sounds like a real attempt at reaching back to the same spirit that originally brought forth Hammerheart (and its technical predecessor \u201cBlood On Ice\u201d) and a slightly cleaned up version of 90s thrash that popped up in the mid 90s, is so blatant that it sounds like two different bands fighting each other, with a slight edge to the modern thrash metal sound when considering the majority of the songs, and the character of even the Viking oriented songs in comparison to both the previous incarnation of the band and the two \u201cNordland\u201d albums that followed this one.\n\nWhile a bit inconsistent in what genre this album is going for, this album is a fairly decent listen in terms of overall quality. Generally the longer songs tend to be more geared towards the slower, atmospheric aesthetic associated with the Viking era paradigm, largely coming off as a heavier revisiting of \u201cBlood On Ice\u201d. The opening \u201cLake Of Fire\u201d and the closer \u201cDay Of Wrath\u201d are the strongest embodiment of that olden, \u201cInto Glory Ride\u201d sound where the acoustic guitars are massive yet distant sounding, layered over with droning choir lines and grooving riffs to create an image of grand mountains and crystal skies over a frostbitten landscape. By contrast, filthy displays of angst and violence such as \u201c109\u201d and \u201cKill, Kill, Kill\u201d offer up an ugly reminder of where Quorthon had taken Bathory not too long before, though the production quality (especially the drum sound) is a bit more digestible and the vocal work is not quite as raw. \u201cBleeding\u201d actually goes a bit further and combines the modern thrash character of before with some of the grunge elements of Quorthon\u2019s solo work, sporting a verse riff that sounds strikingly similar to Alice In Chains\u2019 \u201cThem Bones\u201d.\n\nIn terms of individual songs, this is a very strong album with a little of something for consumers of both of Bathory\u2019s post-black metal eras, but as a whole album \u201cRequiem\u201d has the edge in terms of a consistent listen from one song to the next. It\u2019s difficult to really fit together epic throwbacks to \u201cHammerheart\u201d like that of \u201cOde\u201d with a hybrid of early 90s Metallica and Pantera like \u201cKrom\u201d occupying the same album, and to this day it\u2019s difficult for me to fully get through this album without thinking that some of these songs should have been separated out into a different album. Chalk it up to the paradox of going forward by taking a few steps back into the past, and also waiting for 4 years of studio silence before doing so, leading many to postulate that some of these songs may have been written years apart from each other. Either way, Quorthon never had a dull moment in his career, but this would qualify as one of his lesser appreciated ones, and in comparison to the towering masterpieces that it has to contend with, it\u2019s easy to see why.\n",
        "\nBecause two near worthless Jubileum compilations were not enough, it was decided that a third be released 5 years later to incorporate material from Quorthon's mid-90s identity crisis circa Requiem and Octagon. Now, I'm not quite sure why such albums, the first quite mediocre and the latter downright awful would warrant such a treatment. Any masochist who was interested in such letdowns could surely just purchase them at barely double the cost, and there are no 'greatest hits' to be had in either case. The refinished songs included here from Blood On Ice had been so recently given an official album release that they also had no pressing need for a reprint, and they are so stylistically jarring to the content from the previous two full lengths that this is by far the most inconsistent of the comps.\n\nJubileum Vol. III presents one hour of material, 9 of its 15 tracks previously released through the 90s. From Requiem (1994), we get \"War Machine\", \"Pax Vobiscum\" and \"Crosstitution\"; from Octagon (1995) \"Immaculate Pinetreeroad #930\", \"Sociopath\" and \"33 Something\"; and from the entirely different Blood On Ice we've got \"The Lake\", \"The Stallion\" and \"Gods of Thunder of Wind and of Rain\". Not an an impressive roster by any standards, though I favor the last three simply because they are part of Quorthon's return to common sense, and the Norse themes he had begun to explore upon the masterwork Blood Fire Death. Even then, though, these are far better experienced on the full-length album with their neighbors, almost out of place among the more boring, straightforward thrashers. So in other words, about 60% of this collection is a rehash of null value.\n\nWe are left with the unreleased material, which hails from all over the spectrum. \"Satan My Master\" is the best of the lot, a pure grimy speed/black metal track from the s/t debut years which has eventually developed into one of their most popular classic tracks (covered by a large number of the bands they've influenced). Not that it's really one of their best, but the riffs are pure honest bludgeoning with Quorthon's rasp splattered all over them, and almost a punk undercurrent in the bass and chords. Another oldie called \"Witchcraft\" is here, a nice savage rush of gnarled speed with scintillating guitars, though the vocal bark is a bit repressed in the mix. \"In Nomine Satanas\" was the original incarnation of the track \"Bond of Blood\" which was later recorded for Twilight of the Gods, but obviously the subject matter was changed. I rather like this raw interpretation, but it's not cool enough that I'd go out of my way for it. Other than these, we're treated to an alternate vocal take on \"Valhalla\" (Hammerheart); and a pair of mediocre mid paced groove/thrashers in \"Resolution Greed\" and \"Genocide\" which probably didn't make it to the miserable Octagon and wouldn't have helped if they had.\n\nIn short, not a lot worth a damn, and I once again am left baffled as to why the rarer demo and cult tracks from all three of the Jubileum releases weren't just gathered in one place. Instead, Boss and Quorthon must have felt we all owed them another 30-50 dollars for next to nothing. Comparatively, Jubileum Vol. III might have more unreleased material than either of the earlier compilations, but as a collection of music of note, it pretty much sucks a bone. Better to listen to \"Satan My Master\" and \"Witchcraft\" elsewhere and save the scratch.\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nBy the latter portion of the mid 90s, Quorthon was in desperate need of a turnaround, as his once mighty Bathory institution seemed to be unraveling at its seams; his writing devolved into phoned in, dull thrash and groove metal which wouldn't have sufficed even a decade before its release, when the genre was still shaping up. I just don't see the appeal in creating a bold new genre of music, like the Norse themed folk-tinted metal that he manifest and progressed through the trio of Blood Fire Death, Hammerheart and Twilight of the Gods, and then sputtering out into something more pedestrian like Octagon, or Quorthon's grunge rock solo records, but thank fuck the man would come to his senses and return to the Viking path.\n\nGranted, Blood On Ice was not a remarkable return to form. In fact, it wasn't even necessarily a new album, but enough of the content had been restored and supplemented from the original writing and recordings in 1988-89 that it feels like at least a sidereal movement from Twilight of the Gods. Originally, it would have served as a bridge between Blood Fire Death and its follower Hammerheart, and structurally, it's a lot like the latter. A lot of glorious, open passages guided by cleaner, layered vocals, with a handful of brief, folksy acoustic sequences (\"Man of Iron\", \"The Ravens\") to break up the more substantial bulk of the heavy metal tunes. Curiously, while I've never been the biggest fan of his cleaner vocal presence, Quorthon sounds admittedly tauter and more professional on some of these cuts than anything he'd done to their day (in 1995), and a few of the softer segments lend credibility that the guy could have written a pure folk record and built up a following that way.\n\nTunes like \"Blood On Ice\", \"The Woodwoman\" and \"The Lake\" rely heavily on their atmosphere just as much as Twilight of the Gods, so Bathory was continuing to move away from the central guitars so important to the first five records, instead writing riffs to support the woeful choirs of winter depression and unrest. But where this all comes together, like the acoustic sequence at around 3:50 in \"The Woodwoman\" or the enthusiastic canter of \"Gods of Thunder of Wind and of Rain\" which feels like Neil Young astride a long ship, you're getting a solid experience worthy at least of it's chronological predecessor Twilight of the Gods, if nowhere near as poignant and crushing as his seminal works in the style. There are some problems with the production, for instance the cheesy slap of the snare drum in \"Blood On Ice\", but in general, for something that was recorded and reworked from two different periods of Quorthon's career, it comes together fluidly.\n\nMy favorite tune here is surprisingly the expansive closer \"The Revenge of the Blood on Ice\", which more than any other places my psyche upon the same cold, battlestained vistas of the 1988-1990 material, and Bathory had long possessed a rare ability to write lengthy songs that incessantly draw the listener into their depths (since \"Enter the Eternal Fire\"). However, there is a bit of derivation and excess familiarity. For example, you'll hear a VERY familiar drum beat in the bridge of this piece, and a lot of the soothing, structured choir vocals feel as if they were just lifted from and slightly tweaked from Hammerheart. That said, compared to Octagon, this feels so enormously inspired, from the beautiful cover image to the obvious amount of effort Tomas placed in its salvage and reconstructive surgery. Rather than continue to crash along for another decade (aka Metallica), the Swede seems to have recognized his errors and righted them before they could run quickly out of control. Blood On Ice is not one of his best, but it comes near to compensation for the lackluster comps and albums that he'd been spewing forth since 1991.\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nThis is one of those perplexing releases that reeks of 'you have got to be fucking kidding me'. Just a few short years after Bathory had finished producing the largely useless Jubileum compilations, they go ahead and release ANOTHER. Katalog is your standard cash cow collection featuring entirely re-issued material. There are 11 tracks culled from the 10 studio albums (including the latest, Destroyer of Worlds), and presumably the intent was to con some young sucker into purchasing this as a 'sampler' of what to buy and experience next. Katalog was initially intended to be a promotional device only, so I assume it was meant for radio stations, zines or shops, but it was eventually decided to produce it in a commercial format.\n\nThe only way this works is as some sort of case study on the various transformations wrought through Bathory's career, but even then it's not worth the $.02, since you could just as easily build your own mix CD or shuffle your .mp3 playlist and achieve the same results. You'd assume each selection is meant to best represent the particular album it was initially released upon, but fuck if that's the case for the crappy Octagon (\"War Supply\") or average Requiem (\"Distinguish to Kill\"), which don't necessarily have good, at least not great songs. From the earlier archives, we get \"Armageddon\" (Bathory, 1984), \"Possessed\" (The Return..., 1985), \"Enter the Eternal Fire\" (Under the Sign of the Black Mark, 1987), a medley of \"Odens Ride Over Nordland/A Fine Day to Die\" (Blood Fire Death, 1988) and \"One Rode to Asa Bay\" (Hammerheart, 1990). All are good choices, but at the same time, more poignant when listened to in their native environment. Rounding out the track list are \"Lake of Fire\" from their new (for the time) effort Destroyer of Worlds, \"The Woodwoman\" from Blood On Ice and \"Twilight of the Gods\" from the album of the same name, plus another of the band's dingy, brief outros, a useless inclusion.\n\nAnd that's it. No unreleased material, strong remixes or re-recordings, etc. Had this been a bonus disc included with Destroyer of Worlds (dropping \"Lake of Fire\"), it might have proved a sweet little perk aimed at younger fans who were not familiar with the band's legacy, but as a standalone product it's shit. Might as well just procure an envelope, stuff some cash or a check in it and send off to Black Mark Production asking for nothing in return. In the end, this is just as void of worth as those Lake of Tears compilations Black Mark churned out in 2004.\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nThere are few puzzles in the often turbulent world of metal that boggle one's expectations more so than the period of Bathory resting between 1988 and 1989. Though largely an underground phenomenon that was pushing the boundaries of what most thrash metal consumers could comprehend, there was a following to this band that was most likely perplexed at what happened between \u201cBlood Fire Death\u201d and \u201cHammerheart\u201d. The sudden immersion of a once purely vile sound with something right out of the Manowar playbook was not the largest stylistic leap that could have been made, but it was definitely large enough to make one wonder if the same band had created both albums. Further complicating this enigmatic period in Quorthon\u2019s musical evolution is \u201cBlood On Ice\u201d, the missing link that not only explains how sharply this Swedish maniac was turning away from his former sound, but why the highly regarded classic that is \u201cHammerheart\u201d felt just a tiny bit rushed.\n\nTo cut to the chase regarding the nature of this album, there wasn\u2019t really an appropriate time for this album to have been released, though a release immediately following \u201cTwilight Of The Gods\u201d would have been more appropriate than between \u201cOctagon\u201d (an album that sounds nothing like either of Bathory\u2019s 2 defining eras) and \u201cDestroyer Of Worlds\u201d (an album that functions as a transitional blip from this band\u2019s modern thrash era back to their Viking sound). Then again, given the gradual ascendancy of Viking and Celtic themes in a number of black metal bands that were also going through stylistic leaps in evolution, \u201cBlood On Ice\u201d also functions as a sort of place marker, predicting the rise of notable acts like Suidakra, Moonsorrow and Ensiferum. But in terms of its overall style and presentation, this album is more suited to the late 80s than the mid 90s, just not the late 80s of Bathory\u2019s respective place in history, if that makes any sense.\n\nWhile the 2 full on Viking metal albums of the late 80s were examples of Quorthon stepping into a new way of doing things, this album is a full out leap into territory never touched by Bathory before \u201cHammerheart\u201d. The Manowar elements are not just present; they are the dominant force that shapes this entire album. The larger than a 3 story high golem sound that often typifies true metal epics such as \u201cBattle Hymns\u201d and \u201cGates Of Valhalla\u201d is all over every single song heard on here, to the point where the principle difference between this album and \u201cInto Glory Ride\u201d is that Quorthon wrote an album built almost entirely out of epics, barring a couple of folksy acoustic interludes in \u201cMan Of Iron\u201d and \u201cThe Raven\u201d. By the same token, while the two previous Viking releases out of Bathory were molded into an entirely slowed down, doom-laden interpretation of the Manowar influenced epic style, this album makes room for a couple of faster ones that somewhat resemble elements of Manowar\u2019s more commercial offerings. \u201cOne Eyed Old Man\u201d, apart from the extended narration in the middle (also a Manowar staple), is the most aggressive in this respect, with \u201cGods Of Thunder Of Wind And Of Rain\u201d close behind with more of a galloping feel as well.\n\nBe all of this as it may, the lion\u2019s share of this album rests pretty comfortably in down tempo land, trudging forth like an army of immortal warriors at a slow pace. Mixing together a steady drum groove with the reverb turned up to its fullest 80s potential, an army of vocal tracks to sound like a legion in chorus with each other, and a thudding, rock based guitar assault, each of these songs paint a vivid picture of a single warrior\u2019s quest for vengeance like few other have accomplished. Whether it be the massive sounding title song, it\u2019s twice as long reprise at the end, or a slew of catchier versions of this style that occupy the middle of the album (\u201cThe Lake\u201d being the catchiest), the entire listen is consistent, and in perfect sequence with itself while telling the tale contained within the lyrics. The production of all these songs is a slightly lower fidelity affair than what \u201cTwilight Of The Gods\u201d was, Quorthon\u2019s voice is cleaned up a bit more on the lead vocal tracks, yet the effectiveness of these songs is very close to achieving the same spellbinding atmosphere as the 1991 closing chapter of the 1st Viking era of Bathory.\n\nContrary to what many may say about which album influenced the current Nordic craze going on in the metal scene, I would argue that this album has had a more direct impact on the Viking scene than \u201cHammerheart\u201d and \u201cTwilight Of The Gods\u201d did, in no small part due to when it was put out and also the predominant folk elements that are less obvious on said albums. If one wants to be really technical about who originally pioneered this sound, Manowar was doing something along these lines back in the mid 80s (though not for entire albums), but any and all movements within the broader metal coalition are not the handiwork of one man or band. Nevertheless, from both a historical standpoint as well as a purely musical one, this is an essential part of the Viking puzzle that any fan of Crom, Moonsorrow, and even Turisas should not go without hearing.\n",
        "\nOh, those 90s. Nearly every metal artist of credibility running smack dab into an identity crisis, trying to decide whether he or she should 'go with the flow' or stick to his or her guns. Strangely, Quorthon is not an individual whom I would have expected to succumb to such follies, but yet Octagon stands as another bitter pill to swallow, and the absolute low point for the career of Bathory. Down from the mountains of the late 80s, to the sea level of Requiem and now fully submerged in mediocre riffing and writing, disposable vocals and elements that the Viking or black metal connoisseur of Quorthon's fan bast must have found tasteless and confusing. I can only speak from my own experience, but this album was an immediate shelfer, and if I hadn't been so materially inclined to collect the band's whole legacy, grounds for an immediate return.\n\nDon't be fooled by the eight-pointed parallel to the pentagram on the cover, or the traditional font used in the logo here, this is NOT the Bathory you'd grown accustomed to and not something Quorthon has or will ever be recognized for, outside of the obvious chinks in his armor that it represented. I've seen a lot of tell about how this is the groove/nu-metal Bathory record, and while it drifts closer to that clime than any other, it's more of a failed attempt at modern and grimy thrash redolent of what Slayer were doing post-Seasons in the Abyss. You might catch hints of similar structures to those used by Machine Head, System of a Down or other tripe emerging out of the 90s, but Slayer is the perfect comparison for Octagon, since there are a number of riffs here that seem pulled directly from the Hanneman/King playbook. For example, the descending thrash rush in the opener \"Immaculate Pinetreeroad #930\". The mix of grooves and primal thrashing in \"Psychopath\" or the bridge of \"Schizianity\". Or how about the vocal architecture in \"Sociopath\"? Ring any of hell's bells?\n\nNothing is straight lifted, of course, but I felt as bored and irritated by this album as I had been underwhelmed by a Divine Intervention or directly appalled by Diabolus in Musica. It's not that Octagon wholly lacks a personality, or a few 'experimental' touches. For instance, there are a lot of dissonant passages embedded in the guitars, or stolid and raw post Helhammer grooves in tunes like \"Born to Die\" or \"Schizianity\", but the riffs are almost without exception predictably patterned to the point of no return. Not one charming, resonant vocal line or memorable guitar progression exists throughout the entire play length, and even when songs like \"War Supply\" embellish the neanderthal thrashing with noisier, infected atmospheres it still feels no more entertaining than a taut morning struggle on the toilet after a few bowls of bowel sluicing fiber heavy cereal. The only song here I can't say I totally hate is the moody, mid paced \"Century\" slugger which sounds like Hellhammer and 90s Slayer in a circle stroke. But it's not good, either...\n\nThe album ends with a cover of \"Deuce\" from KISS, but in all honestly this sounds nothing like any other track on the entire album. A straight hard rock version with slightly more crushing guitar production and Quorthon's wild, slathering rasped vocals, but contextually it doesn't fit in with the remainder of Octagon. By extension, Octagon doesn't fit in or belong to the remainder of Bathory's discography. Not because it incorporates unwelcome, unimpressive groove metal elements or terrible lyrics in tracks like \"Psychopath\" that feel like something an angsty teen would pen after being the last picked for volleyball teams in Phys. Ed class, but because it just fucking sucks. The songwriting is lamentable, the vocals pathetic, and all the lofty ambitions of previous (and later) albums are rubbed into the mire of contemporary industry driven revolt.\n\nRequiem might have been the first case in which a Bathory album failed to inspire me to set someone or something on fire, or dream of the Eddas, but Octagon was the first and only that I want to run over with my fucking car. It's not clever, it's not funny, it's not interesting and it's nowhere near acceptable.\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nQuorthon\u2019s excursion into the widely criticized 3rd era of Bathory is somewhat of a sensitive topic amongst the faithful, but nowhere is it near as uniform in its ambivalence than where the 8th album dubbed \u201cOctagon\u201d is concerned. Perhaps the big issue is that most choose to see this as either being a modern groove/thrash album, or as a really poor attempt at rehashing the blistering rawness of \u201cRequiem\u201d. While there are elements of both to be found here, there is a case to be made that this album is more suited to the extremities of the growing raw black metal school, but with stylistic quirks that point towards hardcore and modern thrash influences. Or for a less conventional title, this could be seen as an avant-garde blackened thrash album of sorts, though obviously free of all the ambient oddities the go with the first part of the hybrid style.\n\nTo be clear, the approach to production on here is comparable to the unfocused, decrepit character that generally tends to go with obscure black metal demos from a few years prior. The drums borderline on obnoxiousness in how loud and pervasive they are, particularly the popping snare which sounds akin to an exaggeration of what is normally heard out of grindcore bands and a fairly overpowering cymbal presence to boot. The vocals are also a bit loud in comparison to previous work out of this band, while the bass is virtually buried under the rest of the arrangement and the guitars vary from being in the background to fighting with the vocals for the 2nd most prominent spot. While this mixing approach does help to bring out the angst-drenched punk mentality that\u2019s fueling the lyrics (some of which are about as gratuitously profane as the gibberish heard on \u201cSuicidal For Life\u201d), it is definitely understandable why most fans of Quorthon\u2019s work choose this as their reason for dismissing this album.\n\nBut in spite of the obviously glaring air of inaccessibility that permeates the production of each song, I find myself drawn to a good amount of them. \u201cSociopath\u201d, \u201cGRCY\u201d and \u201cJudgment Of Posterity\u201d reprise the Slayer on cocaine character heard on \u201cRequiem\u201d, but with a vocal character that is somewhat less agonized and more shouting in character. But even among some of the slower, Pantera-like material the creeps into \u201cBorn To Die\u201d and \u201cSchizianity\u201d there is a charm to the repetitive guitar lines and Quorthon\u2019s sloppy, heavily accent drenched ravings, even when the lyrics read like something out of a 13 year old kid\u2019s diary. The guitar solo work, which occurs about as often as the typical Slayer or Cannibal Corpse album, is generally a one-dimensional flood of venting pentatonic shred licks and noisy whammy bar noise, but it fits in quite nicely with the equally simplified character of this album.\n\nThe best way to really qualify what this album is in regard to the rest of Quorthon\u2019s discography is by an analogy to Bill Hicks\u2019 famous meltdown in response to a heckler shouting \u201cFree Bird!\u201d by suggesting that Hitler was an underachiever. It\u2019s something that would normally horrify a lot of even the most irreverent of comedy consumers, yet because of the context in which Hicks shouted it out, it was funny and in the minds of some, even appropriate. Nobody really thinks of it as Hick\u2019s best quote or joke, but everybody has a place for it in their memory and has a moment in the course of their lives where they find themselves restating it. That is basically what \u201cOctagon\u201d is; a spur of the moment fit of enraged revulsion that inspires dissonance in the squeamish, yet a reserved nod of agreement from depressing cynics like me. And like the infamous Hicks rant, it definitely loses its effect when listened to over and over.\n",
        "\nBathory is an enigma, as is its alter-ego Quorthon, defying any uniform characterization from one era to the next. Some attribute to him the role of pioneering what became the Nordic black metal scene, though in the 80s when he was laying much of the ground work, the term was used all but interchangeably with death and thrash metal. Others are quick to point out his later 80s and early 90s creations where some of the sounds of the likes of Manowar and elements of folk music were blended together into a heroic mixture that now calls itself Viking metal (though today\u2019s incarnations tend to draw a bit from the blackened era that preceded \u201cHammerheart\u201d as well). But not much is spoken regarding the 3rd era of this band, ergo the one where Quorthon changed his mind about retiring the Bathory name and brought it back in the mid 90s with a very different sound, yet again.\n\nThe first offering of the band\u2019s rebirth can be considered as both a throwback and a somewhat modernized answer to a very real and arguably troubling trend in thrash metal. At face value, one could perhaps draw comparisons to Slayer\u2019s \u201cDivine Intervention\u201d when considering what direction \u201cRequiem\u201d takes, at least in terms of its raw, chaotic, yet oddly focused production. The drum sound is all but abrasively prominent, the bass is also unusually loud and raucous when comparing it to similarly frenzied works during the mid 80s, and the guitars are crisp and possessed of an equal amount of punch and bite. But this listens less like a full out copy of \u201cDivine Intervention\u201d than a composite hybrid of the frenetic, all speed all the time character that dominated much of the early incarnations of thrash/crossover, particularly that of Nuclear Assault and S.O.D., though Quorthon\u2019s vocals are about twice as vicious and agonizing as the most dark and twisted of Angelripper\u2019s vocal jobs.\n\nTo put it in more basic terms, \u201cRequiem\u201d is a contender for the most vile and raunchy of offerings ever to be conceived in the thrash genre, Had it been released by Kreator 2 years before and had a slightly denser production it would have been hailed as an interesting evolution of said band\u2019s consistent career since 1985 and a stark contrast to the slowed down, safe, almost rocking character of most other bands at that particular time. The riff set is a bit on the limited side, drawing up obvious allusions to a more punk infused mentality within the genre paradigm, but whether it\u2019s the raging fury at mach 3 that is \u201cNecroticus\u201d, or the equally nasty yet slightly slower \u201cPax Vobiscum\u201d, the relentless combination of anger and political fatalism intended is all but perfectly captured. Whenever a mood of absolute revulsion at events depicted on the news overtakes me, this is one of the albums that I usually go to in order to vent any misanthropic tendencies in my feelings, as if Quorthon teaching a lesson along the same lines as the parent who locks his kid in a closet with a carton of cigarettes for being caught smoking.\n\nIt\u2019s understandable why this is not very highly regarded amongst Bathory\u2019s studio efforts, it\u2019s definitely a far cry from anything put out under their moniker before. But when treated in the specific context of a thrash metal album that actually pushes the boundaries of sick, twisted irreverence, this is about as extreme as it gets, especially circa 1994 when most of the thrash world was either dying off or getting in touch with their inner homeboy. Picture the love child of Anthrax and Sepultura, the bastard son of Slayer and Suicidal Tendencies, or any other spawn of a fiendish union between extreme thrash, death metal and hardcore, and this album fits the bill every time. It chooses its audience primarily by weeding out casual consumers of the genre who\u2019ve only dabbled in Metallica, and its low-fidelity presentation will probably scare away most Pantera fans. This is precisely what thrash was about at its inception, giving a giant middle finger to mainstream music, and whether by accident or not, Quorthon found himself coming full circle with his roots in a time when the tree was all but dead.\n",
        "\nRequiem doesn't feel so much a 'new Bathory' as one that branched off into an alternate reality at around the time it might have followed Under the Sign of the Black Mark, then somehow found its way back to the natural chronology of the band. After the pair of rather lacking Jubileum compilations, I would have taken just about anything new and original from the vaunted Quorthon, but was not expecting an album which clung so tightly to the pure thrash aesthetics one would expect elsewhere in the scene. Essentially, Requiem is what we might have gotten had Quorthon decided not to delve into his self fulfilling prophecy of viking majesty, but instead attempted to trade blows with a lot of the grimier, aggressive US and German thrashers that dominated extreme metal in the mid through late 80s.\n\nAs such, it's not all that poor of a choice. This was a musician unafraid to reinvent himself, who in doing so helped give birth to a number of sub-genres that remain massive today. Requiem is not some monotonous, point for point impersonation of Exodus, Slayer and Metallica, but there is clearly a bit of US street thrash influence circa Anthrax, Dark Angel, Exodus and S.O.D. in pummelers like \"Suffocate\", \"Requiem\" and \"Distinguish to Kill\", some of which even feature rock out solo breaks that also remind me of the more down home, contemporary American thrashers. The tone used on some of the meatier guitar lines is fairly boxy, redolent of the Finnish band Stone, but the fact that Quorthon sticks with his ghastlier black metal vocals through much of the disc does help it stand out from most of the other 'modern' thrash metal that was spewing forth to an unwelcoming audience in the mid 90s.\n\nUnfortunately, I found them to be the least distinguished and charismatic of Bathory's repertoire to its day, with little but their dry, raw timbre to really propel them. Little of the memorable, vile slather of the Bathory s/t or Under the Sign of the Black Mark. The album inevitably becomes a potpourri of a few finer, choice moments and a bunch of average thrash riffing which, while not even bordering on incompetence, might not have even been effective if it arrived when that music was at its peak momentum. I really like the atmospheric intro to the title track with its distant tolling and eerie synthesizer, and Quorthon wrings a lot of corpulent thrust out of the ensuing, palm muted frenzy, but the riffs just aren't that memorable. Another piece I mildly enjoy is \"War Machine\", for the simplistic, swift flow of the central guitar and the use of sirens to create a belligerent atmosphere, but even this one has a filler riff in the chorus. \"Apocalypse\" has a bold, churning martial appeal to it, with some subtle melodic overtures that hint towards Blood Fire Death or Hammerheart, but it too falls shy of perfection.\n\nHell, even the cover image, while not terrible, is underwhelming, but I don't think I could argue that it didn't capture the stripped down aesthetics of the record. Requiem is the Bathory that might have been, were Quorthon not so inspired and inspiring in the first place, but just another in a sea of thrashers so crowded that some of its most brilliant European authors failed to garner the audience they deserved. This album was a little late for that boom, with most of the thrash audience moving on to hip hop, alternative, grunge and other 90s genre giants. It still sounds like Bathory, just not the one that would launch a thousand dragon ships and etch itself into the annals of immortality. A hollowed out headbanging experience, the aggression dialed up and the atmosphere available only in small pockets. It could get worse, and maybe it will...\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nIf it's not painfully obvious just how conniving Jubileum Vol. II seems in the long term, just take a brief glance through the track list. You'll find more tracks lifted from the same albums that the first volume outsourced the year before, and other rarities that were held back. Had Boss and Quorthon decided to just release the 4 obscurities there and the three here as a single EP, or perhaps tossed on some other unheard material, it might have felt a lot less cheap. Fuck, if they had just kept it in their pants until the later 90s, they could have combined the unreleased material from all THREE Jubileums to produce a single, comprehensive collection that would have been both mandatory and highly anticipated by their original fans and the many that joined the procession through their individual discoveries through the emergent black metal genre earlier that decade.\n\nNah, this just feels like an incomplete 'half' to shove on your shelf next to Vol. I and forget all about it. As proof of this, look at how they've included Bathory's OTHER track from the 1984 Scandinavian Metal Attack split, \"The Return of Darkness and Evil\". Granted, both of their contributions to the release appear elsewhere in the Bathory canon in a form that does not greatly diverge in quality, but I'd rather have these remnants in one place. The other gems here are \"Burnin' Leather\", a straight black/speed/thrash blitz from before the Blood Fire Death album was released with Quorthon's most Germanic, Mille Petrozza presence perhaps in all his legacy (not only for the voice itself but the syllabic patterns); and \"Die in Fire\", which was taken from the same 1983 demo recordings as \"You Don't Move Me (I Don't Give a Fuck)\". The vocals are a little more hacked here, but I still quite enjoy the primal riffing and think that element alone is just another of the myriad reasons Bathory has been such an influential band. Try and count how many of these throwback speed/black bands today owe their very existence to a tune like this...great that we can finally hear it.\n\nBut that's where the value ends to this collection. The rest of the tunes are just lifted off the full-length albums. Two more from Twilight of the Gods (\"Bond of Blood\" and the title track), which seems rather silly. It was their most recent record and yet now we've got 50% and 30 minutes of its content reprinted within 2 years. From the first three albums, there is a small contingent including \"Possessed\", \"Raise the Dead\", \"Total Destruction\" and \"Call from the Grave\", and then more of their Viking fare in the form of \"Shores in Flames\" (Hammerheart) and \"The Golden Walls of Heaven\" (Blood Fire Death). So, yes, now 5 of the 9 tracks from Blood Fire Death are also repressed for these two compilations...if anyone is THAT interested, why not just buy the damned thing and experience its full, consistent glory.\n\nAlas, the same frustrations apply here to this release as they do for every other largely needless printing of plastics and paper that I've experienced, and it's difficult to regard Jubileum Vol. II as anything more than an incomplete commercial venture targeted at collectors and fanatics who will purchase this on its logo/brand name alone. Two of the unreleased tracks are worth hearing, as they'd not been available to those who bought the original pressings of the full-lengths. But the remainder of the content does not flow any better here than it did in its original configuration, and to most of good taste, Bathory's a good enough band to drop the 60-80 bucks on their exceptional backlog anyway. As it stands, the net worth of this particular collection is about as long as it takes to rip \"Burnin' Leather\" and \"Die in Fire\" to your portable mp3 player or desktop folder and then sell it off to some other sucker.\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nWhile Quorthon has been on record to discuss his varying levels of involvement with Black Mark Productions and his relationship to its head of operations, Boss Forsberg (who also produced some of the Bathory albums), I don't think there's any dispute that Bathory itself was more or less the flagship act for the imprint. Through the years, I've often enjoyed the Black Mark signings, for example the Swedish psychedelic/doom troop Lake of Tears, who have released some of my favorite albums of the past 10-15 years. But really, if you consider how much of a cult following Bathory has developed over the years, and what a demand there has been for special editions, re-releases, vinyl and so forth, it wouldn't be a stretch to assume that Quorthon was the label's primary source of income.\n\nTo that extent, it makes sense that the label would and will release all manner of collections and compilations documenting the band's evolution, and Jubileum was the first series of such. The aim here was to provide a good portion of the band's previously released material to prospective audiences, and then jazz it up with a few unreleased gems so the diehards had a reason to pump out the coin for them. Granted, Bathory is such a 'scene status' godfather for the black metal territories that damn near every fan owns their albums in some incarnation, and the last thing they really need is rehashed, redundant material when they would prefer demos, rehearsals or those few old live recordings that might have existed. But alas, this describes about 70% of the contents of this first compilation (and its successor), which is ultimately a lot more useless than not. Also, considering that that both Jubileum volumes I and II are both drawn from the band's early catalog (first six full-lengths), it's a bit lame that they were released independently and not as a 2-CD set...\n\n11 of the track are re-pressed from the prior full-lengths, and the selection is nothing to scoff at in terms of sheer quality. \"Blood Fire Death\", \"Dies Irae\", \"Odens Ride Over Nordland\" and \"A Fine Day to Die\" all represent the very finest of the band's hours, and their finest album (Blood Fire Death), but they also incorporate a smattering of earlier pieces: \"Enter the Eternal Fire\" and \"Equimanthorn\" from Under the Sign of the Black Mark, \"Sadist' from The Return... and \"War\" from the 1984 s/t. Hammerheart earns one proxy (\"Song to Hall Up High\") and the more recent Twilight of the Gods earns two (\"Through Blood by Thunder\", \"Under the Runes\"). So it's clear that Quorthon's choices here were biased towards the more viking themed material, a bias I share only in that it grants Blood Fire Death so much berth, but might not best convey the balance and evolution that the band exhibited in their formative years.\n\nOf course, who gives a shit, because most of us who gave a damn already owned all these songs, and would only be interested in the rare bits. There's a version of \"Sacrifice\" here that was originally featured on the 1984 Scandinavian Metal Attack split (Bathory's proper debut) with other hopefuls like Finland's Oz and Sweden's Trash. I think we all know who got the best of that deal. Then, more importantly there are some rarer tracks like \"Rider at the Gate of Dawn\", a lush choir/synth instrumental of about 80 seconds that would have felt right at home on Blood Fire Death with its grim, warlike mount-trotting implications. \"Crawl to Your Cross\" is a dense and explosive black/thrash piece with a meaty, violent guitar tone somewhere in between the US bands Exodus and ZnoWhite. For 1989, this track was somewhat out of character for the band, since Quorthon was honing in on his viking/pagan medium, so it's understandable why it would have been left out, but I am glad to finally have heard it.\n\nLastly, you've got a real oldie, \"You Don't Move Me (I Don't Give a Fuck\") which was recorded in that total old school filth speed metal style that was further evolved on the Bathory s/t. Raw, spiteful and grimy, it's amazing to me just how much this nearly 30 year old piece sounds like the stuff you'll hear the Japanese band Abigail write today! My favorite thing on this comp, and the bass, vocals and licks are all superb despite the humble 4-track production. I can only imagine how much value Jubileum Vol I. would hold for me if there had been more material like this involved, but sadly it's just an exception to the rule. There's a lot of great music on the comp in general, but I can't think of a single reason it would be more appropriate to experience here than in its original landscape. It might have been a total bust, and been 100% rehash, but at least they felt some compulsion to pepper the contents with a few carrots on sticks for the jaded.\n\nThat said, this is still pretty useless if you're not a collector or completist. As a 7\" with just the unreleased material, it might have shined. As it stands: no. Not the most shameless cash grab I've ever witnessed (check the stupendously redundant Lake of Tears compilations that Black Mark released far later), but kind of a missed opportunity nonetheless. If you DO happen to be one of the fourteen or fifteen interested parties on Earth who haven't yet experienced Quorthon in all his morning glory, then save the shells on this album and instead dive straight into Blood Fire Death, Bathory '84, Hammerheart or Under the Sign of the Black Mark, depending on your preference for his Satanist or Odinist epochs.\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nOver the Christian skulls, and through the waves, to Grandfather Odin's house we go. Twilight of the Gods, the 6th Bathory full length, would see the Swedes' transition to full-on Viking folk metal completed, and all within the span of a year since Hammerheart. Not that this would be the last evolutionary stage for Quorthon, who will continue to place the band on divergent paths through the mid 90s, but I don't think anyone could question that a good number of his albums from the Blood on Ice era and beyond felt like reiterations of the concepts and atmospheres he originally explored on the Viking 'trilogy' of Blood Fire Death, Hammerheart and this Twilight of the Gods.\n\nThis chapter is by far the most accessible in all of Bathory's history, and that's due to the high levels of friendlier rock polish in both production and composition, plus Quorthon's decision to focus almost exclusively on a cleaner vocal tone. Personally, I was saddened at this fact when I first purchased the CD, because I did rather admire the coat of grit he had applied to its predecessors, since all but abandoning the snarling and rasping pandemonium of the early albums. As I've mentioned, I find the man's pure singing voice to be inconsistent at best, as he was never blessed with the broadest range and seems to often stumble over his accent, but even at its worst there is a particular character to his floppy, cutting tone that is easily distinguishable from anyone else (sort of like the charm one might find in 'Engrish' bands, though this is not of grammar but delivery). He can hit a certain thread of melody in \"Twilight of the Gods\" or the soaring symphonic anthem \"Hammerheart\" which proves he's no hack, but there are a number of passages throughout this album, like the slovenly verses of \"To Enter Your Mountain\" in which further refinement and editing should have been mandated.\n\nMusically, the focus is all on slick, clean and catchy chorus sequences and simple flowing rock chords, supported by choirs not unlike those found on Hammerheart. Bathory was no initiate to the use of the acoustic guitar, but here it was most heavily implemented as a base component of the musical landscape. It's nearly everywhere, and tracks like \"Under the Runes\" and \"Blood and Iron\" wouldn't be the same without the brooding, folksy undercurrent it creates. So much of the album is slow that it reminds me of a Viking Pink Floyd. Perhaps not so psychedelic, unless you're a raven or six-legged horse, but certainly as airy and atmospheric as that comparison would imply, with an assured, steady flow to the music that centers heavily on the simplicity of the rock chords and the flow of the vocal arrangements. The aim was to appear glorious, and even though this is far from a personal favorite in the Bathory repertoire, that end result is not one I could ever deny.\n\nI almost wish that the use of voices here had been restricted to the choir sequences, though, like the drudging harmony used in \"Blood and Iron\", because when Quorthon breaks away for the lead vocal lines they often feel relatively shabby and off-kilter. With Hammerheart, I felt as if the man were riding some squall on a dragon ship and beseeching \u00c6gir to let he and the crew pass the towering torrents around them, but here his presence seems to break up the smooth flume of the musical procession and there are cases like \"Through Blood by Thunder\" where he just feels like an emo suffering from a hernia. I found my earlier exposures to the album grating at best, especially in such spots as this, but through the years I've at least learned to tune them out and just focus on the underlying music, which, while rarely exemplary, at least serves for positive background noise to atavistic ruminescence or dorkier pondering. Though interestingly enough, there's a slightly contemporary slant to the lyrics (in particular the title track).\n\nUltimately, it's a good album, but not a showcase of Bathory at peak performance. I do like the meandering, fell majesty and tribal power of the drums, the constant kneading of the acoustics into the roiling, simplified chord structures and the sobering choirs, but at times I feel as if they're all being conducted by a drunkard. Still, this would be the safest to share with your dad, uncles and granddads over a mead. But your mom will still hate it. I can recall that this was supposed to be one of several swan songs for the band. It's solemn disposition certainly reflects that finality, and I'm sure that there are a great many Bathory fans who wish it had been the case, judging by the divisive reactions towards its successors, but it's not as if all the ensuing efforts were total refuse. Twilight of the Gods should be judged as the album which plied the safest waters in terms of a general audience, but it was quite risky at the time for the more specialized metal audience who at the time might have been more desiring of heaps of entrails and Satan. But then, they had Deicide (and many more) to whet their carnal appetites.\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nHammerheart and its successor Twilight of the Gods were unique to me in that they were the only 'growers' I experienced in the whole of Bathory's body of work. Most other albums prompted immediate satisfaction or indifference, but Hammerheart took a span of years to accumulate its value when I was flooded with so much else at that precise point in metal history (1990), where thrash had churned out some of its most impressive and enduring works, and death metal was just digging in its heels. Of course, this was an instantaneous purchase much like anything else on the Noise Records roster, but I listened to it a few times, found that it was not as good as Blood Fire Death, put it on the shelf for a few months, extracted it, enjoyed it a fraction more, rinse and repeat for another two decades.\n\nIt's almost as if Hammerheart grows better not only with its own aging, but with mine. These days, as white threads being to poke out through the hedgerow of my facial hair, I've taken on a new level of appreciation for this trudging, Viking monolith, which nearly completed Bathory's transition from thrash and black roots to one of the forefathers of the pagan/folk metal advent that took a firm hold in Europe through the mid to late 90s. You still get a bit of rasped edge to Quorthon's cleaner tones, and the riffs possess a similar, inherent glory to those of Blood Fire Death that feel so legitimately atavist and Norse in nature, but the material here is slower, more atmospheric and drawn out. Tracks like \"A Fine Day to Die\" and \"Blood Fire Death\" itself were given plenty of space to breathe as they surged forth in their belligerent majesty, but here we experience pure paeans to the land and sea of the Sagas, tributes to the world not only of, but BEYOND the battlefields, and as such it's rather refreshing.\n\nMy favorite component to the music is the interaction of the horn sounds with the undercurrents of distorted guitar and the vocal arrangements. Some of this was carried forward from the fourth album, and yet here the orchestration reaches a new level of prevalence in that it's almost a rule and not the exception. The opening sequence to \"Valhalla\", leading up to the potent thrashing canter of its verse, is a fine example of how Quorthon has grown into a composer beyond the metallic instrumentation, and further evidenced by the soaring choirs he implements in this and numerous other tracks on the album. The tribal, measured Viking thrash of \"Baptised in Fire and Ice\" and the lurching, grooving bludgeon of \"Father to Son\" are other highlights, but I find that, considering the 55 minute length of the album, it's pleasant on the whole to experience, if not without some flaws. I could probably live without the obligatory ambient/choir outro, and the massive 11 minute opener \"Shores in Flames\" could have been slightly trimmed, but the majority of the compositions are compelling enough that I appreciate Hammerheart more than anything the band would put out later.\n\nI've mentioned before that I've never been all that fond of the 'singing' Quorthon, but I should clarify that this is simply the limitation on the vocal chords the Gods granted the man, and not on his effort to better himself, to evolve through the process. He's no Celine Dion, but he works with what he's got. Through Hammerheart, really, you only get a taste of the cleaner tones (like the intro to \"Shores in Flames\"), and he largely adheres to the grimier, accented grit that was so prominent on Blood Fire Death, but you can surmise that he's further motivated by melody to match the atmospheres of the changes in the music. Hammerheart lacks the black metal core of its predecessor. What heaviness you witness here comes at either a doomed clip or a confident slower thrashing impetus, so it makes a whole lot of sense that the vocals needed to adapt along with this new vision.\n\nIn listening through Hammerheart, I like to imagine Quorthon as a skald, a minstrel-herald to the fire and wind who gives voice to and through the ice-rimmed storms that assail the ship on which he rides, and I'm sure this was the man's own motivation in choosing this style. And even where I don't love the delivery of each line, it's full proof of concept, which goes a LONG way to properly assessing and immersing oneself into the music here. The ideas might not have been all that unique, after all, we had Blood Fire Death a few years prior, and heavy metal bands like Faithful Breath, Thor and Manowar had already touted the Viking party line, but the 1988-90 Bathory era is without a doubt the point at which it was handled with what felt like genuine passion and enthusiasm, and not as a gimmick or excuse to wear helmet and furs, or to impress your groupies at the after party with the size of your 'axe'. To that extent, metal owes Quorthon another debt (in addition to that whole black metal thing), and this album, while not one of Bathory's best, indefinitely applies its titular implement to your beating hugr in a surefire, resonant succession.\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nBy the time Bathory's third full-length rolled around, thrash metal had produced a number of hallmarks in extremity which more than contested the Swedes' claim upon that end of the spectrum. Reign in Blood and Darkness Descends not only benefited from unforeseen levels of intensity and musicianship, but they were also incredibly volatile and pissed off to the point that they made almost anything outside of the German Big Three seem like turtles racing hares. That said, Under the Sign of the Black Mark was STILL a paradigm of aggression and evil, not through any sense of instrumental flatulence or compositional brilliance, but for the lack of all these things: the crass and compelling stench of darkness, filth and pestilence which permeates every lick played upon the album.\n\nYou wouldn't want Bathory (1984) or The Return... (1985) to hang about your local chapel or attend a family dinner, but when their successor arrived, it felt like every door and window in the village must have been shut tight and barred off, offerings of rams' blood smeared upon their wooden faces to ward off the evil that had strolled in upon a foul wind. This album is really that good, and in my opinion its pacing and structure placed the band firmly upon the pedestal from which Quorthon would never, and has never been shaken, despite the divisive evolutions that Bathory would endure in future years. Contextually, through my own perspective, I have long gone either way on the earlier albums in terms of their exact classification. They were thrash metal. Dirty Satanic speed metal. Death metal. Black metal. In retrospect, that latter category has since officially become 'a thing' of some importance, but one might still place them in all of these spheres at once and get no argument from me.\n\nBut Under the Sign of the Black Mark, at least for my humble self, feels like the point at which the levee broke on the top shelf of the Abyss, and all the damned and damning souls erupted through the crust, screaming in Bradbury-unison 'something wicked this way comes'. THIS is black metal, at its purest, borne on the nuclear zephyrs of thrash and speed and dawning into its own abominable, leering presence alongside another, more underground Scandinavian threat: Mayhem's Deathcrush. Bathory had to this point already been destined for immortality due to the spiteful, unapologetic atmosphere of The Return... and the vicious charisma of the self-titled debut, but Under the Sign of the Black Mark combines the two into a rapine rush of simple and effective buzzsaw riffing momentum, blazing fallen angel leads that cut the heavens with sighs of inevitable vengeance, and a rasped vocal so grimy and eternal as it barks through its acrobatic patterns that it feels as if Dead and Mille Petrozza found some arcane ritual through which to spiritually copulate in Hell and produce a slavering, ravenous offspring.\n\nFirst, the decision to shorten the traditional intro piece was wise. Unlike \"Revelation of Doom\" or \"Storm of Damnation\", it arrives and departs swiftly with all its howling, scathing, and swelling ambiance, to the extent that I never felt myself thinking 'please get on with it' like the first two albums. And it morphs flawlessly into, \"Massacre\", one of the fraction of the tracks here that reflect the debut's sense for shoveling 2-3 burning guitar progressions at the audience and letting them stick like napalm. Simple, fast paced chords shift in serpentine cohesion while a louder, more disruptive, distorted bass tone (played by Quorthon) barrels below. The new drummer, Paul Lundberg is even more strenuous than his predecessor, and his performance here was a benchmark for the black metal genre as a whole. Unfeeling, callous mechanical human blast work with tunneling double bass, Lundberg makes it sound easy. All too easy. So maybe his technique wasn't on par with a Gene Hoglan, Bobby Jarzombek or Dave Lombardo: that's not the point of this, but to bludgeon you repeatedly like a burlap sack of bloodied coins.\n\nWhat I find most amazing in listening back to the album is how the guitars actually somehow take a back seat to the louder vocals and drums, but the patterns are deadly, powerful and hypnotic enough that they catch your ear anyway. This was actually a process vaulted forward into the more glorious atmosphere of Blood Fire Death, but not many bands could make it work. The neck breaking, ominous grooves of \"Equimanthorn\", the chugging and oblique \"Woman of Dark Desires\", and the dire rocking fortitude of \"13 Candles\" are not fashioned from the most prevalent riffing sequences in the band's career, yet they forcefully carve their well deserved niches into the darker reaches of your mind with a haunting, hostile certainty. Speaking of Blood Fire Death, there's an even more prominent presage in the form of \"Enter the Eternal Fire\", a track that experiments with a grander, 7 minute structure and a lot of those flowing, Viking associated rhythms and hammer-drums that dominate their aesthetics in the near future. \"Of Doom\" is another of the many worth mentioning; the break and flow of the guitars here a tangible precursor to the sound that Emperor would master on their classic In the Nightside Eclipse in the ensuing decade.\n\nThe only, and I mean ONLY reasons that I can justify to give Under the Sign of the Black Mark a less than perfect score are simply that I found a teensy handful of the riffs (less than I can count on one hand) to be less engaging than the remainder, and the closing :25 outro as useless as the two that were on the first couple albums. Minor mars upon a near flawless countenance, but present nonetheless. That said, let them not dissuade anyone who has somehow evaded this album's infernal grasp to immediately correct that mistake, because Under the Sign is one of the most indomitable works of classic black metal, and hands down one of the greatest Scandinavian extreme metal works of the 80s. Period. No contest, with the exception of its next youngest sibling, an album I prefer due for its ability to transport me to a place I'd rather be. Whatever. Apples and oranges. Pikes and pitchforks. Own this, or suffer the consequences of your own, miserable, tasteless purgatory.\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nTo dub The Return... a disappointment would be like condescending to a good massage after a fit of passionate, memorable intercourse. It sure feels good, but it just cannot match the climactic intensity and release you were experiencing just a few minutes earlier. Or in the case of Swedish abomination Bathory, a year earlier. Don't get me wrong: The Return... is a puerile, forceful and even brutal album. I'd state with a straight face that it was more savage, primal, atmospheric and barbaric than its predecessor. But the riffs here are just not as good, the energy level somewhat curbed and a bit more emphasis on the weight and rock-groove of the guitars than the sheer blitz of dirty speed metal that dominated Bathory. That album was a straight razor of sinister intentions, this is more of a vulgar machete with a mildly dulled edge.\n\nThe band was still in a trio format, though Andreas Johansson replaced Rickard Bergman on the bass. The intro and outro play out much the same as on the s/t. \"Revelation of Doom\" is a bit creepier than \"Storm of Damnation\" due to the more roiling torrents of guitar distortion and the pronounced, if distant looped screams, but I still feel as if it just goes on too long. Give me just a minute of this, or cause something more to happen, because even in the span of 3 and a half minutes I grew a little tired of it, and the hidden :25 second outro is too brief and useless to stir up any reaction. There are a few songs which I found spiritual successors to the first album, like \"Bestial Lust\" or \"The Return of the Darkness and Evil\", the latter having some similarities to a straight Slayer speed thrasher (\"Chemical Warfare\") with corpulent tremolo picking in primal but menacing patterns. Most of Quorthon's snarling and rasping is well in line with the identity he had manifest earlier, but I actually found that it had less of a ghastly, wavering character and more of a focused, cutting grimness to it that was marginally less effective.\n\nHowever, he does occasionally add some spice to the mix like the expansive backup gutturals in the chorus of \"Born for Burning\", or the more ritualistic growls in \"Reap of Evil\". Considering how few bands were using the style at the time, it's no wonder that The Return... is cited an influence upon the death metal genre as well as the black. Back in the early through mid 80s, a boundary of distinction had yet to really be drawn, so they shared a lot with Hellhammer in that small class of progenitors that transcended simple categorization. But what I find pretty clear about The Return... is that it has a far more muscled punk or hardcore influence than its predecessor. Songs like \"The Rite of Darkness\", \"Sadist\", \"Son of the Damned\" and \"Total Destruction\" brandish a lot of open, grooving chords that crash back and forth along the axis of the semi-burst beats. They'll often incorporate some solid mid-paced pure thrash riffs (\"Born for Burning\" and \"Sadist\", for example), but I rarely found any of the note progressions here to be as searing or diabolically enthusiastic as a \"Sacrifice\" or \"Necromancy\".\n\nAesthetically, The Return... is brighter and more dynamic than the generally moody darkness prevalent on the s/t album, and here there is really no contention as to its influence on a metric shit ton of later DIY black metal recordings in the underground. Once more it's produced by Quorthon and Boss, so it stands out from the mainstream in that Bathory never had the purse or the desire for tracking down some big name producer and wider cultural acceptance. Almost messy in its determination to tear and bludgeon the listener's brain, but the bass a fraction less pronounced (in both volume and composition) than it had been before. The drums seem a lot more crashing akin to the later Blood Fire Death, lacking that subtler constant tinniness that permeated the debut, and I found that the actual structure of the guitars very often serves as a foreshadowing to that later, monumental masterwork.\n\nIn the end, though, this is really no more than a 'good' black/thrash metal album. Worth owning if you love Bathory, worth owning if you enjoy the primordial sounds that would stretch and settle into the style so many enjoy and emulate today, but it's not possessive of their best material. It's louder and about 10 minutes longer than Bathory, and the lyrics on par, but those are the only areas in which some physical aspect matches or exceeds its forebear. I can't think of any legitimate reason why I'd break this out over any of their other 80s full-lengths, but it's probably on par with all of those later works upon which Quorthon decided he was a 'singer'. Fun enough for frenetic sessions of head banging, appreciable for its place in the canon, but it's no Deathcrush, To Mega Therion or Under the Sign of the Black Mark.\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nTo calculate the actual sum of influence perpetuated by the 1984 Bathory debut might prove inestimable to even the keenest of logisticians, because it's seething tendrils pervade numerous niches of the metal spectrum even today. I can't tell you how many bands I hear annually, via promos or research, that would be entirely content if the whole of their careers amounted to little more than an aesthetic tribute to THIS very album. To exist as nothing other than a shadow of the late Quorthon. Is Bathory the first proper 'black metal' record as far as the fundamental principles we equate to the genre today, disregarding the titular ownership via Venom? I do believe that a strong case could be made for such, at least as good a case as for any other particular work.\n\nOf course, when I was young, and first experienced the Swedes' music, it was considered thrash or speed/thrash metal of a darker pallor than some of the popular Bay Area sounds. People had yet to kick around the 'black metal' tag as a proper sub-genre, and other favored progenitors like Destruction, Sodom and Kreator were clearly performing at a similar, vicious viscosity to Bathory's scathing inauguration. And yet the iconic, minimalistic cover, the classicist font of the logo and the repulsive timbre of Quorthon's youthful snarling best represent, at the very least, the birth of European black metal in its filthier format. That's not to say that Bathory was wholly unique even for its day. Clearly there are parallels to Slayer's rapid, hellish origins (\"Hades\" reminds me of \"Black Magic\") and a grimy punk rocking glaze redolent of the more extreme NWOBHM related acts like Mot\u00f6rhead, Tank and Venom. The Satanic/occult focus of the lyrics was also also not news by this time, as it featured prominently for several of the aforementioned acts. However, the fact that this was arriving from a non-German or American act was indisputably eye awakening.\n\nBathory was not an easy find for me at first. I combed the local import record stores with decent metal sections on a near weekly basis for such gems, squandering my paper route money on whatever was readily available rather than paying double for special orders. If they ever had the damn thing in stock, it was always gone before I arrived. I had to settle for a dub off a friend's cassette for years, and in fact I had purchased hard copies of Bathory's later efforts like Under the Sign of the Black Mark and Blood Fire Death before finally landing my grubby mitts on it (ironically, the only two albums in Quorthon's entire lexicon that I favor over this). Bathory was not a highly visible band in my neck of the woods. You heard mention in interviews or magazines, you saw a few of your favorite metal musicians wearing the T-shirt in photo ops. Metalians in my high school were busy sporting erections for Metallica, Megadeth, Slayer, Anthrax, and most had very little attention span or funds to explore the thrash genre much deeper. If you encountered a guy or gal with a Testament or Nuclear Assault t-shirt other than yourself, you were blown over by the prospect of a kindred spirit. Meet your new best friend.\n\nFunny, then, that of any of the 'second tier' of speed and thrash in the 80s, Bathory has left one of the most enduring and massive legacies. Few metal bands can match their aesthetic imprint count for count, and even some of the 'big' names owe Quorthon a beer in Hell. For example, you could lie to yourself and then try to convince me that Burzum's \"War\" was not a spiritual rehash of the track \"Necromansy\" (not Bathory's \"War\"). The riffing pattern is very similar. Or that Witchery's explosive black/thrash cut \"The Reaper\" was not an atavistic nod to this previous Swedish \"Reaper\", which has a decidedly familiar chorus. And what of the vocals in general? Cronos might have had a crude and carnal mean streak coursing through his pipes, and Schmier a more pinched and nasal wrath on Sentence of Death, but Quorthon's biting vitriol is like a musical Genghis Khan, its seed spread through countless tens of thousands corpse painted progeny who only rarely rival the fiber of their ancestor.\n\nAs far as its production qualities, Bathory was far from a highlight for '84. Glossier 'mainstream' efforts like Powerslave, Metal Heart, Defenders of the Faith or even Ride the Lightning proved that metal had come a long way from the toiletry of its demo years. And yet, Quorthon and Boss wrung out a primal and methodic sound here that too transcend into aesthetic immortality. Not as messy, raw and reductive as Venom's Black Metal, perhaps, but equally sinister. Stefan Larsson's drums have a thinner, backing tone that never intercedes over the concentrated acid of the guitars or the wretching diatribes of the front man, played largely in a punk rock fashion with loads of tinny cymbal crashes (though the supporting bass drums are noticeably thick). The bass of Rickard Bergman isn't dowsed in a load of bold distortion, but instead threads moodily below Quorthon's rhythms and leads; only rarely breaking away from the guitar progression, but where it does (\"In Conspiracy with Satan\", for one) it creates a warmer, morbidly glorious atmosphere.\n\nBut most importantly, Quorthon showed himself a relatively accomplished guitarist early on, and some of my favorite moments on this debut are when his frivolous leads tear off the rhythms in the bridge of a \"Sacrifice\" or the rocking \"Raise the Dead\". There is some degree of amateurish sloppiness in a few of the solos, or the riffing in general, but in general you'll be too hypnotized by the sheer cruelty and velocity. The song structures are relatively primal here, rarely featuring more than 2-3 riff variations, but none lack for a thriving infernal energy, and the brevity of the tracks average around 3 minutes never allows the listener's interest to wane. In fact, alongside Slayer's Reign in Blood, this is one of the best short playing thrash albums of the 80s, in and out faster than a desperate drunken tango with a prostitute. Slam, bam, thank you ma'am, the cash is on the dresser and I'll try not to trip on the sticky jeans around my ankles while I fly down the stairs. 27 minutes of sinful pleasure beget a lifetime of damnation.\n\nIt's not perfect. Personally, I find that the windswept, distant chanting and tolling of the \"Storm of Damnation\" intro could have been clipped in half to better swell the anticipatory momentum for the first metal track, \"Hades\". The outro could have been snipped entirely. A few of the later cuts like \"War\" and \"Armageddon\" never really hit me with an ace riff like the rest, though they are no less despotic and relentless than their neighbors. The lyrics are all appreciably extreme for the time, but some of them seem better ordered and paced than others, and certainly they provided fuel for a great number of faux Satanists and provided ample fuel for the genre's Christian right-wing antagonists. I always got the feeling that Quorthon was just doing the whole 'evil' thing for show, and that he never really had his heart in it, a notion that was enforced by Bathory's later switch almost exclusively to Norse/Viking themes. But, that said, who the hell WASN'T doing it for show? Maybe King Diamond and Cronos were serious about it at some point, but Tom Araya's a bleeding Christian.\n\nYou don't get a chance every day to formally review something that has left such an enormous impression upon such a huge chapter of your life in entertainment, and Bathory is clearly one of the cornerstones. Rolled out of the very depths of the abyss for your amusement. A ripping rout, unapologetic in its backlash towards the mainstream of heavy metal that was making headway at the time of its arrival. Some bands burned churches to make a name for themselves, but some, like this one, just burned your fucking ears off.\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nA lot of people tend to cite Venom as the first black metal band, but the fact is they only coined the term. Music-wise they were pretty much just early thrash metal. Bathory were the first band to truly play the black metal sound.\n\nThis album is packed with heavy riffs, skillful solos, blazing drumwork and tortured raspy shrieks. The distorted speed metal riffs have Mot\u00f6rhead-esque tinge to them. They're reasonably fast and heavy, while going into a slower pace at parts, such as in Necromansy. The solos are played in quite a similar way to \"Fast\" Eddie Clarke (of Mot\u00f6rhead fame if you live under a rock and don't know who Eddie Clarke is). While there's a fair bit of shred going on, it doesn't get to the point where Quorthon was relying on his solos being stupidly fast rather than actually well played. The bass provides a backing rumble, but beyond that it does very little. The drums are well played to suit various parts of the music, unlike later black metal works that would just be non-stop blast beats.\n\nQuorthon was possibly the first vocalist to employ that raspy black metal style. He sounds genuinely tortured and in pain, like all through recording his entire body was in agony. Obviously at the time a vocalist of this sort would be quite frightening. I can't imagine how many people were scared shitless when they read the lyrics and heard the vocals. Speaking of the lyrics, they're incredibly haunting and often set a picture. Two good examples are War and Raise The Dead.\n\nThe production is quite raw, but not the point where everything blurs together into an unlistenable wall of noise. Every instrument can be heard and heard clearly, minus the bass which could've been a bit louder. Other than that, an absolutely flawless album and the very first true black metal release. Get this album now!\n",
        "\nThis album is truly mind blowing. This was probably the most brutal album of all time when it was released as well as the birth of true black metal. The speed, the intensity, the anger, the blasphemy...it's all here. This is where the planets aligned. This is the shit, quite frankly!\n\nThe vocals are absolutely raw, evil shrieks. Quorthon sounds fantastic on every track. These were unheard of vocals back in 84 and I imagine it scared people shitless. It literally sounds like demons have just been belched out of hell and are running wild in the streets, mutilating people. This is pure evil. Many people have tried to copy this vocal style, but have failed. This is truly one of a kind, and it sounds great. The riffs are incredible as well. They are blazingly fast and angry. They don't get boring, aren't repetitive, and they don't suffer from the buzzing of many other early black metal albums. The solos are just as good, if not better. Fast as hell and in your face, Quorthon shows how truly great of a musician he is. The bass isn't exactly prominent, but it has some interesting parts and doesn't just hide behind the riffs the whole time which a lot of great albums have suffered from. The drums aren't exactly full of complex parts. They're basically just pounding fast and loud on the snare and the crash symbol, but they sound great. I just love hearing him crushing the snare. The musicianship isn't exactly as good as it was to come. Some may even call it sloppy. But it was innovative, it was unique, and it was evil. \n\nThis is the album that started black metal. You may think it was Venom or Hellhammer, but this is true black metal. Shrieks, fast and sloppy playing, crappy sound quality, and songs about possession and Satan. This is one of my favorite albums ever. It influenced a whole genre and is still fast and evil to this day. Buy it at all costs.\n",
        "\nSweden for the most part has always had a healthy metal scene, even from the get-go. In the 80's, alongside Candlemass and may be Artch, there was one band that literally blew the standards away as far as what could come from the land of frost; Bathory. First album? Classic. Can't even mention the genre of black metal without mentioning that or the follow-up to this album \"Under The Sign of The Black Mark,\" but that's another review yet to write and discuss. If their first album was about setting the standards as far as how well one could make Venom seem like a joke (gotta remember at the time this was released, Venom was still believed to be actual Satanists...), and if their third album really set the freezing winds blowing from the north a good handful of years before the fires warmed things up in Norway...then \"The Return\" was nothing but an expression of lo-fi black metal EVIL, and actually the first of it's kind too. Before Sarcofago, before Darkthrone, before Beherit, before Xasthur-worshiping Myspace bedroom bands and ecological hipsters made it more acceptable...Bathory's second album was the first in capturing the \"necro\" sound and blackened heart of black metal.\n\n\"The Return\" is really the best example of a band progressing; more specifically mainman Quorthon really pushing himself with trying to basically out-do Venom at their own game; and then some. He did it. Remember how Venom use to print the lyrics/poems on the backs of their first 3 lps? Well Quorthon pulled a rabbit out of his hat and did as such: \"We wanted people to just read out \"The Return...\" \u2013 as in a second album or a follow-up \u2013 and then flip the album over to look for a tracking list. Not finding one, what they got was this apocalyptic poem with the song titles woven into it. Only after listening through the album to the end would you get the full title of the album; The Return of the Darkness and Evil\" Quorthon. So in other words \"U mad? Problem?\"(actually, I think this applies more to Venom than Bathory, seeing how Quorthon managed to pull a second leg of damn good albums compared to enom's only first 3 which I even consider listening to) This must have fucked with metalheads of ancient yore making them scratch their noggins like monkeys. \n\nThere's not much of a difference between this one and the classic self-titled outside of....it's more extreme? It's more evil? More atmospheric? More of everything. I know for years I couldn't listen to this because it sounds raw as fuck compared to the 1rst and 3rd Bathory albums. Even to this day, the sound production is something only a few bands from the could actually mimic. I mean....a certain postal worker with a niche for everything 'primitive' knew how to fucking do it and carried on their legacy for an entire new generation in the 90's. Watain even managed to capture the 'aura' of early Bathory. Nifelheim dragged it through the ice of it's wintery domain. Even The Crown knew the infernal darkness of what it was and paid tribute to it most of it's underrated career. It essentially is like watching an old Hammer Horror movie, grainy, rusty, bleak, and atmospheric. It sounds like it was recorded in a cave and damn it...I cannot get enough of it. Even the song structures, it has hints of NWOBHM, Hardcore Punk, but Quorthon went for broke and added this infernal ambiance that really gave a new meaning. So many great songs; \"Total Destruction,\" \"Born For Burning,\" \"The Return,\" \"Possessed,\" etc. Something beyond hypnotic about those cuts. \n\nThis is one of those hypnotizing albums that you can listen to all day long and not get bored with. So YES this is a must own.The fucking album cover alone should make you want to listen to it. And still after listening to this about 5673920298484576349237385795789.7856345763756384 times, I still want to scream at the top of my lungs \"IT'S THE RETURN OF DARKNESS AND EVIL, IT'S THE RETURN OF FIRE AND PAIN!\"\n",
        "\nThe final chapter of any saga is ultimately where one\u2019s steel is truly tested, regardless to whether one be an instrumentalist, front man, songwriter, or in Quorthon\u2019s unique case, all of the above. While a number of great bands have misjudged their own longevity and elect to fissile out over a slow period of decline, the true greats take their final bows right at the zenith of their respective careers, even if one could potentially put out more works that are still marginally good. But in the case of Bathory, a resurgence of unexpected vigor and vitality resulted in a career that went on more than a decade from this, the intended closing of the curtain on a brilliant and innovative career. To put it mildly, this is the greatest conclusion that turned out not to be.\n\n\u201cTwilight Of The Gods\u201d is the ultimate example of where an album can be epic, and not have to serve any other purpose. While stylistically most of its emulations differ greatly, this colossal congregation of massive atmospherics, majestic acoustic guitar lines, thunderous guitars, bombastic drums, and all the imagery of frost covered landscapes and dragon boats approaching the shore to boot is the archetype for what many Viking oriented black and folk metal outfits from the land of Norse exploits have become known for since. Take Manowar at their most stripped down, battlefield laden, true metal greatness, subtract the speed metal and the mid-tempo NWOBHM influences, and what emerges is a tower of an album casting a shadow engulfing all in its wake.\n\nWithin the misty landscapes of the album\u2019s opening trilogy, which was actually compressed into a single song on the album\u2019s 2003 reissue, is the testament of unfettered genius at work. With winds blowing and a distant cry of a clean electric guitar drone that bears some similarity to ones heard on \u201cHammerheart\u201d, the spellbinding adventure that is this album\u2019s title song kicks off with a blast loud enough to parallel Thor\u2019s hammer striking down a legion of giants. The moods switch between nostalgic and fearsome, with dense acoustic and distorted guitar voicing that meshes brilliantly with droning chorus line that trades blows with Quorthon\u2019s rough edged and dirty lead vocals. Things come to a head somewhere in the latter half of the song, just before the guitar solo where a gratuitous bass shred fest that was obviously paraphrased from Joey Demaio\u2019s extended repertoire signals where this song owes its origins to, while simultaneously pointing out how far Quorthon has refined the concept.\n\nAs the rest of the opening trilogy unfolds, it becomes apparent that keeping the ideas interrelated and minimal is one of the biggest draws to this otherwise ambitious endeavor. The 2nd chapter \u201cThrough Blood By Thunder\u201d begins on a restful guitar drone before launching into another dark and heavy onslaught of trudging grooves at a punishing slow tempo, and like most middle movements of a 3 part series, is the shortest and behaves more like a bridge for 2 more ambitious extremes. \u201cBlood And Iron\u201d contains the most memorable elements of the song, particularly the easily recognizable acoustic theme that sort of comes and goes amidst a sea of thudding guitars that literally sound deep enough to make Zakk Wylde take notice.\n\nWhile the first 3 songs found on here definitely can stand on their own and sum up the nature of this album, it is easily rivaled by the equally chilling follow up in \u201cUnder The Runes\u201d. With an intense mixture of acoustic and electric themes that almost seem like a slowed down answer to \u201cThe Call Of Ktulu\u201d, this thing manages to be the catchiest number to ever come out of Quorthon\u2019s catalog. The tendency is towards a vintage 80s sound, yet at the same time it hints at a coming end for this style of song, as if Quorthon himself is predicting the eventual death of the 80s with the rise to prominence of Nirvana, Pearl Jam and others at around this time and has translated it into a swansong requiem for a time when music was capable of being sorrowful and passionate without being cynical and a complete drag.\n\nThe remnants of this album\u2019s contents largely draw a similar picture to the 4 instant classic preceding them. \u201cTo Enter Your Mountain\u201d has more of a folksy, almost slow dance nature to its acoustic themes, amid a the heavy riffing and gravely shouts. \u201cBond Of Blood\u201d plays up the heaviness a bit more and sounds closer to an all out doom metal song with a slight bit of epic detailing, in much the same fashion as some of Manowar\u2019s more menacing slow songs. And the closing rendition of Holst\u2019s \u201cHammerheart\u201d is a surprising change of pace with Quorthon actually trying out an operatic baritone with a synthesized orchestral accompaniment to close out an album more characterized by roughness than restfulness. It\u2019s a fitting end, yet an all but completely unexpected one as well given Quorthon never sounded so brisk and clear while at the microphone.\n\nThis is an album that is defined by embracing an extreme, and though its greatness is obvious to anyone who goes for atmospherics and triumphant themes, its polarizing nature is equally as obvious to any casual observer. While this spits in the face of common radio oriented music, it also is about as distant from the vile extremes of what defines black metal ala Sodom and Venom as can be without crossing into the world of hard rock. It will likely be doomed to an existence of semi-obscurity despite its impeccable brilliance, in much the same respect as Manilla Road tends to be. But anyone who can take the slow tempos and the unorthodox production is recommended to part with hard earned dough in order to experience Quorthon\u2019s second brush with perfection.\n",
        "\nA lot has been made about of association between Scandinavian/Viking history and metal music, particularly in the wake of an entire sub-genre claiming the label and a host of bands involved in the Norwegian 2nd wave of black metal taking on lyrical and some musical trappings in line with it. But less attention tends to get paid to the origins of the genre, which are many and at times difficult to define. Quorthon is often pointed to as the godfather of present day Viking metal, but a careful analysis of Bathory\u2019s early 90s work shows a combination of already established practices with a more concentrated emphasis on duration and atmosphere. There is very little to be found that hasn\u2019t been inspired by either the grandest of Manowar\u2019s typical epic compositions such as \u201cDark Avenger\u201d and \u201cGates Of Valhalla\u201d, or the longer winded and down tempo offerings of Metallica. Anything that can be attributed to Quorthon specifically in terms of innovation is that, with respect to \u201cHammerheart\u201d, that he isolated the key elements that were already in the works by 1984 and married them to a much grittier, punk infused vocal style that is quite distant from the lion growls of James Hetfield and the pristine banshee wails of Eric Adams.\n\nOriginality is perhaps not the best way to measure the importance of this album, but a good case can be made of its significance when looking at presentation and potency. Quorthon makes the most of his limited vocal range, offering up a unique mixture of clean sung, folksy melodic drones to complement the massive yet slow developing guitar riffs and gravely, haggard sounding shouts that are largely tonally based, but still carrying a strong remnant of the blackened screams of \u201cBlood Fire Death\u201d. Some slight hints of this coming approach to song creation was hinted in the opening and closing songs of said album, but here the early heavy metal influences are worn right on Bathory\u2019s dark shirt sleeves, and with its entry is jettisoned every single thrash metal element that has typified the band\u2019s sound up until now. It is understandable to see many older fans jumping ship on \u201cHammerheart\u201d, but it is equally plausible to see this new sound as a welcome change from a band that is electing to mix things up a bit and is still keeping the quality level up in spite of the stylistic departure. Nevertheless, it is important to keep in mind that this album is just as much a throwback as it is a step forward.\n\nWhat this album may lack in subtlety, it more than makes up for in outright simplicity, stretching the bounds of repetitious sections with an eye for quality that makes these elongated sections appropriate. While appearing frighteningly long in length, both \u201cShores In Flames\u201d and \u201cOne Road To Asa Bay\u201d showcase a free flowing approach to acoustic guitar work and heavy ended, pummeling riff work that borderlines on doom metal territory tempo wise. The latter song is all but a dead ringer for a couple of signature Manowar epics, but Quorthon\u2019s raw vocal work gives it a very interesting flavor, not to mention the nastier guitar tone and the sharper drum production. \u201cBaptized In Fire And Ice\u201d takes a similar approach, but does so with a bit less acoustic work and an even catchier, albeit slow trudging groove. But while the songwriting is definitely being directed around with an eye for what Joey Demaio might do, an equal tendency towards Metallica fanfare sneaks in on \u201cHome Of Once Brave\u201d and \u201cValhalla\u201d, the latter doing a slight paraphrase of the signature outro of \u201cFor Whom The Bell Tolls\u201d, the former outright quoting it and putting some slightly different lead guitar work over top of it.\n\nThis is the sort of album that probably had more of an implicit influence on present day musical practices amongst Scandinavian bands insofar as Vikings are concerned. It has an innovative streak to it in the sense that it brought the idea of simply loading up an album with grandiose epics, which has since become a standard practice for the likes of Moonsorrow. But it is largely an archaic nod to the most primitive and basic conception of metal music, in much the same respect as Bathory\u2019s 80s material, but from a very different, and likely more accessible angle. This is an album that will likely appeal more to fans of Manilla Road than to Ensiferum or Suidakra, though historically it does point to a later revival of early metal practices that was picked up and married to more modern practices by said bands. But as an all out good listen, separate from the questions of what boundaries it may or may not have been pushing, this is a solid endeavor that ought to have a wider audience.\n",
        "\nThe historical significance of Bathory is without question, and no serious party can argue otherwise. Quorthon and company were on the cutting edge, still somewhat conforming to the basic confines of established metal practices on the outer fringes of early Metallica and Slayer, but pushing the envelope far beyond what was probably thought possible at the time. However, how significant and how effectual some of Bathory\u2019s early albums were is up for some debate, regardless of how well crafted or entertaining they might be. While a strong degree of popular sentiment is behind the colossal offering that is \u201cBlood Fire Death\u201d, there are certain questions that can be freely asked about how influential it actually was in comparison to past albums, or the two more distinctively stylized albums that came after for that matter.\n\nWhile there is a noticeable degree of change in how the consonant and melodic characteristics of a few songs differ here from the 84-87 era, this is largely a thrash album with a strong tendency towards a black metal vocal aesthetic. If the two longest songs on here were taken out of the equation, the remains of this album could be qualified as an even dirtier and meaner answer to \u201cPersecution Mania\u201d, or perhaps even an equivalent to the equally savage exercise in extreme thrash metal that was Morbid Saint\u2019s \u201cSpectrum Of Death\u201d. The riff assault is a pure exercise in blinding fury, not quite descending to the near atonal, heavily dissonant character of Slayer\u2019s proto-death metal sound on \u201cReign In Blood\u201d, but is near equal to the intensity of the delivery.\n\nDespite being somewhat of a conventional exercise for 1988, this is definitely a high quality album loaded with energy and does at least hint at a soon to be change in direction. \u201cThe Golden Walls Of Heaven\u201d is among the more powerful and riveting thrash songs in this style to break the 5 minute mark, and slays with a riff set that is largely reminiscent of the faster parts of \u201cHell Awaits\u201d. \u201cDies Irae\u201d takes a similarly long winded route, but has more of a \u201cFight Fire With Fire\u201d feel to it, but with a far nastier vocal delivery. Quorthon\u2019s character of voice on here is actually a tad bit closer to the agonizing character of Varg Vikernes\u2019 sound on Burzum\u2019s early albums, but still dark and goblin-like. But the chief feature of the thrash contents of this album (which is the majority of the songs) is the fantastical riff work and the fancy lead work. Apart from a brief little sonic joke at the beginning of \u201cPace \u2018Till Death\u201d, which has way too much made of it, this is a serious album to content with.\n\nThe remaining contents on here, which is credited as being Bathory\u2019s earliest ventures into what is now known as Viking metal, could be reasonably chalked up as the token epic/progressive ventures of Metallica and Megadeth, except that the principle influence on these songs is Manowar rather than Sabbath or classical music. Both the longwinded title song and the mid-paced \u201cA Fine Day To Die\u201d are chock full of haunting acoustic passages with distant ambient keyboards that can\u2019t help but hold a rather massive torch to \u201cSign Of The Hammer\u201d and \u201cInto Glory Ride\u201d, while still containing an overall character of sound that is conducive to a slower, longer song by a number of conventional thrash bands and the vocal sound of the more extreme ones. However, these songs are more of an exception, and still largely cater to the older sound minus an occasional quiet section with a deeper clean vocal sound out of Quorthon. \n\nTo some, this is the beginning of what everyone now calls Viking metal, and given the occasional thrash tendencies of bands such as Ensiferum and Suidakra, one could say that this album had a measure of impact on the development of the style. However, this album comes off much closer to a glorified mid to late 80s thrash album with Viking oriented lyrics, which will probably appeal more to fans of Sodom and the other members of the Teutonic Trio than most who favor the Norse themed sub-genre as it exists today. Is it a great album? Yes, absolutely. But it is also an album that receives a little more credit than it deserves in shaping a style that was much more directly impacted by \u201cHammerheart\u201d and \u201cTwilight Of The Gods\u201d.\n",
        "\nAmongst the influential offerings of black metal\u2019s obscure and somewhat contested 2nd wave, where the lines between extreme thrash and proto-black metal are about as hazy as can be, there is a single album that arguably sums up the style that has since been stylized and varied from most of the lands touched by the 4 winds. Sure, Venom\u2019s first and second offerings may have laid the lyrical groundwork for most of the scene, and Hellhammer/Celtic Frost brought a good deal into the musical and vocal equation, but the full fledged, signature atmosphere and character of black metal was fully ushered in by Quorthon and company with the release of their 3rd full length work of dark wizardry, \u201cUnder The Sign Of The Black Mark\u201d.\n\nWhile the debut was still largely an exercise in early speed/thrash with a strong helping of aggressive punk rock with a low-fi production, and \u201cThe Return\u2026\u201d was defined by a thin drum sound and an overtly muddy guitar sound that was closer to an early death/thrash sound than a blackened one, this album has all of the principle characteristics that have since been standardized by early 90s Mayhem, Gorgoroth and Immortal. The crunchy, fuzz driven guitar sound meshed with a crisp yet distant accompanying instruments creates an atmosphere well in line with the grim and frostbitten meets witches in the forest character of \u201cDiabolical Fullmoon Mysticism\u201d, and the garbled goblin character of Quorthon\u2019s vocal assault has since been imitated almost to a fault by Pest and Abbath.\n\nBut the real defining point of this album that sets it apart from Bathory\u2019s previous albums is a heightened sense of theatrics and atmospheric density. Naturally this is not something comparable to the wildly deep ponderings of early Emperor, but the beginnings of that same esoteric blend of rich keyboard sounds and blurring guitar lines rears its head on a couple of songs. The more auspicious example is \u201cWoman Of Dark Desires\u201d, which consists of a battering ram of dark power chords and bombastic drum sounds, but makes a little time for a gloomy church organ section that drones in a similar fashion to a handful of songs on \u201cIn The Nightside Eclipse\u201d. \n\nThe other song that shows some leanings towards a consonant yet still pitch black sound also happens to be Bathory\u2019s first flirtation with a more epic sound in \u201cEnter The Eternal Fire\u201d, featuring a droning church bell sound and some synthesized voicing to accompany a more mid-tempo offering. The riff work and implicit melodic content definitely points towards the further developments towards the proto-Viking sound of \u201cBlood, Fire, Death\u201d, but the atmosphere is still perfectly within the same model as what would become Gorgoroth\u2019s early sound. Perhaps the best analogy to more recent bands dealing with the hybrid of Viking and black metal themes would be the first couple of Suidakra albums, though naturally Quorthon\u2019s fuzz driven guitar sound is much more comparable to the 90s Norwegian sound.\n\nNevertheless, this is an album that is only moderately layered with ambient elements and is still mostly a good old fashioned act in unfettered aggression. Shorter bursts of blazing speed such as \u201cMassacre\u201d and \u201cChariots Of Fire\u201d definitely capture the violent character of primitive barbarians painting valley\u2019s with each other\u2019s blood or attributing mythical explanations to their violent world. The riffs blur, the drums cook, the solos are shredded and choppy, and the total delivery is as cold and destructive as a punishing arctic storm. But the true shining moment of pure extreme thrashing belligerence is \u201cOf Doom\u201d, which is riff happy and fast enough to put both Slayer and Sodom on notice.\n\nA lot has been said about this album, and the majority opinion is one of lavish praise, and frankly there are few albums out there that are equally worthy of it. Considering the lack of advanced studio toys that were readily available to other, less threatening version of metal, this is an accomplishment that is even more significant that the genre defining efforts of earlier figures. It\u2019s an album that was equally as ahead of its time as \u201cDeathcrush\u201d, though far superior in quality and more indicative of the dark, occult oriented sound that Mayhem themselves would adopt during the formative years of the early 90s. In other words, this is an album where innovation lays not merely in shock value, but in how well said shocking themes are perfectly packaged into a timeless piece of work that functions equally as art and entertainment. Essential to any and all who can stomach music on the side of the metal spectrum where melodies are not carried in the vocal lines.\n",
        "\nI remember the first time I heard this album I had a hard time swallowing the horrible clean vocals and production glitches (at various points some crackles and pops appear - vinyl nostalgia and all). I admit to not being familiar with Bathory's whole back catalog, but I've heard the albums are considered to be the most important ones and I know about the band's history, so of course the atrocious clean vocals and low production values were no surprise to me.\n\nThe surprise came a few weeks later when I pulled this album out of the cobwebs for another spin. I have no idea what happened in the meantime, but suddenly the little sound problems weren't so bad and I thought that the production fitted the album quite well overall. Even the clean vocals stopped making me cringe. Had they actually grown on me without my knowledge during the period when I didn't play the album? No matter, lets do a bit of reviewing, shall we?\n\nMost of what you get is mid-tempo \"Epic Viking-Metal\" (copyright Quorthon), which means lyrics about how Scandinavia is a cold place (when will we get Inuit metal?), mother earth and nature is where it's at and how honour & pride are cool qualities (fortunately, we are mostly spared from the giggle-inducing Manowar image). Lots of rather cool and pleasant guitar riffs (maybe not very original, but the whole album is done with surprising conviction and that's what makes it work) with basic, yet fun melodic leads on top, lots of those infamous Viking choirs here and there for variety's sake, and an acoustic guitar break with samples of sword fights, water and horses. There's even a faster song to remind us Vikings are only part time treehuggers!\n\nMuch better than Destroyer of Worlds, this is sure to please diehard Bathory fans, but newcomers should probably start with Hammerheart or another of the classics. In any case, if you're thinking of taking the plunge, I suggest that you give this album some time before deciding if you like it or not.\n\nThe second (and final?) disc of the Nordland saga is already available. I have not heard it yet, but I've heard good things about it. Supposedly the two combined are stronger than the sum of their parts. This demands investigation I suppose....\n\nOriginally posted at: www.musiquemachine.com\n",
        "\nThere\u2019s something about the frosty landscapes and dark horizons of Scandinavian metal, of any style or persuasion that tantalizes the minds of esoteric listeners. However, the origins of what would later become a highly artful and complex sub-genre started off as most prototypes tend to, a simplistic and profane exercise in sheer rebellion against established sensibilities. While many occult obsessed early metal bands from Sabbat to Venom and also Mercyful Fate were onto this idea pretty early in the game, Bathory\u2019s early work is where a true extreme was discovered. Early Sodom, Slayer and Destruction could also be pointed to as culprits in the development of the style, but if a clear line is to be drawn, Quorthon\u2019s wicked opening trilogy shows the most clarity of succession from heavy metal to what was heard in Norway and a few other countries in the early 90s, and perhaps also to an extent some of the more mystical sounding death metal bands of the late 80s.\n\nIn contrast to the debut, where the riff set was still largely infused by NWOBHM orthodoxy and a slight helping of punk rock sensibilities, \u201cThe Return\u2026..\u201d paints a much bleaker sonic reality that takes into account the switch in conventional thinking that occurred on \u201cRide The Lightning\u201d and \u201cHaunting The Chapel\u201d, albeit with the same lo-fi, frosty production where fuzz still trumps posh. Many of these songs have a chaotic nature to them, fed in part by a deeper and heavier riff set, that all but predicts the blazing mayhem that would typify the extreme fringes of thrash metal from 1986-87, while still maintaining a very barebones approach of a simple handful of ideas and the same frenzied soloing style that merges the melodic tendencies of metal with the sloppiness of more shred-happy punk soloists. It\u2019s very easy to see where Nocturno Culto and Abbath got their noise driven, frenetic lead style from when listening to this, right down to roughly the same overall character of the guitar distortion.\n\nWhile quite revolutionary for 1985, this is an album that is pretty formulaic in nature, and largely builds upon the existing template of the first album. Along with beginning and ending with predictably creepy ambient tracks that reek of early 80s horror movie worship, most of these songs generally follow strict structural standards that is far more primitive than what most thrash bands were dabbling with by this point. Nevertheless, \u201cTotal Destruction\u201d, \u201cPossessed\u201d and \u201cSadist\u201d captures, in a more basic fashion, a sense of murky darkness fit for the cannibalistic undead. And even amongst the more mid-paced thrash sounding numbers such as \u201cBorn For Burning\u201d and \u201cThe Rite Of Darkness\u201d, the mood doesn\u2019t get much brighter than the doom and gloom of a typical Hellhammer tune. But in terms of an out and out memorable song that will please just about everyone, the catchy yet wildly speedy \u201cThe Return Of Darkness And Evil\u201d is a metallic celebration fit for any thrash fan.\n\nFor 1985, this is among the most ugly yet beautiful piece of filthy, blackened brilliance to be put together, and is rivaled chiefly by what preceded and what followed by the same band. It\u2019s an almost perfect manifesto for just about every straight up, non-hyphenated album under the black metal moniker to be released. What it lacks in theatrics (something that would be addressed on the next album), it makes up for in sheer, unfettered aggression. By today\u2019s standards, it comes off as archaic and still heavily bound by pre-death metal practices, but it\u2019s difficult to imagine how something like this came across at the height of glam rock\u2019s reign on the airwaves. For any black or thrash metal enthusiast, historically oriented or otherwise, this is a must have.\n",
        "\nWith \u2018Blood Fire Death\u2019, Bathory marked the beginning of a new era and marked the arrival of a new genre - Viking metal. Although it may sound ridiculous, this genre, one which merges with the finer aspects of black metal, was very strong in its heyday. When it comes to finding a finer Viking metal band on Earth, only acts like Enslaved can compete with the gloriousness that is Bathory, spearheaded by the late-and-great Tomas Forsberg, also known as Quorthon. \u2018Blood Fire Death\u2019, as the title of my review for it suggests, isn\u2019t my favourite Bathory album but by heck is it still fantastic. Although only a mere two years had passed since \u2018Blood Fire Death\u2019 (1988) was released, there are some notable changes on \u2018Hammerheart\u2019 (1990) and it\u2019s in these very changes that marks Bathory\u2019s step-up from greatness to Godliness. Some of the changes were already being placed in motion on the fourth full-length, \u2018Blood Fire Death\u2019, but they were now in full swing in the Spring of 1990, a fitting season for Bathory to be reborn again within a new sub-genre.\n\nIt\u2019s a tussle between this album, \u2018Hammerheart\u2019 and \u2018Twilight of the Gods\u2019, an album which only came out a year after the former, as to which is my favourite from the Swedish godfather of Viking metal. Although neither are flawless, they come pretty damn close, in my humble opinion. Judging by the material on \u2018Blood Fire Death\u2019, it\u2019s easy to see how Bathory evolved from one moment to the next. As I said, there are traits to this album which can be seen on the aforementioned full-length and vice versa. However, I tend to feel those few differences between the two make all the difference when it comes to finding a definitive winner within Bathory\u2019s discography. The production, for instance, seems a lot stronger on \u2018Hammerheart\u2019. The 1988 full-length is a lot gruffer and rawer in its approach, though that isn\u2019t to say that this album doesn\u2019t embrace distortion and feedback from the powerful guitars. The drums are just as stern, too. They provide a back-up power source to the guitars, which are generally central to the album.\n\nThe production seems more accessible to me here than it did on the previous album although much of Bathory\u2019s acoustic work and such on \u2018Blood Fire Death\u2019 tended to feature during the slower, more fragmented passages in songs, whereas they not spring up all over the place and manage to fit in seamlessly no matter how the production is affecting the atmosphere. \u2018Valhalla\u2019 is a good example of this. The song opens with an acoustic guitar alongside an electric guitar which is giving off a lot of distortion and feedback. Despite the fact that the acoustics have strong and prideful synths to compete with, too, they\u2019re never overshadowed and use the full width of their appeal to draw the listener in time and again. I do tend to feel that \u2018Twilight of the Gods\u2019 has a better use of acoustics but this album isn\u2019t half bad either when it comes to the song writing and song structure aspects. Each song contains its own moments of glory and longevity within the mind, whereas \u2018Blood Fire Death\u2019 certainly had one or two forgettable songs amidst some truly gigantic one\u2019s like the self-titled track, or \u2018A Fine Day to Die\u2019, for example. \n\nWhereas that album featured only two or three truly mammoth songs, this album has several more, including the likes of \u2018Valhalla\u2019, which is one of many to feature a strong use of layered vocal approaches, including Quorthon\u2019s typically gruff style. The use of cleanly chanted vocals isn\u2019t exactly sparse but they\u2019re certainly use sparingly, although always enough to satisfy the listeners needs and wants whilst maintaining a level of desire within them that leaves them craving for more, as shown on songs like \u2018Baptised in Fire and Ice\u2019, a truly wonderful song which mixes the various vocal approaches well, tending to use the cleaner background chants more so than most other songs, though not shying away from the usual gruff approach, one which resonates within me and makes me think of courage, pride and a true belief in the nature of the mythological inspired lyrics. Having said that, \u2018Twilight of the Gods\u2019 is certainly better equipped than the two albums before it at using profound imagery through the evocative lyrics, though it cannot be argued that the imagery on this album and the one previous to it are sheepish or underwhelming because that isn\u2019t the case.\n\nI have never listened to an album or an artist until I found Bathory whereby I felt the lyrics were extremely important despite the fact that I cannot relate to them on an emotional level or because I have been through the exact same experience that the singer is singing about but that is the case here and especially on the next album. The lyrics are truly evocative, sparking endless streams of images of mythological creatures, landscapes and riding into battle over blood soaked grounds. The brilliant \u2018One Rode to Asa Bay\u2019 is, in particular, a true highlight of this and the album. The samples at the beginning of the track meld so well into the overall story of the song and indeed the album. The structures to each song, in fact, are so well thought out and magically crafted together with supreme talent. Even the artwork seems well thought out and fits in so well with the lyrics to the aforementioned song, one that stands up as one of Bathory\u2019s best. As with most of the songs on the album, it\u2019s full of melodies and a general infectious catchiness which is unheard of in Bathory\u2019s early days. As per usual, this is a fantastic Viking metal album.\n",
        "\nI won\u2019t delve too deep into the history of either Bathory or the sorely missed Tomas Forsberg, also known as Quorthon. An innovative in every sense, Quorthon inspired and pioneered in the early days. Not only did he have a hand in shaping black metal but he also forged a genre now known as Viking metal. The respect for Quorthon will run deep as long as metal is alive and, I daresay, even after its death. In terms of his discography with Bathory, it\u2019s hard to pick out a defining moment, although many will argue that \u2018Blood Fire Death\u2019 is his grand opus, the album which immortalised his name forever. Personally, although I\u2019ve grown to adore, love and treasure this album, his fourth and first steps into Viking metal, I\u2019ve recently come to the conclusion that I prefer \u2018Hammerheart\u2019, his fifth full-length and second journey into the land of Vikings. However, although this may be true, my initial disappointment with this album has turned into deep admiration and a sense of longing to hear something even remotely close to its godliness.\n\nEven the introductory song, \u2018Odens Ride Over Nordland\u2019 sends shivers down my spine. When dealing with a so-called classic, I find it very easy to become underwhelmed by the levels of expectation I put on the shoulders of a release. For example, although unrelated musically, their stories are similar - Slowdive. This is a band I once thought were overrated but, ever since my expectations were lowered and I knew what I was going to hear the second time round, after many months of having left the dust to settle, I was blown away. The exact same thing happened with Bathory\u2019s \u2018Blood Fire Death\u2019 and, hopefully, in time, the same will happen with Bathory\u2019s original black metal trilogy, a series of albums I\u2019ve yet to grow to appreciate. The time for the Viking series of albums has come and albums like \u2018Blood Fire Death\u2019 are arising to meet with their fate of being labelled some of the best in the industry, as they truly deserve to be. \n\nWith Bathory\u2019s original trilogy of history making black metal albums, I could never get into the shorter compositions. Although this album only has three songs I\u2019d consider \u201clong\u201d, it feels, in general, more thought out and has a better style of writing. Bathory\u2019s self-titled, for example, feels somewhat rushed to me. I appreciate the innovation of it, but I could never truly feel for the songs or the atmosphere the way I do with this archaic sounding masterpiece. This also explains why I prefer \u2018Hammerheart\u2019 to this particular album. The compositions are longer, leaving more time for variation and wonderful dynamics to become involved. Most, if not all, of the songs on that particular album are terrific at dealing with longer lengths. This album also deals better with longer time frames than it does short. For example, \u2018A Fine Day To Die\u2019 is a Bathory classic. At over eight minutes long, it feels worthwhile. The build-up, the middle and the ending are perfected through the use of multiple changes and craftsmanship. Some songs, like the self-titled, also deal with subtle synths, which I particularly enjoyed. They\u2019re not overbearing and don\u2019t have a lessened impact due to the incredible guitar work. They\u2019re just right.\n\nSongs like \u2018The Golden Walls of Heaven\u2019 however, feel pressed for time. As if they\u2019re rushing their way through in anticipation for the next big song, the mammoth self-titled song, \u2018Blood Fire Death\u2019. Songs like the former are adept at what they do but they don\u2019t have the same feeling, or inspire in the same way that the masterful longer songs do. The shorter songs tend to stick to one tempo and proceed with it until the very end whereas the longer songs are more willing to chop and change dynamics, which makes them far more exciting in terms of the story they tell, which is one of bloodied battles, dismantling armies and destroying regimes. The artwork, accompanied by the instrumentation, is sublime. I often feel that the music should elaborate on the artwork and this is precisely what the instrumentation here does and really well, too. That\u2019s probably why I don\u2019t have as much problem with shorter songs on albums like this because, as with the brooding \u2018Pace\u2019 Till Death\u2019, the shorter songs build images in my head of how fragile life is, how quickly a life can end and the destruction caused by man on his fellow man.\n\nThere\u2019s something very spiritual about the longer songs, in particular, I find. They\u2019re much slower, very drawn out but in a good way. They deal, in my opinion, primarily with the long nature of war. How tiresome it is and how cyclical by using occasional repetition and strong, shrieked vocals, though he has the ability to alter the vocals on occasions to more of a harsh, raspy scream. The solos of each and every song are well handled and mixed in with the other instrumentation well. Each song tends to feature superb layers so you\u2019re always mindful that several things are occurring at once and the detail is incredible, despite how grimy the production may feel, everything is audible and easily accessible to the listener. The production is something I found quite surprising, in fact. I thought it might be a bit thin but it isn\u2019t. It suitably portrays the story of the album and does a great job of highlighting the elements which are only sparsely used but have a great affect on the album, as shown on the self-titled song in the beginning with the acoustics and synths. The drums, even, on this song are somewhat different but treated well by the production. Despite not being too knowledgeable about Bathory or Quorthon\u2019s history, I still find it easy to love almost everything about this album.\n",
        "\nScandinavian Metal Attack is a five band split featuring uprising (at the time) artist from, where else, Scandinavia. One of the bands featured on Scandinavian Metal Attack is Bathory, which was more than enough to make me check this out, and I\u2019m glad I did for this is one amazing split. \n\nThe Bathory side is by far my favorite side of Scandinavian Metal Attack. The first track, \u201cSacrifice\u201d, is Venom worship with an intro riff that sounds similar to something from Mot\u00f6rhead. \u201cThe Return of Darkness and Evil\u201d is different from the version on The Return...with the version on Scandinavian Metal Attack being a bit slower in tempo. The riffs have more of a speed metal influence to them instead of a black metal influence that would be later Bathory. The production on the Bathory side is actual better than the production on the debut album, with the drums being more audible and the riffs more distinct from each other.\n\nOz play very fast, fun, and catchy metal that is closer to hard rock in the line of Kiss. Their vocalist Tapani Anselm is really impressive. He doesn\u2019t sound like anyone I've heard before with his deep voice that bounces everywhere and insanely catchy choruses. \u201cFire in the Brain\u201d is loaded with fast melodic riffs and has the catchiest choruses on Scandinavian Metal Attack. The other track, \u201cSearch Lights\u201d, is full of fast melodic riffs also, but it\u2019s not as memorable due to it not having catchy choruses. \n\nTrash play simple hard rock with some catchy riffs and great drumming. \u201cWatch Out\u201d is great with its catchy intro riff, hammering drums, and cool bridge section. \u201cNo More Rock Tonight\u201d isn\u2019t that good however, and its probably the worst track on Scandinavian Metal Attack. The track is too repetitive for my liking; a rather uninspired riff played over and over with Tony Hellander not sounding as good as he does on \u201cWatch Out\u201d. His high notes are unpleasant and it\u2019s annoying to listen to him screaming at the top of his lungs. The Trash material sounds the loudest of all and have the best production job out of all five acts. The hammering snare drum and fiercely hit cymbals are always heard, with Tony Hellander and his Rob Halford-like shrieks drowning everything out. It\u2019s a bit of a disappointment how Trash could write something like \u201cWatch Out\u201d (one of the best on here), but then write something like \u201cNo More Rock Tonight.\u201d \n\nSpitfire didn\u2019t go anywhere or even release an album. I think the band broke up right after Scandinavian Metal Attack was released. Anyway, \u201cEyes of Storm\u201d starts out like a ballad with a calming guitar and rather unremarkable vocals. After the ballad part is over the track gets better with its '80s groove, heavy riffs, and energetic vocals. You can clearly tell that he has no experience whatsoever on vocals, yet he doesn\u2019t sound terrible. He has an average range, mostly hitting high notes, and other than the into of \u201cEyes of Storm\u201d he\u2019s quite good. \u201cCrazy Living\u201d is more of the same only without the ballad intro and Kimmo Morja is screaming like a maniac throughout. \n\nZero Nine are one of the first heavy metal bands from Finland. Zero Nine have some catchy riffs like the one on \u201cUnder the Sun\u201d. The problem is that Zero Nine do not have that great of a vocalist. Kepa Salmirinne is the worst vocalist out of the bunch. His range is limited and sounds monotonous with the exception coming from the chorus on \u201cRock Away\u201d. The drums are also bothersome with a bass drum sounding weak and the quiet snare being an annoyance also. There is a bit of groove in their sound, especially in the bass work. This helps Zero Nine out because it makes Zero Nine easiest to listen and get into. \n\nScandinavian Metal Attack is a great split with all five bands playing excellent heavy metal. Every track is great with the exception being \u201cNo More Rock Tonight\u201d. This split is highly recommended and is worth everyone's time to check out.\n",
        "\nWith a discography as extensive as Quorthon\u2019s, it is easy for certain releases to overshadow others, especially when the quality of his material is as incredible as it is. Now, while it is undeniable that Blood Fire Death, Hammerheart and Twilight of the Gods are all absolute masterpieces, I feel that Nordland II, the final chapter of Quorthon\u2019s legacy, deserves far more recognition than it receives because it is honestly just about flawless. Following much the same direction as part I of the Nordland saga, this hour long epic crowns one of metal\u2019s most important and influential figure\u2019s legendary career, featuring some of Bathory\u2019s finest material ever written. \n\nLike its predecessor, Nordland II is a thunderous return back to the epic viking metal sound of mid-era Bathory, but only better. The song-writing is simply masterful, displaying a true sense of wisdom and maturity through nine magnificent compositions, which is complimented by Quorthon\u2019s genius lyrical musings, that transport you right into the middle of a bloody battle raging on across a barren, permafrost laden plain, all taking place underneath an ominous, swirling vortex of black and grey, with the occasional fork of lightning piercing through the clouds and illuminating the sky. The music itself is to a similar effect, with the combination of Quorthon\u2019s riffing, lead and keyboard work all predominantly accompanied by a steady, mid-paced beat conjuring a mental image of charging into battle along side your fellow warriors, with shield in hand and sword at the ready. It is the way the riffs and melodies just feel like they are marching into battle themselves as well as possessing this warlike conviction, which makes this album so damn spectacular and just so majestic. Channeling Bathory\u2019s more thrash orientated material, \u201cDeath and Resurrection of a Northern Son\u201d however, shows that Quorthon has not completely ditched the furious pace of his early and mid-90\u2019s records, opening up with a fast, pummelling barrage of double-bass and thick, gritty tremolo picking which continues on right throughout the verse. This ferocious assault though, is short-lived, as we are soon greeted with soaring leads and epic keyboard choirs which make for a climatic build-up into the second verse, which is slightly disappointing as the verses are pretty average both instrumentally and vocally compared to the rest of the song, and is actually the album\u2019s weakest moment. \n\nThe following track \u201cThe Messenger\u201d however, is absolutely flawless, and one of the stand-outs on the album. Once again, an elevating keyboard and guitar melody kick off the song, accompanied by the sound of the wind howling through the air, which soon explodes into a herd of storming power chords rolling across a field along side a troop of thundering horses galloping into the distance. At 10 minutes in length, this phenomenal track is one of the longest songs on the album, together with \u201cThe Wheel of Sun\u201d which clocks in at just over 12 minutes. Plodding along at a much slower tempo, this epic album closer flows much smoother, with Quorthon churning out walls of slower, sustained chord progressions, as well as two conquering guitar solos full of soaring string slides, pulls and bends as well as blazing shredding runs, which also make appearances in \u201cBlooded Shore,\u201d \u201cSea Wolf\u201d and \u201cThe Land,\u201d and are all just loaded with a tonne of pure, emotional energy. Quorthon\u2019s vocals are also just packed with loads of raw energy, utilizing a combination of aggressive, yet brilliantly executed singing, the occasional full-fledged scream and almost archaic sounding chanting, which are all usually accompanied by beautiful back-up choirs. Overall, Quorthon\u2019s vocal performance from a technical standpoint is the best of his career despite a few shaky passages, with his voice sounding better than it ever has and just booming with confidence and maximum energy. \n\nDriving the songs forward towards the horizon with a valiant force, the drums further compliment Quorthon\u2019s mighty guitar and vocal performances, and while they are relatively simplistic consisting of fairly basic beats and patterns with minimal fills, they are still immensely powerful and work with the music exceptionally. Production wise, they\u2019re not perfect, but I don\u2019t feel this is to the album\u2019s disadvantage in any way, and actually adds to its overall charm. The heavily distorted, fuzzy tone of the guitar and gritty bass tone initially didn\u2019t sit to well with me though, but, after a few listens I had no problem with them, as every last instrumental nuance just blends together perfectly. From the epic keyboard droning opening the album in \u201cFanfare,\u201d to the pan flute synth melody that kicks off \u201cSea Wolf\u201d or the soft, atmospheric build up in \u201cDeath and Resurrection of a Northern Son,\u201d as well Quorthon\u2019s extraordinary vocals, everything just comes together as one charging, triumphant mass of pure brilliance and majesty.\n\nWhile it doesn\u2019t quite match up to the almost unparalleled magnificence of Blood Fire Death, Hammerheart or Twilight of the Gods, this phenomenal record is certainly still worthy of any metal fan\u2019s attention, and is a grand testament to one of the most legendary musicians to ever grace this planet.\n",
        "\nAnd so it would happen, in 1988, that Quorthon would transition from the primal black chaos of his first three works (all pretty fine by their own rights), into the mightiest epic of his career. Blood Fire Death is the first Viking metal-themed work of note since Led Zeppelin's immortal \"Immigrant Song\", and remains to me the very highest watermark by which all other works of its kind must eventually be compared. With the exception of Enslaved (who have also written several masterpieces, though usually with a different, complex progression to them), no other band can really stress the point of 'Vikinghood' quite like this one. This album arrived alongside the top crop of the best overall year in metal history, and thousands of bands have been trying to live up to it since.\n\nI'll note here that despite the larger, epic structure of its tracks, Quorthon retained a lot of what made his earlier albums so ripe...so vibrantly destructive and misanthropic. He has simply merged that furor with a lyrical hierarchy that means enough to him that he would continue to trace it through the remainder of his career as Bathory. But his later success would be limited...some of the works like Hammerheart, Twilight of the Gods, Blood on Ice, and Destroyer of Worlds were worthwhile, but I felt that his insistence on the cleaner, shaky vocals and ever increasing use of acoustics provided them all with an inconsistent quality. However, not the case for Blood Fire Death, which walks a straight and true path of belligerent savagery and and kicks your ass again and again for 9 tracks and 45 minutes.\n\nIt does not kick your ass with metal alone, as the intro piece \"Oden's Ride Over Nordland\" proves, a stunning three minute intro of thundering horses and epic choirs that hover below a gathering storm structure, gray and black clouds penetrated by the light of the suncross and the wisdom of the Father's sole, gazing eye. The track flows nicely into the acoustics that introduce \"A Fine Day to Die\", Quorthon adding subtle vocal flavors, and then at 1:45, all fucking hell breaks loose...and we all welcome our doom. Prepare your soul, my friends, because this is THE END. Fight or flight! Vvornth's crashing kit exclaims the immortality of the riffing to follow, and the guitars grind you into a mid-paced paradise where Valhalla calls every wayward man of honor to crush the fucking skulls of his enemies. The vocals are sick, tortured and 100% authentic gleanings into the genius that, for a brief period of years, possessed this man. The track is just over 8 and a half minutes of bewildering punishment, slowly churning along like a juggernaught of axes and screaming that cannot die until the deed is done. \"The Golden Walls of Heaven\" follows, and Quorthon shows that he has not abandoned the speed of his previous works, as this is a vicious and brutal punishment which channels early Kreator and Sodom-like speed/thrash into the bowels of Asgardian lore.\n\n'Soundless wings lacerate the night\nAngels of death emerge accross the sky\nThorned heads spiky limbs climb the air up high\nAttack of the pearly gates\nNow wait for the sign...'\n\nNot convinced? Then the mean, crushing rhythm of \"Pace 'Till Death\" shall quell all doubts, an hymn of destruction that once more takes the brutal German thrashing roots to the fullest extent as it helps usher in the age of barbaric black metal. Noisy and unforgiving, with messy, hack leads and a scorching, thunderous end. \"Holocaust\" is another neck breaking tribute to the insanity of warfare, and once again it bears the heavily influence of insane Euro speed/thrash, with guitars so thick on acid and high on blood that you probably should be deaf after hearing them. More streaming, turbulent leads which go nowhere (except straight through my heart), and more cancerous, raw power! \"For All Those Who Died\" brings it back down a notch to a deadly, mid-paced battering. The way the chords ring out over the surging bass of Kothaar and the simple, stick and bash drumming is beautiful, and Quorthon again poisons the masses with the savage lamentations of his cruelty. The song is a steady five minutes of rocking, the only climax the heightened slamming of the drums over the noisy distorted rumblings in the end.\n\n'Burning naked but smiling\nNot full of fear but pride\nKnowing death alone could cleanse them\nOf the reasons for which they all die'\n\n\"Dies Irae\" claims all your remaining lifebreath, ramming it back down your throat with a mailed fist of frost. The song is so fucking heavy that I feel like, even 20 years hence, it slowly peels off the dead cell layers of my skin with only implied, psychokinetic frost and fire. Gods, what a headache! What a beautiful, lummox of wrath and pain. And the breakdown is viler and more penetrating than an einherjer receiving the blessing of Sif between his thighs. At this point, the album is already one of the most brutal and effective metal works I've ever heard, and yet...it's not over yet. THE BEST IS YET TO COME. And it comes in the form of the title track, 10:30 of classic, immortal riffing and atmosphere that anyone worth his weight in sea salt could live and die by. The track is truly immense...the riff at 1:00 is the best 'Viking' metal riff ever written in history, so strong that I get the shivers running through my head and spine just hearing it. The way the keyboards glint above it, and Quorthon's vocals summon both the chaos of Loki and Ragnarok and the primal chaos beyond the destiny of all mankind. The bridge is even more glorious, with the vocals taking on a grim majesty, a king dethroned, a dying and rising soul. The extensive bridge of this epic breaks for some acoustics, and some surging thrash rhythms that march across the battering of the drums. There is also an outro piece which breathes like wind and thunder, but you will hardly care, because you have just been leveled and brought to your knees. What could be left of you?\n\nBlood Fire Death is staggering. When I first heard it, I simply could not fucking believe it. I was just starting high school that year, and had to bring it in to school the day after I got the cassette, to let all the poseurs know the latest herald of their apocalypse. I may very well have transformed a half dozen glamboyant hairspray chuggers that day, and frightened away another score or more. This was something new...something savage and carnal and yet emotionally impactful. This album is a mountain. It will not move. It escalates from track to track. You can erode it with age, but its imprint will always remain, in the ground soil and dust and memory. It's mandatory listening, whether you enjoy black metal, thrash or speed metal, or Viking/folk metal. And if you've not heard it, I will arrive at your doorstep, beaten cassette in hand, one eye burning directly into you.\n\nHighlights: The first 45:43 of the album. The final 45:43 of the album.\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nHow does a band follow four fantastic albums in a row; four albums that helped to give birth to a new and extreme metal subgenre? By putting out a fifth fantastic album that gives birth to a second metal subgenre. Both viking and black metal can trace their roots to Bathory (and others of course). With Blood Fire Death, Bathory continued to push the boundaries of metal into new territories and obviously Quorthon had no intention of stopping there.\n\nWhat we see with Hammerheart is a shift of gears in the Bathory machine. Expanding on ideas heard on Blood Fire Death, Hammerheart brings us an entirely new sound and style from one of heavy metal\u2019s most important bands. Gone are the songs and imagery of Satan, the thrashing ugly riffs and the raspy, inhuman vocals of Quorthon. With Hammerheart we hear clean, crooning vocals, simplistic song structure, repetitive riffs and entrancing synth. We see a band that has dropped the fire breathing and traded it in for broadswords and a viking image\u2014and it works. Bathory present us with a truly tasteful treat. Laced in Scandinavian mythology, Hammerheart sets sail with \u2018Shores in Flames\u2019. The sounds of ocean waves flood out of the speakers accompanied by a calm and simple riff and nicely done clean vocals on Quorthon\u2019s part. It\u2019s a song you can get absolutely lost in and see yourself on a longship on the ocean\u2014it\u2019s a great start to a great album and one of the strongest tracks. Other highlights are the soaring tunes \u2018Home of Once Brave\u2019 and \u2018One Rode to Asa Bay\u2019. The riffs are simplistic and repetitive, giving the album a somewhat hypnotic quality and that, combined with the well-used synth and Quorthon\u2019s crooning, will have you flying high over a lost world. Quorthon\u2019s vocals are far from what many think of amazing on this record, but they work perfectly with the music presented. If you were to have had someone like say, ICS Vortex or Vintersorg on this record, it would not have been nearly as powerful in my opinion.\n\nThere are no clunkers to be found on this record. I think that the weakest tracks to be found here are \u2018Baptized in Fire and Ice\u2019 and \u2018Valhalla\u2019 and that says something because both of those songs are great. As much as I love the first four Bathory albums, Hammerheart continues to be my favorite and is in heavy rotation in the autumn and winter months of the year. This record is highly recommended to any fan of black, folk or viking metal that has not heard it and is, in my opinion, one of the greatest heavy metal records of all time. You\u2019ll get swept away in it\u2014of this I have no doubt.\n",
        "\nWhen it comes to knowing which to listen to between Bathory mid 90's thrash metal material, \"Requiem\" is the obvious choice. This is because \"Requiem\" still has a blackened feel to the mainly thrash metal sound still that has more in style with Bathory's sound in general than the Pantera-wannabe bullshit that was a pile of dog shit album \"Octagon\".\n\nFirst off, you know it's Quorthon singing, because on \"Reqiuem\" is actually SOUNDS like Quorthon with his trademark evil vocals, rather than some dickhead who wanted to sound like a bad Dave Mustaine/hardcore punk singer. So again, at least we know it's Quorthon singing. Second the music is actually a damn good blackened thrash sound that is more old-school Destruction, and early Kreator and eerily resembles South American death/thrash. Oh there are riffs and plenty. Not to mention the sound production is very raw, yet warm sounding and you can actually hear the bass. Drums have a very underproduced sound, but this actually adds to the black metal influenced sound.\n\nThe first 3 songs are fast and will induced some air drumming, or air guitar worship, whichever your preference is. Also some cool song titles like \"Necroticus\" and \"War Machine\" seem like a throw back to 80's metal cheese. Also, the song \"War Machine\" is fucking excellent. It's a mid-tempo thrasher that has a nice head-bangable main riff and an excellent guitar solo. \"Blood And Soil\", Quorthon sounds like a rabid dying dog about to rip your fucking head off. \"Pax Vobsicum\"...Quorthon nails the basic thrash metal riff. The last 3 songs are in the same style and don't differ at all. Last but not least the lyrics are cheesy, but there are a few lines which deserve mentioning such as ;\n\n\"how the bitch is cut wide open from her cunt to her throat\" - Apocalypse\n\n\"The altar covered in lifegiving cum, \nthe smell of forever running wet cunts\" - Blood And Soil (I don't know what he's talking about, but it's hilarious)\n\nBottom line, I can see myself listening to this album from time and time again. It's very enjoyable. For thrash metal-era of Bathory, stay the fuck away from \"Octagon\" and listen to this instead.\n",
        "\nYou see an album with good, interesting artwork and you think to yourself \"Hey, maybe this isn't as bad as I may think. Maybe there is something worth listening to.\"\n\nNo. Not on \"Octagon.\u201d It's a trap. It lures the listener with a cool fucking front cover of a chaos star/pentagram drawn in blood on some blue stone and it exposes them to some of the worst retro 90's thrash you can imagine. I mean, I can expect this kind of shitty wannabe-thrash from a band like Chimaira on Roadrunner who took all the groove out of their music and wanted to attempt at thrash. I can expect Pantera trying their hardest to even make-up for releasing \"Reinventing The Steel\". Hell, I even expect modern-day Exodus for releasing this and having their record label hype the piece of shit up at the best thrash metal album ever even though that have hyped up every Exodus release since \"Pleasures Of The Flesh\" as the best thrash metal album of all time. But for Quorthon, this album comes off as nothing more than a cash-in on shitty fucking thrash metal.\n\nThe production is dry. It's clear but it's just dry. No bass. The drums can barely be heard. The guitars? Fuck that shitty guitar tone. It's so fucking stock-sounding. Everything about the sound production and style is just pure shit. I can express how goddamn awful it just enrages me to the point of nausea and headache. And let's not go into the lyrics. I mean Quorthon is no Shakespeare but goddamn bro....YOU'RE NOT 16 YEARS OLD. You're a fully grown adult. I mean just look at these lines;\n\n\"Conservatism. Communism. Paganism. Nationalsocialism \nLiberalism. Satanism. Christianity. Slavery. Anarchy. Lunacy. \nInsanity. Mediocracy. Assorted Century.\" - Century\n\n\"Authority. Society. Parents. Teachers. Employees and God. \nAuthority. Society. Parents. Teachers. Employees and God. \nFade into grey. Fade into grey. Fade into grey.\" - Grey\n\nand finally the coup de' grace;\n\n\"Drink my cum. Take my rum. \nBlooded hole. Twisted soul. \nEat my shit. Suck my dick. \" - 33 Something\n\nThe songs range from wannabe-Dark Angel to wannabe Hardcore Punk in the way Pantera covered Poison Idea. More or less Corrosion of Conformity minus the Slayer riffs....wait, there are a lot of bad Slayer riffs that...god, what or who the fuck am I trying to explain this to? It's just really HORRIBLE fucking music. But beyond all that I have painfully described, the worst part of \"Octagon\" is Quorthon's vocals. Quorthon's vocals is a sign of a man who desperately wants his fame back and it trying to be cool with the kids in 1995, but unfortunately for him, nobody told him that grunge and alternaive was what the kids were banging then. And even in the extreme metal underground in 1995, the very music he helped created had already progressed to violent extremes and was on the beginning of a third wave of artists who were about to take black metal even further. The song titles themselves are fucking pointless; \"Schizianity\"??? Hey Quorthon, you may try to bash Christianity, but Trouble never had trouble coming up with material. Not to mention your attempt at trying to sound like fucking Dave Mustaine/ doesn't help. \n\nOh and a KISS cover? Fuck you Quorthon. That's all there is to say.\n\nI cannot name one decent track on this album. Yeah it's that terrible. If you are a fan of Lamb of God, Chimaria, newer Exodus, or newer bands that are passed off as Thrash, you may like this....otherwise avoid this piece of shit album like an Egyptian plague.\n",
        "\nIn 1988, Quorthon had originally recorded songs that are now available on the album Blood on Ice. He was originally going to release those songs but decided that the change would be a bit too drastic\u2026 so he recorded Blood Fire Death instead.\n\nAnd what a good move that was! I like Blood on Ice and all of his other Viking metal albums a lot, but it would have been a real shame to miss out this! This album is widely regarded as the first Viking metal album ever, but in reality only 2 songs on here (3 if you count the intro) could be considered Viking metal. The rest of the album is balls-to-the-wall, poser-killing thrash. Seriously, most songs here wouldn\u2019t sound out of place on Darkness Descends. Just like on Darkness Descends, the thrashers here sound like they\u2019re building up to a musical armageddon. That armageddon manifests in the form of solos (\u201cThe Golden Walls of Heaven\u201d has 3 of \u2018em, which is perfectly appropriate in a song about destroying such a holy place). These songs aren\u2019t \u201cpure\u201d thrash; they have blackened tinges, courtesy of Quorthon\u2019s venomous vocals. But the sound is less lo-fi than typical black metal; the guitars have a lot more bottom end than Bathory\u2019s previous works.\n\n\u201cThe Golden Walls of Heaven,\u201d \u201cPace \u2018Til Death,\u201d \u201cHolocaust,\u201d and \u201cDies Irae\u201d all fit into the thrash-till-death category. My favorite of the four would probably have to be \u201cGolden Walls.\u201d It just sounds so relentless, especially at 1:19. The atmosphere just keeps building and building. It sounds like there's 4 guitars playing at once. Absolutely awesome.\n\n\u201cFor Those Who Died\u201d is kind of a midpaced thrash song. It plods along with not much creativity in the riff department, clearly the worst (or should I say \u201cleast awesome\u201d) song on the album. A funny thing happens at the beginning of the song: the guitar plays a riff for a little bit and when the bass comes in, it\u2019s so loud that it produces a loud distorted scratch for a second. I\u2019m glad to see that Quorthon left the flaw in the record anyway. Quorthon didn\u2019t let better production get to his head. Most modern bands would have taken that error out with ProTools or some other shit like that.\n\nNow for this album\u2019s claim to fame, Viking metal. To start off, we have a 3-minute intro. I see a number of people on this site panning intros, but I can assure everyone here that this intro isn\u2019t like most. It has atmosphere up the ass. I feel like Oden is actually flying across the sky when I hear this one. From the start we get to hear cool sound effects of horses whinnying and battle fog moving in. It builds up to perfection with a choir and synth. This fuckin thing still gives me goosebumps when I hear it. Quorthon couldn\u2019t start this album off any better.\n\nThen we are treated to more epic goodness with the first proper song: \u201cA Fine Day to Die.\u201d It\u2019s slow and bludgeoning. The beat is similar to that of a marching army. Stretch this song out for a couple hours and you have an instant soundtrack to the movie 300. The final Viking song is the title track, quite similar to \u201cA Fine Day to Die,\u201d very epic, long, and heavy. An important thing to mention is that on this song Quorthon tries clean vocals for the first time! He doesn\u2019t use much range, since he was just starting to sing at this point. But I\u2019d much rather hear Quorthon pace himself than try too hard (*cough* Twilight of the Gods). These two songs were some of the first tracks to take black metal and slow it down, add more melody, and give it a lyrical overhaul to depict Norse warriors. \n\nFinally, there\u2019s another one of Quorthon\u2019s absolutely pointless outros to end the record. It\u2019s a minute of a beating drum, a blowing wind, and a chant that doesn\u2019t change pitch once. Thankfully he would abandon this tradition after the next album!\n\nTransitional albums are great. The Beatles had Rubber Soul. Slayer had Hell Awaits. Motorhead had Bomber. Death had Spiritual Healing. Kreator had Terrible Certainty. And Bathory had Blood Fire Death. All these albums marked a paradigm shift from one classic sound to another. Quorthon ended up pioneering two different genres of metal, and he bridged the gap with this album. It is an outstanding record that should be in the collections of anybody who likes thrash, black, folk, or Viking metal.\n",
        "\nIt seems that Quorthon tires of one style and moves onto another rather quickly: with the first two black metal albums, the new two being an introduction to the Viking themes (and slowly losing the Satanic influences in favor for Norse mythology), the fifth and sixth albums being unadulterated Viking metal classics, and the next album being a somewhat overrated \"return to form\", Octagon tends to get little to no respect, and I really can't understand why.\n\nThis is raw, ugly and dirty blackened thrash, plain and simple. Anyone who would expect Quorthon to sit still and continue to ride out any of his eras for any limited time would be foolish.\n\nFirst, let me say that while the production is dirty, it is very listenable. You can decipher everything that's going on, so this shouldn't be a complaint.\n\nIt seems that a lot of people would've loved for Quorthon to continue on the Viking theme, but as a musician, I believe he was prone to low attention levels at times, and this is proof of it. If anyone was hoping for the quality of Hammerheart or Twilight of the Gods, you're going to have to wait until the epic Blood on Ice and the Nordland releases.\n\nBut, the change in style doesn't make this a horrible release - on the contrary, it comes off as a breath of fresh air after having Thor's Hammer shoved down our throats for a while.\n\nAs for the album itself, overall it has a dirty feeling, which I can only attribute to the Motorhead influence, or a lack of money (I believe he was still recording the the garage / studio, so it makes sense in that context). The drums are a bit tinny, but they're still very listenable. And, unlike what other people want to say, the riffs are definitely there.\n\nQuorthon's voice also seems to be a point of contention with many fans. I ask this: was the culture shock from Blood Fire Death to Hammerheart that bad? Did it make you hate Hammerheart? I agree, his vocals did change: for the better since the Requiem album. You can understand him - he pronounces the lyrics instead of making them into a long lost Viking warrior, or a demon possessed. They work. Keep in mind, his vocals changed many times; this is just another facet of his ability.\n\nMusically, this isn't the thinker's album that the Viking trilogy (Blood Fire Death through Twilight of the Gods) were; this is simply a fun, dirty rock 'n metal album that is the meeting place between Quorthon (his \"rock\" band) and the many faces of Bathory. The music is a bit more simple - the guitars have more bite than flow and it seems a record for tossing on when you feel like listening to some good metal when you don't want to imagine the longships or Valhalla, To that effect, if anything, this is Quorthon's \"party\" album (sorry, but that's the only way I can put it).\n\nLyrically, we go all over the place. Immaculate PinetreeRoad #930 is about a kid who kills his parents with an axe, then kills himself with a gun. Okay, maybe \"party album\" isn't exactly fitting unless you're like me - if find the topic fascinating.\n\nCharles Manson is also lyrical fodder (Sociopath)and John Wayne Gacy gets a turn as well (33 Something). Then there are the flat out \"Fuck off\" songs in form of Born to Die and Psychopath. Political statements come to play in Grey, Century and Judgement of Posterity (which, interestingly enough, could be a song an environmentalist could get behind).\n\nThe cover of Kiss's Deuce is interesting, but isn't really a favorite of mine. It's fairly faithful to the original (save for the vocals), but it just doesn't do anything for me.\n\nAlso, to the people criticizing the \"immature\" lyrics, I'd only have to point out that Swedish was Quorthon's home and more than likely some things were lost in translation. And, let's face it, Bathory and The Return were \"marred\" by lyrics of the same (or lesser) quality, yet that's both hailed as classics.\n\nThis divided a lot of the fans of Bathory back in the day as well. I think it's a good, solid metal album. When Blood on Ice came out, it was a masterpiece, but this is a damned fun listen if you like your rock and metal to be down and dirty and sound like something you could have some drinks to. It's not black metal, it's not Viking metal - it's simply good old fashioned metal played directly from the gutter and into your stereo.\n\nI'd advise any fan to give this a fair listen, and to remember, this is a different beast than anything that came before or after.\n",
        "\nDestroyer of Worlds is sort of odd as far as Bathory albums go. It doesn't really have any sort of theme, and mixes seemingly unrelated tracks that sort of combine the different themes of past Bathory albums. Alas, a neophyte to black metal could be excused for thinking \"Destroyer of Worlds\" was a compilation album. However, I assure you, it is not.\n\nA lot of people dislike \"Destroyer of Worlds\", and I really don't see why. The epic \"Lake of Fire\", the gritty, speedy ode to ice hockey \"Sudden Death\", the beautiful and shifting \"White Bones\", it has the best of all worlds. Granted, Bathory is at their most powerful when some sort of theme ties together an album. For example, Hammerheart is often regarded as their magnum opus, and for good reason (although Nordland came close, in my opinion). The crude production and dark content of \"Under The Sign...\" and \"Bathory\", the Odinist \"Twilight of the Gods\", the descent into musical Valhalla with \"Blood Fire Death\", \"Destroyer of Worlds\" is definitely the black sheep of the family. But it works. Magnificently.\n\nA lot of people complain about how Bathory albums get stale after a while. As a big fan of Quorthon's work, I never experienced this first hand, but no one can possibly hold that complaint to this album. There is plenty of variety, and it's all done properly. Quorthon proved that once again, he knew what he was doing. Stylistically, it's sort of a combination of \"Viking Bathory\", Quorthon's \"Album\", and the band's eponymous debut. Is it a little scattered? Yes. It's by no means perfect. But the tracks are, for the most part, very strong. The album is accessable, and a good starting point for folks just getting into Bathory. I highly recommend it.\n\nSide note: It's been my cycling album as of late. Functions admirably there too. Few things beat weaving in and out of traffic, illuminated by dim street lamps and moonlight, to the tune of \"Sudden Death\". \n\nR.I.P. Quorthon.\n",
        "\nBlood On Ice is a fascinating curio that would have been a misreckoning of an album had it not been the lost, delayed thing that it is now. Timing is everything. This is a time sensitive album in some ways. Even if it is pretty good, the time just was not right to release it back during its writing and recording. It was the right decision to put it off. Allow me to explain: This falls squarely on Bathory\u2019s Viking metal era and had Quorthon gone forward and released this as originally planned in 1989, this would have stuck out like a sore thumb between the grand masterpiece that was Hammerheart and the almost as terrific Twilight of the Gods. This is not to say that Blood On Ice is bad by any means. It\u2019s just that this recording was out of sync with Bathory\u2019s delicate evolution. Even Twilight of the Gods still had speckles of the black/thrash Venom-ish vocals in a couple songs despite the overwhelming Manowar influence on that record. Here, there is none of that old black metal sound anywhere. This album would have been just fine following Twilight of the Gods although it would have been a new page in the Viking sound as this is a concept album. That we can listen and reflect on this record after being put out as a side journey that once was is better appreciated because I would be lying to you if I said I would judge it as precisely and objectively on its own merits had it indeed been released twenty years prior to this writing instead of after the fact. I wouldn\u2019t be off base in saying that the majority of metalheads judge an album by a legendary metal band in relation to that band\u2019s other albums of standard especially if they fall in during or near a classic period of work. You can\u2019t convince me that No Prayer For the Dying would still be regarded as one of (Dickinson-ian) Iron Maiden\u2019s weakest albums had it come out in 1997 as a return of the main singer. It\u2019s all about two things: time and standards. On to the music\u2026\n\nConcept pieces in metal don\u2019t jive much with me. There is a story told here on this album but I didn\u2019t really care to follow it as such. This album still feels disjointed anyway if one was to be interested in going along with it. But almost all of the songs taken as wholes are very strong. The biggest beef I have with Blood On Ice is not surprisingly the production quality again but I can\u2019t say I am much surprised by this since the tapes were left in the cellar for six or seven years until Quorthon decided to revisit and tinker with it before putting this out. \n\nThe Intro track sounds very strange and shoddy with the scenery sounds. I didn\u2019t know if the volume knob was too low or what because they drifted sloppily among various channels. The first song proper is the epic title track that reprises itself more or less in a different take in the guise of a couple of the later songs on the record. This is actually a rock-ish song most throughout with synth layering and contains a very plain but loud beat structure on the drums. I would venture to guess that one of the musical reasons why Quorthon had misgivings about the album was his dissatisfaction with the percussion as this to me is the least well drummed performance found during his classic years. It sounds like he really didn\u2019t quite know what he wanted to do to make the drums stand out in this ambitious undertaking so he just decided to use them to apply a standard role and serve as they did with his other albums. \n\nThis record has something that might perhaps be enjoyed by fans of Ayreon or Ensiferum. Man of Iron is an acoustic and folksy epic song. It\u2019s too short for them to just latch on to that one song and leave but it will draw in listeners of that to the rest of Blood On Ice. One Eyed Old Man is also another epic folk/ Viking romp. The vocals on the beginning of it sound like something from that subgenre but they also sounded punkish too. It\u2019s also kind of thrash-y after the narration interlude concludes. Quorthon even does a James Hetfield like shout at the end of the song. But the two best songs on Blood On Ice are found with The Sword and The Stallion. The riffing on the first of the two would not be too out of place had it appeared on Twilight of the Gods. The vocals don\u2019t come through very well on this one as they have a rough demo quality to them. There\u2019s a coolly catchy arrangement going on behind the low richness. It\u2019s too bad that it can\u2019t be heard all the way. The Stallion\u2019s opening riff is the greatest thing on the album to grab you if you hadn\u2019t been interested thus far. There is more classic Metallica influence on this song not only with those rhythms but in the solo there. Like on track three, Quorthon does another Hetfield choral yell. I thought that was pretty nice. \n\nThere isn\u2019t anything too special about The Woodwoman but I liked the acoustic guitar chords that went with the song\u2019s ornate configuration of chorus enrichment. Quorthon does very nice clean singing on the song The Lake. It\u2019s slow and dramatic with much to be admired in the refrain. I think this is another track than can be pointed out to others from the heavy/power fans if they want to check out more Bathory. Gods of Thunder of Wind and of Rain is an unwieldy worded title but it sounds to make more sense because that is the main verse of the faster more up tempo coda. The percussive rhythms are more mixed up this time but they still stay basic. After the all too short but impressively sung soft acoustic interlude of The Raven comes the reprise song called The Revenge of the Blood On Ice. I liked this one better than the title track that it derives from except that it\u2019s infuriatingly inconsistent in the sound quality at different points during the song. In the first minute it sounds too low but it shifts up slightly as it moves forward. Everything is played a little longer on this song but the beats seem maybe a half step pushed up in spacing. I do love the closing thunder pounds at the end (that was in the title track too). Quorthon throws everything down in one continuous stroke on that part; bass, drums, guitars all go down with one march of dark down-tuned display of storm. \n\nBathory is one of my all time favorite bands. After Twilight of the Gods in 1990, Quorthon put out a lot of less than exciting thrash outings (and a couple ill advised grunge flirtations) but it is clear that he did right to go ahead and release this basement album. Nothing sounds better than the band with the 80\u2019s Viking, black metal and classic thrash mojo going all out and blasting loudly. My cell phone wallpaper is of an old photo of Quorthon posing with the dudes from Slayer. Every time I look at it I want to go back to a time when metal reigned supreme. Blood On Ice was made during that time too and I recommend it to those who think so as well. It will not be viewed as Bathory\u2019s most memorable but fans Manowar and other eighties heavy metal will enjoy it along with most Bathory fans from a retro-distance.\n",
        "\n\"Twilight of the Gods\" kicks in after a minute of silence. After that minute of silence, your soul is his for the taking. When he returns it to you, you'll be remade as a man, as a human being. Take my word for it.\n\nQuorthon is genius and we weren't expecting to find that out so late in his career as a musician, I mean, he alone, meaning Bathory alone, created (almost) everything black metal is about. And dropped out of satanic metal, years before everybody else start to copy his techniques. Then he decided to create another metal genre. Let's call it....epic metal. More of a genre derived by thematology and feeling than musical forms, but nevermind. What did you say? Manowar? Oh c'mon guys. Manowar are good. But we're talking Ragnarok, Haavamal and golden halls here. Stay in school, Yank.\n\n\"Twilight of Gods\" is the third and final part of the metal Haavamal, and, if you ask me, it is even better than the previous two (\"Blood Fire Death\" and \"Hammerheart\"). Fullest of feeling and dramatic sounds, fullest of ground-breaking melodies and those wonderful, out-of-tune, \"oh oh oh\" vocals (intro on \"Through Blood By Thunder\"). Anyone familiar with the band's music is unlikely to be disappointed by this, because \"Twilight Of The Gods\" is Quorthon's most mature and complete musical creation. More melodic than the other two albums, but more driven and clear in its purpose. What purpose you ask? The purpose of making you understand what this whole Valhalla thing is about.\n\nBecause you see, Quorthon knows that all this thematology is a myth. He doesn't to pretend to be the mightiest Viking warrior around (Amon Amarth-fucking WHO?), he just traces the myth up to its source and produce some ideas and theories about yourself and the world, derived from the Viking culture. Just read the lyrics of the title track-but do it cautiously. He is even talking about spaceships and technology, he is just making connections and metaphors to the Viking culture and mythology to make you understand his point of view about today, about existence.\n\nSo the next time you will let this one spin on your deck, have in mind that it's not supposed to be \"Viking metal\". It is sophisticated, cultured, socially, politically and emotionally touching music. Head to toe, beginning to end. Quorthon was not great because he was the toughest satanist around, then the toughest axeman around. He was great because he never took any of this seriously, but rather used it to deliver his message to the world. His message about innovation, insight, personality and human existence. But what is wrong with me and I started using past tense? Quorthon never actually died.\n",
        "\nThis is what Bathory is all about, folks. You can write it in blood and yell it from the hills of Skalunda. Yep, this is the original article for Viking metal. This is metal for the valiant, violent and proud and its legend will be upheld. A debt is owed. A tribute is due. As a matter of fact, every time I hear Hammerheart, it makes me think Bathory should have slapped a Danegeld on bands as diverse as Graveland and Amon Amarth; thy must render under Quorthon.- with interest. \n\nHammerheart is the very logical progression from the epic black metal work Blood Fire Death; an album I very much admired and didn\u2019t think could be topped until I heard this one. There still is some of Bathory\u2019s older sounds to be heard on here but they are supplemental to the ambitious scope found. With the vocals, Quorthon still takes influence from Venom in a couple of songs. Taking these influences from certain bands and melding it into his own grand style is one of the best things to appreciate on Hammerheart. \n\nListen to those waves. The song is called Shores in Flames and it is killer. The first verse of lyrics is sung cleanly and beautifully. As I stated above, there are little influences from diverse metal and rock bands found if you look real hard. And I would just about bet you a Runestone penny that Quorthon listened to a couple of lesser known epical pieces called Pirates and Memoirs of an Officer and a Gentleman by Emerson, Lake and Palmer to come up with that slowly sung \u2019Mother winter leaves our land\u2026\u2019 verse. \n\nThe scenery is being set and the atmosphere before a battle is always so serene yet tense. A beach is about to be stormed by Norse hordes of pagan reverence. This is the depiction that will accost you when you blare this song. There is so much vivid detail in those lyrics and sound. I\u2019ve always even thought this album is educational about Viking age lore. If you ask me, I think this kind of music is so much more vivid and entertaining than any film could ever portray. Before Bathory came along, I had to settle for a Kirk Douglas or some Lee Majors movie to get my Viking fix as a kid. When Shores in Flames first came on, I didn\u2019t need those movies. Hammerheart is where it\u2019s at and Viking metal hasn\u2019t been done nearly as well since. I got news for you, it never will either. \n\nAllow me to impress upon you another virtue of this album: its narrative. It\u2019s operatic and furious. In Shores in Flames you will first notice this. Take the sample lyrics of \u2018...at sunbirth we attack the city..Down the coastlines with wind we reign\u2026\u2019 He sings it with the gravel and true brio of a chronicler warrior. And you got to love that chorus! There\u2019s a guitar solo at the end of that. It might remind you of his earlier albums. Quorthon\u2019s playing style is perfect with a crude and boorish vibrato. He does nothing complicated but he doesn\u2019t have to. This is raw melody. The song ends with epic atmosphere. That battle horn blows and those shores really are in flames. You can hear it as sure as you are born. Launch those longboats and let these marauders debark because the next song maybe one of the best ever!\n\nWhen I listen to the track Valhalla, I am not in the 21st century anymore. Hell, my mind just might be at the start of the previous millennium. This song is greatness from Gotland. Who needs energy drinks or meth? Valhalla is pure adrenaline in the form of music. I have tell you, if I am ever about to go into a fight with someone bigger than me, I want to have this song playing in my head loud and clear. \n\nQuorthon takes a lot of riffing inspiration from Ross the Boss on this one. Being a fan of his work in Manowar, that was a treat. They\u2019re simpler at heart than what he did with Manowar but I actually like Quorthon\u2019s playing better. The drumming is marvelous on Valhalla. Those sticks sound like they have lead in them. I liken them to John Bonham's hits on The Immigrant Song. It is this drumming on Hammerheart that sets it apart from Bathory\u2019s previous albums. There is no black metal blasting here. The beats are not swift anymore. They go more for the effect of thunder to portray a battleground. The vocals on this song are the best he has ever done. He sings out of tune sure, but that\u2019s the best part about it. It\u2019s the voice of a warrior charging in full battle mode. He has a rasp and aggression that seems very real. When he screams about swinging his sword in the wind, everything is there. That whole catch verse projected an image of a wide-eyed Viking standing at the bow of a vessel in battle speed with his hair flowing against the wind under overcast skies. I\u2019ve seen paintings like that but Valhalla put it all into play. \n\nA lot of listeners will remember Baptised in Fire and Ice as the song that probably stuck out most upon first listen. It is a good one but ironically, it has become my least favorite on the album if I had to rate the songs. That opening riff is incredible and it\u2019s influenced by Ride the Lightning era Metallica so the eighties metal spirit is in tact. My only complaint with it is that overall it\u2019s too repetitive for a thrash-y track that lasts eight minutes. It doesn\u2019t sound like he quite knew where to take it from there. The actual riff is well written but his technical limitations do show through in regard to his speed on here because this needed to be played faster. His picking hand just wasn\u2019t slick enough to make it rip at correct accuracy. If he were able to have put in some sort of progression to go along with it, Baptised in Fire and Ice would have been the best song on here. A good and memorable track if a bit limited in execution. \n\nFather and Son is slower but a very smooth transition. The choral chants of the title in consistent with the grand setting on Hammerheart. The simplicity of the beginning riffs is magnificent. The bass is very faint on the drum beats. Quorthon again sings out of key alot but I loved it as he is just howling with bestial glee of Viking kinship in a long ago age. Song to Hall Up High is gorgeously placed between these battle hymns. The use of acoustic guitar was always an underrated aspect in Bathory\u2019s Viking era. \n\nA lot of people have said the production is not very good on this album. I have to disagree with this. True, it\u2019s not a high fidelity undertaking but the most impressive thing about the recording is that it always sounds rich and deep despite the limited budget. The mixing in of all those ambient sounds of fires, choral backing vocals, crashing waves, nature and movement is always convincing. \n\nFor some reason, it seems some Bathory fans are split into two factions but I see absolutely no reason for all to not enjoy this masterpiece. Quorthon can do no wrong when it comes to thundering metal be it black or Viking. For those of you who are still not sold on this album, I ask that you to at least play both of the first two tracks on the record at the maximum volume possible and let it shake the walls and split your eardrums. \n\nHow juiced is this album? If Valhalla could have been played for Hardrada\u2019s forces at Stamford Bridge, they would have kicked the shit out of Godwinson\u2019s army and scared off William for the throne of England. The song is anthem and rage at the same time. It represents weaponry and will. Every time I find myself stuck listening to someone\u2019s shitty music of today I feel the urge to yell at the top of my lungs, \u201cQuooorthon!!\u201d \n\nIf it appears that I am fellating Forsberg\u2019s knob like a knavish infidel, I wouldn\u2019t be the first or last to seem so because you cannot praise this album enough. This is an adventure of a heavy metal album. I still love all his black/thrash albums prior but this one took me with one furious swoop. I consider this his magnum opus and images of that battle hammer in full swing prevail. And how that hammer is heavy!\n",
        "\nI noticed when I was checking out this album that not a single person gave it a low review. Maybe it's just because nobody who dislikes this album is intelligent and can write a decent review, in which case I question my own intelligence for giving it a 55. None the less, I don't like this album.\n\nI haven't been a fan of viking metal for that long, so I've just recently discovered a bunch of great bands. Bathory is one of the first groups that comes up when talking about the genre and are frequently crowned as the first viking metal band. While I'm not denying that they were the first to popularize the genre, I just think that a lot of more interesting things have happened in the genre since this album's release. I'm sure when this album was first released it was groundbreaking, and one of the most original metal albums ever, but now does it serve as anything more than a historical note?\n\nFor me, no. I can't listen to this and enjoy it more than a modern viking metal album. But now, on to the actual music. I know that this is going to really piss a lot of people off, but for the most part this just sounds like thrash metal to me. You know, the kind of stuff that Slayer revolutionized. The only differences is that Slayer decided to cut out the crap. For example, many of the songs on this album are very lengthy, but for no purpose. They start with a minute and a half of wind sound effects, then have a two minute intro with plodding power chords that don't do anything and then there's a five minute song and an outro with pointless sludge. Now, wind sound effects and lengthy songs works if you are a progressive band but when the whole purpose of your music is to sound like drunken vikings and be as brutal as possible the excess is not needed. Keep the songs short, heavy and to the point and it works better.\n\nThe band sounds skilled enough but they just don't do anything. They thrash around make loud noises and scream, which must be good fun for the musicians, but in the end isn't musically inspired. There are moments that are nice when everything clicks and it just sounds awesome, but they are few and they are usually stuck in the middle of ten minute long duds. \n\nTo conclude. I'm sure this was a breakthrough during the time it was first released, but as an album in the 21st century it fails, at least for me, to deliver anything I can't already get, but better with a band like Ensiferum. My advice, give it a sample on the computer and see what you think. You might like it, you might not, and either way makes sense to me. I however think that this is a nice addition to a metalhead's collection for it's historical aspect, but not really something to value as musically rewarding.\n",
        "\n\u2026It might cost you much too much!\n\nMan, does this album rule. It\u2019s my mystikal kvlt master Kuorthon, in all his over the top and kickass glory! I can\u2019t go as far as saying it\u2019s his best, because finding Bathory\u2019s best album is like finding CoRn\u2019s worst\u2014there are just so many! However, you don\u2019t suffer a stroke while trying to find Quorthon\u2019s magnum opus as much as you would risk yourself when trying to find Jonathan Whinyes shittum faeceus. So, along comes \u201cTwilight of the Gods\u201d, which is just a little bit short of a complete masterpiece.\n\nOverall, though, this is undoubtedly Bathory\u2019s most melodic piece of work. Acoustic guitars (no pointless noodling though!) are found everywhere, and then they suddenly change into distortion, while keeping that same catchy melodic riffing! That\u2019s right, whence Quorthon\u2019s earlier albums were good because they were so brutal and evil and kvlt, everything starting from \u201cHammerheart\u201d, with the exception of \u201cRequiem\u201d and \u201cOctagon\u201d, is awesome because it\u2019s fun and catchy. Yes, Bathory as a fun, catchy, melodic band, but retaining its overall awesomeness; it\u2019s not very far from being Iron Maiden with silly vocals if you ask me (that\u2019s one huge compliment for Quorthon, really). \n\nSome people might kill me for this, but \u201cTwilight of the Gods\u201d is closer to the power metal spectrum of metalness, than to the Viking/black/other Bathory genres. Beginning with the title track, with its perfect mix of dirty/clean distortion/acoustic intro, then it explodes into a bunch of chords and the titanic (can\u2019t find other words for it) drumming behind. \u201cTA-tatata-TA-tata-TA\u201d, and then the whole thing evolves in an awesome slab of heavy fucking metal with Quorthon\u2019s instantly recognizable voice doing choruses, in such epic fashion that everything including my existence on earth and the universe itself seem to vanish due to the sheer fucking greatness of how that song goes along. Yes, it\u2019s THAT good. Just when you think your head is about to blow up, the verse kicks in, with a vocal melody so out of this world, and every hit of the drums pounds your head like a shovel directly into your skull. Lyrics such as \u201cHoly writings/ hokus-pokus/blaze of glory/ and crucifix/TV-preachers/and dirty tricks\u201d make me think of Helloween for some reason; but leave that to me, I\u2019m way too over ecstatic with this song. \n\nSo, some people don\u2019t like the vocals; probably because Quorthon, in a way, can\u2019t do clean vocals for shit. You know what? I don\u2019t give a fuck! I don\u2019t care about how many notes he can hit; if I wanted that I\u2019d listen to \u201cThe Sentinel\u201d by Priest. No, what is so great about his voice is the sheer emotion contained within. Matt Barlow? He ain\u2019t got shit over Quorthon, even if he misses the chorus\u2019 notes \u201cIt\u2019s the Twilight of the GOOOOOOOODSSS!!\u201d enough for the cats to come join him in; you just feel the passion within the man\u2019s voice. You can feeeeeel the man is clearly struggling, singing his ass off! And that, for me, is much more important than anything else. What\u2019s talent without passion? Quorthon may not have talent for singing, but damn does he try, you can almost take the exact frame where you feel his heart is going to come out his throat\u2026THAT my friends, is what heavy metal is all about (and Aces High).\n\nSoon after that, there are a bunch of even more epic choruses, and it suddenly fades away in a very beautiful melodic passage right at the end; a very brooding, dark, and perfectly fitting acoustic guitar melody. Take notes, countless proggy bands! 13:10 mark, damn me if that\u2019s not emotion, fellows. Can you imagine? That was just the first fucking track, out of 7, and I already feel great! Who needs pot when you have Bathory? There's only one track that sounds a bit forced, like if it's there to make the album longer, and it's \"Hammerheart\". It's from classical composer Gustav Holst, but it sounds like The Lord of the Rings movie soundtrack or something of the sorts...It's not bad, but you know, this album is so great that having there at the end is ludicrous, because it's nowhere near as epic as...everything else on here.\n\n\u201d\u2026For as long as the grass grows, for as long as the stream flows\u2026\u201d. Next track ahead and it already begins with such a speech! Well, \u201cThrough Blood by Thunder\u201d is nowhere near as epic as the title track, and stuff like that holds the album back a lot, if it weren\u2019t for that cool solo at near the end, and \u201cBond by blood!\u201d. I guess Quorthon knew that if he put fucking \u201cBlood and Iron\u201d after \u201cTwilight of the Gods\u201d, his listeners would have a severe case of the deads, although that would be a great way to die. Really, \u201cBlood and Iron\u201d has the best acoustic intro I have ever heard from a song, maybe there are better ones that I can\u2019t think of right now, because that melody at 1:14 is distracting me with its \u201cHey! Look at me you moron!\u201d nature. That one alone is packed with more emotion than a bipolar person, but then it explodes a minute later, with a mid-paced, yet headbangable riff! And some seconds after, the melody returns in a great way, before this cool riff comes in; that kind of stuff is where my \u201cBathory sounds like power metal at times\u201d thesis comes from. My only trouble is that there is not an overtly emotional sounding vocal piece like before, but my feelings change when the acoustic melody makes a final appearance near the end. It\u2019s like hypnosis.\n\n\u201cBlood and Iron\u201d finishes and it leaves you kinda void, but when \u201cUnder the Runes\u201d comes, which, if not for the Spinal Tap-folky intro, and Quorthon\u2019s trademark voice, I would almost confuse it for an 80\u2019s W.A.S.P song, or something similar. The main riff has \u201cglam\u201d written all over it, and the snare drum just gives an arena style vibe that I can\u2019t deny; you know, with all the reverb and \u201ctutu-TAAH\u201d\u2026Yeah, that. That\u2019s the \u2018bad\u2019 part, if you think there\u2019s anything wrong with the main riff sounding \u2018glammish\u2019. The good part though, is that it fucking rules! That guitar lick at 3:32 is especially awesome, with a very cool melody, which then transforms into a majestic solo, and just after that, the vocal melody\u2026Fuck this; it sounds like hair metal, and those last verses near the end make me feel Quorthon\u2019s gonna go \u201cThrough L.A\u2019s sunset strip, she\u2019s just 16 but I\u2019ll make her screeaaam\u2026Thank you Detroit! Good Night!!\u201d Just let me find the puffy hair and the makeup; oh how I would make fun of it if it didn\u2019t kick such brutal amounts of ass.\n\nSo, it\u2019s Quorthon\u2019s experimentation with lots of acoustic passages, power metal elements, slightly less complex song structures (compared to earlier outputs), and random glam metal thrown in just for the hell of it. Oh yeah, and he writes lyrics about Vikings fighting stuff. It\u2019s like a collage of stuff thrown in that end up making sense, and Quorthon is one hell of a songwriter, making some of the most complex vocal melodies this side of Fates Warning! Everything\u2019s here, catchy songwriting, beautiful acoustic passages, monumental riffing, even more monumental guitar soloing (5:18 mark during \u201cBond of Blood\u201d), emotional vocals, and Vikings. Do you love it? YESSS YOU DO!! This is one of Bathory\u2019s essential albums, and I guarantee you won\u2019t regret buying it. Unless, you know, you don\u2019t like anything of the stuff I just mentioned; in which case you should stop listening to metal right now and move to something safer, like, I don\u2019t know, knitting?\n",
        "\nEvery legend begins with truth, as someone once said, and every metal legend has humble beginnings. But in the case of the iconic black metal forefathers known as Bathory, humility is nowhere to be found, save perhaps the rawness of the production. By any standards of either the 1st wave of black metal or the rawest of thrash metal that was running parallel to it circa 1983-84, this brief LP is about as extreme of a listen as there was to be heard and saw the newborn black style moving away from its NWOBHM roots towards something even darker and more menacing. It tends to resemble a thrash album more than what is considered black metal today, but this short debut is arguably where the true sound that typifies the latter genre as it exists today began.\n\nThough many insist on making comparisons to Venom\u2019s early works, this is pretty far removed from what they had done up to this point, and definitely lends credence to front man Quorthon\u2019s assertions that Bathory\u2019s music wasn\u2019t directly impacted by them. The riff work is the first glaring example of the departure, as it shares more in common with the more aggressive and guitar oriented work of early Slayer and Metallica. \u201cSacrifice\u201d and \u201cHades\u201d in particular draws heavily from the same Motorhead meets Diamond Head riffing style that Dave Mustaine was privy to when he put together classics that showed up on the first Metallica LP such as \u201cPhantom Lord\u201d and \u201cMetal Militia\u201d. It should also be noted that Quorthon\u2019s garbled and shrill goblin speak on all of these songs was unheard of at the time, essentially taking maybe an element of Lemmy Kilmister\u2019s raspy vocal style and distorting it further into the intelligible but anti-melodic and inhuman mutterings that are found here.\n\nFor all of the stylistically revolutionary things going on here, it is equally important to note the utter simplicity of this blackened beast. Most of these songs consist of 3 or 4 riffs played in a fairly formulaic and repetitious fashion, and most guitar solos that occur tend to ramble about the pentatonic scale in short bursts, almost like a simpler take on Kerry King\u2019s flashy yet brief shred fests in the midst of a wall of perpetual speed. Likewise, the average duration of each song is well under the 3 mark, almost like a simpler and slower take on \u201cReign In Blood\u201d about 2 years before, exuding about the same level of darkness and malevolence in each speed drum beat and crunchy power chord. Even on slower non-speed oriented works like \u201cNecromansy\u201d and \u201cRaise The Dead\u201d, both of which definitely carry a good level of Black Sabbath influence alongside the faster NWOBHM characteristics, a small number of differing riffs and a non-epic approach to song structure contrast this with Metallica\u2019s longwinded works at this time.\n\nThere isn\u2019t really much to complain about here save that it consists of less than 24 minutes of actual music and even by 1984\u2019s standards this is an extremely roughly produced album. When you contrast it with the pristine and almost overly clean finished product that was \u201cRide The Lightning\u201d, it\u2019s understandable that many newly indoctrinated Metal fans whose understanding of thrash metal is limited to the Big 4 would have a hard time accepting this, but this rivals just about everything that was out in 1984 under the thrash banner in terms of quality and I\u2019d argue surpasses them all in terms of aggression. It lacks the theatrical elements of other early members of the 1st wave of black metal such as Venom and Mercyful Fate, and the formula present here was further improved upon on the two albums that Quorthon and company put out soon after, but its place in history was solidified the minute the first hard copy was circulated.\n\nOriginally submitted to (www.metal-observer.com) on January 4, 2009.\n",
        "\nQuorthon had a quite drastic musical change during the 90s. Maybe too many letters by the fans brought him to compose again some old school material, preferring the death/thrash direction. It was a quite courageous choice because at the time his status was representative for the Viking metal and many didn\u2019t like it. However, this choice brought him to compose this Requiem album, the first one in this direction. Let me say that the following one (Octagon) is one of the most catastrophic attempts to bring back the glorious day but with this one we can enjoy something in a different style. \n\nRequiem is a goodish/average death/thrash effort and obviously can\u2019t beat the first albums in malevolence and darkness but has some good points. The beginning is ultra doom for the title track. The bells sound is on the background and we can notice the Twilight of the Gods oriented production, without the epic feeling. The sounds are very similar to those ones on that Viking masterpiece even if this time the instruments are definitely more violent and faster. Actually, the production is not clean and all the sounds are melted together to create a fuzzy assault with several up tempo parts and hyper vicious bass drums parts. \n\nThe vocals are childish, raspy and Venom oriented in their will to bring to life the old school days. As always, forget about the technique because here it\u2019s all about the sheer impact with sudden stop and go with furious restarts. The drums sound so metallic or plastic too, especially on the hammering snare. However, some epic traces can be found in very short sections like at the end of the title track or on \u201cBlood and Soil\u201d. The rest is more or less on total speed with pure thrash metal riffs and suffered vocals. Everything sounds so bare-bone and aseptic, with cold sounds as a post-nuclear attack. The structures are always quite simple even if the refrains sometimes are easily recognizable, like the one on \u201cCrosstitution\u201d among the others. On several parts, the Sodom spectrum is far more present and this is a good thing for some aspects. \n\nThe cons come with the too monolithic assault of the instruments and the riffs are not always that great. Sometimes the tracks are too similar in their violence and some peaks like the ones on \u201cNecroticus\u201d can\u2019t be reached again. Here Quorthon is just vicious and really violent. The more mid-paced \u201cWar machine\u201d is quite boring because the ideas are not that well-developed and the weird sounds on the background are annoying after awhile. The last tracks have few memorable peaks and the desire to skip is quite strong. They are quite lame in some parts and here Quorthon simple does his homework, without passion or strength. He takes riffs from everywhere to create a collage (the ones on \u201cSuffocate\u201d are incredibly copied by Sodom). \n\nAll in all, this is not like Octagon but it\u2019s not that great either. The simple truth is that Quorthon wasn\u2019t that able to play this style anymore\u2026he made his time with the first, great black/thrash albums but that time was over. The natural evolution brought him to compose the Viking milestones like \u201cBlood Fire Death\u201d and \u201cHammerheart\u201d and it was difficult to be convincing changing once again.\n",
        "\nQuorthon always wanted the best for the fans and when many of them wrote him because they wanted rawer black/thrash in the debut style, he tried to do it. The epic metal was, at the time, the best that was coming from Quorthon\u2019s mind and I think he forgot how to do black, raw metal in a proper way. He was fixed on another genre and I believe it was a quite drastic and violent change. However, I find this album quite bad, like many here say. Yes, the peaks of the first three albums cannot be reached in this genre and this is just a quite weak sample of the old years gone.\n\nAlready with its predecessor, Requiem, the things were changing with a return to a more violent and brutal approach and now the things were exasperated. This is a blasting attack under the sign of the most raw and primitive sound; a quite immature and unpolished mixture of old school genres and, already from the opener, we can taste the essence of this album. The first thing you can notice is the ultra plastic/metallic production that gives the drums a fucking sharp and hammering sound. The guitars are the thing I like the most here because the distortion is fucking low and massive. \n\nThe structures are really simple and the drums almost cover everything in volumes. The vocals by Quorthon are far more childish than in the past. Forget completely the black metal screams because they are thrash metal in timbre with lots of influences from hardcore too! It\u2019s so strange hear this stuff from him\u2026\u201dBorn To Die\u201d is even groove! The violence is, in this song, far less present and the tempo is slow. Damn, this song is quite terrible. The way he plays the guitars is very simple: the open chords riffs are the main technique and he borrowed lots of styles from Hellhammer band. The palm muting riffs are not so present.\n\nForget the goodness in a song like \u201cPsychopath\u201d because there are strange effects too and the whole track is just annoying. The vocals are simple, childish and almost intolerable. In \u201cSociopath\u201d we return to speed and it\u2019s a bit better but it\u2019s like in the following \u201cGrey\u201d: he simple couldn\u2019t play this genre; he wasn\u2019t able, no more. There are even wa-wa solos and they sound incredibly strange for Bathory. Also the vocals patterns take lots of speed and timbres from hardcore/thrash metal and I\u2019m a bit stranded. \u201cCentury\u201d is mid-paced with more groove (it\u2019s incredibly boring\u2026) while \u201c33 Something\u201d shows ultra fast bass drum triplets and up tempo on the snare to return to dementia death/thrash. \n\n\u201cWar Supply\u201d and \u201cSchizianity\u201d are two boring, weak and totally senseless tracks. Quorthon seems completely drunk at the vocals and the slow progression is utter shit. \u201cJudgement of Posterity\u201d features a bit better riffs and some good structures but it\u2019s not enough. This song once again slowly sinks into the limb of mediocrity also because it\u2019s too long to contain three riffs and few ideas. It\u2019s better to fly over the Kiss cover\u2026 I really don\u2019t know what to say. Two or three riffs are not that bad but the rest is to throw away. Ok, you wanted to please the fans, but fuck. I\u2019m sorry Quorthon, you just couldn\u2019t play this genre anymore.\n",
        "\nSorry. This just doesn't do. 13 years have passed and this album still just points itself out in my collection. This is so to say, Quorthon's evil twin, making a pathetic attempt at thrash, utterly failing. This is supposed to be how Bathory should be remembered? The answer is very simple. No. This is just plain comical. Why? Let me tell you.\n\nAfter the majestic and epic Twilight of the Gods back in 91', Quorthon decided it's time to make some great Scandinavian thrash metal attacks (or let's leave it at 'attempts'). So he went into his little cellar and records Requiem in 94' (after releasing two best-ofs with some unreleased tracks from the old blackish era). Requiem was actually not all bad, but still, very deceptive. Quorthon completely dropped the viking and epic themes he had adopted, for whatever reason he had, and moves to thrash. Now, thrash is a great type of heavy metal, just the thrash that you get on Requiem's follow-up, \"Octagon\" is simply downright stupid and lame. Riffs are almost completely ripped off and uninspired, resembling Slayer and early Sodom almost to, say, 80%. The problem is also, that the guitar tune and the recording itself is anything but thrash. It sounds like you would have taken the first Slipknot album or some other \"nu\"-metal abomination and sent it back to the 20s, recording tunes on a phonograph or something similar (by the way; didn't Slipknot actually adopt the octagon into their \"Maggot-crops-overalls\", or whatever they're called). The song structures are more boring and uninspired than a squished slug near a manhole. In fact, this is exactly what this sounds like: the soundtrack to a squished slug near a manhole on \"Immaculate Pinetreeroad #930\", because that's exactly where it goes. The sound on this is vastly inferior to his earlier works, with annoying hissing and dry guitar riffs overlapping themselves, resulting in a complete mess and cacophony. Actually I am beginning to think that this is a joke of the record label into tricking fans of Bathory to buy this atrocity under the name of Bathory. Or another possibility would be that Quorthon was completely drunk when he decided to spawn this. That would also explain the highly intelligent and epic lyrics: \"Drink my cum, Eat my shit, suck my dick, [...] With every breath inhale the stench of lubrication shit and sweat.\". And with every gushing sonic surge out of Quorthon's ass I descend further into a migraine state. There is simply no escape and less than 20 seconds on every song is enjoyable.\n\nThe reason this album still manages to reach a 33% is not because of me thinking \"33 something\". No, no, no. It's because of the cool KISS cover song \"Deuce\". I like the cover, it really has a dirty tone to it and gives it a really cool individual touch. Just download the song somewhere off the Internet and revel in it, but don't think the rest of the album is as cool as that song.\n",
        "\nWe go back to the year 1981. Venom welcomes us to hell with their debut album. Since that album the extreme metal scene and lifestyle have never been the same. Of course this would lead, later on in the early 90s, to the radicalization of this new philosophy with the glorification of the individual in heroic scenarios filled with anti-social themes. 1982 an appropriate name for this kind of music was found; \"Black Metal\", as the titles of Venom's 82' release suggests. The name also fits the music very well, it's Slayer infused into fast and dirty rock'n'roll with harsh vocals and blasphemous lyrics. One formula that has prevailed so many times, but ceased to in the mid 90s. For some reason the individualistic energy that appeared soon put itself out and suffocated into a docile state, later degenerating into order instead of chaos and depression instead of strength.\n\nSo much for the small history lesson. Tomas Forsberg, better known under his scenic name of \"Quorthon\", was merely 18 years old at the time the first \"Bathory\" album was released. But do not get fooled by the age of the band members, for listening to this release, one can really imagine the raw energy that was running through their veins at that time. Energy that this new generation of extreme music is somehow lacking. On this release we have pure chaos that pushes you forward into a juvenile world of mysticism and provocative satanic imagery. The same problems the youth had back then, we have today; the question to wether one is an important part of this world or not and if society really is what it pretends to be. The nihilistic attitude on this album is not only an imagery to promote the band, but also an important part of the music. Every aspect of this album is a reflection of the band members' thoughts and minds. One must not be a psychologist to realize the fact that this album simply put, has more balls than say 95% of what is being produced in the music industry today. With only a set of crude guitars and some amps, a decent drum kit these younglings have managed to overwhelm the animalistic instincts that mankind possesses. The guitar work here is much in vein of old-Venom material, but with a more obscure tone to it. Slightly monotonous guitar riffing accompanied by compatible homogeneous bass lines and rather catchy melodies are repeated in every song, which create a straightforward but also very effective sound pattern. Most songs on this release have short chaotic soli that resemble Slayer on occasions. The tempo on each song is an average 200 bpm or so, so it's pretty mid tempo. Quorthon's vocal duties on this are truly great. They may not be the typical guttural screaming black metal offers some 10 years later, but it's still a damn good rasp coming out of this guy's throat. \n\nThe opener \"Storm of Damnation\", an intro, embraces the album together with its counterpart \"Outro\". Directly after the intro, a set of fast paced drums and sagging guitar riffs capture the listener's attention, carrying him forth into a twisted world of determined eagerness and negative emotions. Grasping one by the leg, this album shows you, instead of telling you. It speaks to its listener, encouraging him to feel the most empathy possible with the music. Technically, this album may not appear outstanding, but it remains impressive. Being only less than half an hour in its length, this album really makes up for its intensity. You will be amazed as this album never gets boring and will stay in your cd player or playlist for a long time spinning again and again on almost endless repeat. Every track on this album has its own character and pulls you down its own dark path, each with its own personal set of blasphemy, such as death, satanic rituals and the apocalypse.\n\n\"I swear the oath of blood \nand tear the virgin's flesh \nI gash the wounds of heaven \nand ride the wings of death\"\n\nThis lyrical extraction of \"Armageddon\" pretty much sums up the feeling on this album and gives a decent impression of what awaits you if you have not already heard this masterpiece. Shut the door and turn up the volume, for this is what our hell sounds like. For fans of Venom, Slayer and Hellhammer, this is a must.\n",
        "\nSay what you will. This album is nothing more (or less) than a polished continuation of Hammerheart. Songs on this album could have easily fit on the previous effort if it had had the same production, and more important, slightly rawer vocals.\n\nTherein lies the biggest difference. Since \u2018Blood, Fire, Death\u2019 Quorthons voice became cleaner and more melodic with each album. Is he stretching it on \u2018Twilight of the Gods\u2019? He is, actually. The possibility of enjoying the vocals here is purely a matter of taste. For the fans of more extreme metal his voice is too mainstream here. For those of you who like strong melodic vocalist, his performance is often out of tune and sounds rather forced. You cannot argue Quorthons creativity but the performance is debatable.\n\nA real weakspot is the last song which has \u2018filler\u2019 or \u2018experiment gone wrong\u2019 surrounding it all the time. The song \u2018Hammerheart\u2019 is an old orchestral piece over which Quorthon has decided to sing. The idea of course is really great and would it have been a great vocalist or even a (real) male choir singing, it could have sounded great as well. Quorthons shortcomings as a melodic vocalist however become painfully obvious here. But hey, who can blame the man for trying. Some of his most classic ideas and songs have been the result of experimenting or just doing \u2018something\u2019. He can\u2019t be right all the time, right?\n\nUnlike \u2018Hammerheart\u2019 this album has a lesser amount of classic songs. Especially the titletrack stand out and the pounding \u201cBlood and Iron\u201d. Especially the spoken words section with the distorted guitars and acoustic guitar on the latter is of such beauty. I cannot imagine a viking metal collection without this mighty song.\n\nHowever. This majority of the album is still extremely heavy. Turn out your lights, light some candles and put on the album at a high volume. The difference in loudness between the intro and the titletrack is so big, when the drums and distorted guitars finally make their entrance, it\u2019s like a bomb falling into your room. So damn heavy! Don\u2019t forget buy some red wine (or better: Mead) and invite a pale skinned maiden. With this album filling the soundscape and some candles you can make some really heavy love.\n\nThe biggest problem with \u2018Twilight\u2026\u2019 compared to contempory artists, modern viking Metal bands or other Bathory releases is the simple fact that for some viking Metal fans this album can be a bit too polished and not \u2018dark\u2019 enough and for the more melodic minded folks still a bit too much on the heavy side of metal with, as said, vocal weaknesses. If you\u2019re really into Bathory however you\u2019ll feel this album is just another great one and slightly less trendsetting or classic as its predecessors.\n",
        "\nAnd it even sounds extreme and vile 21 years later. Quite a remarkable achievement. A lot of modern black metal albums sound either too polished or just aweful. \u201cUnder the Sign of the Black Mark \u201d is still a transparent but loud motherf**ker. And to think Quorthon also used a battery powered amplifier for this. An experiment gone well I must say.\n\nThe shortcomings of their previous record \u201c\u2026the Return\u201d have gone. This album is very tight (tight enough would be a more appropriate description) and dynamic. Changes in paces are all over the place but the album remains powerful the full length.\n\nOnce again the intro is overlong for me so I always skip to the first song \u201cMassacre\u201d. Brutal and not even close anymore to their early days punkrock nor even thrash metal. Fast, furious, brutal, satanic. Best fast song here however is \u201cEquimanthorn\u201d. A simple intro riff played through two different amplifiers before all hell breaks loose without, and I stress without, losing catchiness. If Hell were to exist, this song would be played on parties every single night! I would have been a cover band though since, being a Metal God, Quorthon has obviously gone to heaven (or Valhalla perhaps).\n\nObviously a few mid- or slow paced songs are here as well. Most notible would be \u201cEnter the Eternal Fire\u201d which already sounds more than a lot like the epic pounding metal Quorthon would started to play on Hammerheart (and of course two earlier tracks on Blood, Fire Death) and what most of us years later would start calling Viking Metal. Now slow paced pounding songs with dark riffs like these had been written before by numerous metal bands since Black Sabbath came around but once again it\u2019s the extra amount of eerieness and Quorthons typical screeching vocals that made songs like these sound so much more evil when Bathory played them.\n\nThe viking theme wasn\u2019t exactly new of course. And of course in this period of their career Bathory only made some hidden references to it (the Jewelled Bridge etc). Manowar had done some before and even Yngwie Malmsteen (check out \u201cI Am a Viking\u201d on the superb \u2018Marching Out\u2019 album) but honestly with this dark music the violent and mystical atmosphere surrounding viking came more to life on Bathory albums. Quorthon managed to find a style of metal which suited the lyrical contents in the best possible way.\n\nI always chuckle a bit when I hear terms like \u2018Blackened\u2019. For me, Blackened is a Metallica song. But I understand the point. It\u2019s a retrospective historical term which I, consequently, never use since I grew up with albums like these and not those terms. But yes, one could call this \u2018blackened thrash\u2019. The riffs are far from mainstream thrash even though they touch the style once in a while and as far as the vocals go, well, if I try I can make a comparisson the the early days of Kreator and Sodom.\n\nNow \u201cUnder The Sign\u201d is not an album I would play during summer when it\u2019s 30 degrees celcius out there but otherwise..you can wake me up for this one!\n",
        "\nHonesty compels me to say this is my least favorite Bathory album from the eighties. And the reason solely lies in the performance. I wouldn\u2019t know if there are new re-mastered versions of this album around on which the performance was digitally set straight. My my old eighties version sounds like crap. And I find this to be a real bummer.\n\nBecause, as said, some compositions here are marvellous! This album balances between the evil materpiece \u201cUnder The Sign\u201d and their rocking straight forward debut. I know the background of the album. The circumstances under which it was recorded, 3 months after the infamous \u201cNecronomicon/Maleficarum\u201d sessions, the fact that during the recordings they had to fire bassplayer Andreas 'Adde' Johansson due to drug abuse. But still that can be no excuse for the performance here.\n\nI don\u2019t know wether Quorthon was too hasty and couldn\u2019t get his farter parts played straight over the raging drums or the drums were just too sloppily played anyway. Eitherway, the interaction between drums and guitar seems lost on all fast sections of the album. They\u2019re all over the place.\n\nNow if I take the song \u201cThe Return of the Darkness and Evil\u201d it would be the most obvious example. I\u2019ve known and played the \u2018original\u2019 version from the Scandinavian Metal Attack album hundreds of times. Hell, I ever covered that version! But the version on this album is twice as fast, killing the drive and rhythm of the original riffs and vocal lines. And secondly, not played very tightly.\n\nBut if I listen closely as well to the rest of the songs, I can hear the hidden qualities of the compositions. There are some marvellous riffs and vocal lines and \u2018on paper\u2019 these songs are simply great. The album will forever give me mixed feelings. It could have been so much better.\n",
        "\nIt took me a while to decide if I would start reviewing Bathory albums as well. I\u2019m not a black metal boy. I\u2019m an old school thrasher who also loves Bathory. And since the majority of Bathory reviews here are written by black metal fans I restrained myself at first. But who cares. I\u2019ll do it anyway. from my perspective obviously.\n\nI have to get something out of my system though. This debut has become a classic mostly out of sheer coincidence and shortcomings than a very \u2018intelligent\u2019 approach. What do I mean by that? Simply said, in essence this album does nothing more than worship Venom, Black Sabbath and of course Motorhead. The vocals are different because Quorthon simply couldn\u2019t do any better. It could have been a bad album because of this. A forgotten piece of music. However, this did not happen!\n\nPoint is, firstly, that a few years later the huge influence of this Bathory album (and the next 4) on both the black and viking metal scenes became undisputed and more than obvious. And secondly, the songs on this album are simply very good and because of the characteristic vocals, lyrics and atmosphere the result turned out very different from contemporary artists.\n\nAs said the main musical influences here are Motorhead and Venom in terms of aggression, speed and some rock \u2018n roll based fast metal riffs. Bathory took the image of Venom but made it slightly darker in a Black Sabbeth kind of way and furthermore, more obscure and \u2018underground\u2019. The band didn\u2019t play live, not many band pictures were around. So the band remained a mystical \u2018obscurity\u2019. Something which suited their music very well.\n\nThe album was punkier than Motorhead yet less sloppy than Venom. It had more darkness from Black Sabbath and was far less theatrical than Venom. The album is simple, straight forward and short. The message is clear and therefor more convincing. Most of the songs are fast and furious. The best ones being the catchier ones. But come to think of it, they\u2019re all very catchy, riffwise and choruswise.\n\nOf the slower tracks \u201cRaise the Dead\u201d is the better one. It uses a dark form of old school heavy metal riffing and the catchy vocal lines and pounding simple drums are a perfect finishing touch.\n\nWell, when I first heard this album, the term \u2018black\u2019 meant nothing to me. Black was a colour of certain band members in Gothic Slam and Hirax, nothing more, nothing less. This music was dark! The darkest rock and roll ever made. I still refuse to use the term black metal for this album. Screeching vocals and lyrics about Satan don\u2019t make an album black metal.\n\nThe album cover. Another highlight really. And once again born out of short comings. Photocopies and handmade cut out stuff formed the goat which to this day is the ultimate and enduring Bathory image!\n\nQuite an album. A classic even\n",
        "\nAfter a couple of atrocious thrash albums and the inconsistent \u2018Destroyer of Worlds\u2019, \u2018Nordland I\u2019 was to be the return to the popular Viking metal style of Bathory\u2019s earlier albums. The album was planned to be the first of a set of 4 albums but only 2 were completed before sole band member Quorthon\u2019s death.\n\n\u2018Nordland I\u2019 contains everything that you would expect from a Viking-metal Bathory release: Powerful epic riffs, choirs and a strong, believable and gripping atmosphere. Right from the beginning it is evident that quality vintage Bathory is back with a grand synthesiser melody backed by chants and rolling drums. After that, the music launches straight into a fantastic huge crushing riff, which \u2018Nordland I\u2019 contains plenty of. While most of the riffs are often quite slow, they never get at all close to reaching a doom metal pace, instead sounding like slightly slowed down NWOBHM riffs.\n\nAcoustic guitars often make appearances and there are some totally acoustic songs like \u2018Ring of Gold\u2019.\nThese give the album a slightly folky feel, but like the choirs, background ambient sounds and synth this only enhances the atmosphere without becoming too cheesy. The folk metal aspect of the music is always completely serious and never over-the-top in a Turisas style.\n\nThe biggest problem of \u2018Nordland I\u2019 is the production. Often the guitars sound far too thin, especially on songs like \u2018Dragons Breath\u2019 and \u2018Great Hall Awaits A Falling Brother\u2019, and sometimes the instruments sound mixed together too much. This is not always that noticeable however, especially when the guitars are covered by singing and chants, and doesn\u2018t become as much of a problem as it could be except on a few songs.\n\nThe weaker tracks on the album are actually the faster-paced ones. One of the album\u2019s weakest tracks, \u2018Broken Sword\u2019 in particular is affected by the bad production, with horrible fast repetitive drums completely overpowering the other instruments, making the guitar especially too difficult to hear. \u2018Broken Sword\u2019 is however quite a nice change of pace from the rest of the album which usually remains at about the same tempo and can sound a bit too samey and monotonous sometimes.\n\nQuorthon\u2019s musicianship as usual is excellent, especially as he plays all of the instruments on the album. His programmed drums are occasionally quite poor though, and are sometimes too dense or simplistic. Again though, this is much more noticeable on some songs than others and usually doesn\u2019t become much of a problem. The singing is what really drags Quorthon down. His vocal range is obviously very limited, but in a way his rough style of singing sounds honest and suits the atmosphere of the music, much like that of Black Sabbath\u2019s Ozzy Osbourne. His lyrics fit the theme of the music perfectly with songs containing vivid imagery of Viking battles and myths.\n\nAt an hour long, despite most of the riffs being at a high quality and usually quite catchy, \u2018Nordland I\u2019 really relies on it\u2019s atmosphere to stay interesting for its entire running time because of the slightly repetitive sound, otherwise it can become slightly boring. \u2018Nordland I\u2019 also suffers from a lack of originality. Quorthon went too far in trying to go back to his old style without doing anything new. He even mentions \u2018Asa Bay\u2019, from the classic earlier Bathory song \u2018One Rode to Asa Bay\u2019 numerous times on different songs on the album. Because of this, \u2018Nordland I\u2019 comes dangerously close to sounding like a poor copy of \u2018Hammerheart\u2019.\n\nBecause of production problems and some inconsistency and repetitiveness in songwriting, \u2018Nordland I\u2019 is not quite as good as the classic Bathory Viking-themed albums like \u2018Hammerheart\u2019 and \u2018Blood On Ice\u2019, but is still a very good album and a huge improvement on the preceding albums.\n",
        "\nIt\u2019s not very often that you listen to an album that makes you wonder how in the world did an individual make such music? Well, that\u2019s exactly what thought when I first heard Bathory\u2019s Blood Fire Death a few years ago. For me, this is the album that defines Black Metal along with some other albums like Transilvanian Hunger or In the Nightside Eclipse; although you can\u2019t really compare any of these albums.\n\nUntil Blood Fire Death, Bathory had released three studio albums. And the quality of the albums just got better and better after each release, and this was no exception. I mean, Under the Sign of the Black Mark was a great album; not just great, it definitely was in a class of its own. But when this album was out, it took Bathory\u2019s and Quorthon\u2019s name to a completely new dimension. To a level that no other black metal band had ever reached before. It changed the face of Black Metal, and I daresay, it changed the face Metal. \n\nThe album starts off with \u201cOden Rides over Nordland\u201d. What a perfect name for the track! You can hear the neighing of horses in the beginning, and slowly the intensity of the background goes on increasing. Eventually, it brings up a soft choir. If you are listening to it for the first time, the choir might sound like \u201cCarmina Burana\u201d. Anyways, this is the track that sets the mood for the rest of the album. It generates the perfect atmosphere, and what follows this is just out of this world music. The song that follows is A \u201cFine Day to Die\u201d. And this is undoubtedly the best song of the album. It might even be the best Bathory song; period. \n\n\u201cA Fine Day to Die\u201d starts with a fabulous arpeggio on acoustic guitar; and this is exactly what one might entitle \u2018The Calm before the Storm\u2019. I say this because what follows this beautiful, slow intro is complete mayhem. And when it starts, I assure you, it will make you jump out of your seats. The guitars, drums and the vocals kick in simultaneously. Then, precisely at 2:05, you will listen to THE RIFF; I can\u2019t really express this piece of sheer brilliance in words, but can indubitably say that this is one of the best riffs ever made. The instant you listen to it, your neck will start acting on its own, out of control and won\u2019t stop until the entire album ends. You might say that I\u2019m exaggerating here but no, I\u2019m serious. \n\nI\u2019m not going into every song\u2019s detail here, because it might take me days to portray it. There is no weak song in this album or even an average song as such. Each and every track is just mind-blowing to say the least. \u201cThe Golden Walls of Heaven\u201d sounds more like black-thrash. This song continues and amplifies the pace that the previous song, \u201ca Fine Day to Die\u201d had set in. The album continues in a similar pace up to \u201cHolocaust\u201d. \u201cFor all those Who Died\u201d is the next track, and it is a relatively slower than the previous songs. The word \u2018relatively\u2019 is very important here, since this song is in no way \u2018SLOW\u2019. \u201cDies Irae\u201d is the next song, and again very fast. The best part of the song starts at 2:23, where there is a transition in the tempo, and picks up again when Quorthon screams \u2018DIES IRAE\u2019 followed by a blistering solo. The last real song is \u201cBlood Fire Death\u201d. This is my second favorite song of the album, and another one that starts with acoustic guitar, not to mention that this is the longest song of the album. There are so many parts in this song, innumerable riffs and pace shifts. \nThe album ends with the outro. \n\nSimply put, this album is PERFECT. \n99/100\n",
        "\nThis is evil, most of those that followed are just as much of a masquerade as toddlers on Halloween. Recorded on the eve of May Day,Walpurgis Night, a Cloven Hoofed beast pressed play on a tape player possessed by the spirit of Vlad \u00deepe\u00ba, whilst Quorthon grizzled and gnarled his way through an unholy onslaught of riffs. Duc de Richleau and Rex can\u2019t save you now, they\u2019re stuck in traffic and didn\u2019t take the tube because they harbour xenophobic sentiments, your Satanic baptism is about to occur and the soundtrack is \u2018Under the Sign of the Black Mark\u2019... Satan records the first note!\n\nRather than conjuring the cold and wintry images that most black metal does, \u2018Under the Sign of the Black Mark\u2019 has the listener feeling immensely hot, sweat breaking on their brow, as if they had consumed all of The Star of India\u2019s famously colon emptying Vindaloo. And, you come back for more and more of this same hellish punishment as it is so addictive. \u2018Under the Sign of the Black Mark\u2019 wishes to imprison your soul, not in the abode of mist but behind the Gates of Gehenna. Now, Quorthon didn\u2019t wish to this upon his listeners, indeed, he was much more content with spawning legions of \u201cI AM ZE VIKING!\u201d bands. So like some Devil sick of sin, he abandoned the left hand path. But if anything, this merely heightens the sense of unbridled evil of \u2018Under the Sign of the Black Mark\u2019, as it acts as the final word in evil from one of Satan\u2019s merriest men. Others succeeded in capturing some of the feeling of evil after \u2018Under the Sign of the Black Mark\u2019, but they, fearing some sort of damnation or perhaps in search of wafers, still attended church on Sunday.\n\nWith the 230 volts of electricity in the mains unable to harness such unequivocal evil, Quorthon decided that a leaky, battery powered amplifier would be his best means of worshipping our Dark Lord. As such his tone is mainly treble and as black as hangover excrement. Unable to contact either Phil Collins or Lars Ulrich in sufficient time, Quorthon decided he would not be able to have a sufficiently evil drummer and as such simply got some fellow to go BISH BOSH BISH BOSH at varying tempos (often when he wasn\u2019t supposed to be varying the tempos at all). \n\nUnable to decide which tempo conveyed true evil best, tempos here range from quick-fire lightning fast blasts to even more oppressive grinding work outs. \u2018Massacre\u2019 set the standard for all blackened thrash that followed and is seldom passed in terms of menace and ferocity. Except by \u2018Of Doom\u2026\u2019, which features a riff so foul it forces you into the foetal position, then has you praying that the Angel of Death will only take your first born son instead of your anal virginity. However, no album so rich with iniquity would be complete without a love song. \u2018Woman of Dark Desires\u2019 is a compelling ode to Hungary\u2019s own Elizabeth B\u00e1thory, complete with a screech along refrain and the kookiest Organ solo the Phantom of the Opera never played. \u2018Enter the Eternal Fire\u2019 is perhaps the ultimate black metal song ever, sure it\u2019s a shameless re-write of Manowar\u2019s \u2018Bridge of Death\u2019 but metal only sounds this menacing every once in a black moon (I don\u2019t mean menacing in the \u201coh, the singer sounds like he wants a fight\u201d sense either). Those eerie bells give the whole song an amazing schlock and a haunting quality.\n\n\u2018Under the Sign of the Black Mark\u2019 isn\u2019t an album I can listen to every day, it\u2019s simply too much. But on those certain windy and cloudless nights, when the moon doth glow and Stonehenge is illuminated in a eerie twilight\u2026I\u2019ll deafen the banshee wails with Quorthon\u2019s masterwork and remind myself that this really does expose the second wave as the corpse painted and blackened pansies they are.\n",
        "\nI'll admit it: This was the first release by Bathory I ever picked up. I saw it beside a copy of Octagon in my local record store and decided to pick this one( Thank god.)\nJubileum is a collection of various Bathory songs, picked from the first five albums, as well as a couple of unreleased tracks...And honestly, they couldn't have done a much better job with their compilation. it's an excellent piece for newcomers to the band who want to hear their transition in sound over time, offering both gritty black/thrash classics like \"Cry From the Grave\" and \"The Gold Walls of Heaven,\" alongside the booming viking/folk sound of \"One Rode to Asa Bay\" an \"Twilight of the Gods.\"\nThe unreleased rarities included on the disc are quite interesting as well, mainly consiting of a thrash-based sound along with Quothorn's unique vocals. The first being a cleaner, surprisingly more upbeat version of \"The Return of Darkness and the Evil\" with slightly different lyrics, the lightning fast \"Burning Leather\", and \"Die in Fire\", which is a catchy tune with rather disturbing lyrics.\nThe only problem I can place is that the order of the tracks of questionable. The album skips around from viking to black somewhat often, leading one to believe that little thought was put into that category.\nNevertheless, it's all hear for people that want to sample Bathory's sound before diving into the band. Those already into them may be dissapointed that some excellent tracks were left out, but there's nothing really wrong at all with this album in terms of sound.\n",
        "\nThe improvement shown in The Return\u2026. album was evident to anyone. If the first album was still a bit influenced by Venom and Motorhead, the following one was quite different in terms of song writing and production. Quorthon grew in skills and abilities in playing instruments and the whole album seemed a bit more mature, even if it was always devastating and truly evil. Well, the technique was not excellent because they didn\u2019t need that, but the changes were near. Some of the compositions were a bit more epic and slow and in this Under The Sign Of The Black mark we have the natural continuation.\n\nThe first assault, \u201cMassacre\u201d is an up tempo song with lots of brutal sounds and obscure vocals. It could fit perfectly in The Return\u2026. album. The production is raw, especially in the drums sound that, with its power, almost deletes the guitars sound. Anyways it\u2019s always quite audible but not that powerful and this also contributes in creating a gloomier, primordial atmosphere. It seems like they are playing in a cavern. With the following \u201cWoman Of Dark Desires\u201d the new influences come directly in the riffage and mostly during the epic refrain. \n\n\u201cCall from The Grave\u201d shows epic/dark guitars riffs and a new sense of \u201cmelody\u201d for a band like Bathory. This is completely new. The song is mostly mid paced with a ritualistic tempo and truly extreme vocals. The solo here is fantastic and sounds like a horn for the long notes. This is one of the very first example of epic black metal. This march can be seen as a big influence for funeral black metal too, concerning the down tempos and the really sick air we can breathe.\n\n\u201cEquimanthorn\u201d shows no will to slow down a bit, being completely on up tempo with an evil riffage and the chainsaw bass distortion in the first line. The vocals are always raspy and brutal, showing no mercy or signs of change. Here the solo is more shredded and fast, in old thrash metal style. But with the majestic \u201cEnter The Eternal Fire\u201d we can find again the new influences, here even in a higher dosage if compared to the other songs. The epic-distorted riff are perfectly balanced with arpeggios and even some Viking chorus on the back ground. This song features a longer length and perfect epic parts. This is truly innovative.\n\nAfter that great, glorious song, one of the best from Quorthon, it\u2019s time for \u201cChariots Of Fire\u201d to destroy our ears with a brutal black/thrash riffs orgy, supported with almost blast beats tempos and apocalyptic feeling. This is where you can really notice how Bathory were important for the future generation of blacksters and, most of all, for one of the most important groups in this genre: Immortal. \u201c13 Candles\u201d is another slow march in the obscurity with again some epic passages, like in the riffs or the chorus! This is a perfect balanced song between innovation and tradition. \n\nThe hyper fast \u201cOf Doom\u2026\u201d puts an end to this milestone for the black metal genre, that was already showing some new characteristics and innovations in a sound that was still brutal and raw, but also evocative and extraordinary. Another masterpiece for Bathory.\n",
        "\nJust one year passed and Quorthon is back with an another great release and big influence for the worldwide black metal scene. In the same year another group came into the scene like a tornado: Possessed with Seven Churches. There were a lot of differences between these two groups but, in their way, they contribute in changing something in metal. If Kreator, Sepultura and, partially, the already cited Possessed were important for the death metal genre, this \u201cThe Return\u2026\u201d is another milestone for the black metal one.\n\nAfter a short intro, \u201cTotal Destruction\u201d explodes with its burden of violence, speed and malevolence. The production is far better than the debut and Quorthon, as a musician, grew enough to give a more impact to the song, starting to create truly a personal form and approach. The riffs are in pure death/black metal style with the inevitable influences from thrash metal and Hellhammer. The vocals are blacker here, so more screamed even if they\u2019re not excessive, keeping that Cronos touch. The things change when the group decides to point on the mid paced, pure evil, doom parts. \u201cBorn For Burning\u201d is an example with down tempo and rituals atmosphere.\n\n\u201cThe Winds Of Mayhem\u201d is full of raw up tempo; with the snare drum, the bass drum and the cymbal played together, on the same beat. This is a real, primordially example of black metal with screamed vocals. The sounds and the tempos on \u201cBestial Lust\u201d are more punk/thrash metal style with plenty of open chords riffs, fast sections and the mythical, clean, sharp solos sounds. After another fast black metal attack like \u201cPossessed\u201d, it\u2019s time for \u201cThe Rites Of Darkness\u201d to bring the down tempo again in an atmosphere always more and more apocalyptic, satanic and gloom. This is a great song and my favourite one here, because it\u2019s better structured in its simplicity and evilness. You can really taste what black metal was about during the 80s.\n\nWithout a second to relax, \u201cReap Of Evil\u201d destroys our ears with a massive dose of up tempo, growl vocals from hell and doom parts. The palm muting guitars parts are more canonical thrash and this thing signs an improvement in technique; but it\u2019s only during the savage, open chords riffs parts that the band shows the most evil side. If you want to know where groups like Immortal, Mayhem or Dark Throne took the inspiration for the guitars sound, check out the great \u201cSadist\u201d with a raw, long part at the beginning and a quite sudden (also for the sound) massive thrash riff on the mid paced tempo. \n\nThe final, fast as a train, \u201cThe Return Of Darkness And Evil\u201d (with a great, more epic refrain), ends this second black metal opus by one of the biggest revelations at the time and one of the best metal bands of all time: Bathory.\n",
        "\nI remember the day Quorthon died. It was a complete out of the blue thing. Few days after, a metal magazine in Italy published a quite old interview by the mighty composer with lots of even older journalists\u2019 questions during the 1984-1988 period. A part from the various curiosities about the recording process of the albums and other things, in an answer he talked about his main musical influences at the time of his homonym debut album. At the time in Sweden it was so difficult to find something metal because of the insufficient distribution. The heaviest things they could listen to at the time were the Iron Maiden but one day he discovered Venom and Motorhead and his life changed.\n\nShocked by such violent groups (for the period, of course), he began to practice the instruments with two friends. They wanted to take to the extreme that genre that was already brutal. They wanted to play DEATH METAL. Yes, that is what he said in the interview. Death metal. Not black. And the history begins here. They were very young but in a short period they had few tracks to put out in an album. It was 1984. The Bay Area thrash metal was unknown to them and the Swedish death metal period was quite far, so here we can really understand how they were ahead in mentality. I can consider him a sort of a genius for the intuition and the creativity.\n\nThe owner of the Black Mark production (we don\u2019t know yet if he\u2019s his father or not) gave them the possibility to record and the result was epochal for the growing death/black metal scene. In 1984 it was so hard to find someone who played so fast, brutal and black metal in the whole world. Anyway, don\u2019t believe to find a pure form of black metal here because it\u2019s a genre, like the others, that evolved through different bands and albums. Here we can find a sort of Venom on speed with the Motorhead dirty sound and attitude. The vocals by Quorthon are truly evil and they can be seen as an exasperation of Cronos ones. After the intro, hell\u2019s unleashed by never ending sessions of up tempo with various stop and go.\n\nThey were not technical at all but I don\u2019t care at all when you have the heart, the mind and inspiration. Each song is a pure black jewel. The guitars are fast in the riffage and the solo on \u201cThe Reaper\u201d is total thrash style. \u201cNecromansy\u201d is a bit doom with a malignant guitars work and satanic lyrics. They took this kind of lyrics exactly for their groups-influences but Quorthon, after few years, said that they were totally ridiculous and childish. To return to the music, each song is quite simple, made of catchy verses and refrains in pure dirty hard rock style. \u201cSacrifice\u201d is again total speed with a massive death/thrash metal main riff and a more melodic, excellent guitars solo. \n\nThe tempos are always in Venom style, especially in the drummer\u2019s way of playing but here they are faster. The Venom worshipper-praise-homage title song like \u201cIn Conspiracy With Satan\u201d is a clear proof of how much they loved that group. Anyway, in general, all the titles are in that direction, giving new inspiration for the future generations of black metal composers. In \u201cRaise The Dead\u201d you can hear more or less the same sound style of several mid paced Venom songs while the last \u201cWar\u201d is something unbelievable for malevolence and speed.\n\nHere Bathory yet were a very young band but they, I don\u2019t know if voluntary or not, invented something new in the whole world showing to everybody how extreme metal was evolving, making other groups follow them on the damned path to the real black metal.\n",
        "\nIt is impossible to deny the influence this Viking-obsessed period of Bathory's history had on certain metal realms, and this album in particular really lays out a blueprint for an instantly recognisable cadre of followers. It is strange how only one or two of Quorthon's albums could really be considered innovative in the traditional sense, yet nearly every recording the man and his nebulous colleagues churned out prior to 1994 has had a profound impact on what came after. Quorthon wears his influences on his sleeve: it's there in the sound, if you want to look for it, even though the man himself stubborngly and irritatingly denied the sway these influences (Venom, Metallica, Manowar, etc) had on his sound until his dying day. \"Hammerheart\" is one of those albums that people seem to unquestioningly place in a Valhalla among so many hallowed releases, but I would contend that this one belongs in the same exhibit area as Celtic Frost's \"Into the pandemonium\": a place where experiments go to be admired from a distance for making such a difference, but whose efforts are often outdone by their younger progeny.\n\nAs a starry-eyed metal neophyte in 1996, I was introduced to Bathory's \"Blood on Ice\" album when Quorthon was interviewed on a campus radio station who's metal programme I had only recently begun to enjoy, and instantly fell in love with the huge-sounding choirs, grandiose tale-telling approach and feeling of Viking pride the album invoked. I didn't even notice that the singing was often off-key or that the riffs and drumming were pretty sub-standard in a lot of ways, I was just swept away by the epic quality that I hadn't heard in much music up until that point. So, off I went to the store, looking to purchase this \"masterpiece\", only to find that it wasn't available, much to my chagrin. They did however carry a copy of \"Hammerheart\" on their shelves, which I'd read was another Viking-themed album, so though I was skeptical about checking out another Bathory album first after hearing \"War\" from the debut on the same radio show and finding it quite hard on the ears, I took the plunge and bought the 1990 album instead. \n\nAt first, I was quite swept away by the proud feeling and majestic hymns to Odin that the album contains. \"Shores in Flames\" really is a great opener, which begins with the sound of waves carrying aloft a great dragon-ship and a reflective clean guitar passage that slowly becomes busier and more involved as Quorthon begins to sing. Yes, I'm sure many Bathory fans thought that something was going terribly wrong here, and when the heavy guitars come in and the music sounds more like Manowar than anything else, I've no doubt that many a frown creased formerly eager brows. Still, having no preconceptions (or not many, at least) about Bathory left me wide open to this experience, and I absolutely loved the sound of the guitars on this record and still think they exude a wonderful vibrancy today. Quorthon's singing has been much-discussed, and in truth he was always quite amateurish about it, masking some of his ineptitudes with backing choral effects and harmonies. On \"Hammerheart\", there isn't much alteration done to the voice, unlike what can be heard on the later viking albums, so, bar a few notable sections and some backing chants here and there, what you get is the raw, untempered Quorthon at his straining best. Say what you want about the man's imperfections as a singer, he can occasionally latch on to a very captivating melody and, so long as he sticks within his range, can make it most memorable and stirring. It is this sense of melody, the narrative lyrical approach and pretty cool riff that keep this song afloat, and it reaches a nice climax when Quorthon screams \"Fire!\" and launches into one of his trademark howling guitar solos. \n\nHere though, a stark difference, not only between this and previous work, but also between Viking-era Bathory and just about all of the bands that have followed Quorthon's lead in varying degrees, makes itself known ... the solos, not to mention many of the riffs on this album, are very traditional rock and metal, something which Quorthon seemed to have been moving away from on \"Under the SIgn\" and \"Blood, Fire, Death\". Though many of the early Bathory solos are just wild pentatonic shred-fests, the speed and violence of the material always removed the need for much premeditated melody or \"lyrical\" playing. It is at this point that we must suspend our disbelief or simply ignore the stuff that's poured from Quorthon's mouth and pen, because the man clearly loves Manowar and their influence is all over this and the subsequently released nordic albums ... the influence is, in fact, as plain as the Venom inspiration that Quorthon denies played a part in the making of his early material. Now, I don't have a problem with rock soloing or rock riffs .. hell, I love rock music that rocks as much as I love metal that ... kills posers? Christians? However, if a band is going to slow down, temper their aggression, take on new influences and new sounds, they must do it convincingly, and, unlike in the old days, when you're playing this kind of music, aping your idols isn't necessarily the best way to go about it.\n\n\"Valhalla\" belongs in the middle-tier of songs from \"Hammerheart\" in terms of its level of interest, and believe me, it's a marked drop in quality from the first track. It moves along at a nice marching pace, but like most of what's on here, it's far too long for its own good and is only really held aloft by an admittedly powerful chorus. The verses are made up of Quorthon shouting about sacrifice, warriors and all that, and although the shouting doesn't sound too terrible here (and works pretty well in one of the other songs) it's simply boring to listen to and lacks conviction. Why couldn't he scream his heart out, like he did on the previous album's more mid-paced numbers? Oh, and this song features a riff lifted cheekily from Metallica's \"The Call of Ktulu\" .. nice one, Quorthon.\n\nIf you can make it through \"Baptised in Fire and Ice\" and \"From Father to Son\" you've a pretty strong disposition. The former sounds exactly like Voivod's \"Tribal Convictions\" at first, but then Quorthon starts shouting again and this time it sounds really bad. Even the chorus can't save this one, as Quorthon bellows \"Baptized!\" .. to be followed by some weird monotonous chanting that I guess completes the song title. More howling, rock soloing that never seems to end and .. god damn, just hit the skip button, this song is terrible. \"From Father to Son\" starts out with a couple of minutes of peaceful Viking village sounds: hammers clinking, people moving about, dogs barking, a woman's scream and running feet that greet the wailing of a new-born infant. It's quite nicely done actually and I've always appreciated Quorthon's attention to detail when it comes to sound effects, something he's always played with rather tastefully. Still, I'm afraid to report that this ends up being pretty anti-climactic as the song proper is a plodding affair with an annoying, slow descending riff played on both guitar and keyboard that keeps coming back in a most unwelcomed manner, and the cool verse riff is totally marred by Quorthon's attempts to sing the exact same notes along with it. \n\nBut wait ... if you've made it this far, the best is about to come. In \"Song to Hall up High\" Quorthon demonstrates for the first time his real affinity for tasteful vocal harmonies and classically-inspired acoustics. The song is a praise of Odin from the point of view of a seemingly old warrior, and while Quorthon warbles a little he sounds passionate here and the melody is really haunting, especially when he's joined by a full complement of Quorthon clones to sing the second half of the song in a several-voice harmony. For the last line, the \"singers\" all come together and sing the same notes, while the sound of gulls crying high in the sky and the gentle percussion of a cymbal can be heard. This most captivating piece leads seamlessly into \"Home of Once Brave\", and without a shadow of doubt, here is the highlight of the album. Stripped down to the most simplistic, drony riff imaginable, with drumming that merely keeps time and very slightly accents the ends of verses, the piece becomes a sheer wall of atmosphere, and the vocals have a hell of a lot of room to breathe and command the attention. Here, Quorthon's monotonous delivery is startlingly effective, even though he's practically singing one goddamn note through all the verses! Whereas Snake from Voivod would have made himself sound like a malfunctioning robot, Quorthon has just the right amount of bark and grit to his tone that, here at least, the passion sounds very honest and true, pouring out from the barer of the pounding hammerheart. I believe this song alone is what became the template for much of what bands like Graveland would purvey in the future, as it seems to take the least from traditional metal and is the only song on the album that really does carry a strong ethos of norse pagan pride successfully. The droning riff and the way it's played, with one chord strummed repeatedly with the duration of an eighth and only very infrequently shifting up a couple of tones, definitely sounds like stereotypical pagan metal before such a thing ever existed. On the other hand, the chorus is pure Manowar, in the sense that, as with many of that band's more mid-paced epics, you will hear it once and then be forced to sing along. Quorthon seems to be good at that. He's also good at imitation .. have I mentioned that before? Well, \"Home of Once Brave\" ends with something that sounds a hell of a lot like the end of \"Fight Fire with Fire\". Ah well, never mind.\n\nThe last song tries very hard to be an epic, grand, emotionally-rending tale of christian usurpation of pagan lands and hearts. Unfortunately some weird decisions make this song a lot less fulfilling than it ought to be. What's with the goofy accent, Quorthon? Seriously, it's as though he suddenly decided that it would be more Viking-like to sing in broken English and with a strong Nordic lilt that's not even his to begin with. It turns what would be a serious tale into what amounts to a comic-book farce, showing perhaps the true inspiration behind this Viking period of Quorthon's music. Also, those \"wooooooo-aaaaah!\" noises he keeps making are a lot more obnoxious than they were in the first song, not to mention those damn keyboards, which were thankfully mostly absent from the largely superior \"Twilight of the Gods\". The vocal melody keeps repeating over, and over, and over again and only the sound effects provide a slight respite. I suppose I do like the lyrics, despite the inexplicably poor English (too much mead, huh?)\n\nSo in the end, we have yet another legendary album that's legendary for reasons other than superior musical quality. It's not a detriment to metal, or even Bathory, but as I've illustrated in the previous paragraphs, inconsistency and poor execution mar at least half of the album's worth. Hey, it seems as though Quorthon decided to borrow more from Manowar than the Songbook for Mid-Paced, Epic heavy Metal (TM) after all.\n",
        "\nI wanted to start by saying that the most positive thing that can be said about \u2018Octagon\u2019 is that it\u2019s not quite as bad as some people claim, but that would be untrue. If this had been a terrible first release from an unknown band it would be easy to dismiss, but as the seventh album in the mostly perfect Bathory chronology (yeah I know, the seventh \u2013 an octagon has eight sides, it doesn\u2019t even make sense) this is one of those albums that it physically hurts to listen to. To this day I can\u2019t even look at an octagon without screaming in despair and pummelling the ground with my bloodied fists, which is why they threw me out of the University of Sheffield\u2019s conference centre. What an obscure joke.\n\nWhile its predecessor \u2018Requiem\u2019 was content to replicate the sound of European thrash bands such as Kreator, keeping more in line with the evil Bathory ethos, this follow-up sounds like nothing more than a cheap and lousy attempt to imitate Slayer, and none of it works. Quorthon\u2019s usually exceptional guitars are only decent when directly stealing from that other band, as is the case in \u2018Century,\u2019 and Vvornth\u2019s drums have achieved the unfeasible and actually become significantly more annoying than on the previous release, starting the proceedings as they mean to go on with a far-too-long drum roll on some bins, or whatever it is he\u2019s using. The production sound here is terrible \u2013 not good-terrible, like the early Bathory albums that reeked of an evil tomb, but practically unlistenable, and the double bass drums ticking away in the background almost sound like a CD fault. But most tragic of all is that the flaws can\u2019t be placed solely on the production, but more squarely on Quorthon\u2019s lousy performance, songwriting and lyrics.\n\nWhile \u2018Requiem\u2019 attempted a sort of snarled approach to the vocals, here Quorthon opts for the singing style that worked so well on \u2018Hammerheart\u2019 and \u2018Twilight of the Gods,\u2019 where it didn\u2019t even matter that he can\u2019t sing. Here it matters a great deal, especially as songs like \u2018Grey\u2019 basically see him talking over fast thrashing riffs that should probably be conveying a sense of power and urgency, rather than a bored Swede spouting ridiculous lyrics like \u201cyour clothes will always bite big chumps right out of their concrete ass.\u201d \u2018Schizianity\u2019 (nice pun there, Quorth) attempts something different, which at least shows some hope, but ends up being even less coherent than the rest in its near-doom style with the worst vocal performance of the lot. And there\u2019s a Kiss cover that\u2019s even worse than the original, figure that out for yourself. And now it\u2019s in my head, goddammit.\n\nThis is a horrible album that should never have been released, but at least things only got better from here on, to the point where the final two Bathory releases rank among the best Quorthon would ever record. I love Quorthon, in fact he\u2019s probably my favourite dead guy after Graham Chapman, but I have no idea what possessed him to release this. Certainly not the inspiring demon that influenced his classic early works.\n",
        "\nThis is the first Bathory record I got my hands on and I was forever changed that cold fall day. \n\nThe intro seems worthless to some but I think it is a good way for building suspense and creating a sense of tension. \"Total Destruction\" completely annihilates you when listening. The production sounds very raw and this is the type of sound that influenced bands for decades to come. Somehow, it is raw and heavy at the same time which is something you don't hear often. \n\n\"Born for Burning\" is a thrashing classic! On this album, Bathory really killed any other band that even thought of being in the same class. This destroys Venom and annihilates Hellhammer in every way! \n\nTo hit this in a song by song way is useless but it must be told that this album is the blueprint for black metal. There are tons of really fast riffs and other thrashy ones that really break it up and make this very easy to digest. Also worth remembering are the great little solos. Not many use guitar solos in black metal but Quorthon does it very well. \n\nThe guitar sound is not as trebly as on the first album. There are less Motorhead-inspired riffs on here as well. This is altogether darker and more evil than the first album could ever have hoped to be. The mood is black as night on every single track. There are still a few moments of rock and roll to be found, but not as much as on the debut.\n\nThe vocals are very raspy and sound evil as hell. Compared to Quorthon, Cronos and Tom Warrior may as well have been singing like Vince Neil because this is the voice of death itself!\n\nSongs like \"Possessed\" and \"Sadist\" are very memorable and wicked but it is the final song, \"The Return of the Darkness and Evil\", that really pays homage to the eternal throne of Satan. This song fades in and is true mayhem all the way through. the song is very catchy for being so fast and evil, but that is the mark of Quorthon's genius.\n\nI think what he would accomplish on \"Under the Sign of the Black Mark\" would surpass this, but for the time being Bathory had just created the masterpiece of black metal and one of the most influentual albums of all time.\n\nBest songs: Born for Burning, The Return of the Darkness and Evil\n\nBUY THIS!\n",
        "\nQuorthon might not have been the best musician in metal, but he was among the unsurpassed with respect to his artistic vision. He opened up the doors to an entirely new genre within metal and paved the way with this fantastic recording. While 1984's \"Bathory\" and the follow-up \"The Return...\" were dark and dominantly satanic, Quorthon experimented with melodies that accentuated the epic nature of Norse mythology and folklore on \"Under the Sign of the Black Mark\", giving birth to the subgenre of Viking metal. While this album was still predominantly satanic in nature, Quorthon realized the immense potential for expressing majesty and dignity through this new style.\n\n\"Blood Fire Death\" has a reputation that simply can't be challenged. While it still utilizes some of Quorthon's signature musical elements such as the long instrumental introduction and the \"Outro track\", the components of Norse mythology proudly and competently dominate, and the entire mixture turns out very homogeneous, literally as well as conceptually.\n\nThe galloping and charging horses take the listener from the introduction, \"Oden's Ride Over Nordland\", into \"A Fine Day to Die\", an epic eight-and-a-half minute entrance into the Nordic mission, to die honorably in battle in order to be hailed by the gods up in the great halls of Valhalla. How could anyone not think this is totally awesome? The serene acoustic guitar intro and quiet and echoed vocal verse is peaceful, purposeful and, quite honestly, brilliantly executed. In just under two minutes, the metal is ushered in, covering the entire audible spectrum, excellently mixed. The riffs change a few times before settling into the main riff for the song, which is written in 6/8 time, also sometimes known as waltz time. This has become a staple within black metal, and \"A Fine Day to Die\" is probably the chief reason why! The drumwork is strong and confident, steadily at a headbanging pace that doesn't leave you with whiplash, as was prominent in prior Bathory issues. Several different riffs change back and forth, along with very epic keyboard chords, giving the piece a very massive and mighty feel to it. Another strong point is the arrangement of the riffs, in that they also switch from 6/8 time to 3/2 time homogenously, so it doesn't give any impression that he's trying to be \"progressive\". The emphasis here is in the uniformity.\n\nThe next set of three tracks, beginning with \"The Golden Walls of Heaven\" carries a heavy thrash theme into the mix. The songs are heavy and quick, to the point and ending in the same fashion. \"The Golden Walls of Heaven\" opens with a more familiar introduction and attack, being that of moderately-paced blastbeats. This is a very thrashy song, not unlike something you'd hear on Kreator's \"Pleasure To Kill\", especially with respect to the rapid vocal delivery. \"Pace 'till Death\" follows in a very similar style, with more emphasis on the classic metal crunchy guitar, and it does not disappoint. \"Holocaust\" rounds out the triumvirat of thrash songs and is very much the same as \"Pace 'till Death\". These three songs are along the shorter side of regular songs on the album, between three-and-a-half and six minutes long.\n\nThe themes in Norse mythology continue in \"For All Those Who Died\", with the epic glory of keyboard chorusing replaced by heavier guitar mixes. While it is obvious that this is one of the main titles on the album, I find only one drawback to it, which is in Quorthon's vocal delivery. It sounds a bit more frenzied and less purposeful and collected. It is apparent in the way he delivers the line in the refrain, \"For all ... those ... who ... DIED!\" It comes off sounding a bit too breathy and angry, having slightly less meaning and impact and more attack.\n\n\"Dies Irae\" returns again to the black metal thrash in the prior set of songs. While it is not covering any new ground with respect to this album, it is reinforcing the power conveyed overall. In the background you can make out some very heavy keyboard droning bass chorusing effects. Halfway through the track, the gears shift entirely into an awesome mid-paced headbanger's delight, a very memorable passage amongst a thrash titan.\n\nRounding out the tour of regular songs is the title track, \"Blood Fire Death\", the main theme to the album at ten-and-a-half minutes in length. Acoustic guitar arpeggiating chords and epic-style keyboard chorusing ushers in the metal soon to follow. Once again, the homogeneous mixture of all elements hail this track as paramount to the genre pioneered by Quorthon. His vocal delivery returns not only to a more purposeful and mighty style, but he also incorporates slight melodic toning in the death style. It is obvious, yet not enough to really analyze whether he was on-pitch... which in the opinion of a vocalist such as myself, is a brilliant tactic that is well-executed! It is important to mention that he did this as well in \"A Fine Day to Die\".\n\nAll in all, this album is one that should permanently remain in at least moderate rotation in the listening queue of any black metal fan. The only drawback to the album as a whole is that it can definitely lead to hearing loss when listened to loudly. This is caused by the ample representation of the entire audible spectrum in the production. The sound is crisp, at times too crisp, and the higher frequencies can be painful on the eardrums if not careful. So, adjust your volume accordingly and you should have no problem at all falling totally in love with this album! I give it a 94 out of 100.\n",
        "\nQuorthon is gone.\n\nThe founder of the band that helped spawn the current age of black metal is gone.\n\nSomehow writing those words just doesn't seem right. It's like losing a family member if you've been into metal as long as I and most of my cohorts have. I was introduced to Bathory in 1984 when the debut cassette popped up in the \"import\" section of my local record store. I was disappointed at 13 with the garbage can-type production, but being a Venom fan as of a year earlier bad production did little to sway me one way or another. Still, the majesty and depth that was Bathory managed to surprise and delight me like no other band since the aforementioned Newcastle trio.\n\nIt was a lifelong following I keep dear to this day\n\nWhen I learned of Thomas \"QUORTHON\" Forsberg's passing I was shocked and saddened to the core. I mean, the guys that play music are supposed to be immortal, right? They simply aren't supposed to die! I had my rude awakenings early: December 8, 1980 saw John Lennon murdered in a New York street; January 4, 1986 Phil Lynott of Thin Lizzy passed over after a frantic high-speed car ride to the hospital with his mother vying to keep her son alive after an O.D.; Cliff Burton was crushed by a bus on a dark Stockholm road on September 24, 1986, not to mention Jimi Hendrix, Jim Morrison, Janis Joplin, Brian Wilson, Buddy Holly, Elvis \u2013 this list is seemingly endless \u2013 we should be used to the very death most of our bands glorify, yes?\n\nWell, I'm not. Not now, not ever I guess.\n\nFor years Quorthon was an enigma right out of a Poe novel; he managed to secure a reputation and mystique of almost total anonymity for most of Bathory's career. To see the rare photograph of him back in the day was like a priceless artifact! Not much was known about him, and even more was fabricated. To this day we're not 100% sure of what Quorthon was doing, thinking or living in those formative years. We do know that he was around 15 when he first demoed songs for the now infamous \"Scandinavian Metal Attack\" LP that showcased local Swedish bands for a one-off offering. From there letters came in from all over requesting more of the guttural-vocals and pained screams of young Quorthon. His destiny was beginning.\n\n1984 saw the debut album, \"Bathory\" emerge as one of the underground's most important and sought-after releases in the black metal genre since Venom's \"Black Metal\" just two years earlier. Right up there with Mercyful Fate, Hellhammer, Celtic Frost and the newly-emerging Sodom, Bathory was marking its spot in black metal history. \"The Return\" followed in 1985, into 1987's \"Under the Sign of the Black Mark\", which propelled Bathory into the masses even more prominently. While never keeping a lineup for more than two albums, Quorthon was as prolific as he was mysterious. Some of the albums that followed were exceptional (Blood Fire Death, Hammerheart, and Twilight of the Gods) while others simply seemed to lack some of that early magic. Still and all, Quorthon remained active and prominent in both the early scene and the newly-fashioned resurgence that formed out of Scandinavia in the early 90s. While he publicly dismissed the act of the some of the Norwegian bands as childish and \"silly\" he was proud of the fact that those bands held high the name of Bathory in a short list of influences.\n\nThen he was just gone. There was no huge \"going-out-with-a-bang\" event, no fanfare, and no full-page obituaries: he was just gone. A heart attack claimed his young life in his Sweden apartment on June 7, 2004. The man was just 38-years old. He was four years older than me.\n\nNow, you may ask if this set is worth your hard-earned $60! After all, this isn't chump change and may very well be one major purchase for a fan for a couple of months. So Chris, is the damn thing worth it?\n\nDamn right it is. Over three-hours of tunes and a DVD, not to mention a 176-page book? It's a no-brainer!\n\nBoss, longtime producer, friend (and rumored father) of Quorthon's has put together a 3-CD box set commemorating the life and recordings of his young friend. It covers a span of 1984 to 2003 and has a little bit of everything, a virtual potpourri of Bathory, if you will. Aside from the very versatile and newly remastered cut choices on this release, which also includes some of Quorthon's solo work away from the Bathory name, is the inclusion of a book and DVD. Let me first address the book. It contains 176 pages of some very rare and cool photos of Bathory in every incarnation as well as writings and musings in the man's own words. Some of it humorous, other parts are (intentionally) dark, showing both sides of Quorthon's wit and wisdom. Lyrics are also included therein. It's a fun and informative read. The set also comes with a full color, double-sided poster.\n\nThe DVD is the 12-minute hard-to-find \"Road to Asa Bay\" video and a 10-minute interview from MTV (no, that's no typo) during the Hammerheart-era. The interview is very nice to see: when one hears Cronos or King Diamond speak in interviews they are always \"on\"; in other words, they are always in character, always saying something divinely evil or tempestuous to further their mystique, which is fine\u2026it's a persona we all have come to love and enjoy. However, Quorthon presents himself as a quiet, humble, very passive and intelligent individual that doesn't care too much for the hype surrounding himself or his mystique \u2013 he simply discusses the album and you get the real feeling that you are hearing and seeing him for the first time.\n\nThe real added treat on the DVD is the final 30+ minutes of footage shot by Boss in and around Europe as Quorthon did meet-and-greets, signings, sight-seeing, short stops for radio, dinners with journalists \u2013 a lot of very cool and very rare footage. A lot of it is muffled in terms of sound, but the feeling is there and if ever there was a true Bathory treasure it's in this footage alone. A must have for any fan!\n\nLet's say, for the sake of argument, that all of the rumors about Boss and Quorthon being father and son are true. I think it must have been so difficult for Boss to assemble these recordings of his late son and offer them to us. We catch small glimpses and shots of these \"famous people\" throughout the press and such, but we never really know them. We only know what they present to us and what we take from them. Boss made one hell of a tribute to Quorthon here and it is well worth the price! You know a person has reached legendary status when \"fake death\" rumors begin swirling about. Already it's whispered that Quorthon has \"retired\" to Norway and is writing a book that will emerge in the next couple of years. Soon they will see him working at a local Laundromat or being an Amish farmer \u2013 whatever the case may be. All I know is he's gone and wherever he may be I hope he realizes what an impact he's had on a music scene so wrought with imitators.\n\nOr\u2026maybe he's reading the daily news in a Norwegian villa sipping coffee and enjoying the quiet life. Whatever and wherever\u2026thank you, Thomas, and rest well!\n\n(Originally presented in Metal Coven webzine - 8/12/06)\n",
        "\nWith such a great collection of Music, It makes me wonder why this is such a bland box set!? There is no doubting Quorthon's songwriting ability and the music showcases that much, and that is where this box set succeeds. Where it falters is pretty much everywhere else! \n\nI may as well tell you about the good of this box set first: The three main audio discs give a great overview of Quorthon's career with Bathory, which takes up about 90 percent of the space. Also included are cuts from his solo project simply named Quorthon, which takes up most of the remaining space and there are two Jennie Tebler songs, which are at the end of Disc Three. Most of the material is in a general chronological order, with most of the earlier album on Disc One and onto Disc Two and the later era material coming on the latter half of Disc Two and Disc Three. Really, you can't miss with this collection.\n\nNow, to the items that are what make this box set: The booklet, poster and DVD. Each falters in their own special ways. For example the booklet, which while it has some good info in it, there is nothing new to be found. Plus, I noticed some awful spelling in it, mostly stupid mistakes like having 'the' spelled as 'teh'. Just stupid mistakes that a spell checker could have fixed. Also one of the pages is printed out of order. \n\nThe DVD is another blemish on this box set. It has a music video for \"One Rode to Asa Bay\" along with a short interview. The DVD could have had so much more, and it's an opportunity that was completely passed up. \n\nAnd there is the poster! All I can say is that someone didn't think this through at all. The post is of the box set you just bought.... Yes, you read correctly, the poster is nothing more than an advertisement for an item you already bought!\n\nAll in all, I have to recommend \"In Memory of Quorthon\" despite its short comings. The music is a fine collection spanning the entire career of Quorthon and makes for a great introduction into the greatness that was Quorthon and Bathory.\n",
        "\nBathory\u2019s early albums are revered as landmarks of the dark side of metal, paving the way for the Scandinavian black metal explosion and, later, mellowing out and adding some folk touches to pioneer so-called \u2018Viking metal.\u2019 The first three albums all followed a very similar style before Quorthon\u2019s artistic vision expanded to epic frontiers, preferring the claustrophobic atmosphere of a dank and echoing tomb. Although this isn\u2019t black metal in the modern sense of the term, owing far more to the grittier side of British heavy metal such as Mot\u00f6rhead and particularly the Satanic band Venom (though the late Quorthon denied having heard them previously), the dingy production, snarling voice and thunderous drums create a distinctly blackened and hopeless atmosphere that encourages intrigue and morbid fascination to overshadow the relatively primitive musicianship.\n\nThe original title for this release was to be the exuberant \u2018Pentagrammaton,\u2019 until several people with either dyslexia or a short attention span mis-read it as \u2018Pentagon.\u2019 Bathory\u2019s name is taken from the Hungarian Countess Elizabeth Bathory, also a popular subject in the lyrics of Cradle of Filth, who drank the blood of around seven hundred virgins over the course of a few years in order to remain eternally youthful. The man behind the band is the late Quorthon, whose real name is the subject of some debate even on his tombstone, and for these early releases a drummer and bass player form part of the band, in the form of Stefan Larsson and Rickard Bergman here, in the years before Quorthon took full control of the performances himself.\n\nHe isn\u2019t the greatest guitarist in the world by any means, occasionally seemingly recycling Mot\u00f6rhead riffs and playing simplistic guitar solos, and his snarling vocals aren\u2019t the most riveting, but his skill lies in the enthusiasm and genuine unsettling atmosphere of evil that\u2019s created. Bathory\u2019s self-titled debut set the competitively low standard that many modern bands struggle to attain by downgrading their accidentally-hi-tech equipment or trying to forget how to play. None of the songs on \u2018Bathory\u2019 are complex beyond a mere speed change, and none get anywhere near the four minute mark, relying on speed and violent aggression, with a little focus on catchiness, where Quorthon\u2019s later compositions favoured a more thoughtful pace and eloquent tone. If Bathory\u2019s discography does indeed show a process of maturity, at least until the mid-nineties when things went into a bit of a mid-life crisis, 1984\u2019s \u2018Bathory\u2019 is without a doubt the most juvenile, but far more convincing than any of the more recent shouty, angsty bands that dominate the kids\u2019 rock charts.\n\nThe introductory track, like all Bathory intros to come, is far too long-winded, but perhaps necessary for \u2018method listeners,\u2019 if such a thing exists (I\u2019m pretty sure it does, as I\u2019ve been one on occasion) to allow their trivial and quite happy life to slip away and be replaced with a more solemn and depressing demeanour, to prepare them for the twenty five or so minutes that follows. The sound of a slowed-down Big Ben is mixed with muffled wind sound effects and what may or may not be voices , or just more wind. It\u2019s all quite unsettling and understated, setting a more authentically creepy mood than some of the other kitsch horror film inspired songs I\u2019ve written about recently. The first real song scratches its way into existence as the sound effects fade out, and the style soon becomes standard fare: a roaring guitar accompanied by blasting drums, both sounding distant and muffled at the far end of the crypt, while Quorthon snarls and rasps in-between playing riffs. The style is very reminiscent of Venom\u2019s archetypal song \u2018Black Metal,\u2019 released a few years earlier, but given a significant kick and replacing the stupid rock-n-roll lyrics with a descriptive scene-setting of Hades. There\u2019s not enough in this song to really make it stand out with the exception that it comes first, but it defines Bathory\u2019s early sound.\n\n\u2018The Reaper\u2019 returns to perhaps my favourite subject matter in the whole of heavy metal, that of the inimitable Grim Reaper. The lyrics, written in the first person, don\u2019t do a disservice to Death, and one of the most incredibly cool moments of the album comes when Quorthon yells \u2018I\u2019m coming to take you!\u2019 and breaks into a guitar solo. Nice! The vocals are more legible this time than in the last song, and oddly the vocals and guitars both sound a lot like Dave Mustaine of American thrash band Megadeth, even though their first album wouldn\u2019t be released for another year. Eerie. \u2018Necromansy\u2019 manages to be the most satisfying song thus far, taking a slightly slower pace that allows for more emphasis on heavy riffs and an admittedly catchy drum beat. Quorthon\u2019s vocals sound oddly further back in the mix here, which actually sound pretty good, though this does mean that the band has to rely on a crashing of cymbals to add emphasis in the chorus, which comes out sounding rather less than excellent in the tinny production. The guitar solo sounds more fitting on this one, playing alongside the other instruments rather than doing its own thing, and the song benefits from being a little longer than average in this regard.\n\nUnfortunately, the same cannot be said for \u2018Sacrifice,\u2019 which feels drawn out and repetitive in the middle of the album, sounding a lot like the first song and even more reminiscent of Venom\u2019s \u2018Black Metal\u2019 than that was. \u2018In Conspiracy With Satan,\u2019 despite the great title, also suffers from being a little uninteresting after time, and the vocal growls are almost impossible to discern this time. As I said earlier, the album doesn\u2019t try to impress with its technical ability, but this middle section disappoints me by being too predictable and samey, lacking the driving enthusiasm of the faster songs and the enjoyable pace of the ever-so-slightly-slower ones. The remainder of the album is a lot more rewarding and even a little varied, with the immortal \u2018Armageddon\u2019 epitomising Bathory\u2019s aggression and seeming to beckon an apocalypse with the impressive sonic scape at the end, filled with distant wailing guitars. The bass even gets a miniature solo spot, which is always nice to hear especially as it\u2019s relegated to covering Quorthon\u2019s back the rest of the time, and although the main guitar riff could easily be found on a Mot\u00f6rhead album, it works perfectly. The only issue is that the relentless pounding of the drums has significantly lost its impact at this point in the album, meaning that this song would work better standing alone or separated from similar-sounding pieces on a compilation, which is how I first came across it spliced between slower Bathory pieces on the excellent posthumous collection \u2018In Memory of Quorthon.\u2019\n\nMy favourite song on the album is the comparatively epic \u2018Raise the Dead,\u2019 returning to the tolls of Big Ben (though not an exact sample as that would make it at least fifteen o\u2019clock due to the number of chimes), and fading into a quiet heartbeat. This is a far cry from Pink Floyd\u2019s \u2018Dark Side of the Moon,\u2019 where the heartbeat builds anticipation of a pleasant, dreamy guitar intro coming along any second now, and more along the lines of hearing footsteps approach your room in an empty house. When the song starts, it\u2019s clear that things have mellowed out slightly, even more than \u2018Necromansy,\u2019 and it\u2019s clear that the emphasis is going to be on enjoyment more than violence as Quorthon yells \u2018dust to dust\u2019 before the verse begins. Everything about this song is early Bathory at its best, slowing down a little to create an even better atmosphere and to allow the vocals to be understood and the guitar solo really enjoyed. After a gong crash ends the song abruptly, the downbeat finale \u2018War\u2019 brings things right back to speed, abandoning the progression of the previous song in favour of Quorthon\u2019s fast comfort zone, and why not? The guitar makes some cool mistakes that I\u2019m glad weren\u2019t rectified in the studio, and the song is pretty simple, just yelling about war. The track-list boasts an \u2018Outro\u2019 at track ten which is in many ways the adverse of the introduction, doing the same thing but only lasting for twenty seconds.\n\nBathory\u2019s debut is far from the most impressive example of Quorthon\u2019s artistry, but it made a significant impact on its 1984 release. At only twenty-seven minutes it should seem far too short, but somehow doesn\u2019t, and even if this was only the first side of an LP I think a significant break would be called for before playing the reverse. This raw, dirty and wicked style, which is arguably called black metal, would be continued over the next two albums and perfected in \u2018Under the Sign of the Black Mark,\u2019 balancing the aggression and sheer catchiness present in this album into Bathory staples such as \u2018Woman of Dark Desires.\u2019 Nevertheless, it was the fourth album, \u2018Blood Fire Death,\u2019 where Quorthon really started getting interesting, perhaps looking back over his works and noticing the higher quality of slower songs such as \u2018Raise the Dead\u2019 in order to craft yet another significant sub-genre...\n",
        "\nBlood Fire Death, the fourth album by pioneering Swedish black metal band Bathory is arguably the most influential black metal album ever. Since it's release countless bands have copied the the innovations of this album.\n\nBlood Fire Death displayed an unexpected progression from the first three Bathory albums. The first three albums, Bathory, The Return of Darkness and Evil and Under The Sign of the Black Mark were simple raw primitive black metal, whereas Blood Fire Death was much more epic, and atmospheric.\n\nThe album opens with the wonderful track Odens Ride Over Nordland, and it is quickly apparent that there is a focus on the atmosphere of the music, there are no vocals, just sounds of horses and chariots. This builds to the first real song on the album, the epic and intense A Fine Day to Die. Opening with an acoustic guitar and spoken vocals, the track builds to a powerful mid tempo song with a few amazing solos.\n\nBlood Fire Death contains not only long mid tempo epic tracks, A Fine Day to Die, and the title track which is amazing. There are also several shorter up tempo songs, a few of which sound almost like thrash.\n\nThe songs show a progression in song writing and arrangements. Many of the songs do not use the verse chorus structure rather incorporating various riffs and acoustic passages. The lyrics have become more matrue, no longer satanic but focusing on viking history, culture and the loss of that culture at the hands of christian invaders to Scandinavia. The vocals are mostly shrieked, and sometimes buried by the guitar tone. The guitar tone is low and very distorted. The drums suit the songs very well, during the faster songs the drums are very bombstic.\n\nMost of the second wave of black metal took their basic ideas from Blood Fire Death. If you like black metal, this is a must have, but if you like black metal then you should already own Blood Fire Death\n",
        "\nUp until (and including) \u201cUnder The Sign Of The Black Mark\u201d, the music of Bathory was extremely aggressive, raw and occult, a literal \u201cCall From The Grave\u201d. The release of \u201cBlood, Fire, Death\u201d, however, signified the initiation of some changes in the way Quorthon approached his artistic creations: the songs had become longer in duration, some lyrics did focus on the narration of battles and epic themes, while a choir could now be heard singing along with Quorthon in a number of refrains. \n\n\nWith \u201cHammerheart\u201d, it seems that the innovations first introduced in \u201cBlood, Fire, Death\u201d acquire a more central role and establish themselves as the main components of Bathory\u2019s music. Most songs last more than six minutes and the riffs, although solid and heavy as always, aren't - generally speaking - as fast as before. It seems that Quorthon is now more interested in creating and communicating a certain epic and atmospheric feeling, and doesn't attempt to reach supersonic speeds with his guitar. Certain Black Sabbath influences become now more apparent than ever. Moreover, in his attempt to achieve this eerie and war - like atmosphere, Quorthon doesn't hesitate to add acoustic part to his songs, where he also tries to sing more melodically (unfortunately, he doesn't always succeed in this endeavor). Furthermore, a choir of either male (probably viking sailors) or female voices (probably valkyries) accompanies Quorthon in bridges, refrains or introductions, contributing to the revelation of a mystical, almost mythological, environment. In conclusion, the final result may be more melodic than before, but tantalizing and tempting as always. \n\n\nWhen it comes to the lyrical content of \u201cHammerheart\u201d, Quorthon pays homage to his fearless ancestors, the viking rulers of Nordland and raiders of the northern seas. Up till now, Quorthon had been a faithful disciple of hell, a violent desecrator of everything that considered itself holy and sacred. In \u201cHammerheart\u201d, he modifies his role, and his ambition now is to become a storyteller of the wonders of the viking era, a Snorri Sturluson of his own age. Standing somewhere between myth and fact, legend and reality, the lyrics of \u201cHammerheart\u201d embark on an inspired journey to the viking world and give us a detailed account of a viking warrior\u2019s life: from the time of his birth (Father To Son, Baptized In Fire And Ice), through the occasions when he ravages and plunders foreign coasts (Shores In Flames), to the time when feels his death is imminent and envisions the gates of Valhalla beckon him to enter (Song To Hall Up High, Valhalla). \n\n\nThe first three albums of Bathory became an extremely significant factor in the creation of European black metal, as their influence on bands like Immortal, Marduk or Emperor is more than just obvious. \"Hammerheart\", on the other hand, fueled the fire of Enslaved, Einhejer and Borknagar (just to name a few), so that we can nowadays speak for the development of another metal genre, namely viking metal. Many claim that it was actually \"Blood, Fire, Death\" that highlighted the beginning of this particyular genre. I disagree: \"Blood, Fire, Death\", did provide the basics, but it was \"Hammerheart\" that put viking metal into the right dimensions. In this sense, \"Hammerheart\" could be considered one of the most important albums of Scandinavian metal. \n\n\nDedicated to the memory of Quorthon, 1966 - 2004.\n\n\n\"The vast gates to hall up high \nShall stand open wide and welcome you with all its within\nAnd Oden shall hail YOU, Bearer of a pounding Hammerheart...\"\n",
        "\nWhen I stop and think about it, Vikings are pretty much awesome. I mean, for starters, they\u2019ve got sweet helmets with horns in them, and they usually carry battle-axes (and everyone knows battle-axes are completely 100% cool). They pillaged, ransacked, drank, sailed, and did whatever the Hell else they wanted to do because they were Vikings.\n\nSo why am I talking about Vikings right now?\n\nBecause that\u2019s all I can seriously think about when I listen to \u201cBlood Fire Death\u201d by Bathory.\n\nWith every riff and every growl, I can\u2019t get the picture of a group of Vikings storming through a town center, destroying everything that they dislike. \n\nNow, I\u2019ll be quite upfront with you here: I\u2019m not a big fan of black metal. Dissection and Emperor never really caught my attention, and really the only band that I find myself listening to frequently is Ulver, but that\u2019s mainly due to the unique folk influences in their music. But thanks to a cover of \u201cA Fine Day to Die\u201d by Emperor, I immediately set off on a quest to uncover more Bathory. So I kicked my dog, grabbed my spear and helmet, and went off on my quest (basically, I yelled at my mother, grabbed a burrito and a new shirt, and browsed the internet).\n\nIn the great year of 1983 (in Sweden), a young boy by the name of Quorthon formed Bathory just out of fun. He was able to record just two tracks (out of generosity), but they gathered such unexpected attention that he was asked to do a full album. And thus began his career. Now, Bathory is considered to be one of the forefathers of Black Metal and Viking Metal. \n\nSurprisingly enough, Quorthon manages vocal duties, as well as the guitar work, some percussion, and the effects on almost all of Bathory\u2019s releases. So for the sake of proper kudos, here's the line-up for the band:\n\nQuorthon - vocals, guitars, percussion, effects \nKothaar - bass \nVvornth - drums \n\n\u201cBlood Fire Death\u201d is a bit different than your run-of-the-mill black metal outing. For starters, there\u2019s very little atmospheric touch. This is raw, straight-forward, and blistering evil. If anything, this could almost be like thrash-black metal. However, the first two tracks might have you claiming me to be a liar. \u201cOdens Ride Over Nordland\u201d is a haunting intro, complete with eerie effects, cries from horses from a battlefield, and unless my ears are mistaken, the sound of flames. Then, just as it floats on, the equally chilling and calm guitar intro begins its climb, and so starts \u201cA Fine Day to Die\u201d. Oh, and what would be a black metal track without some chanting? Yea, there\u2019s chanting. But just when you think you\u2019ve figured it out, a huge wall of distortion and blasting drums hits you right in the jaw. \u201cA Fine Day to Die\u201d is a masterpiece, to say the least. It\u2019s aggressive, raw, and full of hatred. Mix that in with a pounding guitar riff, a thumping bass, and pounding drums, and you\u2019re treated to black metals finest. It\u2019s epic, to say the least, but don\u2019t expect this from any of the other songs (save the last). \u201cThe Golden Wall of Heaven\u201d forgoes any of kind of beautiful opening in favor of untapped power, since it comes flying out of nowhere, gritting it\u2019s teeth and never letting up it\u2019s un-relentless attack. The intro to that song is all kinds of awesome, since there\u2019s a bit of a military drum roll mixed in with a climbing guitar. And the verse riffs play victor to all, throttling the song forward at the blink of an eye. Don\u2019t expect any type of slow down either, since \u201cPace \u2018Till Death\u201d is virtually the same way. \n\nHonest to God, listening to this album is like getting punched in the fucking face. It\u2019s literally that heavy. Also, it\u2019s almost impossible for myself to describe the rest of the songs on here since they\u2019re all of the same nature. \u201cHolocaust\u201d and \u201cFor All Those Who Died\u201d are as equally brutal as the first few tracks, and just as amazing. \u201cDies Irae\u201d is really the only different one. The song itself is equivalent to being hit in the head over and over with a sludge hammer, but at certain points, there actually seems to be a hint of melody. But the closer (\"Blood Fire Death\") is almost like \u201cA Fine Day to Die\u201d, which makes it stand out. It follows almost the same formula, as it has some chanting in the background over a quiet guitar. But then it begins to rip forward and spearhead the beginning with power. For all of you big black metal fans out there, this is probably one of the tracks that you\u2019ll love the most, since unlike the other songs on this album, it does have a slight atmospheric touch to it. During the middle of the song, it suddenly cuts out to just a serene acoustic playing, with chanting in the background. Brilliant? I think so. But that certainly doesn\u2019t take away from it being vicious and cruel. A wonderful way to end one of the most wicked albums I\u2019ve ever heard.\n\nThe guitar work is also something that should be highly praised. While most of the riffs are basic and straightforward (which is why I thought this felt like thrash-black metal), the soloing is superb. One only has to listen to the soaring solos on \u201cA Fine Day to Die\u201d to be captivated by them. \u201cThe Golden Walls of Heaven\u201d even features some classic whammy-bar dive bombing before Quorthon begins his shred fest. And that\u2019s another thing: the solos aren\u2019t melodic at all. They are balls-to-the-wall chaotic, and they don\u2019t ever slow down. Even on the title track (which is slightly slower than most of the songs present), Quorthon never lets up his shredding duties. \n\nAnd his vocals are equally as impressive. He doesn\u2019t sing, he doesn\u2019t talk, he just growls and screams his way through this whole album. But that\u2019s also a bit of a drawback, and what I mean by that is that since he doesn\u2019t have a great vocal range, it can get a bit repetitive after awhile. But he\u2019s good at it to the point where it won\u2019t really irritate you that much. I mean, on \u201cDies Irae\u201d, he spits out his lines in a chopped fashion, adding even more frenzy to the song. It\u2019s hard to pinpoint his best performance on this album since it all sounds alike, but if I had to choose, it\u2019d probably be \u201cA Fine Day to Die\u201d, because at points he seems to wail a bit more to add a bit more emotion to the song. But it\u2019s the lyrics that sell his vocals. Besides having one of the most intriguing lines of all time on \u201cA Fine Day to Die\u201d with \u201cThe elder among the men looked deep into the fire and spoke loud with pride, tomorrow is a fine day to die!\u201d, Quorthon is a lyrical master on this album. On \u201cFor All Those Who Died\u201d, he cries out \u201cFor all those who cried aloud, But whose tears were never heard, For questioning one almighty father, Of a heavenly distanced world.\u201d. And while \u201cThe Golden Gates of Heaven\u2019s\u201d lyrics are interesting in their own right, there\u2019s a secret message hidden in it. The first letter of each line, for every verse in the song, spells out SATAN. Take a gander, if you will:\n\n\u201cSilent watching gaze\nAcross the blackened plains\nTwo eyes like burning embers\nAwaits the moment for the\nNorth star to blaze \u201d\n\nTo me, that\u2019s just clever. But even more clever are the lyrics to \u201cDies Irae\u201d, but that involves all of the lines, so I\u2019ll leave you to look up that one later.\n\nThis album isn\u2019t perfect, however. While I love all of the songs, I just can\u2019t help but point out that they all sound the same. They follow the same structure almost, and after awhile you might have to switch tunes. For instance, while \u201cHolocaust\u201d and \u201cDies Irae\u201d have basically the same intros. Now, they\u2019re phenomenal songs by themselves, but if you were listening to this album in whole, you\u2019d think you were listening to the same song again.\n\nThere\u2019s really a lack of a dominant bass on this album, however. You can hear it due to older sound-quality, but that\u2019s really about it. It\u2019s just there; you can hear it, but that\u2019s all there is to it. No fills, variations, nothing. I think some more intricate bass work would\u2019ve been nice on tracks like \u201cBlood Fire Death\u201d, because at points in the song (like during the acoustic section), there was room for a few notes here and there. On the other hand though, the drum work is strong. While it\u2019s undeniably basic, he keeps the beat perfectly and never goes balls-out crazy, which is a good thing. And he can coordinate his kit pretty well to make some interesting intros, like his military-style drumming on \u201cThe Golden Walls of Heaven\u201d. \n\nThis is easily the best black metal album that I own. With its raw power, it completely caught me off-guard. I\u2019ve got a feeling, however, that many typical black metal fans might be put off to the thrash influence in some of these songs, but I assure you, it\u2019s still amazing.\n\nOverall Rating \u2013 4.5/5 (90)\n\nRecommended Tracks\nA Fine Day to Die\nThe Golden Gates of Heaven\nDies Irae\nBlood Fire Death\n",
        "\nHoly shit this one came in as a surprise. \n\nI really enjoyed Quorthon's \"Twilight of the Gods\" a lot, an album, which I\u2019d put into the top 10 Scandinavian metal releases I\u2019ve heard so far and the only real masterpiece that Bathory ever released. Then I heard about Quorthon changing his sound after \"TOTG\" and got curious. I was expecting a slight change in style, but not this! \n\n\"Requiem\" is an album chock-full of chaotic old school thrash riffs and sloppy craziness similar to early Brazilian death/thrash acts. Quorthon is spitting, gargling and screaming his lungs out (CROSTITUTION!!!! UARGH!), pounding on the skins relentlessly while beating the harshest tones out of his guitar. \n\nIt's clear that Bathory went towards a thrashier approach on \"Requiem\" but hardly have I heard an album with such an intense feeling of primitivism, which is, in this album's case, a good thing, since it really creates some kind of ritualistic, barbaric atmosphere. The only similarity to older Bathory works is the intro of the first track \"Requiem\" which sounds a bit as if the album would develop into a well-known stomping rhythm, which mainly appeared on the albums before this one.\n\nNormally, I'd criticise this album of being devoid of originality, the lack of technical prowess and sloppiness in the instrument handling, but \"Requiem\" does work for some reason - it simply bashes your skull in. It pounds, pounds and never lets you go. The rhythm section, while being quite sloppy, is extremely heavy, relentless and intense while providing an enormous amount of catchiness. \"Requiem\" is simply, for the lack of a better term, a \"fun\" album to thrash yourself to. \n\nIt can hardly be seen as a serious release in Bathory's catalogue, since all the sloppiness, the primitive riffage and the to-the-point lyrics simply command you to thrash your way to an early grave. No thoughtful poems, no literature, simply a skull-basher for the thrash loving metalhead. \n\nI know I should give this one a low score for being mediocre and full of the aforementioned flaws, but for some reason, I have to rate this higher because I've rarely heard an album which is so much fun to listen to. \n\nRecommended to anyone looking for a quick dose of skull bashing.\n",
        "\nThere is one great issue with this album: You cannot listen to it: Give the album two minutes and you chant along with the battlehymns on this album. Give it another three minutes and that's you fully dressed in the re-enactment kit, a horn of mead in your hand, and a sword in the other; whilst you've just dug out that LEGO Dragonship your parents gave you for your 4th birthday, and you try to balance your 250 lbs (including beer gut) on its tip. \n\nThe album clocks in at about 57 minutes for 7 songs - the tremendous length of each of the hymns allowing for plenty of warchanting and pillaging your entire bedroom closet. \n\nIt picks of rather quiet, with the waves beating against the shore, with a quiet part the follow it before \"Shores in Flames\" kicks off and you find yourself toasting to your Germanic ancestors. The fury continues in an epic style through \"Valhalla\", \"Baptised in Fire and Ice\" and \"Father to Son\", until you reach the accoustic \"Song to Hall up High\", which honors Valfather Odin and is a truly emotional song. \"Home of Once Brave\" is again a battle hymn highlighted by guitars that make you seem in battle. Finally you reach \"One Rode to Asa Bay\", which has to be the best song on the album. It starts off with a man galloping through the woods, before you have the main song kicking off, carrying on until you reach the Solo at about 5:30, and then the short accoustic part at about 7:30 until the end - all the time able to sympathise with the suffering of the people under the allegedly not peaceful christianisation of Scandinavia. \n\nTo talk of the music itself - the studio is obviously a garage, and the sound quality is not always the best, but quite acceptable. The guitars are heavy and distorted, but their riffling allows enough scope for plenty of epic feeling, which is highlighted by Quorthon's vocals that are sometimes plainly clain, yet sometimes with a raspy touch quite reminding of a vikingr. The songwriting is amazing, and the sporadically used keyboards only add to the truly epic atmosphere, etc etc - so by the time you have finished the album you are put before the haunting choice whether to play it again or to play it again. \n\nNow of course, don't expect this album to be in your possession for too long - you are much more likely to find it abducted by your mates leaving a note that they have borrowed it, on a rather frequent basis. \n\nAlthough all of Bathory's viking-inspired albums are absolutely great, if you are only going to buy one of them, buy Hammerheart: I've owned it for some years now and there hardly passes a day without listening to it; a true masterpiece that will be such until the end of time; so if you are a fan of the genre (although I know plenty of people who favor other genres who LOVE this album!),it is THE album for you to have.\n\n(review originally written for Amazon.co.uk)\n",
        "\nIt goes without saying that Hammerheart and Blood Fire Death were not just some of Bathory's greatest works, but also for the subgenres of Viking and black metal. Both albums saw explorations in neo-classical composition, acoustic interludes, clean singing, and a lyrical base revolving around Norse mythology. Supposedly, Twilight of the Gods was the creme de la creme of this style. It topped both albums in its towering scope, showed a big step up in Quorthon's skills as a guitarist and songwriting, and was hailed as Bathory's most \"epic\" album to that point. While it certainly lives up to its nature, it walks a fine line between epic and cheesy. \n\nNow, on a basis of musicality and composition, this release is fucking ace. Powerful, driving sections of sustained power chords are backed by slow powerhouse drumming, which gives the music a seriously mountain-like atmosphere. The riffs in these sections are straight-out epic heavy metal with some folkish feel. These passages are drawn out just the right amount of time before it can be labelled as repetitive, and they often lead into solos or acoustic passages. It's the moments like these on \"Under the Runes\" and \"Through Blood by Thunder\" that help the album out immensely. Quorthon's shredding neo-classical solos provide plenty of epic ear candy, and the acoustic guitar passages that open and close the title track are nothing short of jaw-dropping in their display of musicianship and atmosphere. Things are layered very wisely; the electrics are backed by acoustics for climax and power, or vice versa. Layers of deep baritone vocals are used on \"Through Blood by Thunder\" and \"Hammerheart,\" the latter of which is a totally neo-classical work that gives the album a sense of closure.\n\nAnd now comes where I flame this album. Quorthon's vocals are fucking horrid. His clean singing was tolerable on BFD and Hammerheart; the former, because it was the first attempt at doing such, was traded with the harsh screams, and was kept to a bare minimum; and the latter because it only served as another tool of the music. But here, he actually tries to be a lead vocalist. The bad thing is, I believe the man actually convinced himself to think he was a good vocalist. His lower range singing isn't too bad; a little rough, but it suits the dramatic tone of the music perfectly. The choir effects on the closing track are rapturous, and \"Blood and Iron\" is probably the best song on the album vocally. It's the songs like \"Under the Runes\" and the title track that will make you cringe in disgust, though. Quorthon attempts (I emphasize the word \"attempt\") to go above his range, and fails horribly. Sour notes, lack of emotion or charisma in the voice, and a nasally, strained voice. It seems like Quorthon is attempting to size himself up to a band like Manowar; and while he may surpass musically, the vocals damn near ruin the songs. Upon first listening, I just took it as an acquired taste. But the more I listened and dissected the vocals, I came to the conclusion that Quorthon struggles to maintain competency throughout the album's course.\n\nThe lyrics do help things out a bit, though; the larger-than-life feel of the music coexists perfectly with Quorthon's lyrics focused around Norse mythology and Viking lore. The title track takes a different stance on things, though; it almost seems like a social satire. There are plenty of lines to chant along to, and some moments when used in the context of the music will definitely raise some horns.\n\nThis is one of the only Bathory albums that really didn't do it for me. The music is damn genius: epic, atmospheric, and ballsy with tons of guitar virtuoso. Unfortunately, the vocals will probably make your nutsack shrink in horror. Sorry guys, I'll stick with Under the Sign of the Black Mark.\n",
        "\nBathory is just simply one of those bands that was spawning creations far ahead of the times. Granted that Venom is often credited for creating black metal, they truly only receive such credit due to coining the term with there 1982 album, there music is just thrash with Satanic themes. Despite being influenced intially by Venom, Bathory ended up creating a legacy of their own. Quorthon's first three albums seem embrace Satanic and occult themes, and are essentially, the first true black metal albums, as they create the raw atmosphere and demonic vocals that is a commonplace today. Blood Fire Death however, was an entirely different concept. This album is credited by being the first true viking metal album, incoporating atmospheric elements and far more epic themes.\n\nThe actual music here still features Quorthon's demonic vocals, which sound quite typical as black metal of today, yet considering this was before black metal existed really, this shows how ahead of his time Quorthon truly was. The guitars seem to be composed in a very simplistic manner, yet the riffs are quite powerful. Those present on the tracks A Fine Day To Die and The Golden Walls Of Heaven are very energetic. Some of the songs seem to focus on atmospheric repetition, for example on the title track, which is done very well, and allows the mind to almost get lost in the music at times. The title track is simply amazing, standing at over ten minutes in length, yet feels as though it still ends far too soon. This track is enhanced with a slight backing choir, which is almost haunting in it's own way. Easily the best Bathory song in my opinion, and one of the best for this genre. Bathory's lyrics are mainly about war, epic battles, fantasy, and viking oriented themes, along with some hidden Satanic messages.\n\nThis album is nothing short of a cult classic, it's hard to believe it's age really. It's eternal albums such as these that do not diminish as time goes on. Thats how you know it's special.\n",
        "\nWhile I do like Bathory very much, I have to admit that I'm not Quorthon's greatest fan. I enjoy all his Viking metal releases and his black metal ones as well (hell, I even like \"Requiem\" to an extend), but he rarely released anything I was completely satisfied with. It's not that I found any faults in his music, it just didn't touch me where it should. Don't get me wrong, the man sure was a genius, spawning two entire genres on his own, but I never quite grasped the brilliance (which is undoubtly present). \n\nThings changed with \"Twilight of the Idols\" though. It might be a calm and restrained album, but it manages to be atmospheric, epic and beautiful while it still pounds your head in with slow, heavy riffage. Quorthon's vocal performance is probably the strongest in his career (only rivalled by the \"Nordland\" albums), his voice just fits so well into the musical compositions. \n\nThe album is filled with sombre acoustics and stomping rhythms. The use of acoustic guitar on this release is fantastic and especially shines in the title track, \"Blood and Iron\" and \"Under the Runes\". A few songs contain narrated passages which fit so surprisingly well that you wouldn't want to miss them at all, the drumming is meaty as hell and supports the rhythm section tremendously - the production on here is simply the best that Bathory ever had (including the \"Nordland\" albums). \n\nYes, I'd take \"Twilight of the Idols\" over \"Hammerheart\" any day. It might not have its bite and hints of aggression, but improved songwriting, better production, better vocals and more atmosphere. \n\nLocating flaws on this album is pretty difficult, but maybe Quorthon's vocals, even though they are very strong overall, do sometimes sound slightly out of tune and too strained (best example - verses of \"To Enter Your Mountain\") but that is just a minor quibble. \n\nI recommend this to all fans of Viking and Heavy metal. It's an essential listen. \n\nIf you're new to Bathory's music, stay away from the releases after this, as a mediocre era began after \"Twilight..\", but somehow, the late Quorthon managed to recapture the Viking metal spirit in the Nordland albums, but sadly we won't be able to hear what the guy had in mind.\n",
        "\nBuried beneath the buzzy, lo-fi production of Under the Sign of the Black Mark is some well crafted music. The songs vary quite a bit in tempo, but generally share a common structure: a driving, energetic base laid by the rhythm section, embellished by the occasional guitar lead (furious tremolo picking while the left hand meanders capriciously about the fretboard) and, most importantly, Quorthon's tremendous vocal performance. Quorthon's raspy delivery is pleasantly abrasive and yet the lyrics are clearly understandable.\n\nThe real magic of this album is the syncopated interplay between the vocals and the rhythm section, which generates an intensity none of Bathory's contemporaries in the late 1980s could rival. Unfortunately Bathory themselves would drift away from this formula in subsequent releases, as they began to forsake rhythmic complexity in favor of a more epic sound; and to my ears, none of their later albums ever managed to recapture the energy of this album. But this album itself remains a masterpiece, and arguably spawned an entire genre of music.\n",
        "\nWell folks, it started here; partially. I won't even bother discussing the reputation of this album, as I'm only here to discuss the music in its content.\n\nClearly, this was recorded in one of the smallest studios on the face of the earth. The shredding, trebly guitars sound like they're being played through age-old practice amps, bass is distant, and the drumming is some of the most straight-forward, simple drumming you'll ever hear. (You won't hear a single hi-hat; only the bass drum, snare, and ride cymbal are used. How's that for \"kvlt,\" fuckers?!) This LP's production is dirty, grimy, lo-fi, and raw; just like the production of nearly all black metal albums to follow suit. Quorthon sounds like an evil Lemmy here, and you won't find a trace of clean vocals. Bathory are one of the only bands, partially due to the time of its release, to channel pure juvenile aggression into a type of music that truly comes off as evil when it's done right. \n\nQuorthon's songwriting chops definitely weren't at the \"Twilight of the Gods\" level, which I'm grateful for in irony. (Can you imagine a 10-minute \"Armageddon\"? Fucking crazy.) You'll only find a total of about 3 or 4 riffs each song; thank God that they're good ones. The riffs here are highly reminiscent of Motorhead, but with a pushed degree of speed and aggression. Solos are composed mainly of tremolo picking and tapping, but it works perfectly within the bold, evil context of the music. All of the songs follow a rigid structure of: intro, verse, chorus, verse, chorus, solo, chorus, end. There's some variation here and there, but you won't find a song here that comes anywhere close to 4 minutes. Bathory's blitzkrieg attack is in, out, and leaves a trail of destruction so vast that it helped forge a genre.\n\nAnd of course, the lyrics. With classic song titles like \"In Conspiracy of Satan\" and \"Necromansy,\" how the hell can you go wrong? The lines of the chorus in every song will pretty much force you to raise the horns and shout along, especially on the ripping opener \"Hades\" and \"Sacrifice.\" (Admit it. You sing along to it just like I do, you bastard.) By no means are the lyrics intelligent, poetic, or mature; but with music so raw, primitive, and dirty, that's not what you should expect.\n\nPure classic. That's all that needs to be said. Get out the bullet belts, beer, and have a good old time with true classic underground metal.\n",
        "\nThis is not black metal and what is \u201cviking metal\u201d but an ambiguous commercial term that defines sucky folksy rock-based music with later metal techniques and viking themes? I mean, it\u00b4s not a separate genre or subgenre, so what is Hammerheart? Let me describe the music: in essence this is slow to mid-tempo heavy metal played with the techniques and distortion that Bathory used in earlier albums, the production is raw and the guitar tone sounds abrasive. Rhythmically they no longer bash the shit out of everything but slow down to hold a simple beat to mantain your attention while cymbals are used for dramatic purpose. Percussion goes from tribal rhythms to a constant walking pace or a slower but violent Bathory style stomp beat.The voice is sometimes raspy sometimes cleaner sung that show theme variations and the mood of the song; together vocals, percussion and choruses make this music sound a bit like opera at times in its explosive moments. The songs Valhalla and Home of the once brave, are similar to Enter the Eternal Fire of the Under the sign album in its narrative composition, but the difference is that here the pace and rhythms are simpler and linear to give way to the dramatic elements that make this music both \u201cviking\u201d and epic but are perhaps too dependant of the vocal parts. The best song here is One rode to Asa Bay, it is a musical mourning of sorrow for the loss of a better age, a deep concern for this dying age devoid of culture and traditional wisdom, it is all lost nothing can be saved now. The ideas behind the music are both tribute to Nordic Culture and Quorthon\u00b4s conclusion that the world as it is now is fucked up for good, it is resentment, anger and hopelessness; the viking themes are metaphors to express those ideas, which is why I don\u00b4t think this is \u201cviking metal\u201d. \n\n\nFor those who haven\u00b4t listened to this cd, you can appreciate this music in two ways: 1- like well done heavy metal/rock that visits the first generations from its progenitors to the bulk of heavy metal makers with a refined sense of narrative tempos and \u201cfeeling\u201d. 2 \u2013 like a narrative semi-soundtrack of rock melodramatic storytelling, like a theatrical musical play. However perhaps because it\u00b4s too much heavymetal in structure the \u201ctheatrical\u201d elements simply do not blend with the music but float like superficial decorations; although the intent of the music might have been profound, you understand the emotions like given instructions but not \u201cfeel\u201d them.\n\nMy final comment is that despite the sincerity of the music where other \u201cviking metal\u201d bands are pure gimmick is that if you listen to Bathory\u00b4s discography in one single day with Bathory \u2013 Bathory you get excited, with The Return you get shocked, with Under the sign you get satisfied, with Blood Fire Death one gets fucking blown away and with Hammerheart well... let\u00b4s just say that it\u00b4s hard to say goodbye to satanic Bathory. I\u00b4d say this is a good album because it shows the epic side of heavy metal with vivid artistry, intelligence, class and emotional integrity.\n",
        "\nYes, I am a sucker for atmospheric music. But this music is more beautiful than anything else Quorthon has done. Ever. Crystalline guitar passages flow like clear northern rivers over the massive, booming drums, and are accentuated by acoustic passages both within and without the regular passages. The singing is often done in a more baritone voice than on Hammerheart, though it's still obvious it's the same person singing.\n\nThe production is probably the best among the first era bathory releases (1984-1991), but still bears many similarities to Hammerheart. The main differences are in the snare, which is A LOT more echo-y, and the guitars, which are more transparent. The whole production is drenched in reverb, which could end up in a mess, but Quorthon keeps it simple here, and creates a masterful production that envelopes the listener and leaves him/her with a feeling of awe of the power of the gods.\n\nAnd yes, this release is slow. It is content to stroll along at a doom-like pace through most of the CD. This can be construed as a metaphor of pessimism for a world that is in its last throes, though, in all honesty, it's more likely just a way of keeping things \"uncluttered\", as it were. Whereas Hammerheart (the album) was more focused on the vikings themselves, the imagery of this album is more of the vikingland. The lyrics are even better than Hammerheart's, with vast imagery and attention to the natural elements. It describes the exploits of the vikings with more attention to the surroundings, which paints a much better picture. And the music is a lot more grand and epic than Hammerheart, though, in the process, lost the intensity of Hammerheart. \n\nHowever, it does have intensity in this release, but it's saved for the symphonic closer (which is actually a cover of Gustav Holst's \"Jupiter\", but with viking themed lyrics.) That song makes up for ANY shortcomings the rest of the album has, and is the song I want played at my funeral. \n\nWhat are these shortcomings? Sometimes, this album can drone on. The songs are long, and slow, and often (in songs like Blood and Iron, Twilight of the Gods, and Bond of Blood) a non-avid bathory fan can get bored. \n\nHowever, I cannot make a review of this album without mentioning Under the Runes, which I feel is the strongest song on this album. Words do not describe it. It's just awesome. The acoustic intro is mystifying, and the rest of the song seems perfectly executed. \n\nOne thing, though, is that this album isn't for everybody. Those looking for intensity, look elsewhere. Those looking for speed, look elsewhere. Those looking for clean sounding drums, look elsewhere. Those looking for palm muted riffs, look elsewhere. This is all about being big and epic\n",
        "\nThis is the final part of Bathory's \"satanic trilogy\" after this they would do Blood Fire Death which is kind of an in between album, mainly moving into the nihilism of warfare, and the ability to transcend it to create a meaning for existence. The first three Bathory albums though in essence defined all black metal that would follow (at least in Norway), listen to the intro that turns into \"Massacre\" and tell me that it doesn't remind you of Darkthrone's Kathaarian Life Code. Bathory moved into a field more extreme then almost anyone else, even Slayer. By using the Motorhead idea of everything louder then everything else Quorthon created a harsh listening experience that really rubs raw your whole soul. The drums bash away in a minimalistic style that creates something almost ritualistic, never letting up they blast away with a harsh tone that if in the right stereo actually hurts, the guitar tone is bone dry and all trebble, blasting wave after wave of hatred and contempt. \"Woman of Dark Desires\" is even more harsh, with a drum sound that is so loud so insane, and all by accident on here, or so Quorthon says. That combined with the guitars which seem to move in an ambient sense, only several notes at a time, making me think of Ildjarn, then in the chorus there is a little more distinction, but also on this song keyboards are added that are way ahead of their time, this is repeated throughout the whole album, The kind of keyboards Countess would attempt to replicate, somehow adding a dark sinister horror movie atmosphere to the proceedings. \n\nQuorthon's voice is possessed on here, demonic screams with a perfect tone, want to know what Dead was trying to do, it's all right here. This album is harsh and unrelenting even with the slower songs like \"Call From the Grave\" and \"Enter the Eternal Fire\" which even though slower and more atmospheric, are just as harsh as any of the faster songs. Of course one knows that Darkthrone and Mayhem both stole riffs from this album, but in an attempt to match the fury and intensity of the blasphemy and darkness that is contained on here, and of course since they were also original in their own ways, they managed to transcend the stamp of copy cat bands.\n\nIf you are thinking of picking this up just remember, though it is in many ways well produced, it is as harsh as putting your hand into an open flame, with metal stamper drums that hit hard and evil vocals of hatred, guitars that buzz with an intent to kill and a bass that is quite loud, but also quite distorted. Everything on here is designed to basically rip the flesh from your body and then rejoice in the misery of those actions. Combined with the dark occultic atmosphere, everything on here is what black metal wishes it could be, and of course very often bands suceed, but it's also good to listen to the originators, and not just the bands to follow.\n\nThis is like all Bathory an essential purchase, sure Quorthon was never fond of it, but it is effective in creating a demonic atmosphere, if hell existed this is what it would sound like. Cold, morbid and unrelenting.\n",
        "\nThough many do dismiss this album when compared to later Bathory albums (and that is understandable) I think that this is often a little misguided, as though you can hear some Motorhead moments on here, Bathory, unlike Venom, created metal that feels evil and above all feels black from beginning to end.\n\nOpening with the ominous bells (Big Ben slowed down in fact) with a number of other sound effects, one is drawn into a dark world of shadows and flickering candles, I visualize a sorcerer working his dark magick as a storm brews around him. This Luciferian power that seemed to possess Bathory is quite strong even here on the intro (which is though a little long). When three minutes later Hades starts we are put into dark atmospheric black metal, Quorthon's vocals are just as hateful and grim as ever, even from this early date he sounds like a demon from hell. Now of course this song is more old school and almost punky then most, but it still works. Unlike Darkthrone who has become more punky but without the malefic spirit (i.e. become more like Venom then Bathory) Bathory's style on here is very evil and the spirit is manevelent to normal human boundaries. And yes even in this song we given a slightly epic breakdown, which makes one think of what Bathory would end up with.\n\nEvery song on here is a classic, some more then others of course, but each one is excellent. One thing though many think Bathory was ripping off Venom, this is due to the similar song-titles, and similar sound, but, even though Venom came first, Quorthon was not originally into the metal scene and was not even aware of Venom until after the release of this album for people kept comparing Bathory to Venom. I believe this is true, because many other bands (like Slayer, Sodom, etc.) would often use similar song titles, and the general feeling of Motorhead and Exploited meeting Black Sabbath was going around everywhere at this time, and given that, even though Quorthon states he was more influenced by Oi! punk at this time then metal (and I think punk musicians did the drums and bass) what he ended up creating was something beyond most metal and all punk, something inspired by a power much more demonic and evocative. \n\nThe production does suffer, but it is actually better then the one on The Return.. as it is clearer. However all Bathory has great use of production for atmosphere, and this is no different, even if it wasn't on purpose the sound creates a dark, dank ancient atmosphere, and the lyrics having the sorcerous feeling only highten this. Which by the way was one thing Bathory always had over Venom and many other metal bands, the lyrics really do as Quorthon said, they paint pictures with words, creating dark visions of war, necromantic charms, sacrifices upon pagan altars to satan, etc. It really is quite powerful, and there is a reason why black metal fans, no matter if pagan or satanic or nihilistic will almost always cite early Bathory as being one of the best, that is because it is, and it still holds up, none of this has aged, it still has the same necromantic power it always has had.\n\nSo in closing, if you like black metal and have not heard this or the other old Bathory albums then you cannot really consider yourself a real black metal fan. Bathory is the beginning of everything and you must listen to these albums. This one is in particular as important as any of the others, for it helped to create the type of sound and feeling bands like Darkthrone and Countess would go for. Ancient, warlike, spectral, demonic black metal, that even if it has some Motorhead moments never loses the evil atmosphere.\n\nEssential.\n",
        "\nOkay, so I'm not exactly the biggest BM fan, so why would I review Bathory? A friend of mine insisted that I get this album, and after putting it off for ages, I gave in and bought it. Needless to say I'm glad I bought it. This album is full of great riffs and solos, unique and effective production and powerful vocals.\n\nThere's a ton of great riffing in this albums. While a lot of the tunes go through at light speed, particularly the brutal Equimanthron and Massacre, some songs are slowed down to great effect. Enter the Eternal FIre is a massive epic full of great mid-tempo riffs, before breaking into a quite nice bit of melodic respite. It's an awesome track, probably the best track here. Very effective use of synth on that track too. 13 Candles is another mid tempo beast that is very effective and super heavy. Or course, a lot of the fast tunes are good as well, with plenty of great tremelo picked riffs coming at you. While some of the faster tunes will sound similar on the first few listens, repeated listenings will reveal plenty of differences in the tunes.\n\nOne thing that's common in Black Metal, or at least in my perception of Black Metal is the production (or lack of it). The production in this album is pretty freaking cool, I thought. The guitars are slightly reverbed, and the drums are very loud. The vocals are buried in the mix, but the high pitched screams come out really nicely. This album is a great example of how unusual production can work very well in some cases, as the screaming and the guitars sound very sinister buried in the mix. The screaming is great too.. It's pretty evil, fairly harsh, but it complements the music perfectly and it's fairly comprehensible.\n\nI don't like super depressing black metal. But I do like Black Metal that rocks, that's full of great riffs, that is heavy and has interesting and appropriate production. Maybe you're someone who normally doesn't like this kind of music. Well, give this album a chance. Chances are you'll be headbanging along to it before too long.\n",
        "\nThis review is difficult to write, since I am a huge Bathory fan and would easily give this box a 100 based on my view of the music. However, I will not go in-depth on the actual music contained in this box set, because if you\u2019re not familiar with the music of Bathory, this is not the place to start; instead go pick up the Jubileum series. If you are familiar, then nothing that I say will change your opinion, since there is really nothing new here, except for a cover of the Sex Pistol\u2019s \u201cGod Save The Queen,\u201d Black Sabbath\u2019s \u201cWar Pigs,\u201d which is musically faithful to the original, but Quorthon\u2019s vocals here do not measure up to Ozzy, a very interesting cover of Motorhead\u2019s \u201cAce Of Spades\u201d that is so different from the original that it is reminiscent of the way Type O Negative\u2019s cover of Black Sabbath\u2019s \u201cBlack Sabbath\u201d sounds like a completely different song, and The Beetles' \"I'm Only Sleeping,\" which I cannot really compare to the original since I'm not too familiar with it.\n\nThe real review here is the merit of this box set in tribute to Quorthon (R.I.P.). As mentioned earlier, the 3 CD\u2019s here actually offer less rare and unreleased material that was present on the Jubileum series, so they offer little to add value to this package. \n\nHowever, the jewel of this box is the DVD. The DVD contains a quality copy of the epic \u201cOne Rode To Asa Bay\u201d video, officially released for the first time, instead of the low quality bootleg versions that are floating around the web (You Tube, etc.) or the horrible copy that is on the \u201cThe True Black Essence\u201d bootleg CD. Now you can watch the video in an acceptable video quality on your TV with really good sound. \n\nAlso on the DVD is a small interview that Quorthon did with MTV about the progression of Bathory from Black Metal to Viking Metal that was cool to see. Finally, the DVD wraps up with about 20 minutes of camcorder footage that Boss taped during a European tour Quorthon made to promote \u201cHammerheart.\u201d Most of the footage is of Quorthon doing meet and greet stops at record stores where he autographed tons of Bathory memorabilia while chatting with \u201cThe Horde.\u201d It was great to see this footage and it made me long for the return of those days, where the kids were all wearing Bathory, Kreator, Sodom, Exumer, Celtic Frost, etc. shirts, instead of today\u2019s youth wearing Godsmack and Limp Bizkit shirts. \n\nAnother point of interest was the 174 page booklet that comes with this box set. It is the same dimensions as a jewel case printed on glossy paper stock. Although it is nice to have the band discography, history, etc. all nicely edited into a tidy little book, there really is not much new here. Almost everything was culled from the Bathory.se website. The only thing that was bit cool and exclusive was letter from Order From Chaos\u2019 Chuck Keller talking about his friendship with \u201cQ\u201d and that he misses him.\n\nThe box also comes with a poster that measures approximately 19\u201d x 22\u201d and is quite a disappointment, to put in mildly. I cannot fathom how a tribute to a deceased \u201clegend\u201d of Metal could have been dishonored like this! The poster is a hybrid of two separate designs printed on one side! How could Black Mark cheap out like this and not print this as a two sided poster is unfathomable. On the left side is the famous 1987 photo of Quorthon\u2019s fire breathing in London and right next to it is a design for the contents of this very box set! If you have the box set, what purpose does a poster serve telling you what you already know? Obviously, this poster serves as a promotional tool to sell the box set, so why not spend the extra dollars to print this two sided, so that those with the box set see the Quorthon picture in all it\u2019s glory and the other side could be used at record stores for promoting the box set?\n\nThe entire box set itself has the 3 CD\u2019s and the DVD packaged in jewel cases with the poster folded up to about the size of a slim-line jewel case, which the aforementioned 174 page booklet also being the exact size of a jewel case, so that the entire contents slides into a cardboard sleeve style casing. This is really kind of a let down. I would have expected something more inline with some of the beautiful limited edition packages that Nuclear Blast has made (Crematory\u2019s \u201cRemind\u201d in a flight case, Nightwish\u2019s \u201cOnce\u201d box with ornamental globe, etc.) or even the packaging of the \u201cLord Of The Ring\u201d movies in the collector\u2019s box editions that contain small sculptures and beautiful artwork. Instead, you are presented with jewel case CD\u2019s and DVD that all have the exact same lame booklet that describes the contents of the box set. Why couldn\u2019t each CD and the DVD come with different booklets that describe why certain tracks were Quorthon\u2019s favorites or Boss\u2019s favorites; what made the songs chosen special? These are the kind of things that needed to be answered and they were not. \n\nI gave this box an 85, even though the legacy of the music deserves a 100, because of the weakness of the packaging of this \u201cIn Memory of Quorthon\u201d box left me with, I dare say it, the feeling that this box was more of a way to cash in a final time on the great works of Quorthon, rather than pay him the proper tribute that he deserved. Kings are supposed to be laid to rest in monuments of stone; this King, perhaps the \u201cKing of Kings,\u201d was buried in a pine box.\n",
        "\nLet me start off with this. If you haven't heard or at least heard of this album before, or have not heard of this BAND, then you better get with it, buddy. \n\nAbsolutely classic release from the mind of Quorthon, most certainly the first hero of the evil Black Metal world. What I refer to as the evil one is the real one, not synth worship fakes. \n\nThe album starts off on an upward musical progression built upon audible doom. The title is perfect - \"Revelation of Doom\". The second track commences with some raw old-school riffing in the black/thrash vein. \n\n\"Born for Burning\" is a perfect example of how Bathory worship bands like Toxic Holocaust achieve a certain sound, but it will never be what Bathory once was!! Fucking destructive song patterns, raw guitar work in Satan's name, and blasting drums. This is black metal in its earliest form of even the slightest evolution. Very minimal. Very cold and distant. Bathory is root to the world of Black Metal. \"The Winds of Mayhem\" is yet another prime form of the earliest black metal. The first solo rips in towards the two and a half minute mark. \n\n\"Possessed\" slightly reminded me of the earliest Immortal I had heard, heavy repetitive rhythms accompanied by the deadliest screams from Hell.... \"I am POSSESSED!!!\". The solo after this second chorus is beyond words. It lays beyond hopes of what a modern day musician could create. Sure it's possible, but it won't be Bathory. Bath \"The Rite of Darkness\" as well as \"Reap of Evil\" are by far some of the best examples of the early Bathory era. Quorthon's motivation for creating music and titling/writing song started to differ past the next album. Not just that, but they're part of the blasphemous, nun-defiling audio soundtrack of an evil ritual. \n\nThe next two tracks further develop this album in its entity, \"Sadist\" offering a killer early Thrash breakdown that multiple bands later renominated and further developed it themselves. The breakdown is without a doubt the most stand-out one on the album, giving reminder of the \"Born for Burning\" style of Quorthon riffs. The last track is again as evil as it gets, with about the most appropriate title; \"Return of Darkness and Evil\". \n\nIn final conclusion, I've always considered this album to be at the top of my black influences list, as well as the self/titled. For comparing influential groups in the early '80s, this is certainly up there with (if not ahead of) Possessed and Sepultura. There is no room for filler, this is a straight up black/thrash attack from 1985. Let the blood of Bathory flow!!! \n\n\u00a9 CanadianMetal.com 2006\n",
        "\nWell, firstly I must comment on the artwork. It is definitely astonishing, and summarizes norse mythology better than any artwork could do. The album\u00b4s story is based on the viking beliefs, with an original protagonist. Worth having it especially for it\u00b4s cover artwork.\nThe album itself is a perfect example of Viking power, but sometimes it can be a bit boring or dull. Besides that, it creates an adequate epic ambient, with war sounds and very strange noises.\nI find Quorthon\u00b4s voice especially beautiful and varied on this album. You won\u00b4t hear any grunts or angry screams (and, personally, I find him much more original in this viking style). The choruses are also, as always, very well suited. \nI still find a little influence of Quorthon\u00b4s satanic addiction.\n\nThe Intro is one of that strange Bathory tracks full of those \"strange noises\", that actually gets you into the epic ambient. Followed by Blood on Ice, a long track with nice riffs and the chorus following the melody. Man of iron is addicting, being simple but strange and charming. Pity that it has to be so short. I find One Eyed Old Man\u00b4s music not suited for the calm lyrics, but it has that strong viking furor, except when old Odin speaks. The Stallion and The Sword are a bit similar for me, but The Stallion is much better in musical terms. The Woodwoman has a nice intro and Quorthon vocal performance is one of the best of the album (ah, but he shouldn\u00b4t criticise the poor wooodwoman, it isn\u00b4t her fault to be so ugly as Quorthon says). The Lake... there are some differences in opinions about this track. Some people think it is one of the worst of the album, and others, the best. I\u00b4d go for the second option. Here I can find the real Norse Spirit, the sorrow and kind of evil; that sticky melody that creates images of malevolent Gods and beautiful reminiscents of the Scandinavian landscapes. Gods of Thunder, of Wind and of Rain is very fast, but lacks that spirit, and the vocals are not so clear as in the other tracks. However, it has much power and a very nice riff near the end, worth listening to the song. Beauty\u00b4s peak is reached by the acoustic The Ravens, but it has the same problem as Man of Iron: TOO short. Finally, The Revenge of the Blood on Ice sounds similar to Blood on Ice, but better. I don\u00b4t have much to comment on this last track except that it is a good ending for the Album. However, a final acoustic track (not another Outro, please) would have been great.\n\nWell, this is what I have to comment on this great Album. A must-have for viking fans like me. Not very good for headbanging, but for reassuring the love or respect for the civilization. Hail Quorthon, Son of Loki!\n",
        "\nThis album, Bathory\u2019s fourth offspring, began an evolution for the band, a slide away from pure black metal towards a sort of epic Viking music, not totally dissimilar to Manowar\u2019s more grandiose moments. For me, the results of said influence were not among the best ideas Quorthon would provide his audience with, but as far as Blood Fire Death is concerned, the balance of both styles is a fine compromise. And WOW, for the first time other band members (Wornth and Kothaar of the great Norwegian tribe of unpronounceable warriors) are actually named and pictured!! If in fact they actually perform or not is a question of some mystery, but no matter, the album is a feast of moods and metal all the same. \n\n\nOpening with the truly atmospheric \u201cOdens Ride Over Nordland\u201d, we segue into the ethereal acoustic intro to \u201cA Fine Day to Die,\u201d which is easily one of Quorthon\u2019s finest epic tales ever. Better sound than ever gives new life to the guitars in the mix, while the drumming is as booming as it was on \u201cUnder the Sign of the Black Mark\u201d. More mid-tempo blasphemy makes itself manifest in \u201cThe Golden Walls of Heaven\u201d, while \u201cDies Irae\u201d is an all out thrashing whirlwind that stands as one of the better raging numbers in the band\u2019s arsenal. I must admit that \u201cPace 'Til Death\u201d is just plain silly, but the album redeems itself with plenty credibility to spare as the EPIC title song spreads itself across most of the record\u2019s second side. An acoustic start, a raw riff, a mid-tempo grind, and an ethereal chorus backed up by what sounds like orchestral kettledrums combine gives this cut an otherworldly resonance. A black metal opera unto itself, its power would rarely be equaled by and BM contenders. \n\n\nFrom here Bathory\u2019s path became crooked in my view. For the next two albums (Hammerheart and Twilight of the Gods) the Viking rock took over, the band returning to BM brutality although half-heartedly thereafter. Sadly we can\u2019t look to Bathory for more material of this ilk, given Quorthon\u2019s untimely demise recently. But never you mind, the three Bathory albums I review here are essential metal classics \u2013 All Hail!!\n",
        "\nBathory\u2019s first two records both blasted really imbalanced sound jobs, too much treble on the first, and a massive sonic wall of black sludge on the second. But with UTSOTBM (as it will hence be called) the problems were rectified, and thus this is the first Bathory album where you can clearly make out all the subtleties of the band\u2019s now well-established black metal noise. This is a good thing, because the thunderous drumming and Quorthon\u2019s impassioned rasp gather much more force than ever before. \n\n\nBut what makes this yet another great chapter in Bathory\u2019s inverted bible is the songs themselves which are almost uniformly among their best, and indeed some of the best ever in Black Metal. Period. \u201cMassacre\u201d is the perfect hi-speed adrenaline rush to begin matters, and when you compare this cut to later, similar ditties from later BM warlords such as Immortal the influence is so thick you can smell it. \u201cWoman of Dark Desires\u201d on the opposite hand, moves slowly and celebrates the vampiric mistress who unknowingly lent her name to the band, Elizabeth Bathory. \u201cCall From the Grave\u201d is another moody piece (note a snatch of Chopin\u2019s \u201cMarche Funebre\u201d in the instrumental section) whilst \u201cEquimanthorn\u201d balances thrash with mid-tempo pounding, as well as giving Marduk one of their album titles with its lyrics (\u201cEven the Heavens Shall Burn When We Are Gathered\u201d). \n\n\nThe real towering inferno of this album, however, is the eight or so minutes of \u201cEnter the Eternal Fire\u201d, which is simply one of the greatest BM songs ever. Evoking hellish torment at it\u2019s finest, it boasts some of Quorthon\u2019s best writing and vocals yet, while remaining a resonant song, brutal delivery and all. \n\n\nFor my money, UTSOTBM is perhaps Bathory\u2019s most accomplished work, and easily outmatches scores of competition within BM\u2019s annals. Changes would be on the horizon for Bathory\u2019s music, but in 1987, a good 3-4 years before the global BM charge would really dominate, there was only one worthy of the appellation black metal. And the gathered masses deliver their chant: \u201cVenom is dead, Bathory is king\u2026 long live Quorthon and his cursed offspring!\u201d Well maybe not, but it sounds cool\u2026.\n",
        "\nThe first band to outdo Venom in the all-important areas of satanic imagery and fearsome mood, Sweden\u2019s Bathory pretty much invented the very idea of black metal in all aspects. Musically, lyrically, and in graphic appearance, Bathory said it all first, which would be a daunting enough task for an entire band to take on, much less one person. But at most stages of their legacy, Bathory was just that. Quorthon (real name Snorre Ruch) is the dude to hail (blame) for codifying the first setoff rules for what BM should look and sound like. \n\n\nThe band\u2019s 1984 self-titled debut was a screechy, treble-drenched collection of songs that came across like a demo Venom might have recorded after a night of obscene alcohol abuse. Some good tunes were there, but on the whole it didn\u2019t say a lot about Bathory\u2019s potential. The Return, however was a different crock of bisque completely. First instead of being washed out with high-end white noise, the sound here is so dark the songs seem to crawl out of a shadow rather than simply begin. It\u2019s all about the black here, and it doesn\u2019t matter if the song is high-speed mayhem or slow plodding menace. The mood of impenetrable darkness is absolute. Even better, the album actually features something of a running storyline, inconsistently spinning a yarn about Satan reclaiming the earth from the grasp of God. Song wise, we\u2019re in good shape too. A few thrashing blasters appear, the best of which being \u201cTotal Destruction\u201d, \u201cBestial Lust (Bitch)\u201d, and my personal fave, \u201cSadist\u201d. But Quorthon really straps on the goat horns for \u201cBorn for Burning\u201d, a slow, deliberate track parading the Bathory evil vibe in spades, and a real highlight of the band\u2019s catalog. \n\n\nThe bottom line is without the shadow of Quorthon casting itself across metal, Mayhem, Darkthrone, Emperor, and hundreds of other corpse painted denizens of our planet just wouldn\u2019t have known what to do with their spare time. Bathory is an icon and The Return is their blackest hour.\n",
        "\nFor all the people that say black metal is new and like Dimmu Borgir or whatever. They don't know shit. This is pure Black Metal. Evil, entergetic, and necro as fuck. This has riffs down the throat provided by the one and only Quorthon. The production on this is......well, there is practically no production values. It just adds to the raw intensity and heaviness of this album and is pretty revolutionary for 1985. \n\nWe have \"Revalation of Doom\" which is a long 3 minute intro full of random noises and screams. You can feel the imment doom aproaching. \"Total Destruction\" has riffs, and a lot of them. Quorthon has some insane vocals. No one else sounded this evil at the time. That opening riff is just beyond heavy. Great way to open the album. \"Born for Burning\" is a midpaced Black/Thrash song with more killer riffs and vocals. \"The Wind of Mayhem\" is more of the same. Quorthon has an intresting way he plays his leads, which is straight out of the Tom G. Warrior sense of playing guitar. \"Bestial Lust\" sounds kind of like a Venom song, but this is more evil sounding than Venom ever thought they could be. \"Possessed\" is a song that dosen't really stand out and is a bit average, but even the average on this album is still pretty damn good. \"Reap of Evil\" is some more raw, dirty Black/Speed Metal. Yes, some of this album does sound similiar, but when it's this good, who cares? \"Son of the Damned\" is fast as hell with awesome little break half way through and before you know it, it's over. Oh yes, Quorthon is a lyrical genius, something that needs to be pointed out. \"Sadist\" starts out similiar to a few of the past songs, but half way through we get......THRASH BREAK!!! and it commands headbanging. Best riff on the album right there. \"The Return of Darkness and Evil\" is probably the crown jewel of the album. The riffage is a lot more memorable and that chorus is infectious. \"The return of my master Satannnnnn!!!\" Yeah, this is evil done right. The outro is kind of pointless, and I believe it is now at the end of every Bathory album. At least the CD versions.\n\nWell, this is some awesome early, raw, speedy Black Metal. This is the 2nd in a series of 4 albums that Bathory did that were worth checking out. The influence is unquestionable. If you like the Nordic stuff they did later on, you'll probably hate this. For everyone else that likes Venom or Celtic Frost, this is right up your alley. RECOMMENDED.\n",
        "\nThe trouble with being Bathory is having such a classic back catalogue to emulate is no mean feat. Not that the legend has already been tarnished with the nonchalant release of the Requiem and Octagon albums in the mid nineties. These quite awful long players were a far cry from the grandeur that was found on \u2018Blood, Fire, Death\u2019 or \u2018Hammerheart\u2019. In fact, Bathory had run out of steam by the time \u2018Twilight of the Gods\u2019 was released in 1991.\n\n\nSo here we are in 2001 and a new Bathory album which could have been an absolute killer. The trouble with \u2018Destroyer of Worlds\u2019 is that it borrows much of its contents from Requiem and Octagon, as well as Hammerheart. There are sublime moments that echo the bands glorious past on tracks like, Day of Wrath, Lake of Fire, Ode, and the epic nature of the title track. Here we find a new surge of passion that is 100% classic Bathory.\n\n\nBut then we have the thrashy mess that condemns the rest of the album to oblivion. To be fair the faster material does have its moments but there never seems to be a good reason for their inclusion. They are like album fillers when set against the aforementioned slower tracks. Destroyer of Worlds is definitely the bands finest opus since \u2018Twilight of the Gods\u2019, and yet it is a mixed affair that will both please and annoy anyone who is into the bands past history. It is a pity Quorthon couldn\u2019t find it in himself to give the fans what they wanted to hear. He has obviously split the difference and that has resulted in an album split into two halves.\n",
        "\nBathory's Requiem is almost a reverse swansong of sorts. Many fans were split into two when Bathory started meddling in Viking / Folkish anthems rather than blackened metal of the earlier albums. So Quorthon went and wrote a thrashing album with the Christian-bashing back intact. I believe this album, when placed beside its previous effort, is even more heavy. This album takes Bathory to a place where God-bashing, primal riffs, and substandard drumming work well.\n\nThis album is not Bathory's musical climax, nor is the heaviest work; but it still does what it set out to do... quell the naysayers! The riffs are very heavy, almost an 80's German thrash feel (such as Kreator or Destruction). The drums, like I said before, are very substandard, but they keep the time, and they actually work well within this album. The lack of frills within the drumming helps the listener focus on the thrashing riffs and the lyrical concepts of this album. The vocals are very raw, almost like a grating shout: a mix between the black metal rasp of old and the German thrashers hoarse shouts of the late 80's.\n\nThe production is actually quite good for the style. Despite what others may say, I believe that the instrument levels and muddy quality lend an amazing chaotic air to the album. By having the guitars and vocals high in the mix, the focus is on the lyrics and guitar riffs. The drums are good enough to be heard, and the bass can be heard most of the time chugging along. The muddy quality of this recording makes this album sound more primal than thrash albums though. There is a very energetic feeling about this album, and a sense of urgency that Quorthon uses to his advantage.\n\nOverall, this album is best viewed as a way to qualm naysayers about Bathory's heaviness. Is should also be viewed as a stepping stone in one metal's most amazing careers. Once again, this is not Quorthon's best musical work, but the lyrical content, the riffs, and the basic structures are impressive. This is recommended to fans of thrash looking to get into Bathory, as well as Bathory fans and completists. This is not an essential album, but a fun listen none-the-less.\n",
        "\nThis album is damn near artistic perfection. Bathory blends classical structure and theory with modern music years prior to the popularization of this concept in black metal. The intro track shows this fascination that Quorthon had acquired with classical music. \"A Fine Day to Die\" sets the stage by introducing the battle and viking themes early on in the album, sounding production-wise centuries old, faded but not wrinkled with time. The rest of the album holds this sound and atmosphere well, yet has more energy in the tracks, ditching the \"2-minute intro\" approach found in \"A Fine Day to Die.\"\n\nThis album is extremely enjoyable to listen to, and makes you want to dust off the ol' viking cap and have a go at another nation. It's beautiful, in that regard. The vocals are discernable, yet included the scream not quite popularized yet in black metal - another element placing Bathory above the rest (especially at the time). They feel rushed at parts, yet rightfully so, as the music often feels lightning fast, whether or not it's simply mid-tempo.\n\nSome parts of songs feel like Venom in guitar simplicity, yet it's still wonderfully done, with much less cheese to be found here. Dark, but still not hyperbole. Bathory strays away from Venom's humorous take on Satanism and occult themes in this album.\n\nThe best part? I'd have to say it's \"Blood Fire Death,\" a war anthem that's perfect for running, weights, everything. This is one of the greatest pieces ever composed, and is executed so well that it sounds eternally old, yet seems not to age like most. It's epic sounding, and it's worth buying the album just for this track.\n",
        "\n\u201cCertainly in this country as far as power, speed, brutality and utter noise is concerned, nothing in Sweden even came close for about a decade\u201d - Quorthon\n\nIndeed, that quote form Bathory\u2019s main man is VERY TRUE considering how fast, loud and raucous this album is, especially for the time that it was released. Okay, so The Return\u2026 may have consisted of some SLIGHT punk influences (Bestial Lust) and a few occasional rockish riffs that were present on the first album (Born For Burning), but this album here, Under The Sign Of The Black Mark, completely eliminates every element that caused Metal heads to cry out \u201cVenom clones!\u201d to Bathory, and instead, broke the boundaries of everything that was once considered extreme Metal in the 80s. There are songs on here that make Kreator, Slayer and Dark Angel seem like little girls! Not to say that those bands weren\u2019t lethal and/or brutal for their time, because in 1986, all of the aforementioned groups released three of the greatest, most lethal albums to ever grace the ears of man kind; Pleasure To Kill, Reign In Blood and Darkness Descends. Were they giving Bathory a run for the money? Perhapse so, but just as songs like Massacre and Chariots Of Fire destroy anything that was previously known as thrash, black and speed Metal, Under The Sign Of The Black Mark is also the album that foreshadowed the heavier, far more epic direction that Bathory would soon take. Call From The Grave and Enter The Eternal Fire a perfect examples of that change in direction.\n\n\nUnder The Sign Of The Black Mark surpassed the doomed heaviness of Celtic Frost\u2019s To Mega Therion, the speed of Sodom\u2019s Obsessed By Cruelty, and the brutality of Kreator\u2019s Pleasure To Kill and Slayer\u2019s Reign In Blood. It was overall more unique as well. Most of the lyrics weren\u2019t about summoning the powers of Hell, sadistic death, torture, destruction and all of that other good stuff that Bathory, as well as all of the other aforementioned bands, used to write about in their lyrics. Instead, the lyrics on Under The Sign Of The Black Mark were about historical battles (Massacre), Norse mythology (Equimanthorn), nuclear war (Chariots of Fire), the afterlife (Call From The Grave, Enter The Eternal Fire), the Bathory fan base (\u2026Of Doom), Elizabeth Bathory herself (Woman Of Dark Desires), and even one more song based around Satan and the occult (13 Candles). \n\nAlso, unlike the previous two Bathory records, this album also consists of more variety musically speaking. From fast, neck snapping mega-thrashers (Massacre, Equimanthorn, \u2026Of Doom), to mid paced approaches (Woman Of Dark Desires, 13 Candles), and all the way to the slower, epic numbers (Call From The Grave and Enter The Eternal Fire), Under The Sign Of The Black Mark is a mile stone in the history of Metal music. Actually, that was quite an understatement there but anyway, let\u2019s get on with the song by song descriptions\u2026 \n\n\n1. Nocturnal Obeisance (Intro) - If there is one flaw with this album it would be the intro. Why? Well compared to Storm Of Damnation or Revelation Of Doom, this one is basically nothing. Just a few random echoes and wind effects. Aside from that, I also have a problem with the title. I know that it\u2019s in Latin, but in English, it translates to Nighttime Obesity\u2026WHY?! I have no fucking clue.\n\n2. Massacre - What an appropriate title for such a brutal track. The lyrics here are based on the battle of Little Big Horn, yet are ultimately indecipherable when considering the speed that Quorthon sings/growls at. Musically, the song is blazing fast, heavy, brutal as all hell, and at the time, made bands like Kreator and Slayer seem like nothing more than traditional rock! So both lyrically and musically, this song is BRUTAL, in all caps, in the true sense of the word.\n\n\u201cI remember virtually stealing the entire base for that track from Saxon's \"Machine Gun\". Their \"Wheels of Steel\" and \"Denim and Leather\" albums are highly underrated I think\u201d - Quorthon discussing the base technique used for the following track\u2026\n\n3. Woman Of Dark Desires - Finally, a song written about the dark and lovely Countess that all extreme Metal fans tend to adore. Hey, it all started with the Venom track Countess Bathory from 1982. Then a band that\u2019s actually called BATHORY comes into the scene, yet waits a few years before actually writing a song about the woman whom they named the band after in the first place. Here we have it, a song about Elizabeth Bathory herself. Amongst all of the other songs that Bathory has done, this one is a bit more traditionally structured, consisting of that verse-chorus-verse-chorus-solo-verse-chorus format. There are also some gothic, church organ keyboards included in here as well, which only adds to the darkened atmosphere of the song. The chorus itself is catchy as fuck. Yeah, try getting that one out of your head!\n\n4. Call From The Grave - This song begins with some strange noises, something that sounds like a man gasping for air on the edge of his life. Pretty soon though, the thick, swinging drum beats come thundering in which are backed up by ultra heavy, mid-paced riffs that simply crush in all their might. Quorthon sounds like he\u2019s in total pain on this song, which only adds to the affect and atmosphere of what the song is really about. Is there an afterlife? Or does your soul just stay in your grave? The lyrics of the song are from the perspective of a dead soul who is trapped in his own grave and unable to escape, calling to God for help but no one hears his pleas. By the way, the guitar solo on this tune is by far the best one on the album. It isn\u2019t fast nor is it extreme in any sense, but shit\u2026the tone and harmonics that this solo is played at just simply SLAY! Possibly one of the best solos that I have ever heard!\n\n5. Equimanthorn - \u201cI basically ripped the opening passages from the soundtrack to the \"Jaws\" movie writing that one\u201d states Quorthon. And yes, you can actually tell that the intro to this song is a reminisce of the movie Jaws. So, what does Equimanthorn mean? I have no clue, but the lyrics are obviously Norse based, which foreshadows the direction the Bathory would later turn to in late 80s/early 90s with their so called Viking Metal albums. Musically though, this song sounds NOTHING like the later, Viking works of the band. The first half of the track is ultra fast Speed Metal at its best. As a matter of fact, this song is played so fucking fast, that the terms Speed Metal and Thrash Metal can NOT be used to describe such a rapid song. You\u2019d have to hear it for yourself to believe and experience the brutal intensity of a track such as this. Quorthon spits forth the lyrics at like\u2026.500 miles per hour! Now how the FUCK does he do that?! Midway through though, the pace changes drastically, and a semi-fast, main riff carries on the rhythm as Quorthon continues to growl his lyrics of Norse mythology at a much steadier pace than before. Quorthon shouts the word \u201cEQUIMANTHORN!\u201d over and over at the top of his lungs up until the pace picks up all over again, leading the track\u2019s rhythm back into its hellish pace, ending it all off with one crazy as fuck guitar solo that\u2026you know what? I can\u2019t even begin to describe how amazing that ending solo is. No, it\u2019s not complexed, but if a guitar solo could be considered lethal and/or brutal, this would really be it! \n\n6. Enter The Eternal Fire - Although the lyrics here have absolutely nothing to do with any Nordic subject, the music alone is a reminisce of what Bathory would later become when they would start to release the Viking albums. The entire song consists of mid-paced, swinging drum patters and steady riffs, much similar to the material off of the band\u2019s Hammerheart album released in 1990. The lyrics here though are another tale of the afterlife, much like Call From The Grave. However, this one is more interesting. It\u2019s about a guy who ends up in the fiery place known as Hell. Bathory wrote references to Satan and Hell before in their two previous albums, but the lyrics on this track are far deeper. They convey a strong anti-religious meaning since the lyrics are about a man who is sentenced to burn for all eternity just for living a life of pleasure. Now how fair is that?! Bathory has always been one to attack religion, but with this track, the message seriously gets across pretty damn well instead of the band just blabbering about Satan, death and blasphemy, which can still be good, by the way, but those kinds of lyrics tend to get old pretty fast. My favorite part of this whole song is where Quorthon begins screaming \u201cOh Lord! Have mercy oh lord! This can\u2019t be! Raging flames consume my soul! THE PAIN TURNS MY MIND! OH NO THIS CAN\u2019T BE! OH NO! OH NOOOOOOO!!\u201d\u2026.he screams as if the pain of fire is actually consuming his body. \n\n7. Chariots Of Fire - Once again, the album picks up the pace with a blazing fast Speed Metal song in the vein of Massacre and the first half of Equimanthorn. Much like Massacre, though, this song never changes pace. It\u2019s constantly fast through out, almost too damn fast to head bang to. But hey, I can do it! VERY FEW people can without getting whiplashed anyway\u2026not to brag or anything. Anyway, the guitar solo that ends this track off is another extreme, godly one. Nothing like the one at the end of Equimanthorn, but it\u2019s still amazing.\n\n8. 13 Candles - With this song, Bathory returns to their Satanic roots by making a song about birth of Satan\u2019s child. You all know of the \u201cvirgin\u201d Mary who gave birth to Christ while still being a \u201cvirgin\u201c, right? Yeah, she sure used a good cover up, eh? Well anyway, this song must be a mockery of that story since it\u2019s about some virgin giving birth to the son of Satan. The song itself is far more mid-paced than the previous track, yet manages to be a overall faster than Call From The Grave or Enter The Eternal Fire. The dark chants in the background add so much to the evil atmosphere as well. \u201cBorn a child of the underworld\u201d you\u2019ll hear the demon choir chant! Shit, if only this was put on The Return\u2026, it would have been even better!\n\n9. \u2026Of Doom - Now this track has NO RELATION to the previous song. Even I thought at first that both tracks would be combined into one song hence their names. I thought it was something like 13 Candles Of Doom, but it\u2019s really not. This track is nothing more than another rapid, fast Death Metal assault that is also a blunt tribute to Bathory\u2019s fan base at the time. The lyrics are basically an ode to Bathory Hordes all around the world. It\u2019s a great way to end the album off with such aggression as well.\n\n\nOn a side note, all of the quotes from Quorthon on this review were taken from the official Bathory site. www.bathory.se . There\u2019s some pretty interesting stuff there to read. I only took the quotes that described the music alone.\n",
        "\n\u201cMy goal was to mix the speed of Mot\u00f6rhead with the dark atmosphere of Black Sabbath\u201d - Quorthon\n\nWhen it all comes down to it, that\u2019s basically what this album comes off as; a dark and brutal mix of Mot\u00f6rhead and Black Sabbath, with of course, a ting of early punk as well for added aggression. Wait, wasn't that Venom\u2018s goal as well? Over the past two decades, the comparisons between Bathory and Venom have been countless, leaving Metal fans scratching their heads and contrasting between the two bands endlessly. Sure, Venom may have started it all, but what Bathory did with the release of their first album is simply pure blasphemy taken beyond what Venom or any other extreme Metal band had done with their music! If you\u2019ve heard this album, let me ask you a question; does this release honestly sound over 20 years old? Because it is!\n\nI mean, regardless if Quorthon decides to admit if his musical influences were taken from Venom or not, the music on Bathory\u2019s first LP isn\u2019t exactly the same as Venom\u2019s first two albums. Yes, it sounds very punk-ish at times and the early Mot\u00f6rhead influences are all too clear. The lyrics though, are far more blasphemous than anything Venom had ever put out, which made it seem like Quorthon was trying to outdo Venom in terms of extremity. Even the music was a bit more extreme than Welcome To Hell or Black Metal. I mean, if you\u2019ve heard the first two Venom LPs and thought that the production sucked, then stay away from this album. You know what? I did some Darkthrone reviews just yesterday and stated that nothing was more raw or minimal as their early albums. But now that I think about, this album really changes my mind. I would say that the production to Bathory\u2019s first album is low-fi, but that statement would be false! Why? Because there IS NO production, that\u2019s why. \n\nSo what exactly does this record sound like? Is it fast? Is it heavy? Well, not to say that there weren\u2019t faster bands out there at the time, because there sure as hell were, but\u2026did they sound this evil? Hell no! Yes, the punk, Mot\u00f6rhead and especially the Venom influences shine greatly, but Bathory adds such a twist to it all, that only Quorthon himself has been able to top such an evil sounding album, which of course, would be done the following year in 1985 with the release of The Return\u2026 . Now, as far as the heaviness goes, well\u2026I wouldn\u2019t call this album heavy. Harsh? Yes. Fast? Yes. Evil? Yes. Brutal? To a point, but yes. Heavy? No. The sound is so paper thin that the bass can barely be deciphered at all. The drums are by far the lowest in the mix amongst all of the other instruments. The guitars are searing, loud and, well, pretty fucking thin if you ask me. Is it a plus for this record though? You bet! The ultra thin sound may reduce the thrash essence of this release, but it only adds to the dark and evil aura of the album. Alright, let\u2019s get on with the song by song review now.\n\n\n1. Storm Of Damnation - Unlike most album intros, this one is really pretty damn cool. Hence its name, it sounds like a storm from the depths of Hades itself. Swirling winds, evil howls and all of that good, evil stuff. Now, on with the first song\u2026\n\n2. Hades - If a places like Hades really existed, this is what it should sound like down there. Pure fucking evil. The song itself is simplistic and minimal, lacking in the thrash quality that Venom had only because the drums are so damn low in the mix. I know that Bathory had a bassist at the time, but the bass is barely audible to the listener\u2019s ear. Turn to bass-boost up on your stereo and you just may be able to hear it. This album basically serves as the blue-print for Darkthrone\u2019s album, Under A Funeral Moon. And yes, that album was good, raw and unholy black metal in the true sense of the term, but when compared to this, it\u2019s nothing but stranded holy nun in the cold forests of Norway. Bathory rules all extreme Metal acts, plain and simple!\n\n3. Reaper - Now when I think of extreme Metal, THIS is the kind of shit that comes to mind. Forget all of this grim and necro stuff, save that when you\u2019re feeling more mellow. This track is another assault of Black/Death Metal fury with a hideous vibe of evil and anger. Just listen to that god damn chorus. \u201cI\u2019m the reeeeeaaaaaaaaaperrr!! Coming to take you!!\u201d. Quorthon sounds like the Grim Reaper himself!\n\n4. Necromancy - There is far more groove added to this track, but the unholy vibe is still there. This song also has the best lyric on the whole entire album; \u201cI gather up the forces of darkness to bring damnation, lust and war. Gather all of Heaven\u2019s virgin\u2019s to bend before our horny Lord\u201d. And no, the word \u201clord\u201d in the lyrics isn\u2019t referring to the man upstairs. I think you know damn well who it\u2019s referring to\u2026\n\n5. Sacrifice - Hey, doesn\u2019t Venom have a song called Sacrifice on their Black Metal LP? Anyway, this is the exact same song that Bathory recorded for the Scandinavian Metal Attack compilation in 1983, except the album version sounds far more evil. It\u2019s not just a reminisce of Mot\u00f6rhead like the first version was. This, in my opinion, is the far better version because it\u2019s simply more evil. Nothing more, nothing less.\n\n6. In Conspriacy With Satan - Alright Quorthon, the Venom influence is far too obvious by now that it\u2019s almost a proven fact that you were inspired by Venom. On Venom\u2019s Welcome To Hell LP, there is a song called In League With Satan. Coincidence? I mean, both songs have brutal, extreme and controversial lyrics, but Bathory\u2019s version is the true winner. Oh yeah, and not that anyone cares or anything, but I have this denim vest with Bathory goat head and logo on the back and underneath it reads \u201cIn Conspiracy With Satan\u201d in Old English letters. And no, it\u2019s not for the shock value either, and that\u2019s all I\u2019m saying about it\u2026\n\n7. Armageddon - There\u2019s some nice riffing going on here. Aside from that, this song manages to keep the brutal pace up of all the other previous songs on the album. It\u2019s appropriately titled Armageddon and could easily serve as the soundtrack to the end of the world. Nevertheless, a song like this is bound to get that head banging.\n\n8. Raise The Dead - Yes\u2026Venom does have a song as well called Raise The Dead on their Black Metal album. I swear, Quorthon, if you\u2019re going to lie, at least make the coincidences appear to be believable in the least sense. Anyway, this track is the slowest one the album by far. It begins with some bell chimes and then leads into a slow, mid-paced, swinging rhythm while staying away from the doom territory. The reason for this is because the riffs are all played open so there is a lack the \u201cthickness\u201d to them. So no, there\u2019s no crunch to them either, but the dark and evil atmosphere that this song creates makes up for all that anyway. The chorus kills too. Quorthon growls/chants \u201cRaise the dead!\u201d repeatedly, which only adds to the horror of the atmosphere. Seriously, a song like this could be used for a good, classic horror movie. A zombie movie in particular, hence the song title.\n\n9. War - The last track on the album is an all-out, Death Metal assault on the listener. Everything heard here is minimal, fast paced and chaotic. The chorus only repeats the word \u201cWAR!\u201d over and over. And just listen to that crazy guitar solo\u2026wow!\n\n\n\nMany bands have tried to mimic this style, yet fail to deliver the evil that Bathory first created. Even the early 90s albums from Darkthrone are holy compared to this!! There are no lyrics about forests, elves, mysterious icy landscapes, cold winters or strict ideology here. These lyrics are all about blasphemy, Satan, evil, blood, hell, raping and sacrificing virgins and summoning the powers of darkness and evil. Sure, the later Death and Black Metal bands of the 90s may have sounded more brutal musically, but no band has ever been as evil as Bathory, and that includes bands like Sarcofago, Deicide, Darkthrone, and even Bathory\u2019s 80s peers of extreme Metal like Sepultura, Slayer, Hellhammer and Onslaught. I do enjoy listening to all of the aforementioned bands, but no one comes close to the evilness of Bathory with the exception of one band in the mid to early 80s\u2026Mercyful Fate. The thing is though, they weren\u2019t the same style of Metal. They were just as evil and blasphemous, but they were an entirely different style of Metal. Both bands though, can be considered Black Metal, and indeed were back in the 80s.\n",
        "\nHoly shit-crackers, it's the ancient black-metallers Bathory with a release that doesn't sound like the production studio manager was jerking off on the job! First album I listened to by these guys was \"Under the Sign of the Black Mark\", and that would have been so much better if there was some sort of balance between the bass and guitars. No matter. A nod to Bathory is a nod to one of the first black metal bands of all time. So if you don't like them, fuck off. Now for the review:\n\nThe album starts off with a horse neighing in the background, eerie atmospheric music playing. The horse begins it's charge and as the track progresses, you hear a chorus in the background doing a Lord of the Ringsy chant. The track comes to a climax and shifts into the second one with light accoustic guitar playing a dark melody. The melody continues on, Quorthon singing softly in the background. Then a pause. BAM! Guitars blare and the drums kick in. The vocalist lets out a painful cry of \"AAAUUGH!\" The track proceeds to ruin your shit with shredding guitars, fast-paced drums, insane guitar solos, and classic Bathory vocals in an almost epic song.\n\nThat is the greatest fucking opening to an album I have ever heard in my entire life.\n\nThe rest of the album's tracks aren't nearly as long as the first two that are combined. They usually clock in at about four and a half minutes, but are just as equally fast and grim. Each and every single one of them. This album, I can almost say, is fucking perfect. All the instruments on this album are well balanced and to say the least, very fucking talented. \n\nThen there's the second to last track before the out. The track titled after the album. \"Blood Fire Death\". Who needs subtly when you get this? This track is just as epic-like as the first one. Mixing in accoustic guitars at the beginning to help add to the macabre atmosphere of the album.\n\nIf you like black metal, you will get this.\n\nRIP Ace Quorthon Borje Forsberg\n",
        "\nTo begin with I am admittedly a sucker for Viking related music so this album (and so many others) scored points with me before I even heard it. Now this was really my first exposure to Bathory (what? You? No? Yes!), so I really didn\u2019t know what to expect. I\u2019d heard portions of Hammerheart before, but never really grasped any of Bathory\u2019s early work. I immediately fell in love with this album. There is a lot of contrast musically on Nordland I that ranges from acoustic folk tracks (Ring of Gold, eerie song that creates amazing atmosphere absolutely remarkable) to the more rock based tracks following the line of 1996\u2019s 'Blood on Ice' to thrashier tracks with blasting drums (Broken Sword). Quorthon\u2019s vocals are, again, most attuned to the style of \u2018Blood on Ice\u2019 and are very smooth and very accessible. Production-wise it is very clear; you don\u2019t have to strain to catch much at all. The vocals may seem a little distant at times, but I really feel that it helps create an atmosphere that takes you back to Nordland in the time of the Vikings (the obligatory Bathory horse sample is at the beginning of \u2018Foreverdark Woods another stand out track on the album). Though by far this isn\u2019t my favorite Bathory album (yes, I\u2019ve listened to a lot of Bathory now\u2026) this is a very good album, and I recommend it to those who are fans of thrash, power metal, folk, etc. and of course to fans of later\n",
        "\nThis is kind of Bathorys comeback album since Quorthon intended Twilight Of The Gods to be Bathorys last album. But after doing his side-project album he regained his will to continue with Bathory, resulting in 3 new Bathory albums within 1,5 years! \n\nThis album entitled \"Requiem\" was meet with alot of criticism, I think the reasons for that are quite obvious: Very bad production and poor vocal perfomance. And I must admit that I too thought this was simply terrible when I first popped it in my CD-player. But beneath the terrible production & vocal perfomance there is quality stuff to be found. The opening title-track begins with an intro that reminds me of something out of \"Under The Sign Of The Black Mark\", but as soon as the guitars kicks in its obvious that this was gonna be a thrash album. The build up riffs sounds like something that Slayer would have done back in the day. Not a bad way to open up the album at all! But the true highlights of the album lies in the second half of the album. Blood And Soil immediatetly grabs your attention with its heavy riffs and Suffocate, Distinguish To Kill & Apocalypse all contains killer thrash-riffs that have been sadly overlooked. War Machine & Pax Vobiscum got its moments too, decent but not that good either. Same goes for Crosstitution but that one took some time for me to appriciate. Achully, the only track I think is completely crap here is Necroticus, that one still only ring annoyance in my ears. But my favorite must be Distinguish To Kill with its speed, great riffing and Quorthons sick-sounding vocals! \n\nIf this album was recorded by, lets say Destruction or Sodom it would have been an awesome album! Or if Quorthon would have given this album the same treatment as Blood Fire Death in production & vocals it would have been great! In my opinion this is still Bathorys third worst album but I still think its a good album non the less, the production & vocal perfomance do wear it down but the songs are still strong. And after all, isn't that the most important thing? \n\nSo if you think you can listen & enjoy an album beyond the shallowness of production & vocal perfomance then give this album a couple of tries (it deserves it). But if you haven't heard much of Bathory I suggest you begin checking out their first 5 before you try anything els. \n\nOne strange note on this album is that the track-list on the back of the CD is in alphabetical order, makes no sence to me why anyone would do this. Strange but ahwell... \n\nOverall its a good album but it got its flaws. \n\nKiller songs: Blood And Soil, Suffocate, Distinguish To Kill, Apocalypse & the title track\n",
        "\n\"Twilight of the Gods\" is Bathory's most relaxed record. It's strolling pace reminds one of \"Hammerheart\" but lacks little of the two-fisted fury that made that record such a grooving and ominous piece of work. In fact, this record seems almost content to slide along melodically and tell it's stories in an almost melancholy manner that never pummels or shakes. The record is filled with moody acoustics, Quothorn singing as Quothorn does and the music slides sad epic after sad epic of world demise. This is a powerful record, but not a record that ever really \"rocks\". The Viking-rock becomes metaphor for a world that is dying \n\nThe opening \"Twilight of the Gods\" is a rather powerful introductory track that sticks in the mind and shows Quothorns ability to write a sombre epic. \"Under the Runes\" is a controversial bit that musicall stands as one of the mans stronger tracks. \"Bond of Blood\" has rather macbre march to it that mixes the choirs a bit better than some of his other epics as well. Much of the record though follows a pattern of acoustic opening and mid-paced middler that really doesn't excite as it should. Nothing here is heavy, but nothing really is catchy either. The songs create a great atmosphere but don't work as individual songpieces the way that many songs on earlier records do.\n\nBathory are at their most atmopheric here but not their most memorable or exciting. It's not poor, but it's not great by any means either. It's here not there in the concept of heaviness and it's not truly the most epic work aside from the title track either. Bathory would start to crack and shift here into something that was less than pleasent and this record, while still good - marks the downfall of the project.\n\nFor all Bathory fans and fans of Quthorns epic works...I'd check this out. Those of you looking for excitement can look elsewhere as this record has none.\n",
        "\nAlthough released in 1996, the album was written and recorded during the late 80s and should have been released around 1987 and 1988. The songwriting here is fantastic, which strongly differs from the previous efforts of the 80s Bathory albums, and the musical structure here is amazing. Because of the drastic change in style, Quorthon decided not to release this after all, and instead, released Blood Fire Death, which was also a change in style that was slowly forming the transition. Think about it, if this had been released right after Under The Sign Of The Black Mark, it would have stunned a lot of the fans, and Quorthon didn't want to risk ruining the Bathory name. Going from thrashy death metal and writing songs about death and evil, to traditional styled metal with classical influences and writing about Norse mythology is a really big change, but I still think that this should have been released earlier. In a way, I'm glad it wasn't, because then there would have been no Blood Fire Death album, but then again, this one could have easily repleaced 1990's Hammerheart album, for I think that it is superior.\n\n\n1. Intro - Ah yes, the sounds of the North. This intro perfectly sets the mood for the album, including sounds of the Nordic village animals, voices in the distance and villagers moving about.\n\n2. Man Of Iron - Beautiful acoustic tune. Quorthon's vocals are top notch here, as he displays his amazing ability to sing clear as well. I noticed that on a lot of other song that he uses clear vox on, he doesn't sound that smooth, and often strains to hit a certain note. But on here, his vocals are done pretty damn well.\n\n3. One-Eyed Old Man - Here's where the drums and distortion finally kick in. It's pretty fast paced when compared to most of the other tracks on here. The clear vocals are done amazingly well, even on this faster tune, and the riffs are fantastic. One thing I love about this song are the solos. You know those kind that make you want to air play guitar? Yup. That's what these are. The mid section of this song includes a spoken narrative from an \"old wise man\", that I used to highly despise. Who knows, maybe it just grew on me over time, or maybe after reading the story line to the album, I decided to appreciate it more. Great song, none-the-less.\n\n4. The Sword - Things slow down here, although they get a little bit heavier as well. Steady, slow and heavy, yet full of metallic power. The drumming is quite powerful and unique, and Quorthon\u2019s vocals convey an attitude of strength and pride. Manowar, eat your fucking heart out!\n\n5. The Stallion - The opening riff to this song is amazing. Hence the song title, it\u2019s a semi-galloping riff. The pace and percussion to the song is quite similar to The Sword, but occasionally you\u2019re able to hear some acoustic guitars in the background. The riffage is a little more interesting, and the vocals are a bit catchier, demonstrating a wider range than that of the last tune. The mid-guitar solo here is absolutely fantastic! It may not be the fastest, but I love it! Overall, this is simply one of the best.\n\n6. The Woodwoman - Wonderful acoustic guitars open up this song, followed by a blast of heavy riffs and pounding drums. Once again, the pace remains the same as in the last two songs, but Quorthon\u2019s voice shines out a little a bit more, showing great range and amazing harmony. Honestly, this song is quite heavy, but the vocal work is absolutely enchanting, catchy as hell. The way the acoustic guitars flow along with the pace and rhythm of the song is awesome too. Without them, the song would feel incomplete.\n\n7. The Lake - Another slow paced tune with acoustic backing guitars. There is one thing that is quite special about this one though, and that\u2019s the chorus. I mean\u2026HOLY SHIT! AMAZING! How does he do that?? This chorus is wonderful!! Catchy!! The way it flows with the pace of the song is so killer!! Hails to this! The acoustic backing guitars and melodic chants only add more to the mood, making this a masterpiece. Sounds like it may be the best song on the album, eh? Well, it\u2019s not\u2026\n\n8. Gods Of Thunder, Of Wind, And Of Rain - This one is! What starts out with a bass intro and horse sound effects, leads into a furious metallic assault of heavy riffs, pounding double bass, atmospheric chants and one hell of a rhythm. Unlike the last few songs, this one has quite a bit of speed to it. Remember how I talked about how catchy the chorus was in the song before this one? Well, imagine an entire song being that amazing. That\u2019s how this one is. Quorthon\u2019s vocals show a lot of pride and power, and the chants\u2026.well, I always thought that by adding chants into Metal, it was only for atmosphere and mood, especially in Bathory\u2019s case, but in this song, they do more than just that. They kick ass just like the rest of the instruments. And the guitar solo\u2026well, that\u2019s also the best one on the album. Yeah, the previous songs had some pretty killer guitar solos, but this one just beats them all. Overall, I think this song gives the other epic Bathory track Blood Fire Death a run for the money, and this is only half the length of that one. \n\n9. The Ravens - Shortest track on the album, but still a great one. Like Man Of Iron, this one is all in acoustics, also written and sung at the same pace as that one. Perfect tune to relax to after the full metal assault of Gods Of Thunder, Of Wind, And Of Rain. It\u2019s also a great way to lead the listener into the album\u2019s epic ending\u2026\n\n10. The Revenge Of The Blood On Ice - Although this is no One Rode To Asa Bay (and it sure as hell is no Blood Fire Death!!), this epic track is truly a masterpiece. The same type of rhythm is used for this track as the one in The Sword or The Woodwoman. Quorthon uses great harmony in his vocals as chants blast through the background of the song to create an amazing mood of epic atmosphere. The song undergoes various tone changes through-out, but never lets the listener down once or bores them, even in its 10 minute span. The only way to end off a masterpiece, is with a masterpiece itself\u2026\n",
        "\nAfter two great Viking albums, Bathory brings us this great piece of Thrash Metal. What? Bathory playing Thrash Metal? Well, why not? They already played Black, Death, Viking... and yeah. Now also Thrash (Although Bathory already released some thrashy songs in 1993's Juabileum Volume II compilation album).\n\n1991's Twilight of the Gods was intended to be the last Bathory album, but after recording a Solo album, Quorthon decided to keep Bathory alive. Well. Lets center now on the music:\n\nHeavy and thrashy riffs, wild thrash metal solos and not death / black vocals on this album. Quorthon is screaming the whole fucking album! All songs contain the same kind of main riff, that we could also listen in next album, Octagon. Concretly there is the \"Damned Riff\", one of those u keep in your mind cuz is simple, but fucking catchy. Alterations of this riff can be listen in almost all the songs. Its the main riff for \"Suffocate\", maybe the best song in the album. \nThe lyrics deals with earthly occult matters and death.\n\nA great and different (dont know exactly why) thrash album. Brutal and fuckin thrashy and fast, this deserves nor less than 80% or 85%. \n\nSong highlights:\n-Crosstitution\n-Pax Vobiscum\n-Suffocate\n",
        "\nA follow up album to Hammerheart, very epic indeed, and with wonderful musicianship involved, as always. A worthy album for it's predecessor.\n\nThe album indeed starts out with an eerie wind atmosphere, it slowly adds up to loud guitars and depthy drums, very powerful indeed. The first song, I think is very great, the weakest part is probably Quorthons vocals, which maybe could've been a tad louder, and maybe better sang? Not sure, the rest of the song is just amazing work, in my opinion. Very atmospheric and somewhat doomish. It's 14 plus minute length seems to fly by as you sit and enjoy the music, it fades out with great acoustics and atmospherics (the wind.) You can practically see the mist.\n\nThe album in itself is a very epic piece of work, often overlooked when compared to Hammerheart, but the whole mood is different I think it's so full and powerful. The solo's and drumming and everything just adds up into a huge masterpiece, I think. I know I am repeating myself, but it truly is an album you should sit and listen to with closed eyes, unless reading the lyrics, which adds a great effect to your imagery also.\n\nIndeed an album to pick up and checkout, whether you are into this sort of thing or not. Stand out tracks? All of them, but really I would say \"Blood and Iron\", \"Under the Runes\", really all of them.\n\nThe lyrics are somewhat different on some of the lyrics, mostly though they stick to the epic \"Viking\" style lyrics, which some anger in here and there towards present time people. I think Twilight of the Gods, the song at least was somewhat comparing today with long ago? Maybe I am just way off.\n\nIndeed a great album to pick up, I think, so powerful and full of atmosphere, and just damn good music.\n",
        "\nThis is the second of the three Jubileum albums from Bathory. This basically is a greatest hits collection. This one focuses more on the Viking era and some unreleased stuff but does have some black metal on it. The album starts off with a classic \"the return of darkness and evil.\" this just sets an evil mood for everything. This was the original version of the song and not the one that appears on \"the return.\" This album, as i said before, contains many unreleased and rare tracks like \"Burnin' Leather,\" \"Die in Fire,\" which reminds me of Judas priest for some reason, and the early version of \"The return of darkness and evil.\" This is really a cd worth getting for new fans of Bathory and older fans because you get a little bit every style Bathory played. From the black metal classics like \"Call from the Grave,\" \"The Return of Darkness and Evil,\" \"Raise the Dead,\" and \"Possessed,\" to the more thrashy \"the golden walls of heaven,\" to the epic Viking masterpieces of \"twilight of the gods,\" \"shores in flames,\" and the legendary \"One Rode to Asa Bay.\" If your interesting in getting into the legend that is Bathory this is a good place to start because you see the many sides and forms that is Bathory.\n",
        "\nOkay, so after the series of releases in the mid 90's that, barring Blood on Ice for the fact that its release was delayed, made most fans of Bathory begin to doubt if Quothorn would ever regain his stride. I suppose that the jury is probably hung on the Nordland saga, two back-to-back, bonecrushingly epic albums that would aim to tell various stories of Norse legend with the viking metal sound that Quothorn basically pioneered with the opener and closer of Blood Fire Death.\n\nSo the deal is? \nIt's fucking awesome.\n\nWhat you can expect? The swelling, wordless choirs of a Quothorn overdubbed, along with much more confident lead vocals that only occasionally falter with the imprecision that made his attempts 15 years ago so damned charming. The slower pace (for the most part) that helps to build a totally fucking believable atmosphere about the album, showcasing the simplistic but effective song structure and some absolutely beautiful riffs that are trademark Bathory. The occasional sample of wind blowing, water flowing, horses galloping and some well-placed synth to give things as epic a tinge as you could want. There's something indescribable about the album that just feels right, from the full-on folk of Ring of Gold, to the orgiastic build before the vocals come in on Vinterblot. And I can't quite tell what the instrument is at the beginning of Foreverdark Woods (although it sounds vaguely like a mandolin), but when it returns a few times more throughout the course of that particular 8 minute epic, it really fits in to the flow of the song, rather than seeming like a random instrument choice for versatility. Just about the only song that picks up the pace a bit is Broken Sword, although even that is after a minute-long acoustic build before the key gets dropped down a step and the thrashing begins.\n\nPerhaps the mystique surrounding Bathory in the early career was one of the many pioneering traits that Quothorn brought to the table, but Nordland I reminds you that behind all that, Quothorn was a fucking brilliant songwriter, and even the chance to spice it all up with production work several hundreds of times fancier then the basement 4-track recordings of Bathory's early days, the composition of the songs are still at the forefront. Which is really to the benefit of any metal fan who isn't too busy being an elitist to enjoy some great music. Quothorn and his unquestionably brilliant legacy will be missed.\n",
        "\nHoly shit\n\nThis is the single most brutal, yet beautiful album I have ever heard.\n\nOden's Ride Over Nordland, the album's three minute intro, showcases just how epic this album is. Horses, gongs, rumbling mountains- it almost makes you feel as though the Ragnarok is about to happen. Actually, it basically does happen on this disc.\n\nA Fine Day to Die-Quorthon brilliantly starts and ends this album with two long, epic skullkrushers, while filling the middle with blistering, skin flaying thrash. You could almost compare it to Reign in Blood, where the two longer songs (although a whopping 4 minutes on RIB) begin and end the disc. Just when you are about to become mesmerized by this song's intro, one of the most gut wrenching riffs ever brings you back into reality and completely destroys you. The song then proceeds to break your face for 7 more minutes.\n\nThe Golden Walls of Heaven-The first of the 5 thrash songs on the disc. Fairly straightforward, the song progressively gets better and goes into a sweet riff at 3:33, before ending with a THIRD solo.\n\nPace 'Till Death- Jesus Christ. Listen to that intro. At the 33 second drum hit, your neck is guaranteed to be wrecked by the end of this song. The lyrics here deal with racing motorcycles or cars or something I believe. 1:50 is where this song turns into a total speed fest that threatens to crush your brain into oblivion. Mirror Mirror on the wall, who's the fastest of them all? Fucking godly.\n\nHolocaust-Probably the weakest song on the album, which isn't saying too much. I think the intro here sounds a little to close to Dies Irae, which is placed right after it on the CD. If you look at the lyrics, the first letter of each line spells \"SATAN\" and keeps repeating the pattern.\n\nDies Irae- One of the heaviest songs I've ever heard. Like Morbid Angel's opening riff in \"God of Emptiness\", this riff sounds like it came from the depths of hell. Blistering speed metal until 2:22 and then- Another one of the most awesome riffs I've ever heard. This song is somewhat comparable to \"Equimanthorn\" in the way it abruptly breaks down into a slower, chugging riff. Quorthon adds a faster part and another solo before ending the song.\n\nBlood Fire Death- This song is fucking god. In the vein of A Fine Day to Die, this is a more viking oriented song, and foreshadows the transition from thrash/black to the Hammerheart era. The \"chanting\" backing vocal in this song reminds me of Norfair's music in \"Super Metroid\", it's fucking great. Somewhere near 7 minutes, the song breaks into a slow galloping riff that almost embodies victory, it's that epic. The song goes back into the main riff and then fades out with acoustic guitars.\n\n\nAmazing, amazing disc-never gets old and never fails to thouroughly brutalize with every listen.\n",
        "\nUgly and raw. That's a succint description for Bathory's first full length release. It's a bit odd to call it \"full length\", since it lasts a mere 27 minutes. However, that 27 minutes is put to good use. It's historical significance can't be overstated, since this is basically where black metal took off.\n\nWhat we have here is basically simple thrash. Simple, repetitive guitar riffs laid over simple, repetitive drum beats. The bass can be heard, but it doesn't do anything special. The vocals are sort of distorted, but not to the extent that you hear in newer black metal bands. The production is pretty basement-quality, but that's a good thing, the rawness gives it an out-of-control, unpredictable feel.\n\nMany of the songs sound similar upon first listen, and even after the onset of familiarity, they still don't deviate too much. Raise the Dead is the exception, being much slower than all the others. Given this, it's hard to pick out highlights, but the first four songs are all excellent, with the aforementioned Raise the Dead and War also being very good. In truth though, there aren't any weak songs. The closest thing to a weak track is the too-long intro.\n\nIn sum, if you like dirty, raw thrash, you will like Bathory's s/t. If you like long, complex, bombastic songs, you had best look elsewhere.\n",
        "\nThis record is a classic. This record exists on the shelf next to such pounding metal classics such as De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas, Burzum, Black Sabbath, and Killers as one of the records that shattered a mold and created a new feel in a stagnant genre.\n\nFolks...gone but not forgotten...Bathory endure.\n\n\"Under the Sign of the Black Mark\" is an undertaking of low-fi hammer-on metal that defies it's muddy production values to create a misted blood-storm of metal that few have been able to touch. Far ahead of it's time \"Under the Sign...\" growls, snarls and cuts it's way through increasingly intelligent lyrical topics and increasingly musical compositions that do not lose the bleak violence of the first two releases.\n\nThe hammering \"Woman of Dark Desires\" (always a fave of mine) and the epic \"To Enter the Eternal Fire\" set a standard for raw black metal that few bands have managed to dance near. The dark emotions bleed through the stark production to build a haze of despair, anger and violence that few bands could match. As a songwriter, Qouthorn updates the influential nature of his first two records on this, and gives them a compositional boost that made Bathory not only extreme, but showed their musical talents as well.\n\nI can add little more to the legend of \"Under the Sign...\", it is a superior release from one of the forefathers of a movement that I have been a part of for many years. Quothorn, despite his recent loss has left with with some incredible music...if I had to pick a favorite it would be this release, as it brought black metal to a new level, allowed musicians to write with both melody and violence, and set the stage for many other bands to come.\n\nThis record the perfect third culmination of satanic black metal from Bathory...this record has inspired thousands and will continue to inspire thousands. \n\nBathory are legends...\n",
        "\nMan, forget the first two releases, becuase this one owns them in every way possible. The heaviness, distortion and speed have increased into something more extreme than the last two albums, and Quorthon's growls have also progressed into a more brutal tone, with screeches added in here and there. Raw, mean, evil and ugly, that's what this album is. What a fitting description...\n\n\nNocternal Obeisance - This is a pretty nice intro, and even though it could have been done better, it's pretty essential to have considering how the second track starts out...\n\nMassacre - Without warning, this insane tune kicks right in through your speakers like a fire ball out of Hell. No musical build-up, no melody, no catchiness...just pure insanity and brutal torment to the human ear, if cranked up loud enough. Torment in a good way, that is...\n\nWoman Of Dark Desires - Well this tune a bit more mid-paced, and much catchier than the previous tune, particularly with the chorus. The song itself is about Elizabeth Bathory, as anyone could easily tell by the lyrics. Overall, the song is very thrashy, and Quorthon's vocal work here is just genius. Even though this song is highly brutal, there are lots of groovy guitar riffs, as well as killer solos and organ synths added in. What a masterpiece!\n\nCall From The Grave - Very nice! I love the slow, heavy pace to this one. Quorthon sounds as if he is doing mutli-growls here, as I can hear the lead vocals and backing vocals in the background behind the music as well. It adds so much to the madness and mood of the song. Now the highlight here is the guitar solo...It's not fast, nor is it extreme, but just the way it's done and the tone that is used makes it sound fucking incredible. It is the best solo on the album.\n\nEquimanthorn - Here we have probably the fastest track on the album, very similar to most of the material on the follow up album, Blood Fire Death. The vox is sung (growled?) insanely fast, and Quorthon screeches most of the time here. The pace shifts, from 150mph beats, to a groovy mid-paced beat in the middle of the song. The speed then continues, followed by blazing fast solo to end off the song that might also ripp your face apart.\n\nEnter The Eternal Fire - Now this is one of Bathory's all-time best. Slow and heavy, quite similar to Call From The Grave, but the growl is a bit less harsh on this one. The main riff is catchy as fuck, though. Simplistic, but catchy. Overall, the song has an evil, epic feel to it, and contains some of the coolest lyrics ever written. I mean, it's about being cast into Hell for eternity, and proof of that is heard towards the end when Quorthon is crying out to God because he's burning in the eternal fire. That has got to be the coolest part of the song, by far\n\nChariots Of Fire - Very similar to Massacre, both in pace and in length. I think this song has a bit more structure to it though. Straight out brutal speed metal, like a chariot ablaze, riding through the sky with nothing to stand in its path. The solo is also worth mentioning, for even though it's short, it's one of the best on the album.\n\n13 Candles - Mid-paced and groovy in many places, along with a catchy as fuck chorus, consisting of dark, evil chants to fit perfectly with the mood. One of the more complexed songs on the album.\n\n...of Doom - Another brutal speed metal assualt, very similar to Massacre and Chariots, but of all these three songs, this one has the best riffage. This song was actually written for the Bathory fan-base at the time. There's much more variety and complexity to this song as well, making it the best of all the speed-oriented songs on the album.\n",
        "\nHaving given out my daily \"zero\" already, I can't possibly give a THIRD consecutive null rating to this album. It's not that bad... well, it's close, but not zero point zero level. \n\nAfter listening to about 20 minutes of this, it dawned on me EXACTLY what this sounds like... the 1985 home recording done by Jeff Hanneman as a quick demo tape to share with his bandmates before they went in and formally wrote the songs to Reign in Blood. Note that that was a \"quick demo\", and is thus grim and kvlt. This is an actual release, and thus it gets no such leeway. It's SHIT. And Quorthon sounds exactly like Hanneman but with an accent. There's a good reason why Hanneman is not Slayer's vocalist.\n\nThe production is awful. Clangy drums, inaudible guitars... then the songwriting is also awful. Lots of bad Slayer ripoff riffs, and in fact this sounds EXACTLY like what would happen if Hanneman made a riff tape right before Divine Intervention. I won't even bother counting the exact moments where songs sound like Slayer songs... but I noted Hell Awaits, Temptation, Criminally Insane, Killing Fields, and that's when I stopped noting.\n\nOh yeah, some of the lyrics are just plain hilarious... \"eat my shit! suck my dick!\" Thanks, Quorthon. I can't really name any highlights of this album - to do so would imply going back to listening to it again, which is not something I plan on doing.\n",
        "\nAfter two releases that lost me (\"Hammerheart\" and \"Twlilight of the Gods\"), I was hopeful for this album to reclaim some of Quorthon's glorious thrashing madness. It does, but something is missing. Maybe it's just that he made an album to silence those naysayers who said he'd lost it, because there is certainly a lot of gratuitous thrashing on this album--none of the dynamics and class of \"Blood, Fire, Death\", and none of the distinctively sick feel of the earliest material. Just a lot of 100mph and not much else, plus weak production without the trashy character of the old days. Don't get me wrong, this has its moments--the title track blasting off right away, \"Crosstitution\" with its amusing title and severely anti-Christian lyrics--but it lacks identity and variety. Every song blasts by at 100mph with little variation and he plays basically the same solo on every song--how cool is that? Not very. \"Distinguish To Kill\" even features a blast beat ending the song with seriously atonal riffing over the top, but that feels tacked-on. Not one of his better albums, for certain, and do yourself a favor by avoiding this unless you are a completist. Or better yet, download the songs I mentioned and save a few bucks!\n",
        "\nYes, this became more atmospheric and spacious, with something Bathory had not been known for previously--dynamics!--but DAMN, is this an incredible album! It features better production and musicianship than previous efforts, and you can even hear the bass here and there, a trashy distorted tone that underlies Quorthon's trademark chainsaw guitar massacre perfectly. The drums are tighter than in the past, too, since it was someone other than Quorthon laying them down (Vvoornth, it was, if I recall rightly). It's still trebly as all hell and thin compared to many releases, but that is part of the old Bathory charm, right?\n\nFrom his usual ambient intro (\"Odin's Ride Over Nordland\", a haunting and eerie piece, one of his best) to the slaughterfest of \"A Fine Day To Die\", the albums starts off strong and doesn't let up. The usual 100mph thrash establishes itself afterward with \"The Golden Walls Of Heaven\", and the tighter playing makes it even more effective, as is the case with the other fast numbers on here, like \"Holocaust\" (the countdown near the end of this just builds and builds, and still puts me on the edge of my seat to this day!). But this album saw Quorthon slowing down more and incorporating more subtle (!) elements into his lethal and pioneering black metal mixture, and it was for the better because it enabled much of the metal community to take him more seriously. And the Viking-oriented lyrical content was well-written, not just cheesey Manowar wannabe stuff (no disrespect intended to the Kings of Metal, natch)--though Quorth IS a Manowar fan, now that I think of it. In any event, this was on e of the last really good Bathory albums released before he got it into his head he could actually sing instead of scream like a witch (he's waaay better at the screaming, IMO) and started exploring the more doomy, then more hard rock oriented sounds of his following albums, which lost me a bit. If you can snag this album, by all means do, as it is important to the evolution of Black Metal as we know it today.\n",
        "\nI fondly remember the time one of my first ever music trading contacts (in my tape trading days in the late 80s-early 90s) sent me a vinyl copy of this album, the first Bathory I'd ever heard. It blew me through the wall with its savage intensity from first note to last, and it still occupies a proud position in my vinyl collection these days. \n\nThis most definitely is one of the most important and influential Black Metal releases in the history of metal, and all the hallmarks that have become part of the modern BM movement are there; the blazing fast tempos, the cavernous, \"necro\" production values (funny how something that was born of necessity on Quorthon's part--lack of studio time and money--has become something that most \"true\" black metal bands slavishly copy!), the not so good yet compelling musicianship...it's all there. And his amusingly mangled English language lyrics are always a fun read, too. That guitar sound is one of the most abrasive and attention-getting I've ever heard as well.\n\nTo this day, I have a hard time picking my fave tracks on this album because it's all so damn good! But I would pick \"Equimanthorn\" above all for the maniacal buzzsaw guitar frenzy that it builds to after a minimalist guitar intro, and crazed ending solo, not to mention the big, noisy, crashing ending--gotta love it!!! \"Enter The Eternal Fire\" is another favorite of mine, and I always found it ironic how the lyrics actually ended with the protagonist crying out to God to save him from the damnation he thought he'd craved until then--a nice nod to the old Black Sabbath records. Everything else, well, it's there, it's brilliant, and that's all you need to know! If you don't have this all time classic, then what's wrong with you??? Get it and see where the second wave of Scandi black metal as well as all the US black metal weenies in this day and age got it all from whether they know (or admit) it or not. And I do mean all (tho we can't deny Venom either while we're at it)!\n",
        "\nThe first \u201dviking\u201d metal album Bathory released... atleast lyricly, the music is best described as thrash-metal with blackish growling vocals and its really awesome! I think It was planned to be released as a double-album with material from \u201cBlood On Ice\u201d, \u201cValhalla\u201d from \u201cHammerheart\u201d and \u201cIn Nomine Satanas\u201d among other songs, but lets talk about the songs that achually are on here:\n\nOdins Ride Over Nordland: This is an awesome intro! Even though its 3min long it really creates a good atmosphere...\n\nA Fine Day To Die: This song is a riff-machine! The most perfect riffs for a opening song ever possess this song, this is probably the best Bathory song there is... don\u00b4t really know what to say, its just awesome...\n\nThe Golden Walls Of Heaven: Pure kick-ass thrash song with some Slayer influences! One of the better songs on the album\n\nPace till Death: Another great thrash-ripping song, this time I detect some Kreator influences but it really kicks ass! Has a cool (and funny) intro too! \n\nHolocaust: A good song, but with strong competition from so great songs it doesn\u00b4t stands out too much...\n\nFor All Those Who Died: This song is a little different then the other, a little bit more mellow... not the best song on the album but a good refreshment\n\nDies Irae: Man what a kick-ass song! A real headbanger with a awesome part at 2:25! One of my favorites on the album!\n\nBlood Fire Death: The last and most epic song on the album! And can only be matched by \u201cA Fine Day To Die\u201d, it has some keboards in the background that sounds really awesome! This is a perfect way to close the album with, also one of Bathorys best songs up to date! \n\nThis must be my favorite Bathory album! If you don\u00b4t like the epic viking stuff because of Quorthons clean vocals or the early Bathory album because they are to primitive then give this a try! Its really awesome both vocaly and musicly, even for those who don\u00b4t like the first few albums or the viking albums. Your metal cd-collection will stand incomplete without this album!\n",
        "\nFew albums, if any, had quite a weird and long story such as Bathory's \"Blood On Ice\". Many a metal fan has over the years stated his/her love and admiration for the band's second triple set of albums, the \"Viking albums\" which marked Bathory's activiy during the second half of the 80's and the beginning of the 90's. However, there still was a missing chapter to be written for the Viking epic to be complete, and ironically enough, the one which started it all. What now is available as \"Blood On Ice\" is actually the seed of Bathory's Viking period.\n\nAs you can read from Quorthon's extensive liner notes in the booklet, \"Blood On Ice\" originally took form as a pastime for the band leader between a Satanic metal slaughter and another in the form of a self written heroic saga which borrowed heavily from Northern mythology and Wagner's works, which Quorthon has always admired. After the recording of \"Under The Sign Of The Black Mark\", however, Quorthon's interests towards flat-out aggression and grim topics began to wane, and this is how \"Blood Fire Death\", the link between the first and the second era of Bathory's production, was born. Quorthon's inspiration naturally leaned towards this new Viking styled concept, and so his saga was cut down into what would become the lyrics of the songs and \"Blood On Ice\" was recorded in demo form between the sessions of \"Blood Fire Death\" and \"Hammerheart\", with parts of it being processed at the same timeas the latter was recorded. It was then abandoned, as Quorthon feared that the change of direction would be too abrupt for fans to take, and so \"Hammerheart\" was issued instead. Years later, Quorthon would reveal of the existence of this unreleased album and the fan mail assault began...\n\n...and so here we are in 1995, with Quorthon doing a massive job transferring the original and unfinished material on a modern master, straightening the rough sound and adding the (numerous) missing ingredients before finally offering this missing chapter to his avid fan base. A great and worthwile display of admiration and respect from both sides, I'd like to state. The work must have been hard and the results are amazingly good, judging from the very limited resources Quorthon had to start with.\n\"Blood On Ice\" rightfully fits among Bathory's other three Viking platters, and due to its unique nature works well both as an introduction and a further addition, thus appealing to old and new fans equally. Musically, the compositions range between plodding marches a la \"A Fine Day To Die\" such as the title track, \"The Sword\" and \"The Stallion\" to faster assaults like \"One Eyed Old Man\" and the powerful \"Gods of Thunder, of Wind and of Rain\" (which in time has become a fan favourite), and includes the mandatory acoustic moments (\"The Ravens\" and the excellent \"Man of Iron\") along with \"Twilight Of The Gods\" styled slow, atmospheric epics, namely the very good \"The Woodwoman\" and the fantastic \"The Lake\"... everything spiced with choirs, acoustics, sound effects and other traditional Bathory gimmicks.\n\nAll in all \"Blood On Ice\" is a very solid and enjoyable work, mandatory for anyone who enjoyed Bathory's second season but a recommended listen to any other metal fan too. A long wait, but well worth it. Thank you, Quorthon.\n",
        "\nThat song title clear sums up this thrash metal monster. Fast, merciless thrash metal with screechy growls, much more lethal than anything Quorthon will ever do, or has done vocally. The production is cleaned up from the previous three releases, and is done much faster and far heavier, as if it was Kreator's evil little brother. That is why this is Bathory's best release IMO.\n\nOdin's Ride Over Nordland - This intro totally blows away Storm of Damnation, and most other album intros in general. Dark chants, symphonic music and the roar of thunder blare away in the background while the sound of a horse cries out, giving the listener a mental image of this Nordic god, Odin, riding out over a vast land. Speaking of Kreator earlier, Choir Of The Damned can't even touch this.\n\nA Fine Day To Die - An acoustic guitar intro and soft, whisper-like vocals open up this masterpiece, but it's not long before the heaviness and growls kick in all at once, followed by a mid-paced beat and crushing riffs that bombard the listener. This is one of Bathory's all-time best songs, and the second best on the album. The solo will ripp you open a new asshole. Vocally, Quorthon sounds better than ever. He doesn't screech so much on this tune, but he still delivers a killer vocal performance. The entire song itself is very epic, but lethal at the same time.\n\nThe Golden Walls Of Heaven - Here's where the album really starts to give Kreator a run for the money. Quorthon's growls and screeches here are unbelievable, and the blazing fast speed remains constant through out the entire song. As for the riffage, well, it crushes the golden walls of heaven thsemselves.\n\nPace 'Till Death - \"Mirror mirror on the wall I'm the fastest of them all!!!!!!\"...I just love that line. I mean, that line clearly describes this track quite accurately, for it is the fastest song on the album, not only pace and riff wise, but Quorthon sounds like a fucking maniac burning in Hell, more than he usually does. One particular thing I noticed about the beginning of this song is its intro. There is this little Teacher's Pet-ish guitar lick, no joke. I doubt this is just a \"coincidence\" to Venom, like the debute album was.\n\nHolocaust - This song is almost as fast as the previous track, and is just about as vicious. The solos in between the verses absolutley slay, and the main riffage is no less tame. One thing that deserves some mention as well about this song is the countdown towards the end just before the sound of a bomb explodes in the background behind the music. Probably one of the main highlights in the overall album.\n\nFor All Those Who Died - Very nice groove riffs and mid-paced beat. This song probably has the catchiest riffage through out the entire album. As for the vocals, well Quorthon screeches non-stop, particularly during the chorus...\"For all those who diiiiiiiiiiiieeed\"....sheesh!\n\nDies Irae - Okay....this is as lethal and brutal as the album gets. It puts Pace 'Till Death to shame! I mean, I take back what I said about Pace 'Till Death being the fastest on the album, because this one blows it away. Yes, it does slow down for about a minute, but the speed resumes 'till the very end. Speaking of the end, the song's ending is just amazing, like a bunch of bombs exploding in the air...\n\nBlood Fire Death - Ah, here we have the greatest song, not only on the album itself, but this, in my opinion, is Bathory's greatest song ever. A 10+ minute epic that begins with acoustic guitars and chants just like Fine To Day To Die did, but this song is far superior to it in every way. Strong, catchy and mid-paced, that's what this song is. Speaking of pace, that's another similarity that this song has to A Fine Day To Die, but I say once again, this song is far superior. The chants in the beginning of the song do no cut off once the heaviness kicks in, they go along with the main riffage of the entire song, which add to the mood and give the listener a mental image of a Nordic battle taking place. As for Quorthon's vocals, well, they're the most tamed out on this track, and are more or less just a raspy vox, rather than a growl. \nSo overall, this is an amazing, phenominal track, and is everything EPIC should be.\n",
        "\nThis is so similar to the first Bathory LP, but better in a qualitative way I can't really put into words. Where the first was just fast for fast's sake Venom worship with a lot of pre-Venom punk to it, this one manages to succeed in being dark and unholy. It's pretty much Bathory, Version 2.0, and man the upgrade helps a lot!!! The production isn't as clear as the first album, but it works better, actually. It's not a punk-up speed job, but rather an atmospheric black metal work.\n\nThe songs are all pretty similar - raw speed metal in a way Motorhead never quite imagined. Dark imagery like Venom never dared. This is black fucking metal indeed. The silly intro reflects the first Bathory, and is pretty much disposable - it's at Total Destruction that things get going. Man, what an opening riff. Black metal is very necro and inverted-pentagram, but it's also supposed to be a headbanging mindfuck, and it is. You like Venom?\n\nThat wasn't a question - that was more a confirmation. You like breathing oxygen? Then you like Bathory \"The Return\". Born for Burning is more bangage, a bit more groove, but still just as necro. There's no real surprises to be found among the rest of the tracks, unless you count the squealy guitar solo of Possessed. Iron Maiden, this is not. But nor is it really Kerry King. Or how about that thrash break in Reap of Evil. Fast as fuck, and bangest thy head as if up from the dead. Oh yes - the highlight of the album. Or maybe Sadist, with its long extended thrash section. Ahh, too many highlights.\n\nOutro. Silly. Production values. Nonexistent. Is it worth the plastic it's pressed into? FUCK YES.\n",
        "\nSlow, atmospheric and ominous are three keywords in describing the sound Quorthon achieved on Twilight of the Gods.\nThis was at one time meant to be the last Bathory album and as hinted by the title there's an overhanging sense of gloom prevalent on nearly all the tracks. But amidst the despair one should rightly experience while listening to an album named after the end of the world lies the epic sound we all know and love from Hammerheart. \n\nThe songs are slow, often very repetitive but invariably lead up to majestic passages such as the chorus of Blood and Iron; that very line repeated over and over again. \nThose passages are sadly less overwhelming than on Hammerheart and that, coupled with the more sombre atmosphere present here makes Twilight of the Gods the lesser good of the two in my opinion. Make no mistake, this is \u201cviking metal\u201d at its best and a couple elements are actually superior than on its predecessor:\n1) Quorthon\u2019s vocals have improved. He\u2019s still pretty far from being a good singer though, but that\u2019s a big part of the charm.\n2) The acoustics are godly! Listen to the intro to Blood and Iron (I mention this particular song once more for a good reason: it\u2019s the best on the album) for example, great sense of melody on display here.\n\nThe lyrics still focus on vikings, although in a less overt way than on the previous two albums. Productionwise this album is very good compared to most other Bathory releases, allowing all instruments to be heard just fine. The vocals might be a little low in the mix though.\n\nIn the end this is nothing but a mandatory purchase for everyone into the more epic, slow side of metal. Everyone else is advised to listen before buying, recommended tracks are Through Blood by Thunder and Blood and Iron although they\u2019re all good. The last song, Hammerheart, is based on Holst\u2019s The Planets with lyrics by Quorthon.\n",
        "\nGeeeeez... I swear this album was released solely to prove that some people will buy ANYTHING with the Bathory logo on it. It really has to be some sort of sick joke on Quorthon's part. Now, I actually LIKE bad production, when it's done well, if that makes any sense. This abortion, on the other hand, sounds like it was recorded using homemade instruments fashioned from old pieces of rusty aluminium and driftwood, while the drum machine sounds a lot like, well, a rubbish bin. Probably the same rubbish bin Lar$ used on St Anger, in fact. The liner notes claim that it was recorded over a period of several weeks. The only explanation for this is that Quorthon painstakingly took his time to make sure it sounded as awful as possible, to make sure not a trace of atmosphere or anything remotely listenable appeared on the album.\n\nI won't even bother breaking down individual songs, since they all sound the same. What we get is a monotone, pounding machine rhythm with some horribly played half-assed thrash riffs being belted out while the formerly-invicible Quorthon delivers a bunch of moronic \"social-conscious\" lyrics in a voice that resembles an angry drunken sailor reciting a monologue about his health problems. There is literally no variation here, no interesting riffs, not a shred of anything that made Bathory's previous efforts so great. Even Requiem, which is quite mediocre, shits all over this from a great height. Then, just as you think it can't get any worse, he pukes up a cover of Kiss's \"Deuce\" that manages to sound even worse than the original. Yep, that's right, a Kiss cover that sucks more than Kiss. Words cannot describe how pointless this album is. But still, i've done my best, in the hope that I can save some unsuspecting new Bathory fans from wasting their money on this.\n",
        "\nSome of you who followed Bathory's epic style, or even the \"The Return\" or \"Under the Sign...\", would be shocked to hear this one. Yes, the title of my review describe the style of this album accurately. And to think Quorton once mentioned in an interview that he never heard Venom before the release of this (yeah, right). \n\nAfter the 3 minute intro (Storm of Damnation), we get hitted in the head with \"Hades\", then \"Ripper\", which sound much alike. The production is lousy, but don't let that you distract from the riffs and the punk-ish drumming which do their job in bringing you into total headbanging frenzy. If only Quorton had a better guitar tone for this album (Kind of like Slayer's at the time), it would have worked much better.\n\n\"Necromansy\" goes along the same lines as the previous, though a bit slower. An opening riff Lemmy Kilmister would have thought off brings us to \"Sacrifice\"....BANG YOUR HEAD!!!! *bang* *bang* *bang*. The rest of the song sound like something out of Welcome to Hell, and you know that can't be a bad thing. We got a highlight here! Both \"In Conspiracy with Satan\" and \"Armageddon\" use fast tremolo distorted riffs, much alike modern black metal bands. \"Raise the Dead\" is THE midpaced song of this album, it's great choice of riffs makes it one of this album's winners. It is eerie, dark and will make you headbang at a steady pace...what more can you ask? \"War\" is another fast tune in the lines of \"Sons of Satan\" or \"Witching Hour\". Of course it works great too, and finishes the album on a high note.\n\nMind you that this isn't one of Bathory's greatest albums, but if you liked Venom's mighty black metal trilogy, you can't let this pass.\n",
        "\nWell what can I say? This album simply reeks of classic. The intro, \"Nocturnal Obeisance\" is half as long as the intro's on the first two albums, which can only be a good thing. After 90 seconds of the usual noises, \"Massacre\" bludgeons you over the head with a short, frenzied burst of pounding aggression and speed, with primitive riffing overlaid by frenzied vocal howls.\n\nFrom there on in, the album alternates between the same violent black metal which characterised Bathory's first two albums - tracks like \"Equimanthorn\" and \"Chariots of Fire\" taking the speed and aggression that extra step further - while \"Call From the Grave\", \"Enter the Eternal Fire\" and \"13 Candles\" introduce an entirely new aspect: slow, crawling doom-laden atmosphere. These tracks helped define an entirely new aspect of heavy metal. Picking up where Hellhammer left off with \"Triumph of Death\", these three tracks defined black metal's atmospheric tendencies.\n\nLyrically, this was where Quorthon began to introduce the Viking them which would become much more prominent on Blood, Fire, Death. Mind you, there's still plenty of hellfire and Satan present here, but \"Equimanthorn\", \"Massacre\" and \"Chariots of Fire\" were the obvious turning point from comic-book inspired devil worship to Conan-inspired epicness. Of course, Quorthon's English here is still quite awful, but that merely adds to the charm.\n\nIt really doesn't get much more influential than this. From the grating, washed-out production where the guitars are thinned out to become purely a tool of ambience, to upping the ante on violence and aggression in black metal, at also introducing an entirely new approach to doom-laden pounding, Under The Sign of the Black Mark is simply THE quintessential album in the laying of black metal's modern foundations. At the same time, it's an amazing album in it's own right, without a single weak moment to be found. Along with Hammerheart, this forms a pinnacle of testament to the importance of Bathory's contribution to metal as we know it.\n"
