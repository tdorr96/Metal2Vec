        "\nIt's no surprise that this is often hailed as the definitive, ultimate thrash record. For many people, it's their first introduction to metal. After Dave Mustaine's first attempt with \"Killing is my Business... and Business is Good!\", the group refined their skills even further than before to bring absolute thrashing genius, in the form of \"Peace Sells... But Who's Buying?\".\n\nIt's common knowledge that Dave Mustaine was a previous member of Metallica before being booted out and forming his own band, Megadeth. The first album was a raw, and sharp attempt at thrash, using lots of leftovers that Mustaine had from Metallica. Although this album also uses a fair amount of leftover riffs and lyrics, it's obvious that the band really had an idea of what direction to go in with this record. \n\nBy the first track \"Wake up Dead\", we can tell this isn't their first rodeo. The guitars have a low, angry, crunchy tone, almost like an animal snarling. Dave Mustaine's excellence is no stranger when we here his first solos and riffs parading throughout the album, accompanied by his raspy screaming vocals. Most of the lyrical content is about evil scary stuff, but some more realistic. Like the previous album, Gar Samuelson absolutely kills it on drums, making use of every piece of the drum kit, often throwing in lots of ride cymbals. The drums sound is crisp and clean, being very audible despite the storm of guitars.\n\nThe bass playing by David Ellefson is distinguished and oftentimes get its own fills in the album. Back to the guitars, Chris Poland and Dave Mustaine take turns with excellent soloing throughout the album, with many many fills. The shredding is clean and coordinated, and tries to fit itself in everywhere while sounding great. Songs like \"The Conjuring\" and \"good Mourning/Black Friday\" really show the shredding excellence. We are also treated to lots of clean guitar intros throughout the album that are creative and steer clear from random noodling.\n\nThe only weak track on the album would be \"I Ain't Superstitious\". It's a great cover, but personally I feel it doesn't vibe with the whole 'evil' tone of the album, but rather morphs the album into more of a 'hotrodder' feel, like something you'd hear blasting on the speakers at a classic car show. It doesn't detract too much, but I think placing that song at the end of the album would be a smarter choice. Now's a good time to talk about the album artwork; created by the brilliant Ed Repka, shows Vic Rattlehead (the bands mascot) in front of a demolished United Nations building in the aftermath of some sort of catastrophic event, with a 'for sale' sign erected in the front of the ruins as fighter jets soar overhead. The idea originally came to Dave when he was having lunch across the street from the United Nations building and thought about how cool it would look in a post apocalyptic scenario. And the albums title came from when Mustaine saw a magazine lying on a coffee table that read \"Peace sells, but nobody's buying it\". Mustaine then wrote the lyrics to the song on the rehearsal buildings wall as he didn't have any pen or paper!\n\nAs David Ellefson said, this was the album powered by cheeseburgers, cocaine, and cigarettes. \"Peace Sells... But Who's Buying?\" will go down in infamy as one of the best thrash records of all time, one with an equally as interesting story. If Dave Mustaine was never kicked out of Metallica, we may never have gotten the tracks on this album! In conclusion, everyone has heard this album, and fi you haven't then you are certainly missing out.\n\nTop 3 Songs: The Conjuring, Peace Sells, Good Mourning/Black Friday\n",
        "\nIt's my 50th review, a milestone for me on this site, and I've also been feeling rather nostalgic lately. Thus, I have decided to review the album which convinced me to embrace metal as not just a hobby, but as a lifestyle. That album is none other than Megadeth's Rust in Peace. What can really be said about this one that hasn't already been said? Well, I don't really give a damn about that, it's time to praise the ever loving shit out of this classic.\n\nWhere to even start? Well, let's rewind back to Peace Sells... But Who's Buying, Megadeth's other masterpiece. What's great about that one is the implementation of, at the time esoteric (for metal), quasi-jazz and punk aspects. They kept those traits subdued enough so that the speed/thrash metal still shined, and that's pretty much exactly what's happening with Rust in Peace as well; only this time, they've incorporated shred/tech ingredients. It's no surprise that after the introduction of speed metal symphonist Marty Friedman and soon-to-be thrash percussion icon Nick Menza, the music blossomed once more into something quite spectacular. So Far So Good... So What, if we all can be honest here for a second, frankly sucked a bit because of its rather shitty mix, hired cast of nobodies, and low amount of spectacular tracks. Basically all of those issues are entirely rectified on Rust in Peace. Every solo and riff is downright inspired, the production is extremely nice and quite crisp, and perhaps most importantly, Rust does maintain the dynamic feel of its predecessors, with several lower-key moments woven directly into the tracks so it all doesn't become too overwhelming.\n\nThe riffwork is obviously something to behold, after all, this is Mustaine in his prime. Aside from what is often expected of him, i.e. fast and good riffs, he ups the ante in pretty much every way you could imagine. Holy Wars...The Punishment Due, Rust's savagely technical opener, features several great syncopated, solo-like aspects in even just the opening rhythm guitar parts, and this standard is upheld throughout pretty much the entire album; think Metallica's And Justice For All, but faster and better. Aside from syncopation, legato, and other Mustainely techniques, this album features a surprising amount of melody, tempo shifts, time signature fuckery, and more. Lucretia, for example, is not exactly a thrash song, but it delivers those most recently mentioned aspects in spades. Its opening notes are wonderfully melodic, the verses are both bouncy and also shifty as hell, and Friedman's solo is simply mind-bending. I have a special love for this song, as I performed it at a recital, but I chose it because I already admired the shit out of it after just one listen.\n\nIt's not all fun and games, as there's certainly a hefty dose of aggression on display. The most savage cuts on here are Take No Prisoners, Five Magics, and Rust in Peace...Polaris. If you wanted Peace Sells-level savagery, these three are your best bets. As for technical ecstasy, that aspect can be found at its highest level in Holy Wars, Hangar 18, and Poison Was the Cure, the latter of which is pretty much what you'd get if you gave Metal Militia a hefty dose of crack cocaine. I could sit here and organize the tracklist even more, I could pick apart the truly scintillating solo on Tornado of Souls, I could tell you that Dawn Patrol is likely everyone's least favorite, but you surely already know all that. I also won't delve too much into Max Norman's Annihilator-esque, razor sharp production, nor the considerably profound lyricism here either. Rust in Peace is just so good the whole time, these things should be quite obvious to the ear; moreover, it's awesome enough that they didn't even need to include a cover song, it simply wasn't necessary.\n\nIn conclusion, everyone may already know that Rust in Peace is something special, but it bears repeating. This is on par with Peace Sells as Megadeth's best. Both feature one decent enough track amongst a sea of truly spectacular and magnificent metal. I can't begin to understate how blown open my mind was when I first heard this. Yeah the vocals aren't the best in thrash, and for some, they're even a dealbreaker. However, if you can't see the greatness behind that snarly singing voice, you're simply blind. This is some of the best metal music ever made, and to this day, it still fully enraptures me. Kinda sucks that they pretty much abandoned this winning tech-thrash hand to ride the groovy pop metal train for the next 10 or so years after this came out, but I chalk that up to a changing musical landscape and I also point a blaming finger at the success of Metallica's self-titled. At least we got the pretty great Youthanasia from that period. Anyway; to put it succinctly, I say Rust in Peace is a must-listen for every metalhead.\n\nP.S. Do NOT buy that shitty 2004 remix, it's basically the George Lucas special edition of Rust in Peace. So many shockingly bad changes were made to it: 1990 version or bust.\n",
        "\nWith a very promising new Megadeth album on the horizon, I thought it would be interesting to have a look at the yardstick by which I tend to measure every other Megadeth album. At the time, \u2018Rust In Peace\u2019 was the album that finally delivered on the promise Dave Mustaine and his fellow musicians occasionally hinted at on their first three albums. While most of the material is still quite fast, the focus of the album is on clever songwriting, with a surprisingly large number of crunchy speed metal riffs as the means to that end. I still think it is the best Megadeth album to date.\n\nHaving said that, \u2018Rust In Peace\u2019 is not necessarily Megadeth\u2019s most consistent release. That title would probably go to 2004\u2019s comeback album \u2018The System Has Failed\u2019. \u2018Rust In Peace\u2019 just happens to have a few highlights that are such landmarks in heavy metal songwriting to this day that some of the lesser songs don\u2019t quite manage to make the same impact. The likes of \u2018Lucretia\u2019 are a pleasant enough listen, but when measured against the tight, precise riffing and the accessible, yet surprisingly complex and mature songwriting of some of the other tracks, they do tend to fall a bit short.\n\nOne of those tracks that hog the spotlight, so to speak, is the monumental opener \u2018Holy Wars\u2026The Punishment Due\u2019. Quite a daring move to open the album with what is arguably the most complex song. It starts out recognizable enough with an uptempo thrash riff until it is suddenly broken up by a short, almost Egyptian-sounding classical guitar interlude and the track spends quite some time moving through different atmospheres in mid-tempo territory. With that one and the somewhat more traditional-sounding \u2018Hangar 18\u2019 culminating in long, intense guitar solo trade-offs between Mustaine and (at the time) new kid Marty Friedman, the stage is set for an album full of incredible guitar work.\n\nFriedman\u2019s proper introduction comes in the surprisingly melodic \u2018Tornado Of Souls\u2019. There is a minute-long guitar solo with such a strong, almost narrative build-up that it is probably my favorite solo ever recorded. The rest of the song is incredible as well, though it could have been lifted into the stratosphere even more with a better singer than Mustaine, who is pushing the edge of his range here. Those who prefer Megadeth as a full-speed thrash metal band are served by \u2018Poison Was The Cure\u2019 and the incredible, annihilating \u2018Take No Prisoners\u2019. The deceptively complex \u2018Five Magics\u2019 needs some time to grow and \u2018Rust In Peace\u2026Polaris\u2019 is nothing special, but a fun closer.\n\nSome heavy metal from the eighties has aged about as well as a pack of butter in direct sunlight, but \u2018Rust In Peace\u2019 still sounds as fresh and inspired today. It is also the last album released before a combination of label pressure and commercial ambitions pushed Megadeth towards a bit of an identity crisis, though to Mustaine\u2019s credit: even if he is forced to write an accessible rock album, he\u2019ll try and make the best out of it he possibly can. Despite the band\u2019s recent output mostly being very good \u2013 except, and I cannot emphasize this enough, \u2018Super Collider\u2019 \u2013 there is a reason why people keep comparing Megadeth albums to \u2018Rust In Peace\u2019. It has some of the best metal ever written.\n\nAs a small postscriptum: if you have not heard \u2018Rust In Peace\u2019 yet, make sure to listen to the 2004 remaster. With the bass and backing vocals being much more audible, it is truly the best way to experience the album.\n\nRecommended tracks: \u2018Tornado Of Souls\u2019, \u2018Holy Wars\u2026The Punishment Due\u2019, \u2018Hangar 18\u2019, \u2018Take No Prisoners\u2019\n\nOriginally written for my Kevy Metal weblog\n",
        "\nI guess Nils K Rue\u2019s time with the Drover brothers wasn\u2019t to last as he was quickly out of the band to be replaced by\u2026 Dave Mustaine? Oh shit, this isn\u2019t Eidolon; it\u2019s fuckin\u2019 Megadeth! This was honestly a pretty good move on old Megadavo\u2019s part \u2013 Glen Drover has that drive Mustaine\u2019s prior co-pilots (the ones since Marty Friedman, anyway) weren\u2019t really delivering on, and he\u2019s got some of that cool shreddy shit going for him that Marty Friedman had. Back in 2007, this was refreshing (if fairly uneven) as it sounded the closest to their best material and sounded the most inspired in over fifteen years; now, fifteen years removed from its release, it\u2019s honestly the easiest album of theirs to go back to and enjoy from between Countdown to Extinction and Dystopia, at least based on how there are more quality songs here than across any other album from this period.\n\nIt\u2019s one thing if they had fluked their way into some outright bangers like \u201cSleepwalker\u201d and \u201cGears of War\u201d; it\u2019s another that they\u2019re more calculated joints and they\u2019re joined by the likes of \u201cWashington is Next\u201d, \u201cBlessed Are the Dead\u201d and \u201cPlay for Blood\u201d. The first two tracks on the album are basically the speed metal ones, with faster picking and more kinetic drumming courtesy of Shawn Drover. \u201cWashington is Next\u201d is the more overtly melodic tune of the two \u2013 particularly with its leads permeating through the non-verse and non-solo bits \u2013 but the way that both tracks bob and weave betwixt their riffs etch a more energetic performance to get the album going. Yet the timing between each shift gives the riffs room to breathe, to make an impression. But this isn\u2019t a return to the jazzy speed metal of the debut \u2013 Glen\u2019s more Friedman than Poland, and Shawn\u2019s definitely more Menza than Samuelson. Nah, this is just some right riffing kind of shreddy metal not too far removed from Rust in Peace\u2026 at its best moments here, anyway.\n\nBut it\u2019s not all about speed. \u201cGears of War\u201d contrasts this with a heavily melodic mid-paced riffset, with a chorus like a smart bomb and an overall composition like precision guided armament. \u201cPlay for Blood\u201d maintains this idea, but in a far groovier, borderline Symphony X kind of way \u2013 based on its overall infectiousness with some rather hooky riffs, at any rate. \u201cBlessed Are the Dead\u201d, is a case where you could alter Mustaine\u2019s vocals to his less gravelly trademark snarl (as he shifted down a few octaves here), and take out the more metallic edges of the mastering to a more rock/metal kind of deal, and it wouldn\u2019t be out of place on Countdown to Extinction. The other two here could\u2019ve fit there too, but I don\u2019t know man \u2013 I don\u2019t remember Countdown being as overly riffy as \u201cGears of War\u201d was wont to be. So from there, it\u2019s more like that bridge between Rust and Countdown\u2026 again, at its best moments here.\n\nAfter that\u2026 nothing. Some people have pointed out \u201cBurnt Ice\u201d as a highlight due to its sheer riff quantity, which would be an impressive feat if they actually contributed towards making anything other than background noise. That\u2019s pretty much what a lot of the rest of this album devolves into. Just this vaguely metallic sound coming out of your speakers that at least fills the quiet air, and that\u2019s it. \u201cBurnt Ice\u201d just happens to be the best of it because it at least has stronger riffs. Even then, they did it considerably better on the first two tracks. You could probably pick out some decent enough radio rock choruses in \u201cNever Walk Alone\u201d and \u201cUnited Abominations\u201d, but that would require going through hookless verses that amount to jack shit. I wish there was more to add, but frankly, the issue is of weaker hooks and tepid melodies. The riffs are there, the solos are good \u2013 perhaps even terrific \u2013 but the actual songs don\u2019t utilize them very well. Yep, even when 2000s Megadeth generates a potentially good album, there\u2019s this hefty fuckin\u2019 asterisk attached to it that makes it not so good.\n\nIt\u2019s also noteworthy that on the worse songs, Mustaine\u2019s vocal patterns are quite... odd. \u201cAmerikhastan\u201d is the worst for this \u2013 and it already suffers from basically nothing working in its favor, so to have the most forced vocal lines on the record\u2026 yeah nah this song blows. Even the good songs have instances of that like the chorus to \u201cWashington is Next\u201d \u2013 and while we\u2019re on this song, a more restrained sort of murmuring Mustaine juxtaposed by some harder-hitting speed metal riffs is no bueno \u2013 but you at least get some working bits like the more snarling \u201cGears of War\u201d chorus or the more varied performance on \u201cPlay for Blood\u201d. His vocals are generally not very good outside of select moments, which only exasperates some of the more forced vocal patterns.\n\nI remember back in 2007, United Abominations was considered a return to form \u2013 and, unlike The System Has Failed, there has definitely been a case for that. Perhaps the proverbial bridge between Rust in Peace and Countdown to Extinction is a more appropriate comparison, as it\u2019s a largely shreddy\u2026 speed rock joint perhaps, with moments of genuine thrash interspersed throughout. It certainly riffs harder than what they had done since Rust in Peace, and the solos positively soar as if Marty Friedman was right there with them. If this was an EP of the five good songs, this would be a silver medal next to the dynamic duo that is Peace Sells and Rust in Peace. But with the other five dragging them down, recommending a revisiting of United Abominations comes with quite a few caveats.\n",
        "\nThe World Needs a Hero is supposedly a return to form for Megadeth. Vic is back on the cover, and there's even a Hangar 18 sequel on here, surely they outdid Risk, right? Well, Risk is not a bright spot in their career, but at least it seemed like some effort went into making it stand out. This album on the other hand just doesn't seem to have a lot of love put into it. It's not as experimental as Risk, but the band does attempt a little bit of that. It's not a grab bag of different styles like Cryptic Writings, but it isn't very cohesive like Youthanasia either. This isn't their worst album, but it's pretty damn close. It's rife with sing-talking, bad choruses, and pretty unmemorable riffs. Generally, if something on here is \"good\" by this album's standards, that just means it sucks less than the other tracks.\n\nDisconnect and Burning Bridges are probably the two best cuts from the first half. They remind me of Cryptic Writings or even Youthanasia. The first half also contains the title track and 1000 Times Goodbye, which both downright suck. The latter half has 2 worthwhile songs just like the first half (Dread and Return to Hangar). Both of these feature annoying sing-talking though, which makes them worse than they could have been, especially in Return to Hangar's case. When has about 4 minutes of buildup which leads to a bad imitation of Diamond Head, so I don't count it as one of the good ones. Kill the King could have really spruced this album up, because 4 \"good\" songs out of 12 is a pretty bad batting average! \n\nThe production isn't very good, and at this point in their career there's not really a good excuse for that. It sounds like Cryptic Writings but bigger. Everything is noticeably compressed, so there is not much breathing room in the mix and it definitely clips at points. The drums and bass are well played enough, but it's clear that there's not much of a musical focus on them. Despite this, they are mixed louder than the other instruments. The guitars sound similar to the Cryptic Writings tone, which is more of a rock-oriented type of sound, and what happens sometimes is that when the band starts to play riffs that are on the metal side, it kind of makes them sound weaker. This is the opposite of what happened with Youthanasia, which had its more accesible moments improved by giving them that deeper, heavier guitar tone.\n\nThis album was supposed to be a return to form, why else would Vic be back on the cover? It's like they baited people into buying it by putting Vic on it. The fact that he's on there implies that there is thrash to be heard, but it's all an illusion. The only thrashy song on here is Return to Hangar, and even that is a reprise of a much better song for the most part. Dave's sing-talking, bad lyrics, and not so great songwriting cripple this album. It's pretty uninspired, doesn't really know what it wants to be, and doesn't really do much I could see fans of thrash or even the Youthanasia/Countdown sound liking either. What's laughable is that while Risk and Super Collider are terrible, at least they're bad enough to have a reputation. I have not once heard any fans of Megadeth mention this album by name, it's like everyone forgets it even exists. The best track of this era, Kill the King, which most fans do know, isn't even on here! I would say it's worse than Risk, because at least that release had an identity and Marty Friedman. This was a low point in their career for a very long time, only eclipsed by the even lower low known as Super Collider.\n",
        "\nI listened through Megadeth's discography from beginning to end for the first time thanks to how I check out bands, and I was blown away by the intro to their first album (Last Rites / Loved to Deth), and while Peace Sells...But Who's Buying? is a fantastic record, I always felt that Wake up Dead should've had a bigger impact and build up. The moment I listened to the first song on this record (Into the Lungs of Hell, a wonderful instrumental), I was immediately put back on the headbanging spree in my bedroom at age 16 and it didn't stop for one moment from beginning to end (excluding tracks such as In My Darkest Hour). \n\nAs I said before, Into the Lungs of Hell is a legendary intro and immediately shows you what kind of album this is. It transitions into Set the World Afire, starting with \"I don't want to set the world on fire...\", with a nuclear missile falling and exploding in the background, and heading straight into that riff. Into the Lungs of Hell / Set the World Afire both have his post apocalyptic atmosphere on them that I don't think any band has been able to replicate since, and I applaud Dave and co. for this. \n\nNext up you get the somewhat forgettable but still catchy cover of Anarchy in the U.K. by The Sex Pistols. Now, this would take place as my least favorite song on this record if it wasn't for another song (we'll get into that), but as is, it's a fine enough tune with one catchy chorus. This track is followed up with my favorite track on the album, Mary Jane. Why does this track always get overlooked? Seriously, I'd kill to hear Megadeth play this one live again. It's got one hell of a build up from the intro (\"Forgive me father, for I have sinned\"), to that awesome phaser solo, that heads straight into (\"FORGIVE ME FATHER... I'M IN THE AESTRAL PLANE, AND I'LL NEVER BE THE SAME, NEVER NEVER NEVERRRRR!\"). \n\nThis track is followed up by the worst effort on the record, 502. I don't hate this song. It's not offensive and it's not awful. I can sit through it from beginning to end. It's just extremely forgettable and kind of drags, which is upsetting when you have three fantastic songs and a competent cover in a row. Now, the next track is In My Darkest Hour, and I've got to say something controversial... I never liked this one when I first heard the album. I know that this song was written after hearing about Cliff Burton's death, and Mr. Burton is sorta kinda my favorite musician under the sun, but I just couldn't get why the song was so loved. Nowadays, I respect the song and I really do like the \"Time has a way of taking time, loneliness is not only felt by fools...\" section of the song, but overall it's kind of stale to me.\n\nThe next song before the final track is Liar, which has a pissed off Dave Mustaine at the microphone yelling every possible worst thing he can at Chris Poland. A legendary song, though I don't have much to say about it, except for the fact that this is the first of two instances where Dave raps on a Megadeth song. The final track is one hell of a way to end an album, this track? HOOK. IN. MOUTH. I have no idea why this song is so fantastic, but it just is. That bass, those drums, and Dave's absolutely haunting vocals are just something else. \n\nCan I also mention that this album's 2004 remaster is awful? I feel like I have to mention that.\n\nOverall, So Far, So Good...So What! is a absolutely awesome record that really shouldn't be overlooked. While it is not my favorite Megadeth record (that goes to Rust in Peace), it's certainly one of my absolute favorites. Songs to check out are every song on this album.\n",
        "\nPeace Sells and Rust in Peace \u2013 go ahead, name a more iconic duo of classic albums! Really though, alongside Rust in Peace, Peace Sells is the album you\u2019re going to think of when it comes to Megadeth. Sure, it\u2019s more mellow than the debut and Mustaine\u2019s vocals are nowhere near as unhinged; still, you go through its legendary A-side with the energetic \u201cWake Up Dead\u201d, the three-ton triplet assault of \u201cDevils Island\u201d, the drearier \u201cThe Conjuring\u201d and the downright catchy \u201cPeace Sells\u201d, and perhaps these trade-offs are for the best. More technically proficient, more precise in exactly where each riff strikes, hooks out the ass and shreddy solos to give that extra bit of flavor. Just the way that \u201cWake Up Dead\u201d gets right into the thick of things with its quick little bass line before bobbing and weaving betwixt these two groovy riffs, capping off with Mustaine and Poland soloing like maniacs before heading into the speed metal madness. From there, they let you know that you\u2019re in for a wild 36 minutes! Everything here\u2019s so tight, they could press diamonds.\n\nNot that the B-side is any kind of slouch. Shit, I\u2019d say it comes pretty close. \u201cGood Mourning\u201d picks up where \u201cThe Conjuring\u201d left on in terms of dreariness, with its more melancholic and atmospheric strumming leading expertly into the breakneck-paced \u201cBlack Friday\u201d. \u201cMy Last Words\u201d plays to a similar beat as the \u201cBlack Friday\u201d half, ending the album with a bang through its explosive speed metal riffing. There\u2019s definitely more emphasis on white-hot riffing juxtaposed by tenacious soloing than on the debut. Killing is My Business had a jazzier overtone to it \u2013 one that\u2019s highly evident amidst the choppier riffing \u2013 while this tends to be more closely related to what Metallica and Slayer had been doing up to this point. Although they do revisit those ideas for a couple of songs \u2013 the more technically charged \u201cBad Omen\u201d with its choppier riffs and positively evil intro, and\u2026 serviceable at best cover of \u201cI Ain\u2019t Superstitious\u201d. Points for fitting it more into their style (as they had with \u201cThese Boots\u201d), particularly with the jazzier drumming and lead at the beginning; it\u2019s just that compared to the masterful \u201cThe Conjuring\u201d and \u201cPeace Sells\u201d, \u201cI Ain\u2019t Superstitious\u201d comes across a might underdeveloped. They had to still fit it within the original song\u2019s basic framework, versus whatever more original one they have for the rest that allowed for them to spread their wings and fly away\u2026\n\nThat aside, Peace Sells is a damn good album that rises above the rank and file to show exactly why Megadeth are a part of the big four. The airtight, inventive rhythms combined with some rather Malmsteen-esque soloing makes for some rather excellent guitars that overshadow the declined vocal performances. As a result, the songs largely become the classics that we all know and love even over 35 years later.\n",
        "\nBefore we begin I\u2019d like to add an author note of sorts. I wrote this review in 2018, in the sweltering Spanish sun, while listening to the album in question. My approach was quite hyperbolic and riddled with amateur spelling errors. That said, I\u2019ve cleared up the errors and made some minor alterations to the text, but left it largely in tact, firstly because I\u2019m quite fond of it, being the first review I ever wrote for... well, anything. Secondly, I think it holds up damn well, and my opinions on the record remain the same.\n\nBursting out of the gate with nothing but vengeance on his mind after being kicked out of Metallica in 1983, Dave Mustaine and his then new band, Megadeth layed down the fastest and heaviest thing to come out of the trash scene on a a whole as of 1985. But does it stand the test of time? Well, as much as I would like to emphatically scream 'yes it fucking does!' the answer to that question lies in which version of the record you pick up. \n\nDuring the recording process of this album, the producer provided to the band by the record company, Combat Records, blew half of the bands $8000 recording budget on Heroin, Coke, and, (no joke) around 100 pounds of motherfucking Hamburger meat. After firing the first producer and receiving and extra $4000 from their then record company to get the record finished, the band didn't have enough money to hire a decent producer and ended up producing the thing themselves.\n\nDespite doing a rather good job considering how much worse it could have ended up, the album's production is severly lacking, with the biggest sin being how quiet the rhythm guitar is compared to the rest of the band. With that said, the 2018 remaster if the album is far, far better and probably the best way to listen to and appreciate this album. Don\u2019t entirely write off the original though, it has a certain kind of charm, and if your not one of the lucky bastards who happens to own a copy, it can be found on youtube with just a few clicks.\n\nIs this album sloppy at times? Yes, but who the fuck cares? This is a goddamn thrash record first and foremost and it's only preoccupation is slamming into you like a fucking freight train and only pausing the assault for a hot minute in order to burn your ears off with fantastic solos. Does this record do that? Yes it fucking does! ...I knew I'd get that in here somewhere. Every riff on this record cuts through your ear drums at a lightning pace, despite having been injected with a surprising amount of melody and, in the case of the title track and a couple others, even showing slight tastful restraint. \n\nThe least stereotypical thrash song on this album has to be 'Looking Down The Cross' with its spine-tingling introduction that borders on becoming a technical death metal riff, pummelling rhythm section, lead guitar work with a strong melodic focus that serves the song, and a 5 minute+ run time (making it the longest track on the album) it's by far the closest thing the album has to an epic song. \n\nNow I will take a brief moment to sing the prases of the track Rattlehead. No, before you ask, you don\u2019t have a choice in the matter. Goddamn this song is amazing, where to begin? The difficult as fuck to learn yet catchy main riff, the second riff that comes in like a sledgehammer and provides a short but sweet mid-tempo (at least as far as the rest of the song is concerned) head-banging moment before the real oh shit moment: the first solo of the song. This solo not only sets your ears on fire, but it also works as an effective melodic bridge between the slower and faster segments of the song. And don't get me started on the second solo of the song, words cannot describe it's brilliance. \n\nSimilar praises could be sung of 'Loved To Death', the title track and 'The skull Beneath The Skin'. Does this make the record repetitive? No, It makes it consistent, and that makes it a great album\n\nAnd what's this? A thrash record with a bassist who actually does something interesting for a change? Oh yeah, I forgot this came out in 1985, when great bassists still existed. Listen to David's fanastic work on 'Chosen Ones' during the solo and bass break, it carries the song rhythm brilliantly along with showing musically progressive streak throughout.\n\nLook folks, this album rises above it's thrash metal classification (and depending on which version you\u2019re listening to, it\u2019s shitty production), becoming something quite a bit more exceptional. If you haven't already, listen to this fucking thing in whatever format you can find it in.\n",
        "\nIn many ways, Megadeth are one of the more interesting members of the Big Four. Not the best nor even the most noteworthy (outside of Rust in Peace, of course), but definitely the one where circumstance and their few lasting impacts have certainly made them a real character. You can even hear it loud and clear here in their debut, Killing is my Business. It\u2019s been well-documented which songs here are reworkings of old Metallica tracks \u2013 yada yada yada \u201cMechanix\u201d is just \u201cThe Four Horsemen\u201d on speed, you\u2019ve heard it a million times before. But there may be a reason you\u2019ve not heard Killing is my Business the album a million times, or at least not compared to Kill Em All and Show No Mercy. Killing is my Business certainly shows no mercy with its top cuts, but given the relatively unfocused and aimless thrashing across the rest of the album, it doesn\u2019t quite kill em all with a fistful of metal.\n\nDespite being known more for their technical proficiency, this album does show a rougher, tougher version of them. The main verse riffs to \u201cLast Rites / Loved to Death\u201d and \u201cThe Skull Beneath the Skin\u201d have that choppy quality the more technical side of thrash tends to be known for \u2013 a sign of things to come for Megadeth, albeit with more anger than you\u2019d expect from them. \u201cMechanix\u201d has that unabashed hardcore slant to it that makes it pretty damn catchy with all things considered. \u201cKilling is my Business\u201d and \u201cRattlehead\u201d have those nifty little speed metal riffs that are about as addicting as the drugs the band were doing at the time. All of which are complete with solos that could best be described as a flurry of notes rammed down your throat.\n\nBut it\u2019s not just in the riffs \u2013 not just in the speeding, the thrashing and even the technical bits. There\u2019s also the case of Mustaine\u2019s vocals, which sound positively unhinged. It\u2019s recognizably Mustaine, but the amount of power and force behind his vocals \u2013 whether you\u2019re listening to the original cut or the remaster \u2013 definitely gives the music that extra bit of lift that pumps it up and does not air it out! I honestly forgot just how effective his vocals were here. Normally, when I think of Mustaine\u2019s vocals, I think \u201cworks for the music at best and plain bad at worst\u201d; here, I\u2019m almost convinced this would\u2019ve inspired Tom Araya to kick his vocal game up a notch back in 1985, it\u2019s that good!\n\nSo what\u2019s all the hubbub, why isn\u2019t this \u201c10/10 best thrash debut\u201d, what\u2019s with the bellyaching in the first paragraph? Well, the thing is that when Megadeth\u2019s on their A-game, they are indeed terrific. But they aren\u2019t always on their A-game, and when that happens, all you\u2019re waiting for is a catchy chorus and/or a ripper of a solo from Mustaine and the guitarist for hire (be it Chris Poland, Marty Friedman or Kiko Loureiro) just for the song to fucking do something! As is the case, both \u201cChosen Ones\u201d and \u201cLooking Down the Cross\u201d come across more faceless due to the lack of any interesting riffs or core progressions when compared to the better cuts on this album. The former zooms by like a snap, and the latter only thrives thanks to its solos. Otherwise, they\u2019re both considerably more rushed in their execution, like they blanked out on how to make these songs as complete or even good as \u201cMechanix\u201d or \u201cRattlehead\u201d so they just went with these outlines and that\u2019s it. We got those two songs and \u201cKilling is my Business\u201d done, we\u2019re all good! \u201cThese Boots\u201d \u2013 whether you\u2019re listening to the remaster that has more bleeps than Hell\u2019s Kitchen on broadcast television or not \u2013 is a lame cover song, particularly since Mustaine scales back his vocals significantly to try and fit the original song, but also just because the riffs are more standard speed metal fare. Just a case of there not being much really going on, you know?\n\nA couple of songs here showcase some cool technical shit, although beyond the killer hooks, they\u2019re rather underdeveloped as the surrounding riffs lack the kick that speed metal riffing needs. That\u2019s about the unifying issue with the non-classics on Killing is my Business. Songs like \u201cRattlehead\u201d are fully realized due to consistently engaging riffing while songs like \u201cLast Rites\u201d and \u201cChosen Ones\u201d seem about half-done with filler riffs, maybe a slick hook and definitely a sick solo. That being said, if you\u2019ve ever wanted to hear Mustaine sound like a maniac behind the microphone, then Killing is my Business is the album to pop into your stereo.\n",
        "\nMy favorite metal band is Metallica. I have a tattoo of their logo on my back, and I listen to Ride the Lightning every other day, sometimes daily. But the one thing I must admit is that Dave Mustaine leaving the band is the best thing to ever happen. Metallica might have suffered, but Dave's resilience and willpower led him to create one of the best metal bands of all time in Megadeth, probably the only thrash metal band that truly gave Metallica a run for the money (sorry Slayer, Megadeth is leagues better).\n\nThis demo from 1984 comes on the heels of Dave's dismissal, but he sounds anything but bothered on this tape. The guitar work sounds hungry and Dave's vocals are laced with vengeance and attitude. This was written and played when the band was still a trio (admittedly, they work much better as a four-piece), but wow is this demo ahead of its time for 1984. The guitar riffing is incredibly fast, approaching modern power metal levels of fast, but of course Dave is a much better songwriter than anyone making music in that genre so the riffs still sound catchy, even played at blazing fast speeds.\n\nOf course, this is a demo, and on KIMB it's much easier to hear the music being played, but the band's core sound is still very apparent. \"The Mechanix\" makes it onto the demo and it sounds damn good, although it might be a touch slower than the studio version (\"Loved to Deth\" is way faster than the studio version), the drums sound great and the fills work well for the song. It's hard not to just refer to Megadeth as Dave, because his presence is always what is most striking about any Megadeth release. His vocals are not good, but they work so well with the music that it's hard not to like his nasally vocal delivery. And his guitar playing is obviously a cut above everyone else in metal. \"The Skull Beneath the Skin\" is the third track and it sounds awful through the wall of fuzz that the production erects, but it's still great, even if you cannot hear the vocals at all. The riffs are just too good to turn away.\n",
        "\nThough perhaps not remembered as fondly as the thrash classics that came before it, there has always been a level of respectability to Megadeth's somewhat checkered 1992 venture into quasi-commercial territory. Originally noted as being Mustaine's response to Metallica's ubiquitous 1991 eponymous album, hindsight tends to reveal an album that was less willing to go head-first into commercial pandering, though it was definitely a success in the sales department. About 20 years following it's initial run the waning days of the American thrash metal craze, Countdown To Extinction would be given a similar treatment that Dio gave his legendary solo debut album in 2006, namely a live performance in its entirety, surrounded by a number of obligatory classics from other albums and a token current song for good measure.\n\nTime may well have been taking its toll on Dave's aging voice when the concert occurred in late 2012, but adrenaline can do wonders for an untrained vocalist who's upper range was beginning to fail him. By contrast, the youthful vigor on display by then lead guitarist Chris Broderick (arguably the most technically brilliant player to ever cycle through Megadeth's ever-changing lineup) and drummer Shawn Drover allow one to almost mistake this for an event from the mid-90s, with the former and longtime bassist Dave Ellefson providing some additional power to the vocal performance during the chorus segments. To be fully forthcoming, Mustaine hits the occasional sour note when trying to belt out some of the higher notes, but for the most part, the solid instrumental performance surrounding his aging pipes sufficiently distracts from this.\n\nThe surrounding attractions that round out this 2 hour marathon event include a rather curious blend, or arguably a fitting one for those who originally discovered Megadeth during their more commercialized 90s era. Obligatory epic thrashers such as \"Hanger 18\" and \"Holy Wars...The Punishment Due\" provide much of the zenith point of the early and later segments, with Broderick and Mustaine all but lighting the stage on fire during the dueling solo segments. Surprisingly enough, the entries from 1997's Cryptic Writings in the chugging thrasher \"She Wolf\" and the more tame rocking grooves of \"Trust\" are well realized and don't detract from the old classics, nor does the more by-the-numbers current song \"Public Enemy No. 1\" off the then newest offering Th1rt3en. But ultimately the real golden moment of the entire show is the faithfully rendered performance of original smash hit and thrash classic \"Peace Sells\".\n\nPeripheral highlights aside, the grueling 11 song slough through the Countdown set is a delightfully apt one, taking care to include all of the various studio bells and whistles that made the album a polished and highly marketable change of pace. For those that were firmly locked into the older thrash camp of Megadeth's fan base, deep tracks such as \"High Speed Dirt\", \"Architecture Of Aggression\" and particularly the epic beast and album closer \"Ashes In Your Mouth\" prove masterfully accomplished, though Mustaine struggles a bit with the higher notes on the former. But even more rock-based MTV fodder such as \"Foreclosure Of A Dream\" and \"Countdown To Extinction\" slam the metallic gavel down hard, and the somewhat quirky chugger \"Psychotron\" also goes over solidly. It's not quite a full on reproduction of the same magic that occurred in the studio back in 1992, but it gets close most of the time.\n\nBarring the aforementioned weakness in Dave's vocal performance and also the mix of the instruments relative to the crowd being a bit distant and uneven sounding, the end result here is a decent overall live album with a few stellar highlights. All of the oddball narrated segments that filter in and out of the Countdown To Extinction set tend to work a bit better in the video format, but they managed to avoid being awkward even when heard on CD, which is more than can be said about some of the studio work that coincided with the early 2010s era of the band that produced this album. What could be dubbed the Broderick era of Megadeth tends to catch a bad wrap due to some poor studio showings, but this is not one of them, and along with Endgame showcases this lineup in a better light. It will play more to mainline fans rather than hardcore thrashers, but it's a solid offering regardless.\n",
        "\nMegadeth have a surprising number of compilations. From \"Capitol Punishment: The Megadeth Years\", to most recently, Warheads On Foreheads, the speedy thrash boys from Los Angeles do enjoy a compilation every now and then. I consider \"Warheads On Foreheads\" to be like a Megadeth retrospective, a look at their entire career. From the first song Rattlehead being off their first release, to the final song Dystopia, off their latest release. Personally, I believe this collection is the best Megadeth have ever put out. It's much better then Still Alive And Well and ESPECIALLY better then Greatest Hits: Back To The Start.\n\nSong selection is okay, though the omission of tracks like \"Peace Sells\" and \"502\" are disappointing. I believe they could've fit one more KIMB or SFSGSW song instead of adding \"Holy Wars\" directly at the end of the first disc. It would've worked much better as the opening song of the second disc, which comprises Megadeth's 1990-1994 material. For most mainstream fans, disc 2 is the most worthwhile in the set, as it contains their biggests hits, like Hangar 18, Angry Again, and Symphony of Destruction.\n\nFor me, I enjoy the first disc of the set the most, I love 80's Megadeth more than any other era, and I enjoy they picked so many Peace Sells songs. However, the omission of SFSGSW songs deducts score from this album. C'mon Dave, In My Darkest Hour is a good song, but is that the only thing you're gonna play from SFSGSW? It makes little sense, as while it's not my absolute most favorite Megadeth album, it has many songs worthy of being put into a collection like this (i.e. 502, Into The Lungs Of Hell, Liar).\n\nOf course, I must mention that this album uses the remastered versions of every pre-2002 song. As such, Hangar 18 sounds overproduced, Sweating Bullets uses the inferior 2004 remaster to the superior (though still disappointing) 2012 remaster, while Symphony uses the 2012 remaster...?\n\nConfusing, to say the least. I'm not sure if it was a decision on capitol records part or Dave's part, but he includes the terrible remasters in EVERY release. Only recently has the incredible superior mix of Rust In Peace been made readily available. I understand, Dave is a businessman and whatever gets the money rolling he will do, but this is disappointing and is why this compilation is not getting above an 80% for me. Do better, Dave.\n\nLast thing I should talk about is the final disc of the set, disc 3. Composed of material from Cryptic Writings onward, it's probably the least valuable disc in the 3 disc set, as I believe Megadeth's newer music has aged worse then their older material. This does not mean that the disc does not have good songs, however. \"Public Enemy No. 1\" and \"Poisonous Shadows\" are some of my favorite Megadeth songs, and the compilation ends on a rather fitting note, with the title track of their latest album, Dystopia. \n\nI managed to pick this set up for about 15$, and it's about worth that, I'm a big Megadeth fan so it was worth it to me. I'd suggest listening to the albums these songs come off of first, but if you're looking for a fun way to kill a few hours while you're bored, this set will do it for you. Just don't expect album-level quality.\n\n-Someone who's rather grateful, and somewhat dead inside.\n",
        "\nThis album is very difficult to categorize. Personally, I would categorize this album as a prog metal record with thrash influences (and a dash of doom metal, but we'll get to that). This album really reinvented the wheel for thrash, though, and Megadeth solidified themselves as a top three thrash band, even as the genre was dying out. Perhaps, this album is part of why it died out, because it symbolized the apex of the genre, and all other bands had to find other styles to compete.\n\nThe album kicks off with one of the greatest thrash songs ever, \"Holy Wars... the Punishment Due,\" and it doesn't even have a hook. Mustaine rants about the ideological consequences of religion and their culmination in war, but from the first ten seconds it's clear that the band sounds hungrier, more focused, and more creative than they had been in years. This is due in part to the band mostly kicking their serious drug habits, and also to the addition of lead guitarist Marty Friedman and drummer Nick Menza, who at the time were both at the top of their class in the metal world. Marty's melodic capabilities perfectly contrasted the heavy, crunching riffs from Dave, but also brought out the best in Dave's lead duties that shine through here, like on the back half of \"Hangar 18\" when the two guitarists trade solos.\n\nThis album is undoubtedly guitar driven, and the riffs here are simply brilliant. There isn't a dull riff in the bunch, and \"Lucretia\" and \"Tornado of Souls\" probably showcase the best main riffs on the album. They soar above Nick Menza's frenetic drumming, but they clearly are the focal point of the album. Dave's vocals sound pretty crisp here too, his nasally delivery is perfect for the dystopian message. This works well against the gang vocals on songs like \"Take No Prisoners\" and with the apocalyptic narrative that Dave paints in the lyricism of the title track. This album easily has the best lyrics of Dave's career, toeing the line between pretentiousness and insightfulness beautifully.\n\nDave Ellefson is another star of this album, his bass lines are consistently smooth and intricate, especially on the doom-laden interlude \"Dawn Patrol.\" His bass pokes through on the aforementioned \"Take No Prisoners\" as well, and it's impressive that his bass is able to keep up with Mustaine's riffing. Mustaine writes some of his fastest riffs to date on this album, a good example is \"Poison was the Cure.\" The riffs on this song rivals \"Mechanix\" in terms of speed, and the doom-inspired intro is perfectly juxtaposed to lull the listeners into a sleep. \"Five Magics\" similarly works in a break from the onslaught, and has a well-written hook and the most enthralling solo on the record as well, although the solo in \"Tornado of Souls\" certainly has a stake In the conversation.\n\nThis album sounds complete, polished, and perfectly meshes the sounds of thrash and the blooming prog-metal scene that would lead bands like Dream Theater to prosper. Megadeth does it with care and respect for the art they're creating, employing detailed and complex rhythms under well-crafted riffs that don't feel overdone. And what is perhaps the biggest draw of this album is that Dave pens some of his most thoughtful lyrics, from a societally-conscious perspective, that makes the futuristic guitar licks and the frenzied drums sound like they have a purpose. This is, without a doubt, the peak of thrash metal- that is, if it doesn't transcend fully into the prog metal world.\n",
        "\nYouthanasia is the second heavy metal/rock-oriented album by Megadeth. Their previous venture, Countdown to Extinction, seemed to go in a couple odd directions and was hit or miss for me, but Youthanasia is much more focused and simple (in a good way). This is the album from their mainstream mid period I return to the most. It has aged quite well, and I'd go so far as to say that it is the best album from their \"pop\" years.\n\nOn Youthanasia, Megadeth gives us a more fun, groovier, earwormier version of the CtE formula. This was done by increasing the melodic aspects and giving every song a strong chorus. Due to these changes, even the filler tracks are good, which is very unusual for Megadeth. Youthanasia also lessens the experimental aspects of CtE for a more streamlined sound. That's usually cause for concern, but not with Youthanasia. Weird little left turns like CtE's Captive Honor and Psychotron are just not to be found here, which is great from my perspective. They also moved away from that razor sharp Rust in Peace tone to a deeper, heavier sound, which especially enhances sinister cuts like Black Curtains.\n\nI would say the success of this album is due in part to all the members being involved in writing it, as well as giving great performances all around. Friedman performs a whole bunch of soulful solos, like on their famous ballad A Tout Le Monde. Ellefson is up front in the mix with a quite thick bass tone and delivers several fun fills. Menza lays down many cool and groovy drum beats, like the intro to Addicted to Chaos. Last but not least, Mustaine gives us his best vocal performance ever, as well as a plethora of moody guitar riffs.\n\nIf I must discuss a certain track, it's got to be the closer, Victory. This track is probably the worst one on here; it's lazy lyrically, consisting of callbacks to previous Megadeth songs, and its chorus is suspiciously similar to the one from The Killing Road. Personally, I think it would have been a wiser move to opt for Diadems as the last track instead of leaving it out and using it for the Demon Knight soundtrack. Think about it, the end of the world at the end of the album, wouldn't that be cool? Diadems also fits a lot better than Victory, with its sinister Reckoning Day-esque vibes and its Train of Consequences-esque breakdown. At the end of the day though, Victory isn't really so bad, it's just noticeably worse than everything else, except for maybe Blood of Heroes, though the only drawback to that track is that it's pretty unremarkable.\n\nYouthanasia is a great Megadeth record which is really only held back because it can get a little pedestrian at times. To put it in simple terms, there are no bad songs on here. By simplifying yet strengthening their sound, they accomplish a whole lot. Being made during the band's prime years didn't hurt it one bit either. While it's not the greatest album they ever put out, it's most certainly my favorite of their accessible releases, and possibly even my third or fourth favorite Megadeth album.\n",
        "\nAlright little history lesson folks, in 1994 Megadeth made an album called \"Youthanasia\". In order to promote this album, a few days before it was released Megadeth played a show at Webster Hall, New York City, and played mostly songs from Youth, with a few others sprinkled in. This show was broadcast on MTV and professionally recorded, this album here is the show in its entirety.\n\nNow to the review.\n\nThe show starts off with Holy Wars, which is my 2nd favorite song from the concert. The band plays tight as hell and believe it or not, for a period of time in the 90s, Dave Mustaine could actually sing, this song showcases that. Might I give a second to talk about Nick Menza's drumming? This might be my favorite snare sound of almost any album, it's so tight and pounding, gives an intense feeling to every song he plays them on.\n\nOne thing I enjoy about this show is that Mustaine interacts with the audience a bit, adding in his own asshole-ish quips (\"yeah I love me too\"), and the interesting line about how someone told him that \"In My Darkest Hour\" saved their life before they played the song. Whether that's true or not I can't verify and I take everything Dave says with a grain of salt, but it's interesting nonetheless.\n\nI personally really enjoy the extended Symphony Of Destruction they play. If I had to be honest I've heard that song so many times I could go without hearing it ever again, so when I do listen to it, this version is usually what I listen to. It's god-damn ear candy and I love it. \n\nOf course, I can't go without mentioning the video recording of this show. Hoooly crap I love it. Usually for me to enjoy a pro-shot concert recording it'd need multiple camera angles with shots of both the band and the audience. A lot of officially released \"pro-shot\" concert recordings look like the stuff you'd see on the screen at a stadium with like 3 cameras in total. This show does not feel like that at all, it's great. If you wanna see the pro-shot recording, you can watch it here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shbQhy9aRdc\n\nA fun fact about this show, this is one of the only 5 times they've ever played \"Victory\" live. Honestly, I like the performance here, even if I prefer the studio version. It's such a good ending song to both the Youthanasia album and this concert, it's a damn shame they haven't played it more live.\n\nDave's singing is surprisingly good here, even if he's obviously not a gifted singer. He has melody to his voice and I love his performance on \"A Tout Le Monde\" (even if that song, like Symphony, is overplayed)\n\nNow I think the album could have been a bit longer, I would've added \"Hangar 18\" and \"Wake Up Dead\" to the concert's setlist, they would've worked with Nick Menza's godlike drum sound and Dave's actually good live singing. Of course, I know this concert was performed mainly to promote Youthanasia, but still, 2 more songs would've been appreciated.\n\nOverall this concert is good, really good infact. Give this one a listen sometime, especially if you like Youthanasia like me.\n",
        "\nI love the cover of the old woman tending babies, it's very original and reinforces the title concept successfully. In Countdown to Extinction Mustaine was not a bad boy at all so he parked his thrashy sound towards more melodic, heavy tendencies. Youthanasia contains great material, powerful guitars -not reaching extreme sounds-, very good solos and perhaps more elaborate vocal lines than on the previous record. The well-combined quartet and the oiled machine instruments conceived this time twelve heavy cuts perfectly executed.\n\nThe roller coaster begins with \"Reckoning Day\" where Menza does a great role accompanied by a curious effect on Dave's vocals like he's responding in other notes to the previously sung verse. It's a vocal game repeated on most songs on here. \"Train of Consequences\" maintains the level in a catchy way, then the riffs break off in 1:57 followed by a classy solo; impossible to ignore Friedman's great guitar work and his exotic, particular style. Mr. Friedman is a great shred. The tremendous ballad \"A Tout Le Monde\" excites with its astonishing beauty while the fantastic, pleasant melodies of \"Elysian Fields\" open way the aforementioned vocal games, but it's really strange the harmonica solo that's more notable and present than the one heard up in Train of Consequences' ending.\n\nIn 1994 Mustaine left thrash in CTE without losing his grip and without ceasing breaking skulls with the present sound as always. He got involved in recording a more friendly album, a more professional one than the debut a decade ago, but with a consolidated lineup. Flaws are hard to find out on Youthanasia, however, this is one of the few 90s albums I like a lot. While other bands experimented with too extreme sounds in order to innovate, they actually didn't materialize fully though. Megadeth stayed on the good heavy metal path, stepping away from the lost decade his longtime rival Metallica had succumbed in.\n\nDespite being a slower disc until then, be careful to put your hand on it because you may lose a finger, this blade is still as sharp. Don't forget the fact a powerful song can take its place with fabulous 80s riffing where Dave does one of his great performances ever... what about solos, whose notes achieve such high, technical ones as these guys ever did, ending up a fast and wild road of the red-haired leader.\n\nInside the album we find many photos where they are playing air guitar, or air drum by Menza (RIP). Vic Rattlehead is picking up a baby on the back cover and causes a bad feeling; perhaps at 27 years old, maybe the child is still traumatized. Max Norman takes the production and recovers a devastating, clean sound assisted by Dave again. In the Japanese version there's a bonus track called Crown of Worms, a fast and direct one, quite good. It's a highly recommended masterpiece, a brilliant heavy metal exercise.\n",
        "\nThe moment you hear that opening riff in \u201cHoly Wars\u2026 The Punishment Due\u201d, you know exactly what you\u2019re in for. In short, Rust in Peace is a veritable assault of razor-sharp cyclonic riffing, soloing and just general shredding courtesy of the Dave Mustaine/Marty Friedman tag-team. A legendary tag-team that soar higher than a hippy commune with the kind of guitar acrobatics that are still unmatched to this day. \u201cHangar 18\u201d sees them trading blows with all kinds of insane soloing and leadwork, while \u201cRust in Peace\u2026 Polaris\u201d busts out the hard-hitting riffs amidst a bopping composition. Of course, there\u2019s the zero bullshit thrasher, \u201cTake No Prisoners\u201d that positively takes no shit with its mad thrashing riffs. \u201cTornado of Souls\u201d is more like a tornado of riffs while \u201cPoison was the Cure\u201d is nothing short of speed metal insanity \u2013 and then there\u2019s \u201cLucretia\u201d contrasting that finely with a crunchier, more mid-paced riffset that\u2019s just so goddamn catchy, it ought to be illegal. There\u2019s just so much going on with just the riffs alone, that it becomes positively captivating just seeing where this Cirque de Soleil act will go next.\n\nBut there is more to Rust in Peace than that. Part of it is old mate Nick Menza\u2019s percussion. There\u2019s obviously the thumping beginning of \u201cRust in Peace\u201d, but even just throughout the album, he adds so much kick and power to the songs through his overly peppy drumming. This serves to amplify the guitars excellently, giving that extra surge of power that they need to feel fully complete. Even then, he does know when to go for a more understated, almost sort of smooth jazzy approach during the album\u2019s quieter moments like the beginning of \u201cFive Magics\u201d and all of \u201cDawn Patrol\u201d. Another part is through Dave Ellefson\u2019s bass galloping throughout. That frenzied picking in \u201cTake No Prisoners\u201d, the more downtrodden riff at the beginning of \u201cFive Magics\u201d and that ominous riff expertly kicking off the insanity that is \u201cPoison was the Cure\u201d definitely spring to mind in terms of adding that extra bit of spice to the album.\n\nNot that any of that would matter, if not for the final thing \u2013 how it is all arranged. I mentioned \u201cLucretia\u201d having a crunchier and catchier riffset, and it\u2019s mainly through how they all come together to create this eminently memorable composition. But this applies across every song. Every single riff slots together ever so nicely to create a heavily melodic soundscape, creating these smooth grooves amidst highly technical riffing, all juxtaposed by a theatrical onslaught of solos. There\u2019s just a certain magic to Rust in Peace to where everything comes together ever so tightly. Going from the opening number\u2019s defiance of conventional time signatures, to the groovier thrash riff and dueling solo motif present in \u201cHangar 18\u201d, to the moodier soundscape of \u201cFive Magics\u201d, to the one-two punch of \u201cTake No Prisoners\u201d and \u201cPoison was the Cure\u201d, to the infectious riff machines that are \u201cTornado of Souls\u201d and \u201cRust in Peace\u201d. Hell, \u201cDawn Patrol\u201d \u2013 the fucking interlude song \u2013 is an absolute treat with Ellefson\u2019s bass leading into a smooth bridge between \u201cTornado of Souls\u201d and \u201cRust in Peace\u201d! One could maybe argue that \u201cFive Magics\u201d and \u201cPoison was the Cure\u201d both take like ten years to get started, but the former retains a darker mood in its more down-tempo riffing and the latter\u2019s simply easing you into the speed metal mayhem.\n\nThis is still thrash metal at its core \u2013 amidst the showmanship and overall techniques at display, there\u2019s still that marriage of hardcore punk and the NWOBHM in the average riffs being played and how the songs are put together at the basic level. But by 1990, straight up thrash metal felt played out and everybody wanted to play music that was either heavier or more technical \u2013 and then there\u2019s the matter of And Justice for All a couple of years prior just showing how high this formula could soar with a bigger, more progressive composition. Megadeth took this to mean that they should double down on what worked on Peace Sells and do And Justice for All in their own way, which has resulted in Rust in Peace being in the higher echelon of metal albums ever made. Many bands have tried to take its crown, but Rust in Peace still reigns supreme.\n",
        "\nI usually try to avoid reviewing full-lengths that have been reviewed by a lot of other people but at the risk of adding to the cacophony, I present my review of Megadeth\u2019s 1988 outing \u201cSo Far So Good\u2026So What!\u201d \u201cSo Far So Good\u2026So What!\u201d was my first contact wth Megadeth at the age of 14 in the late 80s and the cover art (Vic Rattlehead\u2026on the Moon (?) dressed like a bounty hunter from \u201cStar Wars\u201d?) as well as the song titles immediately intrigued me and so not soon after, I was listening to the tape (because it was a tape) in my Walkman. It was my first foray into thrash metal, which eventually led me to liking heavier and heavier forms of music. I never really bought that Megadeth could be considered one of the \u201cBig Four of Thrash\u201d (arguably Exodus or Overkill could\u2019ve claimed the title more rightfully). To me, they were what they claimed they were: \u201cThe World\u2019s State of the Art Speed Metal Band\u201d but more often than not, they were a band that occasionally thrashed out but largely played skilled and technically proficient metal with a capital \u201cM\u201d. But I\u2019m not here to ruminate on the nature of Megadeth\u2019s branding\u2026I\u2019m here to do a review of their third full-length.\n\n\u201cSo Far So Good\u2026So What!\u201d presents a Megadeth that is in a transitional phase in a number of ways. It is the \u201cmiddle child\u201d, so to speak, sandwiched firmly in between the debut and it\u2019s classic follow-up, and their magnum opus \u201cRust In Peace\u201d, bookended of course by their 1992 commercial breakthrough \u201cCountdown to Extinction\u201d. It is also the only album to feature the one-time Megadeth line-up of guitar teacher Jeff Young and and former drum tech Chuck Behler on lead guitars and drums, respectively. The production is also somewhere between the the rawness of the first 2 full-lengths and the deliberate but measured gloss of \u201cRust In Peace\u201d and \u201cCountdown\u2026\u201d But most importantly, there are quite a few sonic motifs that only appear on this album and never surface again anywhere on subsequent Megadeth albums. So with this makeshift suicide squad of teachers and techs joined by stalwarts Dave Mustaine and Dave \u201cJunior\u201d Ellefson, Megadeth set out on a mission to create Megadeth\u2019s 3rd album in the aftermath of the load-blowing that was the year 1986 in thrash metal. So how is the actual Megadeth material on this album? Overall I can honestly describe in one word: strong.\n\n\u201cSo Far So Good\u2026So What!\u201d opens with the opening one two punch of \u201cInto the Lungs of Hell\u201d and \u201cSet the World Afire\u201d and they both acquit themselves beautifully as prime Megadeth. \u201cInto the Lungs of Hell\u201d features some curious horns (refer to elements used once) and \u201cSet the World Afire\u201d has some recognizably Megadeth sweep picking in addition to a layered, growling hook. So far, so good\u2026then there comes the \u201cso what\u201d: a cover of the Sex Pistols \u201cAnarchy in the U.K.\u201d I have a tendency to deduct points from a full-length if it has covers anyway, but the sheer obviousness of this particular cover only compounds matters further. I feel that covers are better as B-sides or standalone singles. Better covers were forthcoming from Megadeth not long after this (\u201cNo More Mr. Nice Guy\u201d) until the album-marring Fear cover on \u201cDystopia\u201d, but that\u2019s a whole \u2019nother review. If they needed to pad out the album a little\u2026another instrumental would\u2019ve been more welcome, honestly (but maybe not as the 3rd track on the album).\n\n\u201cMary Jane\u201d, with its convoluted opening moments and the inexplicable, sampled middle part of \u201c502\u201d are good examples of elements that only show up once and never again on a Megadeth album, demonstrating a little bit of experimentation on Megadeth\u2019s part, which is not at all unwelcome. This leads into the \u201cDecline of Western Civilization II\u201d-featured jam \u201cIn My Darkest Hour\u201d. It\u2019s been described as a ballad, but if this is a ballad, then so is \u201cDiadems\u201d. It\u2019s more of a mid-tempo jam with an emotive opening and classic Megadeth ascending chords. \n\n\u201cSo Far So Good\u2026So What!\u201d ends with diss track \u201cLiar\u201d, directed at gear-selling ex-guitarist Chris Poland and the PMRC-inspired \u201cHook In My Mouth\u201d and that\u2019s all they wrote. The two tracks aren\u2019t particularly good or bad, simply there to finish up the album and little else. Considering it was 1988 and everything they do is predicated on what Metallica does, Megadeth could\u2019ve put out a pointless, sprawling, \u201cprogressive\u201d album with bad production like Metallica\u2019s \u201c\u2026And Justice For All\u201d of the same year, but thankfully, they didn\u2019t. It is an economical album that serves as a placeholder between \u201cPeace Sells\u2026\u201d and one of the best metal albums of all time, \u201cRust in Peace\u201d. It shows a way to move forward sonically in the thrash metal scene with a combination of relentless innovation and introspective mid-tempo jams. Is it a masterpiece? Not necessarily. It is also overshadowed by releases of the same year by Crumbsuckers, Sepultura and a late-to-the party-but-thrashing hard debut by Sadus. In a lot of ways, though this is a good album, but with a little editing, \u201cSo Far So Good So What!\u201d could\u2019ve been an awesome EP in the vein of Kreators \u201cOut of the Dark\u2026\u201d The actual material is great, but the organization of the album leaves a little to be desired. However, it does inch Megadeth out of the thrash ghetto a little bit and is a foreshadowing of greater things to come. \u201cSo Far So good So What!\u201d might seem like a mere placeholder to Megadeth\u2026but even Megadeth\u2019s placeholders are better than most bands magnum opuses.\n",
        "\nAfter almost a decade of releases that stretched from being subpar to straight up embarrassing, Megadeth finally came back with a vengeance with their 2007 release United Abominations. The songs were memorable, the thrash elements were back will full force and there seemed to be a level of consistency and confidence that hadn\u2019t been in the band since the mid 90s. But as we all know, a great comeback album isn\u2019t a guarantee for continued success. There are a lot of bands who have made a great comeback album but never been able to recapture that magic on future releases. One thing is for sure though: Megadeth is not one of those bands. In fact, they weren\u2019t only able to match United Abominations with their next release, 2009s Endgame. They were also able to outshine it. \n\nEndgame takes all the elements that worked on United Abominations and improves them. If United Abominations can be described as Countdown To Extinction 2.0, Endgame can more or less be described as Rust In Peace 2.0. This is a fast, heavy, rampaging thrash metal album that leaves NOTHING to chance. It didn\u2019t took me more than 3 minutes to realize that this album had potential. The opening track \u201dDialectic Chaos\u201d has enough incredible lead work to make a normal band turn volts, yet Megadeth manage to squeeze all those incredible solos into a 2 minute-long instrumental. It was the second track on the album, \u201dThis Day We Fight\u201d, that made me truly pay attention though. The riffs\u2026 The drumming\u2026 The vocals\u2026 The lyrics\u2026 Holy shit! This is a pissed off Dave Mustaine. And as we all know, a pissed off Dave Mustaine often leads to great Megadeth music. \n\nI wasn\u2019t completely convinced yet though. The System Has Failed started of incredible as well but as that album went on it turned into a disjointed, corporative turd. Luckily that\u2019s not the case with Endgame. \u201d44 minutes\u201d\u2026 Great! \u201d1320\u201d\u2026 Great!... \u201dBite The Hand\u201d\u2026 Great! Song after song manages to not only hold my attention but also to genuinely impress me. The most impressive thing is that the album only gets better with each song. 3 of my 4 favorite tracks all appears on the second half of the album. The songs in question are the title track, \u201dHeadcrusher\u201d and \u201dHow The Story Ends\u201d. The title track is basically a progressive thrash metal song and is built around this wonderful Iron Maiden-ish galloping riff but in a more thrashy manner. \u201dHeadcrusher\u201d is just a barnstormer that easily could have fitted on some of the bands finest works like Peace Sells But Who\u2019s Buying? or Rust In Peace. Probably the fastest and heaviest song on the album together with \u201dThis Day We Fight\u201d. \u201dHow The Story Ends\u201d is just a fun, heavy metal anthem with some wonderful riffs and an absolute sledgehammer chorus. Even the ballad on the album, \u201dThe Hardest Part Of Letting Go\u201d manages to hold my attention and creates a soulful, saddened atmosphere. If that song would have appeared on The World Needs A Hero or Risk I would have thrown it in the trash can without any hesitation. But on Endgame it works as a nice protruder on an otherwise fast, heavy, slaughtering thrash metal album. \n\nThe main reason why this is such an enjoyable album is because Megadeth is finally playing thrash metal again. Gone are the whiny vocals, gone are the alternative tendencies, gone are the disjointed arrangements. Instead it\u2019s Megadeth playing the style of music that they are associated with, the style of music that turned them into one of the most beloved heavy metal bands ever. It\u2019s the style of music we want Megadeth to play, and it\u2019s such a relief to hear that after a decade of disjointed, lackluster releases. If United Abominations started the comeback, Endgame certainly completed the comeback and cemented Megadeth as a force to be counted with for many years to come. \n\nI also have to give a huge amount of praise to the musicianship. What really makes this album such a delicious feast is the impeccable guitar work by guitarists Dave Mustaine and Chris Broderick. The riffs sounds fresh and sharp and the lead work is absolutely remarkable. It almost feels like these guitar parts were written during the Rust In Peace years, were locked in a vault and then brought back to the world when this album was written. That\u2019s how good these riffs and leads are!\n\nAll I can say is WOW! The fact that this album was written over 20 years into their career shows that Megadeth are the real deal and that when they pull things together and are focusing on the right things, they can bring some truly special music to the world. In my opinion, this is not only one of the best Megadeth albums but also one of the best albums of the 00s overall. What an incredible achievement!\n",
        "\nAfter going through a rough existential crisis in the early part of the 00s, Megadeth finally decided to pull things together again. In 2004 they released The System Has Failed, which was originally intended to be a Dave Mustaine solo album but was released as a Megadeth album in order to increase the sales. Many people consider that album to be the true comeback album of Megadeth. For my money, that\u2019s not the case since that album still suffered from the disjointed and unstructured approach that plagued their albums in the late 90s and early 00s. Despite that, there were a couple of songs on The System Has Failed that were absolutely spectacular, songs that showed that Dave Mustaine could still write some fast-paced, brutal thrash metal anthems if he wanted to. Luckily, mr. Mustaine realized that and decided to build on that momentum for the band's next release, United Abominations from 2007.\n\nIn my opimion, United Abominations is the true comeback album by Megadeth and not The System Has Failed. With United Abominations, Megadeth decided to go back to the recipe that made them a name in the metal community in the late 80s and early 90s. The fast riffing, the incredible melodic leads, the technical drumming and the nihilistic lyrics of Dave Mustaine\u2026. Everything that made Megadeth such an awesome band in their early days is finally coming back with full force on United Abominations. Already on the opening track, \u201dSleepwalker\u201d, you can tell that the band means serious business with this album. The riffs are ripping, the singing is phenomenal and the pace is fast. Already there momentum is built, and with the next song, \u201dWashington Is Next\u201d, they manage to not only keep that momentum but also to build on it. These 2 songs are probably my favorites of the album and true gems in the Megadeth canon.\n\nWhat makes United Abominations such a fun listen is that it\u2019s not always about speed and thrash metal mayhem. The approach on this album can more or less be described as a return to the style of music that the band played on Countdown To Extinction, where thrashy tendencies were combined with more traditional heavy metal anthems, and to me that\u2019s a positive thing since Countdown are among my favorite Megadeth albums. Comparing to the alternative, commercialized approach that the band was stupid enough to take with albums like Cryptic Writings and Risk, this is accessible Megadeth done right. Memorable, fairly simple songs in a traditional manner without influences from popular trends and commercial tendencies. \u201dNever Walk Alone\u201d and \u201dBlessed Be The Dead\u201d are perfect examples of this formula. Easy on the ears but still heavy and written in a traditional Megadeth style. Same can be said about the title track which I could have seen appearing on Countdown To Extinction.\n\nThe only downfall is that the album loses a little steam in the middle. \u201dPlay For Blood\u201d is easily my least favorite song on the album. To be fair I struggle to recall how it even sounds. The remake of \u201dA Tout Le Monde\u201d from Youthanasia is also a waste of space. Even though it features some nice female vocals by Lacuna Coil's vocalist Cristina Scabbia, there was literally no reason to remake that song, even more put it on an otherwise great album. It would have fitted much better as a B-side or as a separate single. Luckily, the album redeems itself with it\u2019s last 2 tracks. \u201dYou\u2019re Dead\u201d is a ripping, crushing heavy metal anthem with a chorus to die for and \u201dBurnt Ice\u201d, despite being a bit all over the place vocal-wise, contains some of the bands best melodic leads of all time. A very good way to end the album indeed.\n\nAs a whole, I consider this to be the true comeback album by Megadeth. They went back to the formula that worked so well with Countdown To Extinction and managed to put out their first truly great album since Youthanasia. The thrash metal elements are back, even if they don\u2019t take the front, and the traditional accessibility that made Countdown To Extinction such a great album is once again flourishing. While not as good as Countdown To Extinction, it\u2019s still a very enjoyable release that also marked the beginning of the bands revival, a revival that still continues to this day.\n",
        "\nNumerous thrash metal bands went through significant chages in the late nineties and early years of the millennium. That was also the case for veterans Megadeth who released experimental rock album Risk as well as melodic and radio-friendly The World Needs a Hero that were criticized by experts and fans alike and ultimately led to a hiatus. It was around that time that the band played an acoustic set at a radio station in Boston in front of an intimate crowd. The release was made available to fan club members fifteen years ago but has now been officially released for its twentieth birthday.\n\nOn the positive side, the band's technical skills are astonishing and work perfectly acoustically. Especially the dynamic guitar play by band leader Dave Mustaine and the talented Al Pitrelli stands out. The playful solo sections combining melody and speed in ''Dread and the Fugitive Mind'' and ''Almost Honest'' can be cited as highlights. The calmer tunes such as ''Time: The Beginning'' and especially ''Promises'' ooze with atmosphere and work even better than their regular studio versions.\n\nOn the negative side, Dave Mustaine's vocals aren't particularly variable which is more obvious in the context of an intimate acoustic concert than during a vivid thrash metal show. A more melodic and soothing approach would especially have fit the ballads better. While David Ellefson on bass guitar and Jimmy DeGrasso on drums do a great job, the acoustic renditions certainly focus on guitar play and underuse the rhythmic instruments. The production in a little bit rough around the edges as one can hear static during the announcements. Speaking of announcements, Dave Mustaine's rant against a fan who annoyed him is completely uncalled for and should have been cut out. The speech by one of the radio station employees in time for the last song also overstays its welcome. One could also note that the album only features ten songs and has a rather short running time of forty minutes, including an abridged version of ''Holy Wars... The Punishment Due'' that is rather disappointing.\n\nAt the end of the day, Megadeth's Unplugged in Boston sounds interesting on paper but is only of average quality at the end of the day. The guitar play is outstanding and the setlist features some intriguing rarities but the rhythm section and production are slightly underwhelming. This release is interesting for avid collectors and fans but occasional listeners can skip this record without any regrets.\n",
        "\nThis one doesn't pack the same punch as their previous 3-4 albums. It's more heavy metal based rather than thrash metal and the riffs aren't as catchy as 'Countdown To Extinction' but they're still good! It's just not so fantastic as the previous they seemed to get more seller out than anything else. But let's enjoy the Marty Friedman era of Megadeth. The riffs could've been better but still they're decent. The leads are alright, too! Dave seems to be a little bit whinier as well. I don't think anything could surpassed Dave on their previous. Or even on 'Rust In Peace' and 'Peace Sells...But Who's Buying?'.\n\nIt's definitely milder than previous Megadeth releases. But that doesn't take away from the great guitar riffs and succinct leads by Dave and Marty. They both kick ass and it's to be this era of Megadeth to be the better. I'm not as familiar as the more modern playing of this band, I just know that I like the first two almost decades of the bands. Dave is always seeming to be in Metallica's shadow, or at least jealous of their success over Megadeth's. He definitely wanted a band that was heavier than Metallica but of course we know that Metallica took precedence over Megadeth unfortunately. Maybe James's rhythms are catchier than Dave's could be it why their favored?\n\nThe sound quality was definitely good, just like 'Countdown To Extinction' about the same. Just the music isn't as catchy as that album. But I still think it's worth a \"B\" rating, definitely. Some songs were really catchy and noteworthy. It's a step down from 'Countdown...' but Dave shows that they still have it going strong. I always liked his songwriting. Even in Metallica some of his riffs like in \"Jump In The Fire\" and \"Phantom Lord\" were some wicked riffs on those tracks. And on 'Peace Sells...' he came up with some amazingly catchy licks that are some of the best in the history of Megadeth (in my opinion).\n\nFor Megadeth fans, this isn't a disappointment. This is showing a somewhat milder more heavy metal type of gig than thrash metal. But they're still catchy with the songwriting and worth checking out if you haven't already. This is a way old album, but as you can see I'm just getting around to writing about it. It's how far gone I am in Megadeth's discography. But this is because I only recently decided to give the band a fair shake which I've done. And I've found them to be among the greats. Look upon this as a victory for the band, not so much of a failure that Dave may think. Get it on CD or stream it or both!\n",
        "\nOne of my favorite Megadeth releases so far. I like it even more than 'Rust In Peace'. It just has this heavy/thrash metal type of style to it with way catchy riffs and ultra-Dave vocals. It seems that this is a more mature Megadeth than 'Peace Sells...But Who's Buying?' and 'Rust In Peace'. The music is just better on here the songs catchier and the lyrical concepts are dealing with all sorts of things like mental illness (\"Sweating Bullets\") and politics/self awareness (\"Foreclosure of a Dream\"), etc. Dave is at the height of his maturity here between the songwriting, the strong lineup with Marty Friedman and Nick Menza RIP (we'll leave out Ellefson). \n\nI'd have to say that this is more heavy metal than thrash just a mix and the leads are definitely at the pinnacle of their career in music/influential metal. \"Skin 'O My Teeth\" probably my favorite track on the record. And I'd have to say that Megadeth I have way much more respect than I ever used to since I know a little more about Dave coming from Dave in an interview. The fact though that he got kicked out of Metallica actually to form Megadeth to prove that he was going to be successful despite that. I think for a long while he felt inferior/a failure from that happening to him. Maybe it was better that he started his own band to be the frontman and show the world he wasn't going to go away quietly.\n\nBetter production than their previous. And less sloppy guitar playing, very good riffs, too! He put together one helluv a mixture of music that's strong the whole way through. With Marty, I think the band was able to diversify in the sense that Dave had him to work with on riffs probably the best lineup. It's sad about Nick because I think he was great with Megadeth I couldn't possibly see him die so young! Ellefson had the longest time with the band but as of recently did some of the unspeakable with the band so he's been fired by Dave and it's just too bad. I had the utmost respect for him too!\n\nI had to hear the Spotify streaming of this album first since I was a heavy Megadeth critic like I said as of recently and decided to buy the CD. They don't really need my money but I just thought I'd support music as I collect CD's. A family member said just stream it and I couldn't just do that I had to have my famous physical copy of the album. I think the sound quality is better anyway on stereo but not everyone thinks like me. To the countless Megadeth fans all over the world, just buy it because you're going to have (IMO) a better opinion of the release then what you'll get digitally. Show Dave the support and almost 30 years since this has been released! Get it!\n",
        "\nIt's important to lay out one fundamental aspect about Megadeth in general here. One could consider it at least surprising, if not fascinating by extension in and of itself, how people who identify as \"metalheads\" would swear by something that is fundamentally, at its core, not all that metal. Metal is dark. In some shape or form, the darkness is always there whether it is thrash, doom, or more obviously in the case of death or black and industrial. Enormous stomps for beats, speedy aggression and machine gun drum kicks when it isn't all out frantic blast beating as a motor, powerful lead vocals, twisted riffs that tear your mind momentarily. That's metal. Or at least what is typically associated with it. We all know this. That's what anyone from outside the metal world, looking in, would hear. \n\nLet's be clear on this: Megadeth is blues metal. With a capital 'B' for Blues and a lowercase 'm' for metal. Simply because the blues is the dominant component in every album's equation. There are other things there than blues, but the blues is what transpires the most out of the guitar riffs, vocal lines, writing patterns and songs at large. Now again: why people who identify as metalheads swear by a band like Megadeth, may not make all the sense in the world to some. 'Blues metal' could also be used to describe Pantera's music, but is there really any doubt whether it is the metal that's the dominant part in Pantera, when down-tuned guitars, earth-shaking breakdowns and Anselmo's hyper-virility on vocals dominate every track. The case of Megadeth can seem quite peculiar in that sense, in a genre that is so quick to ostracize a band with too many non-metal influences and that glorifies heaviness and the common idea of the underground triumphing over the mainstream. Megadeth have mischievousness, but not heaviness, and certainly feel more diurnal than nocturnal.\n\nTake the first song on this album here: the verse is a textbook bluesy rock n roll lick with Mustaine's classic blues line sung on top, and the chorus at its core sounds like something that could've appeared on a Michael Jackson record. Not that Michael Jackson didn't have some fantastic tracks at the time, and not that this chorus was badly written. It's rather catchy. But go on and listen to it and picture MJ's voice replacing Mustaine's here. The drums, even the guitars don't sound heavy and could likely be kept as they are. \n\nFor the album as a whole, some tracks will tend to be more of a caricature than others. 'Symphony of Destruction' immediately comes to mind: Mustaine's tough guy voice over the most cliche angry power-chord progression in metal, until the hook arrives and it's more poppy blues rock. None of it is lazy writing as much as it may just come across as very cheesy. Other tracks bring a bit more meat and substance to the party with thicker riffing and an upped technicality pervading the songs. Whilst not forgetting, however, about the trusty old textbook rock n roll riff, making an appearance again and again every time it feels like a song might be more explorative. \n\n\"Foreclosure of a Dream\" introduces acoustic folk guitars to the album, of course another major clich\u00e9 at the time in the early 90's as it seemed mandatory that all bands from the thrash scene had at least one track with that southern theme. Mustaine writes the part for the acoustic with his favorite 3-straight chromatic note bass change, which at no point in their discography feels redundant at all. \nLater, \"This Was My Life\" is the most stereotypical Megadeth song you'll find: naughty palm muted chugs and then a riff based on that chromatic 4 straight notes ascending; basically an alternative writing of the \"Hangar 18\" lick; and then the \"This. Was. My. Life\" moment with even more of Mustaine's intimidating tough guy voice. \n\nMustaine sometimes flat out comes across as a children's cartoon voice actor (\"Symphony\", \"Sweating Bullets\"...), and the areas between comedy and seriousness become blurry. The worrying part is it doesn't feel like there's a whole lot of a sense of humor going on there, and Mustaine is known to take his music very seriously and to be a grouchy perfectionist, but who knows what was being attempted at the time. His higher pitched moments are outright whimsical. He was clearly just not prepared at that point technically to hit the high notes smoothly enough for a studio album performance. His highs nearly sound like he's choking on a very small portion of food at the back of his throat. Just odd stuff.\n\nTo be fair, the album has that early 90's metal charm and the production was pretty gorgeous on this. It was a time when major metal albums sounded very organic but benefited from the producers' expertise who now had experience with the genre and could make an album polished where every instrument was intelligible, yet not sound overproduced (as later on). Which is what I think many fans of this album and the band more broadly appreciate: the sheer sound of an album like \"Countdown to extinction\". The chorus to the title-track for instance sounds just silky. And just about every song is going to have stronger moments, and there is a definite song-writing prowess at work, but the problem is that any time that song seems to be gaining in credibility it straight away returns to cheesiness and Dave Mustaine dressed up in a latex batman suit. Hey, we all have different pictures in our minds when the music plays.\n\nJust the fact Megadeth made it so big, is something to ponder about in itself. It's the equivalent of me right now promoting my music as being salsa, and my music contains elements of salsa, but there's an overwhelming techno element that is evident in every single song. And yet people love this stuff. Perhaps they weren't as big fans of salsa as they originally believed.\n\nWhat's even more interesting is despite Megadeth's influential essence in the genre, it wasn't even the predominant blues element that was influential. Bands picked the rare non-blues elements from Megadeth. It's not like 90's and 2000's metal was a bunch of blues metal Megadeth ripoff. In fact metal during those times got progressively heavier and darker, not following Mustaine and co's trend at all. Heck, even grunge that was played on the radio was darker and arguably heavier than Megadeth music.\n",
        "\nProbably my favorite Megadeth release to date. It's just melodic as all hell! That's what drove me to like this album! Dave sounds great, too! Especially on \"Holy Wars...\" and \"Hanger 18.\" Megadeth has been such a huge influence in the metal community since they came about after Megadeth's great Dave Mustaine was fired from Metallica. They've been more consistent than that legendary band staying within the thrash/heavy metal roots. They never sold out, they always came back to write more great music but on 'Rust In Peace', the riffs were top notch, ABSOLUTELY!\n\nBoth Dave and Marty rip on the lead department! And the riffs are God-like. \"Holy Wars...\" probably my favorite song from the entire album. It's just so original and fresh.  The intro to \"Hanger 18\" is killer too. But the whole album displays areas of amazing creativity by Dave mostly. I can't believe that Dave considers himself as a \"failure\" because of getting fired from Metallica. He's way better than he gives himself credit for especially for albums such as this and 'Peace Sells...But Who's Buying?' Amongst the countless other classics that Megadeth has contributed to the metal community!\n\nThe production was decent though it could've been a little better. But still, the album is ingenious! They deserve all the press that they get for this one and many others. Megedeth always came up with fresh riffs and on this one you'll hear what I'm talking about. These guys rip it up Nick and Dave Ellefson sounded great as well. Nick's passing at 51 was just way too young! And Dave now is out of the band permanently. What a waste. But his time with Megadeth was grand. New material is going to be out now too, but to reflect on this, Megadeth was at their primordial best and most creative. Other bands have duplicated riffs from them.\n\nI had the cassette of this that's how old it is! But it's still a countless classic! They stayed great in the 80's and 90's but I kind of took a break from them in the later 90's and more recent albums. I kind of lost interest and wanted to focus only on the classics. Definitely a band that will never be able to duplicate. Only emulate. A lot of bands cover Megadeth songs and for a good reason: they AWESOME! I'm sure newbies to the metal scene need to get introduced to this album and other Megadeth albums that I mentioned. They're priceless! 'Rust In Peace' will go down as my favorite release of theirs ever!\n",
        "\nThe name: Megadeth. Iconic pun-oriented satirical album titles like 'Peace Sells... but Who's Buying?', 'So Far, So Good... So What!' or 'Rust in Peace'. A lineup including lead guitar virtuoso Marty Friedman. Technically proficient thrash metal music that prides itself on being true and authentic, not pandering to the mainstream and vociferously against the conforming system. The perfect metal formula, right ?\n\nFirst and foremost, 'Rust in Peace' is an instrumental-centered piece (although not quite a piece of rust), demonstrating stellar musicianship with its wild 16th note shredded riffs, progressive structured fret work like blues instrumentalists on steroids, dynamic chord changes with occasional detailed open string picking, oddly angled rhythm patterns and unorthodox lead developments exploring various scales, wide theatrical solo sections, amidst the more characteristic jack-knife quick thrashy riff assaults and roaring power chord stomps.\n\n'Holy Wars' or 'Hangar 18' are among the most recognizable old school thrash anthems, with the first's now legendary mid-section of power chords blended with the resonating open string plucks, and the latter showcasing Mustaine's trademark 4-chord chromatic progression in all its glory. The tracks exhibit a wealth of moods and musical colors (at least early on the record) ranging from the more obvious pentatonic blues impishness to rarer ambiances for the style, with a bit of occasional grief, euphoric energy ('Lucretia') and darker tainted moments ('Five Magics').\n\nWhile the album is certainly impressive from a pure musicianship standpoint and with its rather adventurous undertaking; with certain tracks being instantly recognizable and unique; a hefty chunk of this does end up sounding like straightforward blues metal with Mustaine's plaintive high-pitched whines on top. His spoken voice \"performance\" on 'Dawn Patrol' and attempt at a pompous English accent doesn't exactly help, his meaner lows on 'Holy Wars' (\"No more mistakes !\") rather difficult to take seriously, dropping the section's credibility some. Is the \"punishment due\" having to sit through Mustaine's botched singing for 40min ? I guess so. A trying task, to be sure. An unquestionable prerequisite to enjoy this album is having an unconditional love for the sound of constant blues metal; not even so much thrash as full fledged, outright blues metal; and having an unbending tolerance for wailing hardly-believable vocals that border on full cheesiness quite frankly.\n\nFor the outsider who doesn't swear by this band, the album is really interesting only so long as it manages to step outside its strongly blues-tinted thrash comfort zone, which it is able to do on about 3 tracks in parts, give or take. The rest of the way, it's really just Mustaine's angry middle-class lectures about injustices in the world and overly high-strung distortion blues, and Friedman's leads and the overall impressive fret work don't give the album any more depth or meaning ultimately. Great metal means the music has to feel deep on some level, emotionally powerful and climactic. Even Metallica's 'Black Album', blamed for its superficiality, had a track like the immersive 'The Unforgiven'. Except for a few select moments, this album here generally comes across as casual in feel and too often lacks the epic edge of great metal albums, thrash or otherwise.\n",
        "\nThe way this album has gone down in popular memory when it comes to Megadeth's other classic releases has always been curious to me. It's probably the least highly regarded album of this era, and though Jeff Young is a great guitarist, he was only on this album and was followed up by Marty Friedman, who is so legendary that he totally eclipses Young. The end result is that you have an album that most Megadeth fans enjoy, but don't consider to be particularly remarkable. The original production on this album certainly helped cement this in, since it is neither polished like Rust In Peace or Countdown, but nor was it raw like like their debut album. It was just messy and incoherent. Fortunately this album is a rare case where a remaster genuinely improved it, and I think it showed So Far, So Good...So What? to be a truly stupendous album that marks many significant improvements and developments in Megadeth as a band.\n\nSFSGSW starts off with the instrumental track featuring the sort of guitarwork that Megadeth is legendary for. Shredding solos and lightning fast solos treat your ears to a sample of what is to come throughout the album. The riffs feel a touch less wild and chaotic than they were on Peace Sells and Killing Is My Business, but not to their detriment. It's simply a more controlled form of heavy guitar playing, and it shows that Mustaine was perhaps getting more methodical in how he wrote songs. Songs like Liar and Set The World Afire give the listener plenty of reason to simultaneously rattle their head and wonder in awe at Young's and Mustaine's intricate soloing. I could go on, but if you know thrash metal, then you know what Megadeth guitar riffs and solos sound like. There is plenty to be found here, and in excellent quality.\n\nThe most significant development on this album is that you can hear Dave Mustaine getting a better grasp on how to use his voice. Few would accuse him of being a great singer, but his high pitched snarl has been used to great effect on many songs. On Megadeth's first two albums though, Mustaine's voice could be pretty hit or miss. Sometimes he could convey great amounts of energy (Rattlehead, Peace Sells, My Last Words), but sometimes his voice was just grating and amateurish (Wake Up Dead). On SFSGSW we get a far better and far more consistent vocal performance, with Mustaine even exploring new ground with his emotional performance on In My Darkest Hour, something that he hadn't really tried up until then. Liar has Mustaine going full force, firing off angry accusations at his former guitarist, whereas Hook In Mouth shows him pulling off a more moderate yet bombastic vocal style. I feel that this album truly doesn't get enough credit for how much Mustaine's singing improves on it, though it is not yet up to the level of quality that he would bring on Rust in Peace and Countdown to Extinction. That said, there are still a few moments where he misses the mark, like the very ending of Hook in Mouth where he gives a sort of half sung-half spoken vocal delivery, and it robs a truly great song of its momentum right as the album is coming to an end, which is a shame.\n\nAnarchy in the UK features here as a cover, and it's...well it's definitely the low point of the album. Mustaine seems to have had odd ideas when it came to putting covers of other artists, and nowhere did it fail to succeed more than here. Previously Megadeth had covered These Boots and I Ain't Superstitious, two songs decidedly far from thrash metal. Though they're mostly unnecessary on their respective albums, they're at least fun and unique takes on those songs. Yet now when Megadeth covers a punk rock classic, something far closer to their own style, it mostly falls flat. Aside from having a different singer, it does almost nothing different or interesting with the original. I do find myself enjoying it simply because I like Anarchy in the UK, but I can't honestly describe it as a good cover.\n\nSFSGSW does not perhaps have the same high peaks that are found on other albums from Megadeth's classic album, but with the exception of Anarchy in the UK it is remarkably consistent. Rarely do I listen to it and feel like I need to skip a track. I still prefer Rust In Peace for how it perfects Megadeth's style of thrash, and Killing is My Business for is sheer raw ferocity, but this is still an excellent serving of thrash metal that any fan should enjoy.\n",
        "\nI have gone through a period of listening to albums by notable bands that are considered to be \"stinkers\". While some of them wasn't as bad as people say, others have definitely proven to be as bad as people say. I have gone through Load and ReLoad by Metallica. I have gone through St. Anger by Metallica. I have gone through Demolition by Judas Priest. And as bad as all these albums are, they still manage to look like solid efforts compared to the rock bottom abomintation released by Megadeth in 1999: Risk.\n\nThe older I get, the more I start to really appreciate the machine that is Megadeth. Rust In Peace has become one of my all time favorites and they have more strong albums as well: Peace Sells, Countdown To Extinction, Endgame, 13 (many hate that one but I think it's great), Dystopia... I think it's safe to say that Megadeth have managed to be rock solid throughout their entire career and haven't released any true stinkers. Well... That's what I thought for a long time. Then I heard Risk and I had to reevaluate things. \n\nFirst we have to clear things out: This album was released in 1999. Heavy metal was down the tubes and miles away from the popularity it once had. Instead the rock scene was mostly dominated by n\u00fc metal and alternative rock genres. Therefore it's not a surprise that many metal bands decided to change their sounds and adapt to the musical climate surrounding them. Metallica did it... and so did Megadeth. The problem is that these bands entered completely new territory and started to write music that was miles away from the music they once wrote. Why is that a problem you may think? Because these guys simply doesn't know how to write that type of music. Bands like Megadeth, Metallica and Slayer know how to write heavy, fast and brutal metal anthems. Thus they shall write and play that type of music. They aren't supposed to play alternative rock because they don't know how to write alternative rock songs. \n\nRisk symbolizes this problem more than any other \"experimental\" album relased by a notable metal band in that era. Risk is basically an alternative rock album. The fast, heavy riffs and the outstanding lead guitar work that made Megadeth's earlier (and later) albums so great and memorable are nowhere to be found on here. One can argue that they started to incorporate this type of music already on this album's \nprecursor Cryptic Writings and that is true. But while Cryptic Writings at least has a handful of songs that suits the classic Megadeth formula and can be considered thrash metal/heavy metal, Risk has none. This wouldn't have been a problem if Dave Mustaine knew how to write alternative rock songs. But the fact is: He doesn't. Period. \n\nAll songs on Risk are either unmemorable or annoying and most of them are plagued by abysmal songwriting. Already on the first track, \"Insomnia\", you know something is wrong. That ear-cutting chrous drills into your brain and becomes a nightmare that wakes you up at night. Same can be said about the cheesy ballads by the name of \"I'll Be There For You\" and \"Breadline\". \"Crush Em\" is basically a fist pump song more suited for street fighting than for a Megadeth album, led by a disco-ish bassline that reminds me a lot of \"I Was Made For Lovin You\" by Kiss (which in itself isn't a good thing). The rock bottom is then hit with songs like \"The Doctor Is Calling\" and the \"Time\" suite that finishes the album. I can't recall anything from those songs more than the fact that I thought they were awful and never wanted to listen to them again.\n\nWhen I listen to albums that I consider to be absolutely terrible i often challenge myself to find segments in the songs that I think could have suited on a good album by the particular band. So the question remains: Are there any redeeming qualities about this album? Is there anything on RIsk that could have suited on a good Megadeth album? I'm not sure. The only song that I consider to be somewhat memorable is the second track \"Prince Of Darkness\". That feels like a song that, in an alternative universe and under very critical circumstances, could be considered to be a heavy metal song. I also find the chorus to \"Wonderlust\" to be catchy and somewhat enjoyable so I can't be too harsh on that one either. But I'm really grasping for straws here. Both of these songs are still subpar Megadeth songs and I wouldn't say that the decent segments in them would have suited on a good Megadeth album. The fact that I praise those 2 songs says more about the other songs on the album than about the songs themselves. They just happened to be the least painful songs.\n\nAs a whole, Risk isn't as bad as people say. It's worse than that. Megadeth's attempt to be modern and commercial is an unlistenable mess that every living soul should stay away from at all costs. With very, VERY, few glimpses of decency, I think it's safe to say that this is one of the worst albums I have heard. Ever.\n",
        "\nMetallica, Slayer, Megadeth & Anthrax, the Big Four of Thrash Metal!... Ha, good one. That's the funniest shit I've seen since seeing Kong shoving a tree down Godzilla's throat (or an axe, if you've seen their latest rematch). Honestly, as of right now, only Megadeth seems to still fit the part of this whole \"idea\", as Slayer doesn't exist anymore, Metallica only scratches the surface of thrash and so does Anthrax. But hey, they apparently sell the biggest number of records, unlike other bands being much closer to thrash, like Death Angel, Overkill, Testament or Exodus, so it makes sense, I guess...? Whatever this marketing crap is, the idea of this four bands uniting for making a tour around the world was born. And it ended up in recording this DVD, which I manage to bought some long time ago. However, I feel like I could spent that money on buying an actual good DVD, if other bands like Overkill or Death Angel were more open to the idea of fucking doing them.\n\nChronologically, I should start with Anthrax, but I prefer to start from Slayer. \"Fucking Slayer\" (or \"SLAYER, kurwa!\" from where I come from), I always cringe when I hear that chant. It makes me feel like those people have no idea that thrash needs more than aggression and speed to be great. While it could seem like I hate Slayer - no, not really. When they actually put some effort, they really can produce some relatively good music, as shown with 'Show No Mercy', 'Hell Awaits' (which are two albums completely overlooked on this show - what are the odds!), 'South of Heaven', 'Seasons in the Abyss' and even 'God Hates Us All'. It's mostly the cult following of 'Reign in Blood' that really gets under my nerves, because this album only has hollow aggression and speed to offer. And nothing else. But that didin't stopped metalheads from calling it \"magnum opus\" of thrash and compare every competent album to this mediocrity. But that's a story for another time.\n\nHonestly, this show is really weak. Not only the setlist sucks, offering very little variety out of Slayer's entire catalogue (it's mostly the big hits from 'Reing In Blood', 'South of Heaven' and 'Seasons in the Abyss', with three song from then-latest release 'World Painted Blood', 'Disciple' from 'God Hates Us All' and 'Jihad' from 'Christ Illusion'), but the song performances are also lacking punch. Hannemann and King were never anything special, but now they've really set the bar to the new low. Solos feel sloppy, as if playing those songs thousand times wasn't enough. I guess it's a nice thing to see Slayer in the iconic OG line-up before Jeff passed away, but to be honest, these guys are/were past their prime. Well, most of them, because Dave Lombardo is Dave Lombardo and Dave Lombardo is fucking awesome. Even if Slayer's music doesn't give him much of a room to vary his playstyle. Arguably, the lowest point of this show is Tom Araya. His vocals are just a pain to listen to. At some moments he sound like he's struggling for breath. Maybe he should have taken some vocal lessons to learn how to utilize your energy during singing better. Hell, maybe that would let him do the proper high-pitched screams again. \n\nAnother problem is the sound, which is quite muddy. While on 'Vile' by Cannibal Corpse it works for album's atmosphere, here it's just annoying. Live perfomances for me should sound clean enough to hear every member doing their work. Only drums sounds a bit passable, while King's guitar seem to overpower Hannemann's guitar in the mix, and Tom Araya seems to be completely lost, both vocally and with bass guitar. For better or worse, it's perhaps a good thing Slayer ended their career. Araya seems happy with retirement, King can play his horrible solos elsewhere (which I pity to whoever decides to join his new pet project) and Lombardo provides his skills for Suicidal Tendencies and Philm. Overall, I rate it around 35%. Too much bullshit for me to recommend. 'Decade of Aggression' is much likely a better choice.\n\nNext in the list, Anthrax. And again, it's pretty \"meh\". The musicianship is much tighter than Slayer, though. And as long as Charlie Benante isn't allowed anywhere close to 'Fast as a Shark' by Accept, I'll take him. But there are two things dragging this show down. First, setlist. I'll just gonna ask, where is 'Among the Living' (the song)? Where's 'A.I.R.'? Or 'Gung-Ho'? Or anything from 'Persistence of Time'? You had the time to play a song from much rather despised John Bush era, but nothing from 5th album? Not even a cheesy 'Belly of the Beast'? I guess that Joe Jackson cover of 'Got the Time' is the representative of 'Persistence of Time', but I'll rather have an original song here.\n\nBut even with better setlist the show would still be disappointing, because Joey Belladonna can't sing to save his life anymore. While the band seem to have a lot of fun performing the songs, Belladona drags the entire show down. In the 80s he may seemed a little bit like Bruce Dickinson knock-off, here it's even more evident, since his vocals downgraded just as much as Bruce's. It's again painful to listen, especially during 'Heaven and Hell' cover. Sorry Joey, but Mark Osegueda is the only one who can fucking nail this song. And again, Belladonna is struggling to keep his breath during singing a lot of times. And people have balls to say they're the best of out the 4. Yeah, fuck no.\n\nOne advantage they have over the rest is sound, which is clean, and sleak, and exactly how a modern live show should fucking sound like! It's right there with first part of 'The World is Ours' by Motorhead, 'Dark Roots of Thrash' by Testament or both Metallica's DVD from year prior. The drums have enough punch in them, the bass is audible, and guitars are just perfect. The only complaint is Belladona's voice being a bit hidden in the mix, although that might be a good thing... Overall, 50%. The musicianship and sound can't save a show with this disgraceful vocal performance. And to think I used to say this show was the best. What a joke. Get yourselves a copy of 'Alive 2', it's a much better Anthrax expierience with Belladonna that doesn't sound like a watered down version of modern Bruce Dickinson. Who already is a watered down version of classic Bruce, which is... Yikes.\n\nOkay then, Metallica. The biggest out of 4, the most recongizable, and of course have to put out the biggest and longest show. Well, I'm not so sure about that. Problem one, the setlist became way too formulaic at the time. We start with 'Creeping Death', so of course it only makes sense to follow-up with 'For Whom the Bell Tolls', correct that with 'Fuel' and a forgotten gem from 'Ride the Lightning' or '...And Justice for All', a ballad (at least 'One' appears much later on), a 'Death Magnetic' song (it's not 'Broken, Beat & Scarred', thank God), followed up by 'Cyanide', 'Sad But True', another ballad, 'All Nightmare Long', ANOTHER BALLAD, 'Master of Puppets', thrashy song with intro (and it's not overlooked 'Fight Fire With Fire' or 'Battery'), duo 'Nothing Else Matters' and 'Enter Sandman', cover song, and two 'Kill 'Em All' songs, the second one being obligatory 'Seek and Destroy'.\n\nI mean, at this point Metallica released 2 official albums which have this setlist structure, and countless of bootlegs from other shows. How hard it was to do some fucking changes? It wasn't until 2014/2015 when they're finally shaken the formula up, but seeing almost exact same-y setlist for 3rd time, with few song appearing on the THIRD RELEASE IN A ROW, makes me absolutely LIVID, to put it mildly. Like, why should I buy this release over, let's say, 'Orgullo, Pasion y Gloria' or 'Francais Pour Une Nuit'? Because without it, I'm only losing Big Four's joined performance of 'Am I Evil' (and aside from Lombardo, Slayer didn't even bother to show up, so fuck'em) and other three concerts, but aside from Megadeth, I wouldn't cry over losing them. And right now, I'm kind sick to death of hearing 'Blackened' or 'Cyanide', and don't even get me started on fucking 'One'. Why not give 'My Apocalypse' or 'The Shortest Straw' some exposure? Yeah, I know they're on 'Quebec Magnetic'. But before 2012, QM was nowhere near close release, so again, what does Metallica fan gains by buying this release?\n\nProblem two, perfomances. I know it's cheap to make fun of Lars' poor drumming skills and Kirk's excessive attachment to wah pedal, but it's just too easy. Apparently, they did improve in the last few years on 'Hardwired' tours, but it's all too little, too late. And Kirk is still unable to play one solo without his livesafer. Something that was charming in the 80s, is now pathetic. Thankfully, Rob and James are league above the other half of the Metallica. I mean, Rob comes from Infectious Groove, Suicidal Tendencies, Black Label Society and played for Ozzy fucking Osbourne, so what else is there to say? Metallica always had a nose for great bassists, and Rob is no different (even if Burton's creative inputs and Newsted devilish backing vocals will always be missed). James was always a tight rhythm guitarist, sometimes even providing some great solos ('Master of Puppets' and 'Nothing Else Matters' being most prominent examples) and while his voice is rather a huge downgrade from 80s, he's nowhere near as bad as Araya or Belladonna. And he's without a doubt a great frontman, encouraging audience to sing with him, giving some peptalks and stuff.\n\nProblem three, sound. While I can compliment 'Orgullo, Pasion y Gloria' and 'Francais Pour Une Nuit' for their clean and sleak sound, this one however starts to show some cracks. The drums feel like they're trying to remind the 'And Justice for All' era, to which I say: \"STOP!\", while the bass seem to trying to find its place in the mix. That might be only complaints about the sound, cause guitars and vocals are good enough. And of course, the 'Am I Evil' with other bands is a highlight for a lot of people, but my would rather be 'All Nightmare Long' - hearing this song live every time feels great, and even with those performers this song's atmosphere is more than enough to make it worth a listen. My rating for this show is somewhere around 65%, 70% at most. I'm getting sick of hearing 'Blackened', 'One' and 'Cyanide' on each of the DVD they've released. And Lars and Kirk should really start to suck it up and practicing a lot, because if it wasn't for James and Rob, they would probably be thrown out of the band long time ago.\n\nI decided to save the best for the last, i.e. Megadeth. Hell yes, that's one show that I can't complain about much. Or rather, I'd need to resort to nitpicking to actually find flaws. Setlist is great for a show that lasts only 1 hour (although 'Holy Wars' being played twice is questionable for me), the musicianship is top notch, and the sound is great. Well, okay, now for complaints, number 1, lack of Dave's interaction with crowd. I know he's not as great of a vocalist, but as a charismatic persona, he should interact with audience more. Here he only says couple of words before 'Head Crusher' and that's it. Live performances have this advantage of interacting with the crowd, yet Mustaine didn't decided to use that. Shame, cause this show, while being fantastic, definitely needs to catch a breath. Number 2, while drums and bass sound fucking perfect ('Hook in a Mouth' opening proves that), the guitars feel muddled, and sound like they've caught a stage fright...? Although it's probably due to rain during the perfomance, and some nasty weather is not enough to spook out Megadeth, so I can forgive that. Aside from that, though, I have no complaints. 90% from me. Funnily enough, I considered the show to be the weakest out of entire 4 back in the day I bought this DVD. How the turns have tabled indeed...\n\nHonestly, 'The Big Four: Live from Sofia, Bulgaria' is rather a disappointing release. 1 show is a complete disaster, other two are hampered by certain musicians, and only one actually delievers on what fans want. This is really far from what, in comparison, Testament or Motorhead can offer in terms of live perfomance, and it's definitely inferior to all of those bands' previous live recordings, 'Decade of Aggresion' and 'Live Shit' especially. I would just recommend to check out those bands' other DVDs, because it's really not worth it just for the sake of Metallica, Anthrax, Megadeth and Dave Lombardo performing 'Am I Evil'. Well, that, and the fact that these bands aren't really the 'Big Four of Thrash'.\n",
        "\n\"Peace Sells... But Who's Buying?\" is an album that deserves to be remembered, because it has never valued at its fair measure. Maybe the beginnings of this band were a bit turbulent, with continuous lineup changes, or because their masterpieces \"Rust In Peace\" and \"Countdown To Extinction\" overshadow this legacy. This seems a grievance because Megadeth is a band to rediscover, regardless of their three popular albums (including \"Youthanasia\"). This record has a very strong point, all songs here are quite unpredictable. They're not your typical radio singles, even the singles that accompany it.\n\n\"Wake Up Dead\" is a masterful opener, with rhythm changes, complex developments, with an effective hook that works well with peculiar vocals, speed guitar solos, and an omnipresent bass with lyrics politically incorrect. Yeah, fuck the political correctness. \"The Conjuring\", with superb Ellefson's bass lines shows that he's one of the pillars that support the band's sound. The title track is a super hit, its speech worthy of study shows the songwriting that would impress again in Countdown To Extinction. If I summarize all in a song, would be this one, since it gathers the basic details on these songs, such as refined technique, insurmountable riff and jazz reminiscences. \"Devil's Island\" closes the first half, one of my favorite sides in thrash metal. Ever. \"My Last Words\" is another great song with Iron Maiden influence, a perfect way to end this masterpiece, maybe it follows the custom of that British band.\n\nDave Mustaine and Chris Poland did form a couple of enviable guitars for that time. David Ellefson is one of the permanent members who give such recognizable style for Megadeth. And finally, Mustaine had a good eye to choose drummers like Gar Samuelson, and drums are mixed nicely. Just like Metallica, Anthrax and Testament, Megadeth dissociated themselves from extreme metal in order to write songs with more hook, giving more popularity as a result and better record sales without losing the thrash metal roots. In other latitudes, bands like Exodus, Overkill or Slayer are more attached to ferocity, following the European stream of bands like Sodom or Kreator.\n\n\"Hey WR95, after this album, they recorded So Far, So Good...So What!, a classic one that people barely remember In My Darkest Hour. Then comes the trilogy Rust In Peace/Countdown To Extinction/Youthanasia, their glorious era with a galactic lineup (Mustaine/Friedman/Ellefson/Menza) that deletes from map their first three albums\"... Yes, but we are here to bring this to light and invite you to enjoy it: an overwhelming, ambitious album that reflected how strong Megadeth wanted to tread on thrash scene and how they wanted to become the benchmark. What else to say, a short album less than 40 minutes but eternal at the same time.\n",
        "\nJust to preface, thrash metal is my favorite sub-genre of the greater metal sphere, and perhaps my favorite genre of music as a whole. I've spent countless hours listening to Metallica, Slayer, Artillery, Flotsam & Jetsam, Demolition Hammer, Voivod, Razor...the list goes on and on. However, of all the thrash albums I've listened to in my life, there are none that have captured (and held onto) my attention so completely as Megadeth's Rust in Peace.\n\nRust in Peace was the first album Megadeth recorded with their all-star lineup of Dave Mustaine, David Ellefson, Marty Friedman, and Nick Menza. While the two Daves are mainstays of the band's cast, Megadeth changes drummers and guitarists more often than I hit the snooze button on my morning alarm. This time around, however, they had struck gold. Menza's masterful control of the kit combined with Friedman's exotic and eclectic shredding led to a truly unique sound for the group, one which I have yet to hear come out of any other group at that time.\n\nSomething that will stand out very quickly as you listen to this album is that this is a heavily progressive, technical record. As the 80's progressed into the late 80's and the 90's, the thrash scene was slowly transitioning to a more technically proficient, melodic, and sonically progressive genre. Look no further than albums such as Voivod's Dimension Hatr\u00f6ss, Forbidden's Twisted Into Form, and Watchtower's Control and Resistance for examples of this stylistic shift. On Rust in Peace, Megadeth incorporate a vast array of different styles and sounds, from the blistering yet intricate riffs of \"Poison was the Cure\" to the complex, ever-changing progressions of \"Five Magics\".\n\nThis progressive approach is enhanced even further by Friedman's unique guitar tone, filled with so much emotion and expressiveness that's almost unheard of in the genre. In order to best understand what I mean by this, listen to the song \"Lucretia\", where Marty's guitar sounds almost sorrowful, as if it were weeping as the chords were being played. Don't let this fool you, though - at the end of the day, this is still a thrash album through and through. \"Take No Prisoners\" is filled with the oppressive, no-holds-barred aggression that defines the genre, while \"Holy Wars...The Punishment Due\" is in very serious contention for the single greatest thrash song ever written, so perfect a track that the 6:32 runtime will leave you enraptured for every single second.\n\nI would of course be remiss to not mention perhaps the most widely acclaimed element of the album - the guitar solos. Here's an experiment for you to try out - go onto YouTube and look up \"best thrash solos\", \"best metal solos\", \"best guitar solos\", anything like that. I guarantee you that, at the very least, there will be 1 song from Rust in Peace on there. In fact, that song will likely place high on that list. There might even be multiple solos from this album. Rust in Peace is truly a gift that keeps on giving: you have the unrelenting intensity of \"Holy Wars...The Punishment Due\", the back-and-forth dueling of \"Hangar 18\", the explosive finale of \"Five Magics\", and of course, \"Tornado of Souls\". There's a reason people have been quoted as saying \"the Tornado of Souls guitar solo is better than sex\". If you haven't heard it yet, I'd be really curious to know what type of rock you live under.\n\nI've been mainly talking (or writing, I guess) about the lead/rhythm guitars so far, but there's more to an album than that. As I mentioned earlier in this review, Nick Menza is a force to be reckoned with on the drums. The booming intro of \"Rust in Peace...Polaris\" is where he can be heard most prominently, but he kills it on every single track. Go look up the isolated drum tracks for this album - the percussion on this album is so unbelievably dynamic, and it provides a brilliant foundation for the rest of the band. Additionally, Ellefson's bass chops on display here are equally impressive. Not content with simply mimicking what Mustaine and Friedman are doing, Ellefson utilizes the bass to expertly round out the sound throughout the album. There are even some moments where this lower-end is on full display, such as the satisfying tapping section in \"Take No Prisoners\", as well as the entire runtime of the dark and brooding \"Dawn Patrol\".\n\nI've waxed poetic about this album for long enough. As you can probably guess, I honestly have nothing bad to say about this album. Like, at all. The production is rock-solid, and everything is perfectly refined (provided you're not listening to the 2004 remix/remaster). One common complaint levied against Rust in Peace is Mustaine's vocals, but I find them to be a perfect fit. They're not the most aggressive, nor are they the most technically proficient - however, they suit the tone of the record very well, and I wouldn't change it at all.\n\nThis is the best thrash metal album I've heard in my entire life. Some have come close. Many more pale in comparison. I've tried my best to describe everything I love about this masterpiece, but I still feel that I lack the words to accurately describe how much I worship Rust in Peace. Every time I listen to it, it feels just as fresh and exciting as when I first heard it. A truly timeless classic that will continue to exert its dominance over all who dare attempt to oppose it.\n\nEasiest 100% I will ever give in my life.\n\n-frauds\n",
        "\nEven though Peace Sells and Killing is My Business are my new found favourites, I think that Rust in Peace is probably their most accomplished album. Now, other's may argue differently; some might even say that Countdown to Extinction is the best, based on its commercial success. However, the mid-tempo approach to that album isn't as much fun as this one; this one comes closest to perfection.\n\nThe musicianship from Mustaine, Ellefson and then new members, Nick Menza and Marty Freidman, is of a very high standard. This album has a lot of good riffs, inventive time-signatures, exciting and much anticipated song finales. There are plenty of excellent guitar solos \u2013 especially in the trade-off department. All of this is based on Mustaine's attitude, aggression and his high quality songwriting. His songs cover different themes, with the main one being warfare \u2013 then there's the dark arts, drug addiction, failed relationships and government conspiracy. It's a really great combination.\n\nMustaine's lead work on 'Holy Wars' is fast and aggressive; Friedman delivers the more nuanced touches, with an acoustic bridge which matches the songs motif. In general, Mustaine adds these nuanced melodic and harmonic qualities at just the right moments \u2013 and that, combined with his distinctive snarling, creates the perfect blend of speed, melody and aggression. Then there's 'Hanger 18' and 'Tornado of Souls,' which have great riffs and some amazing solo work. They deliver those 'classic' guitar trade-offs and the latter song demonstrates Friedman's solo ability \u2013 it's a monster of a solo!\n\nI prefer deep cuts like 'Poison Was the Cure,' 'Take No Prisoners' and 'Rust in Peace... Polaris,' though. There's a good use of bass as a focal point at the right times \u2013 most notably on 'Poison Was the Cure,' which builds from the bass, then goes into some really funky Killing Is My Business style riffing. 'Take No Prisoners,' with its lethal riffing, has one of many great lines: 'Goin' to war, give 'em hell \u2013 d-day, next stop Normandy!' All of these songs are unique, but there's still a conceptual unity. They're all war/military related, directly or indirectly; even those about drug-abuse or failed relationships are war-like, metaphorically.\n\nThis is a unique recording and what is obvious is that it took all four musicians to create it. Menza was the glue, linking all of the transitions; his drum chops and the way he accented was key to the flow of each song. That's become more evident listening to them without him, although I will say, Jimmy DeGrasso did them justice in his short tenure. This is the pinnacle of Mustaine's musical career \u2013 this is his Arsenal of Megadeth!\n",
        "\nAlright, forgive the cringey fanboy heading, I'm just going through the reviewer equivalent of writer's block and suddenly ran out of creative titles the same way that Britain ran out of good politicians in the 80's. Nevertheless, I love this album. I first listened to it in April 2019 (hey come on, don't call me a poser for being that late, it's kind of hard to have been around for this album's release when you were born in 2006), and frankly, I thought it sucked. I've always been a fan of Megadeth, since the age of 5 when I first played Holy Wars on guitar hero, but I just couldn't rap my head around the rusty guitar tone, the ultra-rough production, the utter lack of song structure and the sheer ear-blistering speed, but as I gave this more listens over time, I realised just how potent of a debut it is, every thing is so erratic and rapid but tight, every solo is spot-on, every drum fill Gar performs is just crazy, Chris and Dave's playing is just mindblowing through and through, and everything is lightning-fast (all of this is probably cocaine-related, come to think of it) but as well as the playing in general, every song has memorable musical phrases and the ideas expressed are quite ahead of their time.\n\nMy favourite songs from this album are Rattlehead and The Mechanix, both of which are insanely quick and inconstant, but hold together strongly enough as compositions that they don't sound unfocused or lazily written; everything has its purpose, and this is what makes the songs so memorable. The mental, ripping riffs of both tracks are just infectiously good, once you get into this album, you'll be listening to it for days on repeat because of riffs like these, and the record is filled with them. Last Rites / Loved To Deth also exemplifies Megadeth's mixture of technicality and pure filthy thrashing, and it perfectly encapsulates Dave's image of what he formed Megadeth to do: get revenge on Metallica, and be the fastest, heaviest, craziest band in the world. The song starts with a piano intro, Last Rites, which is creepy, and a great way to kick the album off, then Loved To Deth starts, which might be the most deranged song on the entire thing, it's wild and thrashy, but oddly groovy at the same time, the verse riff in particular impressed me because of its incorporation of swing, which was probably influenced by Chris and Gar's background as jazz musicians (that also explains the amazing solos on every track). \n\nThe Skull Beneath The Skin is another favourite of mine, it sounds evil and dark, I love it. Despite the album's morbid and merciless image, there are more light-hearted tracks like Chosen Ones and These Boots, both of which are brilliant songs, but they rely on a much more upbeat and happier sound than the rest of the album. Looking Down The Cross is the longest song on the album, although it's barely 5 minutes song, which says a lot about how abrupt the writing is, and it's a fairly good song, but it's my least favourite from the record because it lacks the energy that the rest of the album boasts.\n\nThe production gets a lot of criticism, but I've grown to like it a fair bit actually, it's rough, sure, but the rawness actually improves the musical quality in my eyes, for example, the intro in The Mechanix is enhanced so much by the dirty, old-school sound. I just wish that David's bass was mixed higher. But on the whole, this is Megadeth's debut album! That automatically means it's worth picking up. If you're looking for fast thrash metal with memorable riffing and mind-blowing technical solos, this would easily be one of the first albums I'd point you to.\n",
        "\nI remember the announcement of the Killing Is My Business... And Business Is Good! re-release, and it was to include the Last Rites demo, I was so stoked! Everything about the first album, I loved, how it sounded, the look of it; absolutely everything, but I had no need for a re-master. Still, the lure of the demo was too much to resist. Skipping right to the three bonus tracks, my first utterable thought was... Holy fucking shit! Megadeth was always the faster of the two Mustaine related bands, and Killing Is My Business... was everything that Kill Em' All wanted to be in terms of speed and intensity. But this demo is to both those albums, what meth is to caffeine pills. \n\nA slightly rougher version of 'Last Rites' opens the tape just as it does the album. Once the final moments of 'Last Rites' harmonically ring out, it rips right into 'Loved To Deth' and becomes a violent killing rampage and doesn't stop until the last note of 'The Skull Beneath The Skin'. Sound-wise the demo is filthy, but the message is clear; Do not fuck with us! Dave Mustaine was clearly pissed off to the point of homicidal after Metallica unceremoniously fired him. His riffs are coming apart at the seams, and the solos are outright deranged. In all that madness, somehow Ellefson and Lee Rausch are keeping up. David Ellefson's bass lines are outstanding, his work on later Megadeth releases have always been exceptional, but the fact that he was executing these blitzkrieg bass-runs this early on is mindblowing. The biggest surprise is Lee Rausch, I am a big Gar Samuelson fan, but Lee Rausch's performance on here is stellar. How Lee never got picked up by another band after this and gone onto a successful career is criminal.\n\nAs Megadeth goes, this is easily one of the five releases that I routinely play. It embodies everything that thrash and speed metal should be. Even if you hate Megadeth but you love thrash, you should give this a listen. The Last Rites demo is so violent I can guarantee you will love this!\n",
        "\nPost Risk Megadeth releases can be effectively all classified as half tributes to the different eras of the classic material, mixed with their current attempts to marry older ideas with said past glories. Sometimes these collections fall flat or come off as simply acceptable. However, sometimes these attempts hit all the right notes; Endgame is one of those times. Endgame was expectedly dubbed as a return to form, as with most releases by the Megadeth, or the Big Four in general. Forwarded by claims that the album could be slotted right in there, between album X and album Y of the first 5 classics, or 6 depending on who was doing the talking. If you had been a fan of Megadeth long enough, you have heard the same claims about The World Needs A Hero, The System Has Failed, and the previous stab, United Abominations. To be fair, this was true in some form or another, that the material on those albums, is definitely better than the releases that saw Megadeth distance themselves from thrash, and on some occasions, heavy metal altogether.\n\nAs with all Megadeth releases, being the zealot that I am, I buy it the day it comes out, or even finding a leak if I can beforehand. I picked up the album from HMV, got back to the car, and threw it in. I think that because of the past albums never really living up to their claims, that the material entered my ears with a doubt filter installed. Anyway, after a few listens I was thoroughly impressed. But this was not Rust In Peace, and it was never going to be. It was Endgame that drove home the idea, that outside of Dave deciding to record only super tech songs, and chase an early 90\u2019s production style; it was never going to be like Rust In Peace. There are, however, lots of shining moments that harken back to the classic albums, but they also found a way to pick the best parts of the new releases. \n\nThe album kicks off with \u2018Dialectic Chaos\u2019, an instrumental that conjures a likeness of Into The Lungs Of Hell. It's stuffed with thrash riffs and exceptional lead work from Mustaine and new guy, Chris Broderick. In fact, being a Mustaine fan, I was outright animated, that aside from a few songs on here, Mustaine and Broderick are trading shred for shred. \u2018This Day We Fight\u2019 doesn\u2019t waste any time ripping into an amalgam of Rust In Peace like material, right down to a riff that is quite similar to one from Five Magics. \u201844 Minutes\u2019 is a track that could have easily been written for United Abominations, with its Gears of War feel. Its recount of the 97\u2019 North Hollywood shootout, using a narrative vocal style that Mustaine has been doing more and more as of late. \u20181320\u2019, a song about drag racing, musically drums up a So Far, So Good\u2019s 502 vibe. \u2018Bite The Hand\u2019 and \u2018Bodies\u2019, imprinting a United Abominations/World Needs A Hero aura respectively, are the only slight weak points of the record. They aren\u2019t bad or even mediocre, but they do have a few lyrical and musical moments that don\u2019t appeal to me. Though, I do enjoy \u2018Bodies\u2019 melodic approach more than \u2018Bite The Hand\u2019s\u2019 disjointed riffing and lyrics.\n\nThe title track \u2018Endgame\u2019, could have been written for United Abominations, as it fits its character to a T. With its narrative/diatribe vocals, back and forth lead work, and those under-solo Hangar 18-esque riffs, it tears into American politics. This is another element to return that I have enjoyed with current Megadeth albums. Mustaine, never being shy about speaking his mind about current events, for a while those topics took a back seat to lyrics about his personal life. There is only so much about his past drug use and religion that one can appreciate. \u2018The Hardest Part Of Letting Go... Sealed With A Kiss\u2019 is a bit of a refugee on the album. It definitely has an A Worlds Needs A Hero vibe but it also has an almost European power metal feel, which I can only really attribute to Chris Broderick\u2019s involvement in the song writing. \u2018Head Crusher\u2019 is as the title appears; it is the heaviest crushing track on the album, definitely at home among the So Far, So Good styled songs. A maverick of the album, it stands out in many ways, and most likely due to Drover writing the bulk of the music. \u2018How The Story Ends\u2019 is an infectious track, with a The System Has Failed/United Abominations feel, with even a few riffs that could have been lifted from The Disintegrators type material off of Cryptic Writings. This track is a personal favourite of mine, with killer catchy riffs, a cool acoustic solo by Dave, and a ripping lead from Broderick. Easily the one song I look forward to the most when spinning the disc. The album ends with \u2018The Right To Go Insane\u2019, and is very United Abominations in its feel. It is a good track, but not the one that should have closed out the album. If one was to switch around the last two tracks, that would have made a great ending to the disc.\n\nSonically the production on this album is stellar, thanks to returning producer Andy Sneap (Nevermore, Testament) at the helm. The sound is crisp, clear, and well mixed; like an updated Max Normal production. As usual, Megadeth is second to none when it comes to its execution, and Dave would accept nothing less. Mustaine\u2019s vocals are great, his leads are some of the best he has done, and his rhythms are razor sharp. The aforementioned Ex Jag Panzer/Nevermore guitarist, Chris Broderick, completes the guitar duo. Skill-wise, Broderick is the closest Megadeth has found that matches Marty Friedman. His lead work is phenomenal but only time will tell if his leads will be as memorable as the classic Friedman or Chris Poland solos. Shawn Drover and Journeyman bassist, James LoMenzo, return on Endgame for their second outing. Both doing a great job, but they don\u2019t stand out like Gar, Nick and David did. \n\nHow does the CD stack up to the classics? Well, I think it should be considered a modern classic. If you are a Megadeth fan, you are almost guaranteed to love this album. If you only like the first 4, you might not receive this album as well as I did. So if Rust In Peace is a perfect album like I think it is, and then this album is its younger brother that isn\u2019t so serious all the time. I highly recommend that you add this to your collection.\n",
        "\nJust like the USSR, that evil commie's nest, thrash metal still managed to make it alive past the 80s into the new decade, though we know that wouldn't last much for either of them. But contrasting with the then decaying Soviet Union, many of the infamous riff-centered metal genre's greatest glories arrived precisely in 1990. Without a doubt in my mind, Megadeth's monumental Rust in Peace easily sits atop that stellar list, ahead of other colossal works like Kreator's Coma of Souls, Morbid Saint's Spectrum of Death, Annihilator's Never, Neverland, Slayer's Seasons in the Abyss and Anthrax's Persistence of Time, among others. In fact, this is probably the best year for the so-called Big Four's output in overall quality, even without 'tallica's participation, though there was never a year in which the four managed to deliver top-shelf albums at the same time, '86 being second close, and 1988 third since all four released material, but fell short due to Megadeth's own massive letdown, So Far, So Good\u2026 So What?.\n\nBut speaking about Metallica, MegaDave's dream of catching up their former, now worldwide famous metal mates, was finally achieved with this tremendous chef-d'oeuvre. His band already surpassed the Four Horsemen in overall speed and virtuosity, as that has been his main goal when forming Megadeth, but Rust in Peace was much, much more than just a vindictive statement of revenge and superiority. This was the distilled maximum quality product of all the tech thrash mastery of the late 80s, taking all the right cues from peers like Coroner, Voivod, Mekong Delta, Target, Deathrow and others and turning them up to 11. All the musical possibilities and potential of the thrash metal genre where achieved here; dexterous technical intricacies anchored by phenomenal guitar riffs and a mind-blowing spot on rhythmic section, catchy and memorable songwriting with intelligent, thinking man's metal lyrics that didn\u2019t end up being neither too preachy nor banal and suckled avidly both the breast of real politics and international social issues, and the sweet tit of sci-fi and fantasy, delivered by a vocalist who, even though was an acquired taste for some, undoubtedly brought forth a strong, unique presence to the scene.\n\nAll nine track here are just tip-top tech thrash metal for the ages, and no matter how many times you listen to them, they never fail to impress and make your cervical vertebrae movements go nuclear. Signature 'Deth opening tune (and their usual closer, live), \u201cHoly Wars\u2026 The Punishment Due\u201d is like taking a track from Master of Puppets, adding an even superior production, while speeding it up and making it even more explosive and complex, without taking away the instant memorability and catchiness of it. This was one of the first Megadeth tunes I ever listened to, while watching the video on MTV. The images of this tall and lean, curly blond dude ripping the axe like a possessed maniac during the final guitar solo would forever be etched into my brain. And so is the Arabesque classic guitar interlude by another six-string virtuoso, the recently recruited Marty Friedman, right when \u201cHoly Wars\u201d gives way to \u201cThe Punishment Due\u201d. And the other David on the band, Mr. Ellefson, was finally given a suitable compliment in Nick Menza to form one of the greatest rhythmic sections in all of thrash metal. Menza and Friedman finally gave Megadeth a solid lineup in which the four instrumental powers combined for a perfect metallurgy, as both demonstrated instant chemistry with Mustaine. \n\nThere are so many outstanding moments here, Menza and Ellefson splashing tasty proggy stop-and-go moments when they're not razing everything along their path with the guitars, while Mustaine and Friedman just put your ears on fire 100% of the time, from the mid-paced rhythmic elegance of Roswellian \u201cHangar 18\u201d and its closing, delightful solo trade-off section, to the scorching, mandatory headbang-inducing final moments of \u201cPolaris\u201d. I will not delve into further song description, as words simply fail to express what a godly guitar solo like the one on \u201cTornado of Souls\u201d can do to a human soul. I'll just say that \u201cSnow Patrol\u201d is of course a different specimen, albeit an interesting one, a minimalist thrash quasi-interlude with Ellefson bass lines and a darker Mustaine addressing global warming, and while some deem it as a filler, I just can't imagine this album without it. The production, supervised by MegaDave himself, is excellent. Furthermore, this is one of those rare cases in which the more recent remastering has managed to make this record sound even greater, especially with the enhancement of those dual-layered Dave choruses and a bigger punch to Ellefson's bass. \n\nAn iconic Ed Repka album cover encases what Rust in Peace, one of thrash metal's finest releases ever, represents as a work of art for mankind; no regime nor politic power would ever outlast the might of music and arts, no matter if they're extreme, countercultural or not. Much of this album, like many similar works by other thrash metal bands, deals with the fear of atomic power being unleashed. It\u2019s curious and funny to think about that nowadays, at the threshold of the third decade of the 21th Century, when humans find themselves trapped inside their homes by the fierce but diminutive hand of a biological agent. Atomic warfare, while obviously still possible, is probably the least concern in people's minds right now\u2026 right after those dreaded, and so far, unseen, murder hornets. Eradication of Earth's entire population remains to be seen (by aliens, perhaps?) but Rust in Peace came here to stay AND SLAY, unlike those rusting warheads hidden somewhere, and its devastating awesomeness will forever be felt by those who chose to press the launch\u2026 I mean, the play, button.\n",
        "\nIn all of its essentials, Youthanasia was rather a dick move from Megadave. He'd made Countdown to Extinction 2 years prior as a shot at challenging Metallica's supremacy, felt gutted when it peaked at #2 in the charts, and then returned to the studio, knuckled down, and made an even more orthodox version of his commercial vision. Now, I know I've just ascribed a thirst for success to Dave Mustaine that overreaches his musical integrity, but I don't have any problem agreeing that Youthanasia proves itself empirically good music as well. You see, in gunning for commercial success away from the dwindling thrash metal wave, Countdown to Extinction was way too creative and nuanced to achieve what it was meant to. You've got aggressive metal like 'High Speed Dirt' and 'Skin o' My Teeth' alongside politically abstract songs in the form of 'Architecture of Aggression' and 'Foreclosure of a Dream', plus a few psychotic acting moments in 'Sweating Bullets' and 'Captive Honour', all of which make the album much less mainstream than the stadium rock aspirations of Metallica. My argument is that Youthanasia takes away most of the intrigue of such a diverse selection and aims for a more formulaic bullseye.\n\nGranted, Megadeth's greatest line-up hits that bullseye so straight that they begin splitting arrows by halfway through the 12 songs. Operating midway between classic metal and contemporary stadium rock, the quartet seizes a memorable chorus, a strutting riff, and a few flashy solos to be bound up in little packages of 3 and a half to 5 minutes. Funnily enough, every time I put this album on, I feel like it will run out of steam after this song - okay, after the next one - alright, the next one then - and it never does. I'm not sure Megadeth required all 12 songs to prove how well they had this thing nailed, though 50 minutes seems by no means excessive in the early part of the \"more is more\" CD era. On the other hand, I always feel while listening that nothing can surprise me, right from the friendly and well-balanced sound to the lame pun in the title and provocative yet really quite safe cover art. Play these songs between bands at a gig and I'll bob my head; play them in the car and I'll do 5 over the speed limit; play them in a shopping centre and I might not even notice. Youthanasia drives a safe line down the middle of the road.\n\nSong by song, I can pick out some slightly different types. The rhythmic, almost danceable, antics of opening tracks 'Reckoning Day' and 'Train of Consequences' emphasize a new kind of Megadeth riff that relies on fewer notes and a more instinctive reaction from the listener, while time and again on 'The Killing Road', 'Blood of Heroes', 'Black Curtains', and 'Addicted to Chaos' a swaggering tempo topped off by a striding groove performs the service of providing momentum, something that the left hands of Marty Friedman and Dave Mustaine used to be more than adequate at. In general, I like that style, especially when the vocals power over the top and the guitarists interject with controlled bouts of lead work, yet nothing exists in that formula to break through to higher levels of excitement. In fact, it falls to the very last song for speed to even be considered as a resource, and even then 'Victory' hardly feels urgent. As you would expect from a big rock album in 1994, some clean work and balladry appears every 3 songs or so, showcasing Mustaine's improved vocal control and David Ellefson's pronounced bass playing. Without the bass being as high as it is, Youthanasia would show almost no sign of the heavy metal band from a few years earlier.\n\nAs I hope I've made clear by now, the compactness and single-mindedness of this album doesn't actually equate to it being poor in any way. Just, as I began by stating, Youthanasia was a dick move. As an intensely conscious decision to rein in creativity and natural ability, I cannot stand behind the ethos of the album whatsoever, and fully endorse the return to experimentation on the less solid Risk. Nevertheless, we are left with unquestionably the most consistent Megadeth album, surely the most commercially appealing, and perhaps an enduring record of the band's influence. I hear all sorts of post-millennial ideas present here, from the drum intro to 'Addicted to Chaos' (pinched by Soil for 'Halo', if anyone was wondering) to those slightly wandering leads of Friedman's, which point more to modern prog metal than stadium rock in their note choices. By no means am I endorsing Youthanasia as an artistic decision, but as pure music it's actually pretty much on point.\n",
        "\nI was expecting to give this around a 10 or a little higher, but decided on an 8. I knew this review was gonna be negative for sure, but didn't know exactly what to rate it, I think an 8 is acceptable enough. First of all let me get this straight, this itself isnt absolutely fucking terrible, but compared to the original song, this is an abomination. If this was it's own song and wasn't a remake of the original, I'd easily give this a way higher score.\n\nAlot of the time I HEAVILY dislike when bands make modern, \"re-vamped\" versions of their classics, unless its something specific or it legitimately isn't bad. Some bands do it greatly, particularly brutal death metal bands, or death metal bands in general. For the most part they make it great or decent enough, but what we have here with this \u00c0 tout le monde remake is just unacceptable.\n\nThis remake has been dehydrated of all it's emotion and iconic feel. Think of it as a sponge, it sucked out all the life and greatness. No water = no life. A giant sponge sucked the life out of this big time. The beauty of the sad, windy, rainy day mood is completely gone. Sure, the original song is obviously still here, but it's ruined by the newer and half-assed sound. The original has soul, it has emotion, and that's what makes it so great. THIS is a remake just for the hell of it. There's no soul to be found, all the beauty is gone. On top of that, it's played in a note higher or something from what I observe, so as soon as it starts playing it's already cringe-worthy. Makes you go \"uuUgGhHHHH\" and shiver in disgust.\n\nI'm not one to bitch about remakes or \"newer music\", most of the metal and music I listen to is from 1995-present. Most of the time I listen to things that came out after 2000. I cant stand people who whine about \"old school better dur dur new music bad and gay grrrr\", but when it comes to crap like this, a meaningless remake of a beautiful classic which is ruined by half-assery and the modern sound, that's when I feel the same way. Not to shit on the genre at all, but alot of the time thrash bands don't do so well with remakes of their classics, that's death metal's thing. Thrash needs to stop doing that, and this right here proves exactly why. Yeah, \u00c0 tout le monde isn't exactly a pure thrash song. Especially if a thrash band puts out remakes of stuff from their iffy/different/experimental era you know it'll probably be bad. That's exactly the case here. You know what I mean, whatever.\n\nThe original version felt full of life, and had an actual foundation that had an atmosphere when it hit the listeners' ears. This feels empty and hollow, not a good taste in your mouth. This does NOT give me the same vibe as the original does. Instead it gives me the vibe of mediocrity, the vibe of the \"popular 80's thrash band trying to be epic as they used to with 'comeback' type albums and material\". Leaving me wondering why Dave Mustaine, an absolute chad, has done this. \n\nDave's vocals sound weak and uninspired, which once again proves that the life has been completely sucked out of this. Where's the depth? The care? Doesn't seem to me like he legitimately cares enough to fit the same vibe and mood as the original. On top of that, he sounds rushed, like he's trying to get through this as fast as possible. It's like a live version of the band playing the song, but recorded into a studio version. There's no clear direction, just the need for the destination. What a dissapointment. I also dont like the dual vocals either, that's really unneeded and makes it even more bad. God NO dual vocals, especially with a female counterpart. THE CRINGE. Compared to the OG version, everything here sounds thin, lifeless, wussy as fuck, whiney, and bare of worth. This sucks. Everything is played correctly, and the instrumentation is definitely there, but the presentation and style/sound of the instruments are gross and VERY bitter, no thanks. We could DEFINITELY have a beautiful modern version of the song if the band put more care into it and tried to make it as similar and soulful to the original as much as possible, but THIS is what we got. A contrived, careless, scurried up revamp. Wow.\n\nNothing towards the female vocalist I guess, but WHY??? I really fucking hate when there's a cheesy as hell unneeded female vocal part singing along the dude, it always ruins it, that's just how it is; unless it's gothic metal or something, but that's an entirely different thing. I just fucking hate it, it's annoying and makes my head and ears ache. No reason for her to be in this awful insulting remake, making it even more stupid than it already is. It would honestly be kinda less bad if she were never in this. Adding the girl doesn't make it any more special, or emotional, it adds nothing. In fact; it makes it even worse than it already is. There's NO NEED to add cheesy as fuck stupid female backing parts, ever. What the hell? Fucking stupid.\n\nThis review is entirely based off the song's comparison to the original, as it's obvious that this is once again, a giant abomination and a pure insult. A timeless classic remade in a modern, money-pinching, half-assed, un-soulful mess. This is my first time writing an extremely negative review, never currently have given anything a rating this low before. I definitely hate other things more than this, but I can't deny the fact that this remake is absolute crap and garbage. I can SLIGHTLY tolerate the other things, but this dreadful remake I can't stand. Not complete fucking garbage but it sure is very close to it. There's no emotion, no soul, no foundation, just pure abomination that truly has zero reason to exist.\n\nIt's listenable, but NO. Please NO.\n\nPLEASE stick to the original, this doesn't deserve any light or positivity at all. I will most definitely not listen to anybody trying to persuade me that it's a \"good remake\" or \"not as bad\". No, not listening to that false garbage. Take that thought elsewhere, because this remake is and will forever remain an insulting piece of crap. I love Megadeth and don't hate pretty much most the stuff they have, I'm a definite fan and have been for a long time.. But this is just unacceptable. I love Megadeth and I love you Dave Mustaine, but this remake of one of your all time greatest songs and a big favorite of mine is a GIANT fail.\n",
        "\nMegadeth is a band that, when they\u2019re on, they\u2019re on like Donkey Kong. Peace Sells, Rust in Peace, most of Countdown to Extinction, those three songs from Endgame we all know and love \u2013 this is the kind of stuff that kept Megadeth firmly stamped right on the map. They dropped off for a while with the two albums after Endgame, but there\u2019s much ado about their 2016 release, Dystopia. With Kiko Loureiro serving as the other guitarist, having the album more closely resembling Rust in Peace is a safe bet \u2013 nothing like him and Dave Mustaine coming right on out with some high-flying solos accentuating catchy riffs. It isn\u2019t quite as strong as those albums I just mentioned, but it\u2019s definitely got its strengths.\n\nSure enough, the album starts off pretty good with the triple threat of \u201cThe Threat is Real\u201d, \u201cDystopia\u201d and \u201cFatal Illusion\u201d. The intro song operates at a mid-pace, mixing some chugs with some mid-paced gallops and throws all that your way. Thankfully, this comes across more like an earworm than a non-entity. The titular song is more lively given the faster strumming and leads permeating throughout to get it in your head. \u201cFatal Illusion\u201d creeps up on you with a somewhat angular groove \u2013 somewhat reminiscent of what you\u2019d hear from Angra \u2013 before picking up the pace and ratcheting up the tension with some thrashing riffs. Big fat fucking spoiler alert, alongside the fiery fretboarding solo-laden instrumental \u201cConquer or Die\u201d and the out and out fucking catchy affair that is \u201cThe Emperor\u201d, these are the best songs on the album, mainly because they\u2019re the most melodic and lively songs on the album.\n\nThis is at least better than anything they\u2019ve done since Countdown to Extinction. Having said that, the other songs are considerably weaker \u2013 but they\u2019re not without some merit. \u201cPost American World\u201d and \u201cBullet to the Brain\u201d have memorable choruses thanks to a slightly more urgent pace in the instruments. Like, I dare you to get their choruses out of your head. But both are bookended with lame, plodding chugs that serve as the verse riffs. Seriously, this shit chugs like a fucking choo-choo train! \u201cPoisonous Shadows\u201d could\u2019ve worked as a neat mid-paced song if it were about two minutes shorter. It\u2019s got a decent rhythm that would stick more if it didn\u2019t drag on for six goddamn minutes. As it is, though, it just kind of plods along \u2013 and, when taking the other faults into consideration, it lets the album down a fair bit.\n\nMuch of the album consists of mid-paced grooves and thrashy-sounding riffs, interspersing shreddy as fuck solos throughout. This is all with Chris Adler providing a solid backend, David Ellefson providing a few bass licks to bring us back to Mustaine and Loureiro\u2019s riffing, and Mustaine bringing about a venomous vocal assault that provides bite to the angry lyrics whilst also providing additional melody to the songs \u2013 said venom, the likes of which we haven\u2019t heard since Rust in Peace. But that album presents somewhat technical and highly melodic riffs, and the songs are a lot more interesting as a result. On Dystopia, the songs vacillate between fairly non-descript chugging and vague thrashing with great solos, and enjoyable guitar technics. In cases of the latter, the songs are consistently enjoyable. The titular song\u2019s theatrics make it pop while \u201cThe Emperor\u201d has yet to leave my head in the four years this album has been out as of writing this. But in cases of the former, I\u2019m just waiting for a catchy chorus or for either Mustaine or Loureiro to let it rip so that the song can do SOMETHING.\n\nAnd it all comes back to how, when Megadeth are on, they\u2019re the main event at the Apollo Theater. Half of Dystopia stands a bit below the band\u2019s best work, but then that\u2019s a monolithic standard to try and meet, so to come close to that while still being a band for over 30 years is pretty impressive by any metric. But the other half lives and dies by the solos and maybe the choruses because everything else is kind of lame \u2013 just like most everything that they\u2019ve done between Countdown and here. As it stands, it\u2019s good, but I\u2019m also hoping that the Mustaine/Loureiro partnership can produce some truly stellar stuff in the future.\n",
        "\nThis is one of the classics worthy of its praise, and should unite both casual listeners and underground connoisseurs in this opinion. It might feel rather fruitless to review a classic of this scale at this point, but after re-listening to it multiple times lately and learning to play some of the tracks I felt compelled. Most of everything that can be said about this album was probably already said but I figured I'd give some further analysis of the songwriting and tracks.\n\nThe album fuses thrash with speed and heavy metal, and creates what has since then been recognized as the signature Megadeth sound. Regardless of how Dave feels on the matter, him getting kicked out of Metallica literally benefited everyone in the metal world because it led to the creation of this album (and the rest of Megadeth). The album sees Megadeth (specifically the line up at the time) working as a united front of ultimate thrash metal deliverance.\n\nSongs don't follow a simple verse - chorus structure, although there are choruses in most of them. Holy Wars starts the album in an intense thrashing mood, and in itself is a journey that keeps on evolving and giving. The rhythm guitar blasts you with elaborate and fast single note (as opposed to power chord) riffs, as a slower melody begins playing on top of it, before continuing into the first verse that Mustaine manages to sing while playing these quick thrashing riffs. The song breaks into a halt at the memorable flamenco-inspired bridge, into a power chord focused breakdown riff, then continues developing the song in a mid-paced manner using motifs from before. The song then picks up the pace again and blasts you with a catchy thrash riff with the first solo of the album on top of it. \n\nThis slowing down from and continuing into further escalation before the climax of the song is repeated a few times on the album, on Hangar 18 the song starts in a more mid-paced and melodic manner and sounds more like a heavy metal song before the band reminds you who you're dealing with. A similar thing to Holy Wars happens with Rust In Peace, being split into essentially two parts where the latter is an banging escalation into the conclusion. \n\nTake No Prisoners on the other hand is just blasting at 110% intensity from the first second to the last. It's the perfect thrash song. It keeps evolving and blasting you with riffs upon riffs, occasionally giving you a very brief pause that lasts for merely one bar, before blasting off into another riff. A lot of the riffs are essentially power chords - rock n' roll inspired lick on the lower strings - power chords with Mustaine singing every 2nd bar. It's like the guitars are having a highway speed dialogue with each other. Even this track that is constantly blasting at full speed manages to feel like a journey that keeps evolving. It never feels like a riff salad.\n\nThere are countless golden solos sprinkled around the album, by both Marty and Mustaine. They always fit the mood and intensity of the album and are tactically placed in ideal locations. I'm sure they don't need an introduction as they are some of the most known solos of all time in Metal (Specifically Hangar 18 and Tornado of Souls). There are occasional short bass interludes that are slower and more groovy, before the album continues exploding at you. Like previously mentioned, there are moments and riffs that show you the Rock n' Roll influence you can often hear peaking through with Megadeth (Think of the main riff in Killing is My Business), although it's still thrash/speed through and through.\n\nUnlike their main peers, Metallica, (Yeah I'm gonna compared them, deal with it) there are no songs that drag on for too long (think 7-8 minutes). Songs like Holy Wars and Hangar 18 feel longer than they are because they have so much in them and develop constantly without mundanely going back to the chorus just for the sake of it. Imagine how lame it would be if after Hangar 18 escalates into thrashing/soloing insanity, Dave goes back to singing \"Hangar 18 I know too much\". It would be so lame it made me cringe writing that. \n\nAnother thing this album shows, as do a lot of the more extreme metal classics, is how pointless and frankly shit of a genre progressive metal is, seeing as this achieves being progressive without pointless noodling and wankery, or inferior songwriting. \n\nThe reason it's not a 100% for me is that the first half of Hangar 18 is not ideal for me, maybe due to over exposure, as well as Lucretia feeling a bit below par (plus the weird laughing grandma in the intro). I am glad the album ends the way it does, with a really fucking intense thrashing escalation of the funky Rust in Peace... Polaris. I will end this review with a beautiful poem:\n\nChildhood is when you idolize Metallica\nAdolescence is preferring Slayer\nYoung adulthood is acting like they're all entry level garbage\nSage wisdom is to grasp Megadeth and the art of the Riff\n",
        "\nAh, Megadeth. Perhaps the best thrash band of all time and eternally destined to be compared to Metallica. Today they are definetly famous, but in the 80s they were still an unknown group struggling with their first album, hoping that it was good enough to bring them to light.\n\nAnd Killing is my business ... and business is good! probably met expectations, although fortunately they made better records over time.\n\nAmong the prominent elements of this album there is immediately the intro to Last rites / Loved to deth. The first thing the listener hears, in fact, is Bach's Toccata and Fugue in D minor, played with the piano and guitar. It is a pleasant surprise, and it introduces the atmosphere well. The actual song has a quick and acid riff, a violent and overwhelming trend and great power and catchiness. It is certainly one of the most successful songs not only of the disc but of the subgenre itself. The crazy and gloomy atmosphere is a huge advantage. The titletrack is slower and smoother for the first few moments, then accelerates suddenly, and the tempo keeps changing until the end. In any case, it remains effective, well supported by a high quality riff and a memorable refrain. His only flaw is being too short, only three minutes. \n\nThe skull beneath the skin is simply brutal. Slow and threatening, dark and suffocating, with a guitar that is more acidic than ever and an additional dose of sadism in the voice. The incessant rhythm and the abrupt ending contribute to the sensation. Rattlehead is probably the fastest, less violent than the previous tracks and with particularly successful solos. About halfway it becomes a mid-tempo, but then it accelerates again and remains constant. It is the most catchy song and in some way it can also be considered proto-power metal. Chosen ones is another mid-tempo that is closer to heavy metal. Unfortunately, in some moments it almost seems to go out of tempo, there is a sudden slowdown which is quite mild but not so much as not to be noticed. Fortunately, a good part of the song is occupied by a solo as technical as it is fascinating, and at the end the speed increases allowing to forget the small defects. \n\nLooking down the Cross, in addition to having highly interesting lyrics, is very gloomy, with a beginning marked by the threatening gait of the bass. The atmosphere is maintained throughout the piece, of which the instrumental part, almost hypnotic, is appreciable. Mechanix is \u200b\u200bbasically an accelerated version of Metallica's The four horsemen, and is officially its first version. It is a pleasant listening, given the excellent, fast and harsh instrumental structure, but suffers from the bland lyrics. The last song is a cover of These boots by Nancy Sinatra in an interesting thrash version and with the modified text. It is a successful experiment. The only problem is the remastered version of the album which has horrendous censorship. And not simply missing parts of the vocal lines, but an authentic whistle. The general advice is to avoid this version as much as possible.\n\nAs for the technical side, this record is an exceptional effort. The musicians are all extremely talented and competent, especially the guitarists. Moreover, Mustaine is certainly not known for the pleasantness of his voice, but the latter, in its roughness and violence, is fit for the genre.\n\nKilling is my business ... and business is good! is not Megadeth's masterpiece, nor the best thrash metal record of all time, but it's still essential and, although too short, an excellent album.\n\nBest tracks: Last rites/Loved to deth, Looking down the Cross, The skull beneath the skin\n",
        "\nMegadeth album vs Dave Mustaine solo album? The jury is out on this one, but the results remain the same. With Mustaine writing pretty much the whole album, the session additions of returning guitarist Chris Poland, Jimmy Sloas on bass, and Zappa drummer Vinnie Colaiuta forming the core of the albums lineup, and a myriad of other guests per song, \"The System Has Failed\" was Megadeth's rise from the dead in multiple ways. A return to form, a comeback for Mustaine after an arm injury, a string of lackluster material preceding, and the band's overall inactivity/breakup/hiatus/death preceding it. All these factors considered, it's amazing that this record doesn't get brought up more often. It isn't perfect, but it's DAMN good. \n\nFirst, the good. And there's a lot more good than bad. For the most part, \"The System Has Failed\" is fist-to-your-face MEGADETH. It's exactly the kind of riff-filled, shreddy, gritty, punchy thrash that makes them who they are. \"Blackmail The Universe\" is a great album opener, introducing it with politically-charged samples and the classic Megadeth neck-breaking, head-banging goodness. \"Kick The Chair\" is arguably one of Megadeth's best songs in the past 25 years, if not longer, providing a throwback very reminiscent of the 80's style. \"The Scorpion\", a complete outlier for Megadeth as a whole, experiments with keyboards, more progressive arrangements, and melancholic melodies, to surprising success. A bold roll of the dice that works out to a very unique result. \"Tears In The Vial\", a much more traditionally approached song, is a beautiful example of \"old becomes new again\", recycling very familiar parts of Megadeth's past without being a clone or a mockup of that material. It adds it's own flare while holding fast to the late-80's dynamic. The combination of \"I Know Jack\"/\"Back In The Day\" has one of the best sounding riff/tempo combinations on the entire record. \"Truth Be Told\" is an epic example of Mustaine's innovative spark, putting ballad-esque sections nose to nose with ripping riff work, several time signature changes, and mood swings in a little over five and a half minutes. Compared to a good number of albums of theirs, both before and after this was released, this is a major breath of fresh air.\n\nNow, the bad. Or, at least, the \"not as good\". \"Die Dead Enough\" is kind of forgettable, especially nestled in between two of the album's ragers in \"Blackmail The Universe\" and \"Kick The Chair\". \"Something I Am Not\" is almost a radio song, with very little to pull from it compared to what it's surrounded by. The album's ending tracks, \"Of Mice And Men\", \"Shadow Of Deth\", and \"My Kingdom\", are lackluster. Moreover, \"Shadow Of Deth\" is just Psalm 23 presented \"Megadeth-style\", and feels unnecessary in the long run. The other two aren't all that bad, but simply don't have the fire that the rest of the album brings. It's as if Mustaine gasses out towards the end. It's not that any of these rob from the album's overall structure, but they seem almost like overflow at times. \n\nWriting and production-wise, it's incredibly streamlined. Personally, I love that in my Megadeth. They've always had the ability to lay down filth, but they do so on polished steel. And this is a prime example of it. None of the instruments sound too drowned or out of place, mixed poorly, etc. Writing-wise, there's some suffering in some spots, but lest we forget that Mustaine wrote this entire album. For example, a guitarist writing drums can be a recipe for disaster in concept alone. However, he nailed it overall. A few spotty, aesthetic opinions from me don't really take away from the fact that this guy wrote out all the parts of every piece, and this was the result. It's pretty fantastic, all things considered. Lyrically, it's a political hellscape. If you know anything about Megadeth, this is their bread and butter, and it should come as zero surprise. I don't have to deep dive on this. It's calling card Dave, calling card Deth. \n\nSo where does this leave us? Megadeth/MegaDave put out a killer album in the mid-00's. It isn't perfect, but it's an absolute banger that Megadeth hadn't struck gold on since \"Rust In Peace\". I fully believe this is Megadeth's best album outside of the that era, and is a hidden gem in their discography, with one hell of a backstory. Mustaine may be a crazy s.o.b. sometimes, but you've got to give it to the guy, he can get down when he's in a zone. \"The System Has Failed\" proves it. It deserves accolades among Megadeth's fans, as well as metal community as a whole. Is it \"Rust In Peace\" good? No. Would it have fit in that era? Absolutely. It's the baby brother of the big dogs of old, and deserves a spot at the table.\n",
        "\nIt\u2019s almost funny how some albums are typical products of their time. Megadeth\u2019s Countdown to Extinction, released in 1992, is one such album. We all know the story: the alternative/grunge wave swept metal back into the underground and everything that was supposed to be rebellious and cool in the eighties was suddenly considered outdated, clich\u00e9d and lame. (Also, most metal musicians decided to scrap spandex pants altogether, so at least there\u2019s that.) In the following years, metal acts with a certain status and name recognition largely fell into one of three categories: some changed their image by incorporating alternative elements into their music, some didn\u2019t go alternative but watered down their sound to become more mellow and mass-appealing, and some stubbornly stayed true to their trademark sound or got even heavier than before.\n\nMegadeth fall under category number two and Countdown to Extinction was the album that started the band\u2019s gradual decline, which went on throughout the nineties and was only truly reversed sometime around the mid 2000s. Countdown to Extinction was, if I\u2019m not mistaken, also the band\u2019s most commercially successful album, and that commercial success was basically well-deserved because it stands as one of those (rare) instances where a metal band watered down their sound and aimed for mainstream recognition without completely wimping out in the process.\n\nOf course Megadeth will always be compared to Metallica, and much like the latter\u2019s notorious self-titled album, which conspicuously came out just the year before, Countdown to Extinction can hardly be called proper thrash metal any more. The difference between this and the band\u2019s previous effort, the brilliant Rust in Piece, is indeed striking. Mostly gone are the cascades of distinct riffs, the brilliant high-speed shredding, the intricate soloing and unconventional song structures, all making way for generally shorter, simpler tracks focusing more on melodic hooks and memorable choruses than a barrage of crushing thrash riffs. A widely known track like \u201cSymphony of Destruction\u201d is still a riff monster in its own right, but it\u2019s a rather concise, stripped-down, accessible one. Even so, this is prime \u201cBeavis and Butthead\u201d headbanging material and striking proof of Dave Mustaine\u2019s uncanny penchant for writing guitar riffs that are both devastating and insanely memorable. In addition, the lyrics are a thoughtful reflection on the corrupting properties of political power and the dangers of millions of people subserviently falling in line to follow an ideology gone mainstream.\n\n\u201cCountdown to Extinction\u201d, the overtly melodic title track, is a perfect example for Megadeth\u2019s new streamlined approach, as are other deceptively catchy tunes such as \u201cThis Was My Life\u201d or \u201cPsychotron\u201d. These songs are still heavy enough, mind you, but they almost certainly aren\u2019t thrash. Neither is the semi-ballad \u201cForeclosure of a Dream\u201d or the weird \u201cnormal Dave meets mental Dave\u201d schizophrenic soliloquy called \u201cSweating Bullets\u201d. The thrashiest and most complex track of the bunch is probably \u201cAshes in Your Mouth\u201d, whereas \u201cSkin o' My Teeth\u201d and \u201cHigh Speed Dirt\u201d are more like rollicking thrash-\u2018n\u2019-roll tunes\u2014energetic, catchy stuff that\u2019s fun to scream along with but would hardly have been among the highlights of Megadeth\u2019s previous oeuvre.\n\nCountdown to Extinction\u2019s popular appeal is further underlined by the glossiest, most polished production Megadeth ever had up to this point, which, at least in this particular case, is not a bad thing at all. Everything sounds crystal-clear, the guitars have enough crunch and David Ellefson\u2019s bass makes a very audible and valuable contribution. When you\u2019re aiming for a wider audience and increased mainstream recognition, you might as well pull out all the stops and go all in. Megadeth did just that and that they managed to do it without significantly compromising the, if you will, metalness of Countdown to Extinction is a testament to the soundness of Dave Mustaine\u2019s artistic vision.\n\nIn the end, Countdown to Extinction is catchy enough to appeal to a non-thrash audience yet also still heavy enough to avoid the dreaded sellout label. It was a largely successful balancing act at the time, one that, quite frankly, Megadeth failed to repeat with similar prowess on subsequent albums, which got increasingly bland and toothless until Megadave finally managed to right his errant ship. Whether Countdown to Extinction turned out better than Metallica\u2019s black album, or in fact the other way around, is the topic of another discussion. I will say it definitely turned out more focused and consistent and that if it weren\u2019t for Mustaine\u2019s idiosyncratic, croaking singing style, he may have had better luck trying to catch up with his long-time arch rivals. Then again, Megadeth wouldn\u2019t be Megadeth without Dave\u2019s vocals, so it\u2019s really a moot point.\n\nChoicest cuts: Symphony of Destruction, This Was My Life, Psychotron, High Speed Dirt, Ashes in Your Mouth\n\nRating: 8.0 out of 10 points\n",
        "\nTheir ninth album overall, The World Needs A Hero represents the final stage of Megadeth's 10 year neutering following the untouchable Rust In Peace, surpassing Risk as the most embarrassing album in the band's catalogue. Their push for a \"hit\" release at any cost started out rather well with the neatly-packaged Countdown to Extinction and Youthanasia, but the quality of Mustaine's ideas and his self-awareness went into freefall from Cryptic Writings onwards. If Risk was a cynical, corny and often irritating coda to the band's initial breakup, The World... was Deth's bland, unconvincing and desperate death rattle.\n\nApparently marketed as a response to the \"alternative\" stylings of Risk, this album nevertheless continues to dick around with different genres, thrash metal again an afterthought to radio-readiness. Elements of heavy metal, groove, grunge, hard rock and prog rock are all called upon in this dire experiment, as the band continued to lose coherence. When the band does incorporate thrash metal, it's usually unsubtly jammed in as a bridge to resuscitate an otherwise flatlining song. Tragic then, that the solitary thrash song on offer is the soul-destroying, completely unnecessary \"Return to Hangar\" - a sequel to the godly \"Hangar 18\". It's watered-down and sluggish, pathetically mimicking the original's structure for nostalgia's sake. As far as unwarranted sequels go, \"The Unforgiven II\" had some value, but \"Return to Hangar\" is a futile attempt at appeasing long-suffering fans. Creatively, Megadeth were dead in the water, and there was no Marty Friedman to blame this time around.\n\nAt what point is the band supposed to have regained any dignity here? Not on the cheaply programmed, orchestral ballad \"Promises\", which sounds more and more like an outro for Rozen Maiden, even with Mustaine's distracting, strained bleating. It won't be found on the banal answerphone messages of \"1000 Times Goodbye\", yet another angsty break-up song that tramples all over \"In My Darkest Hour\". And it certainly isn't present on the needlessly lengthy closer \"When\", a heavy metal track with zero urgency or direction, which laughably transitions to a thrash break for a brief minute towards the end. Realistically, it's not any heavier than Cryptic Writings, and features a dull production job that supresses any potential of redemption when the band finally does decide to showcase their skills. Like Risk, it is overproduced, but this time the songwriting feels phoned-in rather than unconventional. The one track I can stomach out of the twelve is the gormless but catchy \"Moto Psycho\". Unlike the others it isn't laced in pretension or melodrama; it feels as though someone had fun recording it. Mercifully, it is also the shortest track on the album by almost a minute.\n\nNobody comes out of this album smelling of roses, but Mustaine's vocal performance absolutely stinks. Obviously, the man was never blessed with the most natural singing voice, but his ear for raw melody had saved him up to this point, with Youthanasia being my favourite example, and the quirky So Far, So Good... So What! a close second. After threatening it on Risk with \"Prince of Darkness\" and \"Wanderlust\", Mustaine now commits to his spoken-word vocal style for a large portion of the album, rather than actually singing. He deflates any energy a song could have, and can too often sound like he's reading deranged, paranoid entries plucked from his diary. When he does sing, he does so in an awkward lower register, in part due to age no doubt, which most people have now become accustomed to, though it sounds as ugly as the man's heart.\n\nIt is almost impossible to believe that this album was released in the same year as God Hates Us All. The bashing Slayer get for that one seems mightily unfair whilst The World... sneaks in under the radar. If Slayer gave fans their worst album in 2001, then Megadeth released the worst album of the combined catalogues of The Big Four; an album that makes St Anger, Volume 8 and even Risk look appealing. Revisiting these post-Youthanasia albums all but confirm what I've always suspected: Megadeth and Mustaine are dead to me after 1994, especially since fraudulently resurrecting the band as a mouthpiece for Dave's misguided, shameful and thoroughly rotten beliefs. Mustaine should have gone solo; the band should never have returned, and this part of their career could have remained forgotten in favour of those first five or six incomparable albums.\n\nSpin To Win:\n\"Moto Psycho\"\n",
        "\nSo, the birth of Megadeth... It's well known that this album wasn't made to make a big artistic statement, to change the metal landscape or to even make Mustaine and Co. the household names they would inevitably become - no, this is in it's entirety a bick F*ck You to Metallica. You can feel it in every note, every spiteful word Mustaine spits out, and in the obscenely high tempos, brought about by a fan letter asking Mustaine to \"make his music faster than Metallica's\". The interesting thing is that it works.\n\nFirst of all, the instrumentation. Being the literal genesis of Megadeth, and one of the very first major Thrash releases the playing is raw and unpolished. Dave Mustaine's skill with a guitar is already near-virtuosic, but all to often falls victim to the sloppiness brought on by the fast tempos. Since Chris Poland plays a lesser role on this album, most of the solos are Mustaine's - fast, furious and rather noisy and a bit sloppy. \n\nMustaine's vocals are rather different on here, than on other outings. It's raw, really, really raw. The screams and harshness are very obviously the real deal, no control whatsoever and it's understandable that he switched techniques, given that the singing he does here is the kind that'll shred your throat in months. It sounds good though.\n\nThe bass is good, and is decently audible, with a high-emphasis on midrange, bordering on \"bouncy\" I would say. Ellefson alternates between fingers and pick here, before ultimately ditching fingerstyle completely post-KIMB. These contrasting picking styles provide a definite variation in both tone and playing. Gar Samuelson brings a great performance as always.\n\nThe lyrics are nothing to write home about. Mustaine had not yet developed his writing skills, and all of the songs revolve around typically \"metal\" topics, such as sex (Mechanix), metal itself (Rattlehead), death (Basically every song) as well as some satanism (Skull Beneath the Skin). This being a 20-year old Dave Mustaine, all these lyrics are written in a typically \"Dave\" manner, with songs like \"Skull\" almost delving into comically gory places. So don't expect any snarky political/religious critiques.\n\nThe production is awful. It's far, FAR from unlistenable, but noticeably poor compared to Metallica's similarly low-budget debut. That's what happens when you blow half of it on booze and drugs. Overall, the song list is good, with my personal standouts being the rapid-fire assault of \"Rattlehead\", the juiced up middle finger that is \"Mechanix\", the occult horror of \"Skull Beneath the Skin\" and the outright fury of \"Loved to Deth\" and \"Killing is My Business\".\n\nAll in all, recommended, just don't expect to fall in love with the songwriting or production aspects.\n",
        "\nGiven the more commercially-inclined, tamer and safer nature of Countdown to Extinction compared to its predecessors, along with its somewhat scattershot and transitional nature, it would only make sense that Youthanasia would be a more concrete change in direction, which is very much the case. Youthanasia is a more consistently accessible and streamlined effort than its predecessor, but this move did in fact pay off both quality-wise and on a commercial level. Youthanasia is not only a stronger effort than its predecessor, but it outshines nearly all of the stylistic diversions other '80s metal mainstays underwent in the '90s. It's a remarkably successful experiment and shows that the band was capable of making good and even great music that didn't rely solely on aggression and complexity. I'd even say that to this day it remains Megadeth's last truly high-quality album; Cryptic Writings has enough good material to be worthwhile, but nothing they've done since comes close to even that.\n\nYouthanasia takes the most melodic, mid-tempo heavy metal strains of Countdown to Extinction and runs with them for the entire album; there are no leftover thrashers like 'Ashes in Your Mouth' or 'Skin O' My Teeth', this is a heavy metal/hard rock album the entire way through. The songs here are some of the simplest, traditional and most stripped down they've been up to this point; but not stripped down in a fashionable '90s alternative rock sense - more by having very orthodox '80s hard rock tendencies. Verse-chorus structures, groovy metal/hard rock riffs, straight beats and simpler drumming all around, classical and melodic soloing and a very traditional sense of melody underpin the meat of this album. It would be easy to see this as a regressive, tepid and dated attempt at commercial hard rock based on that description but there's a lot more to it than that.\n\nUnderpinning this album's success is that *every last riff* here manages to be excellent. Despite, or perhaps due to, sticking to such a tried and true, traditional sound, every last riff is simple yet effective - evocative and ear-catching melodies are all over these songs, as are the memorable grooves these riffs have. For all their simplicity, the riffs here are remarkably intelligent in their construction, to the extent that they have the same sense of being crafted to perfection like the guitarwork on Rust in Peace does. Possibly the best example of this is the principle verse riff and chorus riff of 'Addicted to Chaos' - it's as if they were crafted with keen attention paid to the classic metal and rock riffing styles from years gone by. The leads throughout the album are rather old school; with a keen ear for melody and being flashy without overdoing the technicality or going on for too long, they consistently form excellent contrasting sections within songs or act as interesting details when scattered throughout tracks. The drumming is a similar story too; it seems simple on the surface but it complements the grooving of the riffs and is laden with interesting patterns here and there - this is evident from the very first seconds of the opener 'Reckoning Day'. The drums sound heavy and powerful and the guitars have a thick and meaty tone that serves this style of less nimble, heavier and more percussive riffing well.\n\nAnother consistently remarkable quality of the album is that every last song manages to be very catchy - in their adherence to verse-chorus structures and by writing the best hooks possible these manage to be easily some of the catchiest songs in the band's discography. Critical to this quality is that Dave Mustaine's singing here is genuinely good, possibly the best it has been and would ever be. Up until now his voice has never been good but it managed to work on the early Megadeth albums as thrash really just needs attitude, power and energy from a vocalist, while on the more vocally orientated and melodic tracks Countdown to Extinction he definitely sounded quite odd, though anyone at this point is used to his strange voice so it still wasn't an issue. Here however, no such excuses have to be made; while his distinctive snarling and kooky nasality is still present he can really hold a tune and pulls off plenty of great vocal melodies here. The album also shows off a new found emotive range and versatility to Dave's voice, with him pulling off gritty anger as well as he has before but also more sorrowful and passionate moments too, all while not relying on attitude alone to get by. The verses and especially the choruses here make great use of this, and while some hooks stick more than others every single song has memorable lyric after memorable lyric and excellent vocals all around.\n\nWhile most of this album does sit firmly in the realm of mid-tempo heavy metal/hard rock, there are a couple of outliers to give a little variety. '\u00c0 tout le monde' is the token ballad here, and while it can be considered a shoot for radio play (one which paid off) what results is a very poignant and touching ballad. Dave's lyrics while simple, hit hard and his singing is genuinely emotionally compelling; this song is perhaps the best example of the versatility he displays on the album. The song features an earworm of a chorus along with lush acoustic guitars and excellent soloing as ever, and despite its lack of reliance on heavy and hard riffs the song remains engaging throughout. 'Victory' is a more up-tempo track and the closest thing to a thrasher here - it's a fun little song that displays the same strengths as everything else, and its lyrics refer to numerous titles from the band's back catalogue up to this point. It's a more blood-pumping track that makes for a good note to end on.\n\nIt's easy to write off this album as yet another commercial effort in the wake of Metallica, or just Countdown to Extinction but with no holdovers from the old days. However, I think a better way to look at it is a refinement of Countdown to Extinction's formula to produce a more consistent work that succeeds where its predecessor sometimes fails. It\u2019s the sound of a band using their raw talent as well as learning from the past to fully transition into a new genre, while sacrificing none of the music's quality or personality as well as improving in some regards. Do not skip this one out, if you're after a really good heavy metal album this is it.\n",
        "\nOriginally devised as a Dave Mustaine solo album, \u2018The System Has Failed\u2019 eventually became Megadeth\u2019s comeback on multiple levels. Not only did it feature Mustaine returning to activity after an intense arm injury sidelined him for at least a year and a half; it is also more or less unequivocally seen as the first great Megadeth album since 1992\u2019s \u2018Countdown To Extinction\u2019. Personally, I think that seriously sells \u2018Cryptic Writings\u2019 short, but it is a fact that \u2018The System Has Failed\u2019 is the best thing Mustaine had released in a long time and still stands as the best 21st century Megadeth record.\n\nDespite bearing the Megadeth name, calling \u2018The System Has Failed\u2019 a Mustaine solo record is not a stretch. This is the first Megadeth album that does not feature bassist David Ellefson and all the compositions are solely credited to Mustaine. In addition, the album was recorded with a lot of session musicians, though there is a consistent core of bassist Jimmie Lee Sloas, Zappa drummer Vinnie Colaiuta and \u2013 perhaps most surprisingly \u2013 lead guitarist Chris Poland, who played on the first two Megadeth records. Mustaine being who he is, however, this sounds like a reinvigorated version of Megadeth, with a few exceptions.\n\nIn a way, \u2018The System Has Failed\u2019 sounds like an anthology of all of Mustaine\u2019s songwriting tropes. The riffy opening track \u2018Blackmail The Universe\u2019 bears a passing resemblance to \u2018Set The World Afire\u2019, the intricate, yet aggressive speed metal of \u2018Kick The Chair\u2019 is highly reminiscent of \u2018Take No Prisoners\u2019 and the rocking \u2018Something That I\u2019m Not\u2019 feels like an improved version of \u2018Architecture Of Aggression\u2019 at times. The nostalgic heavy metal of the surprisingly melodic \u2018Back In The Day\u2019 doesn\u2019t necessarily sound like any previous Megadeth tracks, but does highlight Mustaine\u2019s love for the NWOBHM movement prominently.\n\nThat does not mean that Mustaine is going through the motions here. \u2018The Scorpion\u2019 is one of his most experimental tracks to date, marrying the atmosphere of OverKill\u2019s latter day midtempo tracks with a progressive, at times almost symphonic arrangement effectively. Even better is the following \u2018Tears In A Vial\u2019, an epic heavy metal track with a dramatic feel that has familiar sections, but also a bit of a fresh approach. The melancholic and melodic majesty in the chorus of \u2018Die Dead Enough\u2019 may be more controversial, as Megadeth\u2019s hardcore fans prefer the band less chorus-driven, but it\u2019s an extremely well-written song that works very well within the context of the album.\n\nUltimately, the only problem with \u2018The System Has Failed\u2019 is that it ends relatively weakly \u2013 like most Megadeth albums. \u2018Of Mice And Men\u2019 is good enough, though a bit preachy, and \u2018Truth Be Told\u2019 has a bunch of cool ideas that don\u2019t really transition into each other all that well, but listeners will eventually mainly remember the album for its first eight tracks. Those feature all the tight riffs, wild lead guitar parts and snarling lead vocals one has come to expect from Mustaine. Compared to the rest of their discography, it would fit nicely between \u2018Rust In Peace\u2019 and \u2018Countdown To Extinction\u2019, as it is more streamlined than the former, but infinitely more metal than the latter.\n\nRecommended tracks: \u2018Kick The Chair\u2019, \u2018Tears In A Vial\u2019, \u2018The Scorpion\u2019, \u2018Back In The Day\u2019\n\nOriginally written for my Kevy Metal weblog\n",
        "\n1988 was a very memorable year for heavy metal, if only for the release of Megadeth\u2019s \u201cSo Far, So Good, So What!\u201d which undoubtedly, is one of the group\u2019s strongest efforts, crafting thrash metal with substance and passion. Unlike other thrash bands of this specific period who are trying to \u201cout-thrash\u201d each other, Dave chose to do the right thing, which is to write tastefully made thrash that would rise above the hoard of copycats saturating the market.\n\nAssisting and helping Dave on this new mission is former guitar instructor turned \u2018Deth lead guitarist Jeff Young, who is probably the most unappreciated \u2018Deth \u201csession player\u201d or \u201chired gun\u201d in the band\u2019s history; he may not be a Chris Poland or a Marty Friedman but his solos show noteworthy aptitude and feeling which other thrash axe-slingers have great difficulty conveying in this type of music. New-fangled drummer, ex-roadie Chuck Behler may not have possessed the technical chops of Nick Menza or the virtuosic approach of Gar Samuelson but he is very competent in his own right, as proven by his furious pounding of the drumkit on songs \u201cIn My Darkest Hour\u201d and \u201cHook in Mouth\u201d.\n\nMoving on to the album itself, five of the eight tracks stand out in this metal compendium which is a feat in itself considering how most thrash compilations are quite uneven, containing both great and not so great songs. Tracks \u201cInto the Lungs of Hell\u201d and \u201cSet the World Afire\u201d are excellent album openers, perfectly setting the stage for the record\u2019s blazing brand of thrash metal; \u201cInto the Lungs of Hell\u201d is an instrumental track much like Metallica\u2019s \u201cCall of Ktulu\u201d and works fine without any vocal accompaniment while \u201cSet the World Afire\u201d is literally a scorching thrasher. Listening to Dave\u2019s pissed off singing, you can actually feel his burning but restrained anger rising to the surface; the rage and frustration Dave felt after being unfairly kicked out of Metallica (a band in which he was a significant contributor) can be palpably sensed here and the malignant misanthropy expressed in this thrash anthem is readily understood by any discerning listener.\n\n\u201cMary Jane\u201d is also a worthy addition to the Megadeth catalog, possibly as a response to Metallica\u2019s \u201cWelcome Home (Sanitarium)\u201d, both songs share themes and subject matter concerning insanity (a favorite topic in thrash metal along with war and death); the major difference is that the former is a billion times better than the latter. Dave\u2019s song simply packs more emotional wallop and resonance than James and Lars\u2019s quasi-ballad which suffers from being a bit cheesy and juvenile. Also \u2018Deth\u2019s performance does not lose the thrash factor, keeping the thrashing element alive and relentless towards the end of the song. Later, Dave would revisit this theme on \u201cSweating Bullets\u201d but the resulting output would not be as effective (after reading the lyrics of the song on the Archives though, I think Dave was singing about a bad marijuana trip and not schizophrenia as I previously suspected, the cassette tape I had back then had no lyric sheet, ha ha).\n\n\u201cHook in Mouth\u201d is another masterful Mustaine composition, featuring one of the most brutal thrash riff to be recorded on tape (okay, maybe not as brutal as any of the riffs on Pleasure to Kill); the band did not require any accompanying growling vocal or death metal riffing to achieve this. It is also worth mentioning for advocating the fight against censorship and for criticizing Tipper Gore. The real icing on the album\u2019s cake though is \u201cIn My Darkest Hour\u201d, arguably one of Dave\u2019s best songs, if not the best Megadeth song; the track is possibly one of the most \u201cpop\u201d sounding in \u2018Deth\u2019s repertoire (the other one is \u201cTrust\u201d from Cryptic Writings) or rather, it is a dark, heavy song with a sort of pop sensibility (whatever that means). The track earns a lot of brownie points from fans for its progression and thoughtful arrangement; it is also one of the most heart wrenching songs written by a thrash band, penned by Dave after his troubled relationship with then girlfriend, Diana. While functioning as a sad \u201clove song\u201d of sorts, it also tackles the taboo subject of suicide which kind of makes it resemble Dave\u2019s ex-band mates\u2019 \u201cFade to Black\u201d or even Judas Priest\u2019s \u201cBeyond the Realms of Death\u201d.\n\nNow, on to the album\u2019s weak areas; the Sex Pistols cover \u201cAnarchy in the UK\u201d should have not been included as it offers nothing new to the table. Dave merely copied the original, note for note, without adding fresh elements to make fans bother to listen; to be honest, I still prefer Motley Crue\u2019s version of this punk classic which is why I think the MegaDave adaptation had no redeeming value whatsoever. Also, \u201c502\u201d is a really annoying hard rock song about drunk driving, which reminds me of some lame and lousy Poison song; not to mention the fact that hearing about the victims of those driving under the influence should make the song doubly uncool in anyone\u2019s book. And finally, \u201cLiar\u201d is just filler used to pad up the album\u2019s short (but sweet) running time; honestly, I really don\u2019t care about Dave\u2019s beef with Chris. In my mind, the squabbling in the band sounds very petty and vulgar. \n\nTo conclude, \u201cSo Far, So Good, So What!\u201d is the most underrated thrash album by Megadeth and is often neglected for their other much hyped albums \u201cPeace Sells\u2026\u201d and \u201cRust in Peace\u201d; it really doesn\u2019t get the attention and praise it so richly deserves since it is one of those thrash records which managed to break free from the monotony and mediocrity of a large percentage of 80s thrash. Young and upcoming thrashers should go out and get a copy of this album, to fully appreciate the intensity of early Megadeth; hopefully, these new thrash maniacs would be inspired by the music found within and form their own thrash bands, giving birth to a new thrash metal renaissance (not the \u201cnew wave of thrash metal\u201d crap a decade or so ago which is only a regurgitation of what once was).\n",
        "\n\"Hidden Tresures\" is 'Deth's classic compilation album (first released as an EP in 1995) featuring three cover songs, a few demos and several recordings lifted from film soundtracks. It is also one of the first \"proper\" 90s 'Deth releases as the sound here has that definitive tone and bite which can be heard on records like Countdown to Extinction and Youthanasia. The songs on HT are surprisingly and remarkably catchy. Mustaine can definitely write songs with great replay value and not just exercises in instrumental wanking (see Rust in Peace). Even the demo versions of \"Symphony of Destruction\" and \"Architecture of Aggression\" have a certain charm which the polished studio renditions somewhat lacked (though of course, the latter are better).\n\nMegadeth's cover of \"Paranoid\" is a commendable interpretation of the Sab Four's most popular song and is superior to their cover of \"Never Say Die\". Obviously, the band's version has a thicker guitar tone and crunch to the riffs, thanks to contemporary advances in guitar distortion technology. Still, the group made the song their own, with Mustaine's snarling vocal delivery and the late Nick Menza's muscular drumming. The other cover track \"No More Mr. Nice Guy\" is no slouch either as it actually sounds better than the Alice Cooper original; Dave injected the song with large doses of sonic steroids and his usual manic singing style, to give the song a major makeover. It is quite definitely one of the best covers accomplished by a heavy metal band. Another cover track \"Problems\" is kinda passable and decent, but does not measure up to the same level of quality as the other two covers; I still prefer the old version, as it had that youthful angst, expressed vividly by one Johnny Rotten. To digress a little bit from the main topic, Megadeth sure had a few misfires with cover songs in the past like \"These Boots\" and \"Anarchy in the UK\". What is wrong with the former is that it breaks the momentum of the songs in \"Killing is my Business...\" because it lacked the aggression of the rest of the songs on that album and had a different beat and rhythm. While the latter does not offer anything new that was already on the Sex Pistols' classic. \n\nGoing back to our topic, the main highlight of this heavy metal compendium are the songs from various late 80s and early 90s movies; I'm sure nobody remembers Arnold Schwarzenegger's godawful movie \"The Last Action Hero\" but the song \"Angry Again\" definitely sticks to one's memory like glue. It has a very memorable chorus and a classic MegaDave verse riff. Also, I haven't watched or saw Super Mario Bros. but the accompanying track \"Breakpoint\" possess a few proto-Youthanasia elements that are sure to please fans of that album. \"Go to Hell\" apes the \"now I lay me down to sleep, pray the lord my soul to keep\" narrated line from \"Enter Sandman\" but is a fuck ton better than that wuss song. \n\nIn conclusion, Hidden Treasures is one of the best compilation albums from one of the greatest metal bands. It testifies to Dave Mustaine's skill and ability as a unique songwriter. I'm sure when James and Lars heard this, they were probably sorry for kicking him out of their band; along with \"The Lost Tracks of Danzig\", this is an excellent compilation album worthy of any self-respecting metalhead's time and money.\n",
        "\nWhen \u2018Trust\u2019 blasts off from its epic rising introduction, it\u2019s easy to feel like Megadeth had slipped into a very comfortable and accessible niche with Cryptic Writing. Almost the album\u2019s longest song at just over five minutes, the opening track, displays all of the ploys that successful rock bands are allowed to play with: a steady riff, moody vocals, a great chorus that you\u2019ll be singing before the song concludes, a voiceover section, an explosive guitar solo, and some extra guts near the end. I believe I first heard \u2018Trust\u2019 on the 2005 greatest hits compilation and was pretty keen to hear the album it featured on. However, as you\u2019ll know by now, there aren\u2019t many songs on Cryptic Writings that sound like \u2018Trust\u2019 and, if you ask me, that\u2019s probably why it isn\u2019t thought of that highly. Megadeth (or Dave Mustaine more particularly) knew how to write great rock songs properly; he just didn\u2019t do it very often.\n\nYou see, it only takes until the third song for the album to hit a stroll, thanks to the country ballad style that allows \u2018Use the Man\u2019 to lope in. It doesn\u2019t swagger in and destroy the room either, but enters via a kind of \u201860s pop interlude, then mucks around with various additional instruments until finally hitting a stride with the guitar solo near the end. The album goes on in this way, wandering from one style to another, each executed anywhere between competently and embarrassingly, making it seem like no plan tied everything together. \u2018Mastermind\u2019 displays cringeworthy vocal effects over mediocre hard rock; \u2018The Disintegrators\u2019 sprints away on a kind of hillbilly speed metal binge; \u2018A Secret Place\u2019 adds sitar to atmospheric effect without interrupting the groove; \u2018Have Cool, Will Travel\u2019 supplements odd grammar with a harmonica; \u2018FFF\u2019 rounds things off with a riff that brings to mind Metallica\u2019s \u2018Motorbreath\u2019, quite probably by design rather than by accident.\n\nAs a composer, Mustaine\u2019s main strength is also his Achilles\u2019 heel. He gets bored easily: he tries to do something about it. Sometimes, that leads to amazing diversity and feats of skill, which were a feature even of Megadeth\u2019s debut and spiced up the thrash genre throughout the band\u2019s first four albums. However, he tired of that and decided more mainstream metal and rock sounds might suit him better, so allowed regular song structures and lighter influences to come in. Here, the diversity remains pretty much the only way to counter boredom, as we witness the simpler styles of sleaze rock, hard rock, country, speed metal, and even minor electronic elements battle for prominence. In the end, they more or less cancel each other out. The point is made rather too quickly, \u2018Almost Honest\u2019 rasping into the silence after \u2018Trust\u2019 plays out, totally changing the epic hard rock into a rhythmic, grungey song with heavy bass presence. Good songs are scattered around as if distributed by a grenade: a random assortment of body parts doesn\u2019t quite make up a coherent whole, while embedded shrapnel proves difficult to extricate from the blast zone.\n\nThe places where Cryptic Writings sounds best are unsurprisingly the moments when Mustaine seems most confident. If ever there was a man who could get high from the smell of his own sweat, I\u2019d bet it\u2019s him. Songs that express doubt or longing \u2013 anything except themes of anger, angst, and general self-righteousness basically \u2013 come off as half-hearted, ponderous, and meandering, \u2018Use the Man\u2019 and the flabby \u2018I\u2019ll Get Even\u2019 proving the worst cases. Aside from the mood, the production shares some of the blame, feeling woolly and powerless, as well as sucking power from the vocals, which really should have been pushed up a bit in order to achieve the rock goals aimed for here. That means that, yes, Megadeth sound better when playing faster and more technically, though little of consequence to the thrash metal past occurs: \u2018Vortex\u2019 and \u2018The Disintegrators\u2019 dabble with speed metal, the latter raising my pulse the most of all the cuts. Praise where it\u2019s due though, because the songs I prefer from Cryptic Writings are those where a balance is found between the accessible style and Mustaine\u2019s confidence. The super strut of \u2018Sin\u2019 and simplicity of \u2018She-Wolf\u2019 are both worth a gander, while the two longest songs surprise by getting the most right: \u2018A Secret Place\u2019 joins \u2018Trust\u2019 in a tie for most enduring anthem.\n\nCritics have already said most things about Cryptic Writings, so I should only clarify that, no, this doesn\u2019t suck; no, there\u2019s no thrash; no, the production\u2019s not great; no, there\u2019s nothing cryptic from Megadave. Mustaine must have been bored as hell when writing some of these songs and he certainly expanded his range with the album as a whole. Then again, looking back, would he say that he completely achieved his goals on Megadeth\u2019s eighth full-length? Probably not.\n",
        "\nMetalheads are a whiny bunch, so it isn't really surprising for crybaby metal fans to come running to the Archives, to bitch and moan about a stylistic change in a band's sound or in the technical aspects of a group's instrumentation. Such is the case with Megadeth's \"Countdown to Extinction\" which, for better or worse, is MegaDave's most commercially successful album. A lot of the so-called \"die-hard\" fans of the band diss the album for its supposed lack of thrash elements or it isn't \"Rust in Peace Pt. 2\". To be honest, such observations are a bunch of BS; at the very least, you wouldn't hear any \"Enter Sandman\" or some other half-assed \"Black Album\" type song on CTE as some misguided people are trying to imply that this record is the band's \"Black Album\" which is patently false.\n\nI am one of the few people in the Archives who don't believe this \"thrash or technical is better than other types of metal\" crap. Besides, such a logical fallacy is very childish and juvenile. People who look down on CTE are pointing out very trivial things such as \"it's not fast, it's not thrash\". Yeah right, whatever. They fail to mention that while it isn't \"Rust in Peace\" (which if you check out my review for that album, is grossly overrated), it's still a highly technical record, albeit accomplished through a more melodic approach. The music on CTE is still difficult to pull off if one does not have the chops or physical prowess over one's instrument. \n\nThe first thing one notices when listening to the album is the more streamlined structure of the songs. Gone are the unnecessary frills or the self-indulgent wanking that plagued Rust in Peace. Instead, we now hear no bullshit, balls to the wall heavy metal which isn't afraid to experiment with different sounds or speeds. The album succeeds in conveying a dark atmosphere which \"Rust in Peace\" tried very hard to achieve but without much luck. It is also the album where the band achieved a level of cohesiveness as a unit and a tightness of playing between band members, which Dave failed to accomplish with the other lineups. Of course, such a view would surely piss off fans of the old albums (especially, those crybabies who hold records like \"Peace Sells...\" or \"Rust in Peace\" in such high esteem) but really, who cares right?\n\nOn to the songs; instead of trying to create another try-hard and boring thrash metal record, the 'Deth boys were able to forge a true heavy metal classic. The best track, in my not so humble perspective, is the final cut \"Ashes in your Mouth\" which combines the best of 80s 'Deth and 90s 'Deth. The sound of the pummeling guitars and drums during the intro section of the song, will surely sate the cravings of those wanting to hear more of the old albums. Another section of the song conjures the glorious guitar passage which divides the two halves of \"Holy Wars\". so the song actually succeeds in its attempt to please the old fans. Meanwhile, those that prefer the new, neo-classical shred style, would however, find satisfaction in the harmonized, dueling guitars of Dave and Marty in the song's latter half. Not only was Dave and Co. able to channel the essence of heavy metal and power metal but they were able to exude the sounds with an unmistakably dark vibe. This can be noticeably observed in the title track \"Countdown to Extinction\" which is without a doubt, a real heavy metal masterpiece, able to go mano a mano with the best compositions of his ex-bandmates. In fact, it is the band's answer to Metallica's \"Harvester of Sorrow\" which makes Deth's fifth album the equivalent of \"...And Justice for All\" and not their \"Black Album\" (that recognition goes to \"Cryptic Writings\").\n\nThis definitive lineup was at the top of its game during the recording of the album; David Ellefson's bass is, as always top notch, and shares the limelight in the intro to the title track. Dave's vocals also showed a marked improvement; his singing is in fact, more tolerable and he actually sounds like a more talented Bon Jovi in some of the songs, as opposed to the nasal atrocities from his 80s recordings. Marty's guitar solos are also much better sounding than on Rust in Peace, particularly in songs \"Psychotron\" and \"Architecture of Aggression\". The late Nick Menza (God bless his soul) is also at his most energetic here as can be heard on the short drum intro to \"Skin 'O My Teeth\". \n\nIn conclusion, CTE achieves its goal of combining fast and moderate speeds in the songs and is a testament to the willingness of the band to grow as musicians and not get stuck in a thrash metal straitjacket. Thrash was getting stale and stagnant in the late 80s to early 90s; the move to a different style is definitely most welcome. Unfortunately, instead of creating a more well rounded sequel to CTE, the band came up with the disappointing \"Youthanasia\" two years later, which tried to pander to a wider mainstream audience (but that's a review for another day).\n",
        "\nCoroner never checked because he didn't fucking care!\n\nHoly shit I forgot how much this album rules! Dystopia can easily be summed up as a combination of everything good from United Abominations and Endgame combined, with some slight idea malfunctions. As an entire release, the most recent Megadeth record is an absolute beast! The songwriting is top notch like it was in the later 2000s, the delivery is smooth as fuck, and amazingly, the crazy extra production that has been used frequently actually enhanced it, rather hurt it. I don't know what the engineer did this time, but boy did they ever do it right. Oh, and there's a nice throwback to the tactic on Peace Sells with the heavy use of buildups to shackle everything together. When this first dropped, I was skeptical at first because hooks aren't as prominent, but once you spin it a few times and take in the overall feel, there's isn't much more you could ask for.\n\nSomething that Dave and co. haven't achieved to their full potential until this album was the ability to feel the music. Jesus Christ man, that fucking bass! Not only does it take on the responsibility for rhythms and bridge work, but it makes this all the more heavy and intense. \"Fatal Illusion\" is probably the greatest track on here due to all of this. The bassy bridge used, the terrorizing energy that is built up over time, and then every ounce of fury in the bass, guitar, and Dave's voice just dump everything they've got into a speed ecstatic kick to finish this track's delivery. Sometimes, the songs get to the point right away, like album opener \"The Threat Is Real\", charging the eardrums with a fret happy rhythm section topped by an angrily melodic lead section. It doesn't stop there though, the drums cut through with a much sharper blade, creating this energy that can be felt while heard. The bass kicks are on maximum overdrive to give this tank of an album even more ammo. Lastly, the super deep and punchy distortions used here add such a dreadful mood to this, that face melting is imminent.\n\nThe chosen title for this album could not be anymore fitting, as everything on this is about horrible global issues, the end of the world, remains of society, etc. This has been a popular theme for the band in more recent efforts, and it's really solid, but man this is where the sound truly matches the lyrics. Although individually this disc may not hold as many hooks as albums in the past, the terror ridden feel that I keep bringing up is what makes this one special. Even on the slower tracks, such as \"Bullet To The Brain\", with the cleaner intro, the bulk of the song is still drenched with fiery pummeling drums and absolutely hateful waves of fortitude. Hell, break into the solo of that song, and notice the slower whiny part of it is still absolutely raging on the kit! Of course, the leads then catch up to that pace and finish it off strong. Yikes is this ever a lot! The only real downfalls here are the fact that (as usual), a few tracks on the second half don't quite hold as much merit, and it's less hooky. Particularly, \"Poisonous Shadows\" absolutely sucks. It isn't the worst thing in the world, but it doesn't fit here very well.\n\nThe magic is nothing more than absolute focus on composition, and picking the correct musicians to fill the roles. The lineup is extremely inconsistent, but if it's what works, I say do it again for the next Megadeth record! And on that note, I just want to close by saying that I hope that there's another one. Even bands that put out consistent bad ones are never gonna make me say \"just hang it up\". Look at Alice Cooper, before Paranormal, he had put out a few snoozefest records, but that one absolutely kills! On the other hand, Dystopia is just proof that they've still got it. There's always room for another album, even if it doesn't turn out to be that great. I look forward to the next record by my man Dave and his henchmen.\n",
        "\nI'll admit, Super Collider is definitely guilty of a few sins, but I'm actually a little bit shocked at the backlash this one gets, and the same goes for back when this came out. One thing's for sure, it's a decent leap forward from the snooze-fest that preceded this one. This should be evident right away, as the guitars have a much meaner angst to them, and the opening track \"Kingmaker\" could not be more of a candidate to represent this. Consistency may be lacking in the realm of keeping the song structures the same, but it's all there in regards to tighter platforms, less slop, and bouncy rhythms. Plus, this one is noticeably less \"over-caked\" with glistening production work than previous Megadeth albums contained in the more recent years, giving it a more stripped down appeal.\n\nOne thing that nobody seems to mention is the fact that there seems to be some throwback-ness in Super Collider, and it's not only because of the production I mentioned. No, the riffs themselves dwell on the energy and attitude that drove a lot of the speed metal tracks on So Far, So Good, So What, and the aforementioned \"Kingmaker\" takes the cake on this. Man! I can't get over how killer of an album opener that is! On the flip side, the title track goes back to the styles on Cryptic Writings with the vocal harmony, slowed down tempo, and the flush progression in the chorus. Stellar grooves with hopping time signatures make an appearance on this disc as well, with the main riff of \"Built For War\" having that beating punch to it while not getting stagnant. Lastly, incorporating major keys despite the darker themes make this an interesting spin to say the least. Admittedly, most of these qualities don't jump out at you, and it may take a few rotations to pick up on, but that's the art of music that grows on you.\n\nThere are definitely some things that can't be overlooked, and I think the most popular accusation is the fact that some of the lyrics make you want to quiver. Let's revisit \"Built For War\", the one that I praised for having an absolutely banger riff. What it's guilty of is annoying vocal delivery, as well as poorly written lyrics. But really, hasn't Megadeth somewhat been guilty of this since 1999? It's a flaw, but it isn't horrendous. \"Dance In The Rain\" is definitely guilty of this too, but again, it somewhat makes up for itself by having solid chord progression, an amazing bridge, and the buildup that leads to a rather devastating outro. One more noticeable thing is the fact that the songs near the end tend to get a little bit boring and unmemorable. Seeing a pattern here? Pretty much every issue with newer Megadeth is the same, it's just that some albums show it more than others, and this one really doesn't as bad as some seem to think. \n\nBreaking this down, we've got a few issues regarding try-hardism, edginess, and some bland numbers here and there. This is nothing new. And really, this doesn't come through as blisteringly as it's advertised. Plus, there's that infamous Thin Lizzy cover at the end, which is a beautiful way to close the album. If nothing else, this gives you the motivation to power through those tracks that don't carry much flame on the second half. These other typical issues aside, you're left with solid songwriting, changes in mood, retro essence, and thunderous guitar ripping! I beg thee, please give this another chance.\n",
        "\nBasically, I like to think of Th1rt3en as all of the scraps that were leftover from United Abominations and Endgame thrown together as a big mess of a record, like a hot dog made out of pig scraps. Except even that comparison is a stretch, because I loved hot dogs back when I still ate meat. This album, however, I see as Megadeth's second worst effort behind The World Needs A Hero. Indeed, the inconsistency is one of the big downfalls, and the boring leads as well as uninspired riffs are what make it pretty mediocre. On the contrary, there are a few tracks that are pretty good the whole way through, as well as snippets here and there from others that stand out. But the end product just doesn't quite fit my definition of a quality product.\n\nStarting with the good, I'll say that \"Public Enemy No. 1\" and \"Who's Life (Is It Anyways?)\" are absolute bangers that clearly came right from the heart. Neither track has anything that sounds forced, and the flow is executed beautifully with the choruses breaking into stellar solos and really good rhythm sections. The teamwork of the drums and riffs lay some really hard foundation. \"Public\" uses a more fret happy and polished up tactic, where \"Who's Life\" is stripped down and to the point, which Megadeth almost always do great with. \"Fast Lane\" is also a decent song, fitting for those highway drives, and \"New World Order\" is catchy as hell. The rest of the record? It's spotty. Take one that hits and misses like \"Guns Drugs & Money\", where the bridges that connect the chorus with the versus are pretty fantastic, but the musical building blocks themselves offer almost nothing. On another note, the lyrics are also pretty stupid.\n\nAs a matter of fact, the first half has a lot of instances like this. \"Never Dead\" contains the best riff on the whole album, bursting through with furious heat and speed metal foundation, but the bulk of the actual song is is completely stagnant. \"New World Order\" is the opposite, where the chorus and intro riff are mega catchy, but the rest of it has little melody and there's no life to Dave's voice. This is still one of the better songs, and I somewhat blame Ellefson's return with a banging bassline for this track getting a pass. Everything else? Scrap it. \"Sudden Death\" and \"We The People\" are weak. The last five tracks are completely hollowed out and hold nothing memorable. In fact, when listening to this late last night, I actually fell asleep by this point. \n\nBottom line, there are three or four tracks that really stand out, a few more that have moments, and the rest is just rubbish. Thirteen songs was the band biting off far more than they could swallow for this release, and they should have just taken the few good ones and put out an EP. For collection's sake it's worth picking up, or perhaps a bargain bin grab. Otherwise, this isn't something that you need to focus on seeking out.\n",
        "\nThis one deserves a bit of a back story, so if that annoys you, skip this paragraph. Endgame was the newest Megadeth album when I first got into them, thus being partially responsible for my love of the band, so there's some nostalgia points being thrown into my overall rating. Funnily enough, little fourteen year old me knew nothing about the band whatsoever, and thought they were this new, aggressive, amazing band that had just broken through. I also thought I was super badass for playing \"This Day We Fight\" in front of my cousins, as if they really gave a shit. I'd later find out from my dad that they'd been around for over twenty years, and were formed from the only other thrash band I knew at the time (who coulda guessed that one?). So, for this reason, as well as actual musical superiority, Endgame holds a special place in my heart, and is easily my favorite non \"classic\" Megadeth record.\n\nWell, much like its predecessor, this completely focuses in on thrash rippers and a heaviness level that hadn't been reached since Rust In Peace. I already mentioned \"This Day We Fight\", but in reality, that is truly one of the heaviest songs Dave and co. had ever released. The riffing combines the speed chugging with extremely thick distortions and foundations that are reminiscent of being rolled over by a tank. \"Head Crusher\" is another one that fits this bill, but to be honest, the strongest feature there is the soloing. High screeches kick it off from the start and the instrumentation loses no momentum throughout the entire song. Chris Broderick's superior playing is all over the place too, if the opener \"Dialectic Chaos\" doesn't just give that away immediately. And the way that it transitions into the next track is just stellar. This dude and Dave make an amazing duo altogether, which is why Endgame is such a strong guitar album. What keeps this from bottoming out from over saturation is the minor tones jumping all over the fret board, as well as not making everything a reckless speedball. By that I mean the slower tracks are just as heavy. \"Bodies\", another favorite of mine, is far slower, yet doesn't lack any of the energy that the other tracks have. And that bassline though; so simple yet so thunderous!\n\nThere are a couple of standout tactics also worth mentioning that get buried below the surface. \"1,320'\" seems like a bit of a throwback, because it uses the same chord progression and writing style that was used back on the Killing Is My Business record. The mix here is also incredible, and the vocals are better than they've been in a decade, sitting perfectly atop the rhythms while not taking anything away form them. Some of the best showcasing can be seen in \"Bite The Hand\", as it's a little more of a \"typical 2000s Megadeth track\", hitting every target that makes this great, just in a more simplistic way; props for the shifts in mood throughout it, though. Lastly, this album without question just has the sharpest of hooks that they've sunk into the pond in the decade preceding. Unlike the other recent records, this only took one spin to really stick into my head, while others needed to grow on me.\n\nI'm not about to pretend that there aren't any flaws, because there are a couple, and it only lies within two tracks; \"The Right To Go Insane\" and \"The Hardest Part Of Letting Go\". The first of those two is pretty forgivable, it just doesn't really offer anything that interesting, and could have been left out. Especially since \"How The Story Ends\" makes for a perfect closer (and not just because of title). On the other hand \"The Hardest Part Of Letting Go\" is an absolutely glaring flaw that can't be overlooked, and after eight years of listening I still cringe. Ballads are great, I love them, and almost always defend them, but this one is absolute trash. His snarling, unsettling voice does not fit the soothing acoustics at all, and the lyrics are pretty stupid. What was meant to be heartwarming almost comes off as uncomfortable. Not to mention, this also doesn't fit the record at all. The rest of it is extremely heavy, devious, and tackles themes of war, new world order, destruction, and violence. This one should have been part of The World Needs A Hero.\n\nBesides that one big stinker of a song, and the unnecessary filler track as the closer, Endgame is perfect. In my humble opinion, no album has matched it since Youthanasia, and even that one may fall a hair shorter. This is everything United Abominations did right, except even better, and for those skeptical of newer Megadeth, I strongly recommend giving this beast a spin. Or, for those who haven't revisited this disc in years, consider a second chance.\n",
        "\nSmart bombs, precision guided armament, a more sophisticated way to end up dead\n\nOh hell yes! We've come to what I consider the first Megadeth record that doesn't leave me hanging for as much as one track since Youthanasia, nearly fifteen years later! A lot of the post-'90s albums tend to be solid with a few that miss the mark greatly, but for the most part, they all have areas that are lacking or just too many songs to not be able to recognize a bit too much filler. That's not the case with United Abominations, though. This one revisits everything that the band built their foundation on, and is probably the first full on thrash record since Countdown To Extinction. That said, the intensity that I've always loved about this band is on full throttle, the writing and erecting of songs is back to the highest of standards, and Dave's voice is the best it's been in years. There are definitely tracks that stand out more than others, but overall, it doesn't have any continuous threads of songs that get boring.\n\nMustaine had already established a reputation of spewing out political themes previously, but damn if this isn't where it hits the hardest yet. United Abominations is an entire record almost entirely dedicated to warfare, corruption, new world order, and the likes. For this, the musicianship is done in a way the projects a war-like environment, with extremely abrasive drum kicks and thunderous bass-lines, all drowned in a thrashy undertone that is, as usual, overproduced, yet menacing. \"Washington Is Next\" is one of the more ferocious and speed infused songs that conveys this image the greatest. The title track gives the same visuals through different tactics. It's a little more down to the nitty gritty, and tones down the power a bit, while using sadder sounding chord progressions. This paints an image of hopelessness, and failure in society. My only gripe with this is how much it reels in the voice sampling, which if you ask me, actually hurts this effect.\n\nMoreoever, the thrashy licks mixed with a more devastated feeling of an unsafe environment are brought on exceptionally. The opening track \"Sleepwalker\" is a very fun one, and it shows this mostly through the chorus of the song. Truly, the biggest gem to be offered is \"Gears Of War\", as it has the best solos, the smoothest flow, some solid transitions, and a very catchy chorus (seldom can something rest on that, but boy does it deliver!). Every minute from the suspenseful guitar intro, transitioning into the deep and devilish main riff, the gang vocals, and everything on top. Hints of groove make their way into the mix, such as on \"Play For Blood\", bringing on the staccato strumming and weaving those riffs into fret tapped progressions topped with more genius solo work. So ultimately, this disc refrains from being shallow, and stays compact the whole way through, despite some minor inconsistencies. Picture a thrash metal album with other toppings to spice it up. The guitar playing is definitely a standout factor overall. Those who don't like later era Megadeth, this is a good one to start with if you're reconsidering.\n",
        "\nThe System Has Failed is what I call an overlooked record that doesn't receive much praise like Rust In Peace does, yet doesn't receive too much hate like Risk does. But, whether you lean one way or another, this is a substantial step up from The World Needs A Hero in my humble opinion. Indeed, there are some songs that hold little to no value, and the majority of this is one sided in the sense that most of the gold lies within the first half. To break it down, if a couple of songs were tossed in the trash, and certain areas were cleaned up, this would make for one cosmic release. There are new approaches in composition taken, layering in atypical metal instruments and effects, as well as thrashy riffs being scattered throughout. Megadeth do continue on with the production and over crystallization of the guitars that was started on the previous release, but that's something that you can grow to overlook, seeing this trend doesn't die even up to Dystopia. Can we blame the far better song writing on the return of Chris Poland? Doubtful, since this was supposed to be a Mustaine solo effort, but his stellar playing certainly spiced it up.\n\nNow, in defiance of the first half of the album being the best, the exception is the first track \"Blackmail The Universe\". There's a whole lot of sampled spoken word and corny effects that really don't do anything, which has been a problem in the past. This layered on a hardly memorable piece of music makes for a weak opening, and I'm oh so grateful that this trend doesn't stick. However, other earlier tracks like \"Die Dead Enough\" and \"The Scorpion\" redeem every weak quality by implementing symphonic elements and soft string plucks to coat the songs with a nice layer of cleanliness, and really, it sounds ecstatic for a band of this sort. \"The Scorpion\" takes the groove to another level by basing its rhythm on staccato chugging without a super heavy bottom, and the way it comes through is surprisingly good. The only flaw? The damn spoken word at the end. This shit just does not jive with this record! All of this softer coating may turn you off, but the heavier tracks are still there. Take \"Kick The Chair\", with its dual solos that combine fret tapping in a melodic way and darker undertone, making for one of the best tracks on this record. So there's quite a few gems to be found within this disc, despite some of the insipid drag on moments.\n\nOn the other hand, the majority of the second half of the album does little to stand out and certainly isn't horrible, but it falls far below the offerings found in the aforementioned tracks. The song that takes from the bible \"Shadow Of Deth\" is another dull track entirely made of spoken words, which could have been left off (man, are we starting to notice a pattern in the main flaws this album has?). Others like \"Something I'm Not\" are just flat out boring and act as a shell with no bullet in it. I'll give the closer \"My Kingdom\" some credit for being better than most of the second half, and a dense enough track to be worthy of finishing this beast off. Another thing noting that saves the second half is the epic heart of \"Back In The Day\"; while not necessarily a super strong track, the atmosphere in this keeps this record from getting to stagnant.\n\nBy and by, besides all of the spoken word tomfoolery that litters this album, the only issues are what isn't there, as opposed to what is there; in other words, there are a few too many fillers that serve little purpose. No overly large gaps of time without even a hint of interesting tunes. No ten minute \"epics\" that deliver nothing acting as a gun with no ammo. No resorting to rehashing a classic hit that barely seems fundamental. And for Christ's sake, no fucking breakup songs that are meant to be emotional or vengeful yet falling flat on its face and sounding nothing short of silly. Just a solid and slightly experimental record that definitely has its blemishes, but is an overall worthwhile treat. For those who let this fly under the radar and don't have much of an opinion on it, I strongly recommend revisiting.\n",
        "\n\"I try, and I try, and I try, and I try, I can't get no, satisfaction\". That famous Rolling Stones line typically describes someone who can't find love, but to be honest, it describes my feelings towards The World Needs A Hero. Many spins and revisits of the first new millennium Megadeth record, and I just can't get into it. The previous album is widely looked at as their worst effort, but contrary to popular opinion, this is where Dave and co. dropped the bomb. Not only is it extremely boring with few redeemable qualities, it's also overly long, as well as containing some very stupid lyrics, and tackling emotional concepts the incorrect way. What's mostly astounding is that Megadeth have pulled this off very well in the past, churning out banger after banger in the '90s, losing all of the luster here. As easy as it is to blame the lineup change, the issues aren't in the music itself, but in the writing.\n \nThat all said, the first track \"Disconnect\" is a solid track with an eerie intro and a darkened heavy metal feel supported by a great rhythm section and a memorable chorus. \"Return To Hangar\" is also very fun, but it doesn't hold much weight seeing that it's essentially a reprise of an old classic, so it's kinda like that free bingo space in the middle. Aside from this, everything else is at best average, at worst horrible. \"1000 Times Goodbye\" is the biggest ear sore, as well as the easiest to pin the emotional concept tag to, done very poorly. The woman's voice with Dave's responses are beyond annoying, and the only reason it's almost worth the listen is because of the \"you know what, you suck\" part making me laugh. It's cringy, and frankly the rest of it is six minutes of filler, no killer. The closer track \"When\" is more than nine minutes of guitar doodling that hardly goes anywhere, and leaves me very disappointed. Actually, that's the issue that most of the songs have, this one just happens to be twice as long. Don't get me wrong, the guitars and drumming aren't poorly executed, it's just that they don't fit into anything worthy of being a redeemable track besides the songs mentioned earlier, and the blandness is what drives this into the dirt. So really, there's not much else that can be said about them, because the majority of them were summed up in one sentence.\n\nIn my eyes, this is the start of where Megadeth began to overproduce their albums, and even though it's somewhat hit or miss here on out, it doesn't save World at all. If anything, this only further spreads the songs together even more, making it even harder for them to stand apart. So really, removing the standout bad moments, as well as the few good ones, we're left with a super generic, average record that overstays its welcome, and resembles a meal consisting entirely of bread. Is it the worst thing in the world? Nah, but it gets old very fast, doesn't vary at all, and falls below average. It's worth giving this disc a spin in the event of a discography binge, or for the sake of completing a collection (that'd be me). Otherwise, it's nothing more than background music.\n",
        "\nThe bitter palpable venomous hatred borne out of a place of resentment for being booted from Metallica in 1983 was a turning point not just for Dave Mustaine, but for the metal world as a whole. I think it goes without saying that the bad blood between Metallica and Megadeth is as infamous as any feud you could think of in the metal world. Granted, it didn't wind up with dead bodies like with Mayhem, nor did it get the intense media coverage like with Pantera, but within the zeitgeist, it was probably one of the most important feuds. It certainly lasted the longest. It wasn't until 2010, almost thirty years later, when The Big Four (Anthrax, Slayer, Metallica and Megadeth) got on stage together for the first time that their relationship started to change for the better.\n\nIf Dave hadn't been fired from Metallica back in 1983, safe to say we probably wouldn't have gotten this monster. Killing Is My Business...And Business Is Good! (quite the mouthful, by the way) was released all the way back in 1985, originally on Combat Records. At that time, thrash metal was something of a fledgling genre. Like many well-established genres and sub-genres of rock and metal alike, it took its cues from older, more popular predecessor genres. Hardcore punk from the UK and U.S.A., as well as glam rock/metal, were tantamount to forming the genre we know and love today. Megadeth would come to be a part of \"The Big Four,\" the four bands responsible for popularizing thrash and making it mainstream - we all know who they are - and their chapter began with this legendary album.\n\nIt's clear from listening to the opening riff of \"Loved to Death\" that Mustaine's goal was unabashedly clear: make an album faster, meaner, heavier than anything Metallica would put out. \"Last Rites/Loved to Death\" is without a doubt the most ferocious track on the entire record. It sets the tone for the rest of the album pretty fucking quickly. And the rest of the album does not disappoint. From the second track onward, there's no letting up. Mustaine packs tons of awesome, nail biting riffs into each song, each one as memorable as the last. To say Mustaine was pissed off when writing this album is an understatement. This man wanted blood. He was out for blood. Songs like \"Rattlehead\" and \"Mechanix\" are definite proof that Mustaine just wanted to destroy everything in his path with all his might.\n\nOf course, he couldn't do it alone. He needed cohorts to help him with his Metallica-conquering ambitions. Without the efforts of David Ellefson, late drummer Gar Samuelson (RIP), and Chris Poland, this album wouldn't pack as much of an impact as it did back in 1985 and still does to this day. A majority of the solo work is manned by Poland and there are solos for days, if I do say so myself. The solo towards the back end of the title track is infectious as hell and blisteringly fast while \"Rattlehead\" is chock full of fantastic Poland solos that make any lover of thrash metal weep, or bang their head 'till they bleed. That part where he goes up the fretboard with Mustaine at 1:11 of \"Rattlehead\" is one of my favorite moments in all of metal ever recorded. It's just a small part, but it's so good that it just makes the song that much more rewarding for someone like me who loves harmony and dual guitar leads or solos. Even when there's no solos to sink your teeth into and you're just enjoying the song without them (which kind of defeats the point of the album), the chemistry between the two guitarists here is some of the best.\n\nWhile this album is insanely fast, it's also surprisingly tight. Granted, it's nowhere near as tight as their later albums would be like Peace Sells...But Who's Buying? or Rust In Peace, but for a debut with a shoestring budget from a new, upcoming band, KIMB is really well put together. It's about as tight as you would expect, however. It's sloppy in a few places, as is expected, but there's not much to complain about given the speed and dexterity of everyone involved in the recording. Like the breakneck opening riff and the frenetic, off the fucking wall drum work by Gar Samuelson on \"Loved to Death\" (in fact, all throughout). or the wonderfully varied performance by Samuelson in \"Looking Down the Cross,\" or the skull splitting speedy madness of \"Mechanix,\" or the tireless bass gymnastics of long-standing bassist David Ellefson (listen to that bass solo in \"Chosen Ones.\" Whoo!), this album is held together by the synchronicity of the individual performances all working together like a well-oiled machine. \n\nThe '80's were a fantastic period for metal in general, but it was an especially golden decade for thrash and speed metal. Megadeth's legacy stands tall with 35 years running and 15 full-length albums currently released. Mustaine's beloved thrashing death machine has had many adventures on the path to domination. Megadeth proved themselves back in 1985 by releasing one of the fastest and most ferocious albums ever released. 33 years later, it hasn't lost any of its impact or bite. In fact, it's only gotten better with age. The kill is still as potent now as it was back then. \n\nI'm going to bow out and enjoy the fuck out of this album in honor of the very first band that got me into metal. Now let's have a toast, throw our horns in the air, and rattle our heads to this classic fucking album.\n\nRATTLE YOUR GODDAMN HEAD!\n",
        "\nOh boy, the great divide is finally here! Risk is the Megadeth album I've most anticipated hitting, and as if it's really any kind of surprise, I actually dig this record. It's got a bad rep, and lord knows it's anything but a thrash record, but one dimensional is the last phrase that I would use to describe this. What it boils down to is an industrial rock album, that also extracts the pop rock elements of Cryptic Writings, and blends them in as a garnish. It's not, I repeat, not a \"pop rock\" record as a whole (more on that later), it just so happens to be the \"poppiest\" one I guess. Looking at the time it dropped, this shouldn't have surprised anyone. Only a year earlier, Marilyn Manson dropped Mechanical Animals, and Rob Zombie dropped Hellbilly Deluxe, two industrial rock discs that received extraordinary praise. So truthfully, I can understand why Mustaine and co. took this route. Sadly, the fans didn't seem to be on the same page, which is understandable. Much like the named Van Halen track, that was a hidden gem in their newest effort, many just dispose of it. This collection of songs is regarded in a similar manner, as it's gonna have a harder time appealing to a thrash audience.\n\nBefore getting too deep into the pool of electronics and echoed atmosphere, the air needs cleared on what Risk is not. As mentioned, there are poppy songs. \"Ecstasy\" uses very clean guitars and has a very warm feeling, and comes off friendlier than normal. \"Breadline\" is a more common one, my personal favorite, that takes a similar approach, yet also maintains a bite of crunch to the guitars. This is all well and good, but it is NOT a straight up pop rock record. Does this sound like Blink-182? Does it sound like Fall Out Boy? How about The 1975? Didn't think so, and if anyone says it does, then they need their head examined. Also, the fact that some people call this country? What the hell?! There's no twang, little acoustics, nothing redneck, or anything remotely country about it. Maybe, if we really really stretch it, \"Wanderlust\" has an ever so slight micro country feel to it, but that's not nearly enough to justify this. So the labels that get slapped on Risk clearly need re-examined, and may be part of why it gets all the hate it gets. No, these poppy moments are dropped here and there, definitely more than before, but to call it \"pop rock\" or \"country\" couldn't be any more wrong.\n\nAll of these glittery moments and jibber jabber aside, the majority of this is composed of hard rock songs with metal riffs that strip away the heavy bottom for a lot of them. Atop of that are sound effects and electronic tones that give this a robotic identity. This is evident immediately with \"Insomnia\", the way that the electronic string like waves echo throughout the song. No denying that that riff is heavy as fuck too! Vocally, the same energy is given off, especially in the chorus with the echoing atmosphere. Others such as \"Crush 'Em\" and \"The Doctor Is Calling\" follow this template, making for very dance-like jams. The famous \"Prince Of Darkness\" uses a lot of spoken word, layered harmonics, and a very dirty surface in riff-work. If non of this screams \"industrial\", then I don't really know what does.\n\nAll of this in mind, there are definitely some forgettable moments on here. Songs like \"Seven\" and \"Wanderlust\" drag on and provide the bare minimum means as far as redeemable qualities. The album in general could be trimmed a few tracks, and I'll also admit that it's somewhat inconsistent with its output. However, this doesn't bother me that much, as it provides something interesting, and basically contradicts the \"bland and one dimensional\" argument that others use. At the end of the day though, this is a solid industrial rock album that still has traces of metal and some pop rock inspired songs here and there. Certainly not a release for everyone, but bearing everything that I mentioned in mind, I think some could grow to appreciate it.\n",
        "\nIt would be easy enough to say that Cryptic Writings is just leftovers from the previous record, but the songs themselves for the most part are just a bit too tight to be seen as such. Very subtle hints of thrash are left, and the moments that do contain them are more along the lines of speed metal that's just cooked extra well. \"She-Wolf\" and \"The Disintegrators\" are the only standout ones I can ultimately think of, but this lack of thrash creates a wild misconception that many listeners accuse it of. Yes, there are some poppy moments that we'll get to, but that doesn't stop Cryptic Writings from still being a heavy metal album. There are a few drop-offs within this as well as overstaying its welcome a little bit, but that can be overlooked. Musically speaking, Mustaine actually avoids politics and takes a break on them for a little, which would soon be back in full uniform. Instead, this focuses more on struggles, feelings, and attitudes towards loved/hated ones. Surely, many a cure was needed for all of the hurt, and this record rips a lot of that out.\n\nFocusing just on the softer materials that were used in assembly, never before was an acoustic the main base plate for a song, even though they had been mixed in before (although \"A Tout Le Monde\" came close). However, \"Use The Man\" almost solely relies on this, making for one of the most touching yet dark tracks about drugs ruining one's life. Themes of disdain in a personal way are also more prevalent, which in turn produced some smoother tracks, such as the vengeful \"I'll Get Even\". But not all of them take this route, because the previously mentioned \"She-Wolf\", about a bitch ex of one of Dave's friends pummels through in such an angry manner, making it one of the most solid tracks on the album. Others like \"Sin\" and \"Almost Honest\" manage to hold the code of heavy along with drops of pop music sprinkled in, which wouldn't take the forefront until the next record. Whichever the case may be, the combo makes for a nice transition from the emotional yet heavy Youthanasia into the pop rock frenzy of Risk.\n\nAs already established on previous efforts, there's a sense of cleanliness to the new found vocal style being used, but this is where backing vocals and overlays are pumped out. That plan of attack gives that rock 'n roll flavor a sharper taste, making it a bit unique, seeing that it wasn't a prime factor in earlier efforts, but once again, I'm not complaining since it's still heavy metal at the core, and put together very well. Where this album falls flat is honestly the last two tracks, \"Vortex\" and \"FFF\". Neither of them hold any candles to the rest of the album, come off as boring, and really are what makes Megadeth overstay their welcome here. Thankfully they're both pretty short songs, but trimming them would boost this up higher, and \"She-Wolf\" would make for the perfect, ripping closer. Other than that, this album isn't guilty of any other sins. The remastered version has a few unreleased tracks, a demo, and a Spanish chorused \"Trust\". Interesting stuff to include to say the least. Ultimately, Cryptic Writings is a calmer heavy metal disc with personal schemes and rock 'n roll hints as well as thrashy moments, and minor flaws. Worthy of owning for sure!\n",
        "\nAlright, now I will admit that the step that Megadeth was taking away from thrash metal is present, even though so many like to blame the predecessor. Essentially, from Countdown to Risk, every albums takes the style of the previous one but lightens it up a bit. So basically, Youthanasia extracts the thrash metal attitude from the previous record, maintaining their signature tone, but leaving out the essential speed metal backbone that makes this genre what it is. However, it is still 100% a metal album. Not \"just hard rock\", no \"pop influence\", or any other stupid things that people seem to pull out of their asses. No, it's a metal record that's straight from the heart, and packs a lot of emotion in the song writing, with cleaner singing and less vicious rhythms, yet maintaining the dark tone and the heavy edge in the riff work. The aforementioned Van Halen track is one of their more emotional ones off of the 1984 album. And why would I mention this synth driven yet solid track from these rockers? Because emotion is what drove most of the themes on Youthanasia, plus it caused conflicts within the band, much like what Eddie and Alex were facing in 1984.\n\nAside from all of the jibber jabber of how this disc takes the softer approach, the idea of the songwriting weakening is a huge fallacy. There are a few standout elements on this one that helps this out greatly, one of the big ones being the leadership shown by the rhythm sections, bass, and drum work. Since Dave Mustaine has always been the main contributor/controller, this allowed a nice change of pace with the rest of the band to hearken in on stronger ideas, and thus, produced for some of the greatest rhythms ever laid down by the band. The very first set of notes of \"Reckoning Day\" shove that in your face right away, with the drums being a prime factor throughout, and laying down a solid foundation for the leads and the vocals. Bass work is more complex and audible in a clean fashion, showing a lot in \"Train Of Consequences\" the most, as well as \"The Killing Road\", and the title track being some of the bigger areas to capitalize on this. This, tied into the fact that Mustaine's singing voice has improved and soars through on a cleaner note makes for an easier listen. But the songwriting is still there! \"Family Tree\" has one of the greatest choruses ever. \"Elysian Fields\" draws in some of the tightest complexion and backing vocal utilization. And of course the more meaningful lyrics help. This easily breaks through on \"The Killing Road\", letting the pain shine through in musical excellence. So how people call this \"generic\" or \"poppy\" or anything dumb like that, I'll never know. The songwriting and beat construction is one hundred percent on point.\n\nThe entire other piece of the beast is the fact that Megadeth incorporate a lot of groove metal laced riffs, which makes sense, looking at the year that this came out. \"Train Of Consequences\" uses chord progressions that were dominated by the groove metal goers, with that chugging staccato like strumming as the basis for the track. The title track also rips into one of the greatest groove riffs ever written as a bridge between the chorus and second verse, and it's absolutely fantastic. Other tracks drop these hints in few and far throughout the release, keeping the whole thing consistent enough to understand the message, but enough surprises to keep all twelve tracks interesting. Albums of this length can get boring, but this one does not at all, thankfully. The only track that sticks out is \"Victory\", as it's a slice of cheese mentioning old Megadeth tunes as lyrics. I guess it's kinda fun, but definitely stands out some. That's the only gripe I have about it. Of course, as always, there's also some unreleased stuff and some demos as bonus material on this version. It kicks pretty hard, but the demo of \"A Tout Le Monde\" is horrible compared to the album track.\n\nIn the grand scheme of things, Youthanasia is another album that so many dislike for reasons that, wait for it, baffle me! It's just a hair below Peace Sells in my book. The writing is excellent. The heart-filled themes are well written and delivered beautifully. The rough aura of thrash is still present while not being the main component. They tamper with groove metal here and there. Really, I don't know what there is to hate about it. I guess if you're expecting something like Rust In Peace you'd be disappointed, but here's an idea; be open to change, evolution, and don't set such ridiculous parameters!\n",
        "\nCountdown To Extinction needs to be addressed and talked about from a different angle, because based off of a lot of what other thrash goers seem to bare in mind, there's a huge lack of musical understanding. God forbid any band lighten up in the slightest without getting attacked by critics who have a metal agenda in mind that must be followed. I'm sure you've heard it all. This album is \"mainstream\". This album is \"generic\". This album is \"not thrash\". The first may be true (and who cares), but the others couldn't be any more false. So Far has always been right behind Rust in my eyes, but to be honest, it's tied with this. Take away the hyper-aggressive nature of Rust, but keep the song writing at an all time high, and you've got this Megadeth masterpiece. Mustaine and co. would not have been able to pull off such a concise album in the fucked up mindset that was usually surrounding them. There's a Van Halen track from the Women And Children First album that speaks of the dangers of this. And why would I mention that softer yet killer tune? Because that fits Dave's rehabilitation idea at the time, and it comes through on this piece of treasure quite a lot (\"Sweating Bullets\" being the most obvious form).\n\nLooking at this strictly from a musical point of view, this is some of the best work the band has ever put out. The rhythms are some of the tightest they've ever written, and while the crazy chord progression and signature changes aren't there anymore, the melodic end of it is one of its greatest features. \"Foreclosure Of A Dream\" mixes soft guitar licks with heavy riffs and it all flows together so nicely. \"Psychotron\" manages to blend in solo breaks and bridges within the verses, without it coming off as awkward, yet so many don't see the magic in this. \"This Was My Life\" hones in on fret tapping brilliance laid atop of advanced rhythm sections, and all of these contain some of Dave's greatest vocal work. Seeing that Friedman had more of a say in the musical writing than before, this was probably another contributing factor alongside Mustaine's desire for change. So really, just because this is a step softer than works that proceed it, saying that it's generic or poorly written shows an obvious lack of musical understanding, theory, and what goes into song writing. Plus, the addressing of real issues at the time are all over the place, mostly political, but the self struggles are there too. Anyone else see the title track as a dis on the slaughterhouse/meat/dairy industry? Probably not the initial intent, but that's what comes to my mind.\n\nFor thrash goers, it's still a full on thrash record. All but only a few tracks are still heavy and have that driving kick to them. \"Skin 'O My Teeth\"? \"High Speed Dirt\"? \"Architecture Of Aggression\"? They're cleanly produced, brought back a notch, thrash hits. Hell, most of them even still cue in on that minor, darker tone that the band were so good and portraying. Anyone ever bash Metal Church for \"not being thrash enough\"? No! So why this gets hit for that, I don't know. If nothing in this review can be seen still, then look at the demos that this version includes as bonus tracks. They show the primitive form, and had every song contained the production of these, nobody would bat an eye. Overall, Countdown To Extinction is some of the best work they've put out, and clearly is surrounded by misconceptions. If we're not on the same page, I suggest giving this a focused listen. Do so with no distractions.\n",
        "\nGoing to war, give 'em hell!\n\nPicture a short, single track that barely comes to three minutes, is packed with speed metal fury, managing to cram in an intro, a worthwhile body, and a solid outro. Nicely pieced together, no real flaws, and an overall great song. This song goes by the title \"Poison Was The Cure\", and it just so happens to be the worst track on the world famous record known as Rust In Peace. Yeah nothing new, right? But that's the way I justify this being the number one thrash metal record ever made. Mostly, it's because it takes every single element that made the previous three records great, extracted those tactics, and blended them into a perfect beverage, like the greatest girly drink on an island vacation that you've ever had. Except there's no worrying about any egos with publicly playing Megadeth's finest work (although who cares about that anyway?). The famous, heavy metal closer from the self titled Van Halen album is another entity to compare this to. And why would I mention that crushing ear splitter from 1978 in a Rust In Peace review? Because that track title describes exactly what Dave and co. were at the time; on fire!\n\nNever mind the fact that the Friedman/Menza duo was in full form, it's the craftmanship of the previous musicians that make this beast what it is, and without them, our 1990 lineup wouldn't be able to draw from them. That's right, this utilizes punky attitudes and heated messages, builds off of suspense, and evenly distributes stripped down simplicity along with progressive aspects, and I think anyone could agree that this is the closest Megadeth ever came to prog. For starters, the track layout doesn't follow any templates, not even the short bass heavy marching tune known as \"Dawn Patrol\". \"Holy Wars.... The Punishment Due\" is the obvious contender for this, shifting time signatures and rhythm patterns left and right. Personally, I believe the title track does that even better, with the famous drum intro and steady yet speedy bulk of the song, fading into a mean neck puncher of an album closer. If it all did this though, it wouldn't be as special. You need those speedballs of angry energy and more accessible, as well as shorter tunes. \"Take No Prisoners\" is a great example, possibly being the best track on here. I mean really, can anyone turn down that buzzing bridge that connects the start of the song to the meat of these few minutes? Of course, the more famous \"Tornado Of Souls\" is probably what comes to mind most of the time, and that one certainly does everything justice too.\n\nAnother advanced technique beyond all of the shifts in tone and lack of generic assery is the placement of the solos along with standout moments on the bass being everywhere. I've already touched on this a little bit, but solos are used as more than just breaks from the vocals. They're used as short transitions in almost every track, they also at times take the place of a verse, and in no way does it ever disappoint. There's no need to go into Marty Friedman worship, his genius playing should be known by all by now. Hopping basswork and all-over the board drum kicks are generally inserted around these areas to fry it up even hotter. Unlike on So Far, which uses rawness to its advantage, Rust blasts through with a very clean production, allowing for an easier listen, and a more refined product. Of course, this version contains a few demos (thank God it's demos and not remixes) that allows you to hear them in primitive form. As cool as it is, the rawness is no match for this beauty. Plus, you also get the short, yet fun \"My Creation\", another unreleased one. So really, there's no going wrong.\n\nYeah, yeah, you probably all knew most of that, if you even made it this far. But nonetheless, my interpretations of this draws from previous works, trims the fat, and sprinkles a little bit of everything in to make it so masterful. I highly doubt every single person has seen it that way, and the next time you give this a spin, I encourage you to think about that. Mustaine say's he's mastered five magics, but truly, this is nine magics (and then some).\n",
        "\nPull over shithead, it's the cops\n\nYou would think that with the lineup of this album being one of the most insignificant and short lived that it wouldn't hold the creative potential and sharp hooks that it does. But by God does it ever. In fact, unlike most, I believe this to be their second greatest effort, and a superior one to Peace Sells. Gone are the suspenseful buildups that made things stand out so much. In place is the flip side, a more angsty approach with a little more technicality in the guitar department, thanks to Jeff Young. Along with this comes a side of more realistic lyricism, sending out the satanic and evil constitution that made up a decent amount of previous songs. More sophistication? Perhaps a little bit, but at the same time, there's a fair amount of chaos. The crazy lifestyle of Mustaine and co. was chaotic and reckless to the max at this point, much like David Lee Roth's character in the mentioned Van Halen track. And why would I mention this ripping ball of classic metal fury? Because nobody roamed these streets at night but them, and with all other things considered, So Far So Good So What is easily Megadeth's most punk album. The inclusion of a Sex Pistols cover is a mere coincidence, but a fitting one.\n\nSaying that this record could pass as a crossover album is certainly too much, and it's still thrash to the max, but one thing that can't be denied is the punk attitude and angst that this one holds over any other. A greatly overlooked feature, yet a solid one. For starters, the political lyrics that would soon be a staple seep in a little bit here. The rebellious heart of the beast and the furious context of the vocal work channels this through better than anything, from the hateful hoarseness of \"Hook In Mouth\" (my personal favorite), to the spitting outbursts and speed of \"Liar\". \"502\" is another one that greatly resembles this, with the punky nature of the riffage and the fractious theme presented. The whiny and anarchic vocal approach is at an all time high here, which shakes it up for sure. As we all know though, this is not a punk record; it just displays a lot of influence from the genre. The pummeling drums are way too metal, and the bassy rhythms and clean structure are far too thought out, thus, it's as thrash as ever. \n\nProduction wise, this one has a gritty feel that gives it a reckless vibe while containing adhesive to hold it together in a perfectly balanced way. \"In My Darkest Hour\" is probably the only exception to this rule, as it's one of the more mature tracks that came from the heart, and is pieced together very carefully despite being written in one sitting. Really, that just shows the sheer talent that the boys possess. More importantly, all of this is such a mix of inspirations that there's no one direction that the record takes as a whole, but it works because of how well the tracks still flow together, utilizing different strategical mechanisms albeit containing the same attitude. The only real downfall is \"Mary Jane\", not because it's a bad song, but because it's clearly weaker than anything else. Plus, the chord progression, tempo, and drum patterns are almost identical to \"In My Darkest Hour\", and this track could have been replaced with something better. Other than this slight scratch, So Far is flawless. This version contains four bonus tracks of older mixes, which is pretty neat to hear. Honestly, I actually like the production better, and almost wish that the mix wasn't tampered with, and four cleaner versions were included as bonus tracks, keeping the old versions as the actual album. To each their own I guess.\n",
        "\nBy now, it's obvious that Peace Sells....But Who's Buying was one of the greatest contributors to the great year of thrash. Being the most evil effort from Megadeth's discography, it was sure to turn many heads and reel in lots of attention. Very dark lyrics, fiery solos and ripping leads, bursts of speed, and pummeling drums are what this piece of golden thrash is well known for. Really, like Killing, there are underlying tactics that help drill this into the listeners brain and make it stick so much harder than the already blistering debut record. Dave and co. channel some of their wildest ideas from this time period in a very unique way here, one like the character described in the aforementioned Van Halen track. And why would I mention that ripping album opener from the Women And Children First record? Because that's exactly what was going on with the boys of 'Deth at the time. The cradle was certainly rocking, at an alarming rate. \n\nThere's no need to go into how wildly spectacular the solo work of \"Wake Up Dead\" is, or how evil the lyrics of \"The Conjuring\" are, etc. It's been touched on to death, and the message is received. The variety is key to keeping the record from going stale for even a second. Really though, almost every track has something in common that seems to be greatly overlooked, and that's the usage of suspense, build-up, and tempo/time-signature changes. The suspense, of course, is the biggest one. Slow, devious moments are implemented in almost every track. The bulk of the title track uses the same rhythm, and keeps it mid-paced, all the way up until the iconic \"can you put a price on peace?\". Then, it kicks into fifth gear with intense guitar work, only to finish the blow with the last minute or so of chanting the chorus. \"Good Mourning/Black Friday\" (my personal favorite track), does the same thing with clean guitars, a slower buildup of melody, soft singing, and then finishes with a transition into the pummeling riff we all know of. Using the same tactic doesn't get boring, due to the different methods of execution. The heavy use of bass plays a large role in this too, caking on another layer of suspense, and making a thicker atmosphere for the build-ups. All of it fits together like a thousand-piece jigsaw puzzle.\n\nOf course, you can't go into this without mentioning the early hints of prog influence. Though this wouldn't come through to its maximum until 1990, clear hints of it were peaking in 1986. Megadeth are not a prog band by any means, but their ability to shift time signatures and tempos is definitely advanced. Poland and Mustaine take turns delivering complex rhythms that don't stay stagnant, but dance all over the fret board. \"Devil's Island\" displays some of the best work in this department. \"Bad Omen\" has the the most fun and groove-infused rhythm section for sure. Of course, Ellefson's superior bass work fills in all cracks, making for a smooth ride from cover to cover. Repetitive riffs and chants are sprinkled in from time to time, and while that may not sound like a good thing, they always work. It's very much needed for the approach that's taken. A lot of talk about production is also thrown around, and while this version cleans it up a bit, the rawness of the original is definitely superior. The bonus tracks provide older mixes of half of the album, if you have this specific version.\n\nThe ability to take all of these different angles of attack; clean buildups, tempo shifts, evil themes, and speed recklessness and sew them all together in a perfect stream is talent beyond what most can display. That's what makes this record so special, and would remain a staple to their sound for records to come. The only thing that doesn't fit as well is the cover of Willie Dixon's \"I Aint Superstitious\", but at least it's a solid cover and it isn't bleeped out to death. As much as it would fit better as an album closer, there's no denying that \"My Last Words\" is an exceptional final blow, and for that, the inclusion of a stray track like this can be overlooked. Megadeth's best? Damn close, but not quite.\n",
        "\nBy now, if it isn't obvious that Killing Is My Business was Dave Mustaine's furious reaction to being kicked out of Metallica, then you've probably been living under a rock, and you need to do some serious research. It's no secret that Megadeth's debut was one of their messier works, with a much harder production, spotty songwriting, face-melting speed, and one of the angriest undertones to ever surface. But what really lies beneath all of the obvious features of this disc? What other musical forces drove all of the angst and pain of growing up in a broken family, living off of drug money, and being fired from the one light of hope in your future? Perhaps we'd never have found out if it weren't for the aforementioned Van Halen track. And why would I mention that classic albeit corny track from their 1978 debut? Because that very bass-line is what united Ellefson and Mustaine, through the thin apartment walls pounding on one of Dave's common hangovers.\n\nMany things come to mind with Killing, and most, if not all of it can be found in any other topic, review, or discussion of this record, which I so kindly summarized above. But a lot of things go missed, and the rock 'n roll and progressive hints are one of this biggest ones by far. Beneath the noisy screeches of complex soloing and booming shrieks of Dave lies many riffs that rip right form the early '70s style. The chopped up nature of the songs resemble a lot of the attitude that was brought forth by the likes of Aerosmith, just sped up and distorted a lot more. The tight rhythms make up the majority of what leans on this, but often times it goes beyond that, especially transition wise. Take the best track, for example; \"Chosen Ones\". While the early rock influences are still there, the intro to this one allows proggy fret licks to shine through, forming a series of strong guitar progression that goes out of the box, and leaves a warmer feeling. Budgie tampered a lot with this, and the raw influence of those silly Welsh boys can be clearly heard here. The chorus rips this in smoothly, staying a little more mellow, but still intimidating. Thus, slower moments aren't common, but present for sure; and when they are present, they're still glazed with a dark essence.\n\nChoppier songwriting has been brought up multiple times, and that may sound like a bad thing, but really, it works with the nature of the beast. The chord progression is broken up into chunks within tracks, constantly shifting tones to keep you on your toes. \"Rattlehead\" hits this pretty hard, and obviously so does \"Last Rites/Loved To Deth\" (that piano intro is a free-be, making it easy to detect this tactic). Most importantly, the bass in Killing is absolutely stellar. Yes, it's partly due to the fact that it stands out and is easier to hear, but what makes it so solid is the way it teams with the rhythm riffs and drum kicks. It's as if Mustaine, Poland, and Samuelson laid down the foundation, and let Ellefson work his magic into it (although I'm sure that's not how it went). Either way, the bass and drum kicks are strong enough to warrant lead breaks on their own, and carry a large amount of weight. The title track is the best example of this, especially in the bridge that proceeds the chorus. The weakest part of this record is its failure to sharpen the hooks as much as albums to come, making it take many listens and a great understanding of what's going on to get into. Plus, depending on the version, the cover of \"These Boots\" is bleeped out for the majority of it, and that's super unpleasant.\n\nThis specific version includes a few bonus tracks, consisting of the demo that Megadeth dropped before this. It's a neat little addition, although really it's just an even messier delivery of what's already here, and it's messy enough as is. As far as the actual album, most fans will give an earful on the speedy raw intensity of this mess. But looking beneath the skin (pun intended), there are a lot of overlooked qualities. The rock 'n roll nature of the riffs, the progressive weirdness of the solos and transitions, and the stellar construction of rhythms that utilize every instrument to form the foundation. All of this allows you to feel the anguish of these scraggy boys in heavy form. Is this their best work? Far from it. But there's a lot more to it than the credit that' it's given.\n",
        "\nMegadeth has had many hits and many misses in their tenure on the scene. This album ends up definitely being a hit, in my eyes easily the best since even before Endgame, their last quite good record.\n\nThe songwriting on Dystopia ends up solid, with every track ending up consistent in base quality and in overall sound. As a consequence of its consistency, however, most of the tracks do not end up standing out. This is not a bad thing however, as the album is fantastically solid all the way through, so one ends up enjoying every song, even if they do not necessarily stand at the end of the day. The album is a good listen end to end, and the consistency makes one want to always listen to it as such.\n\nOut of all the tracks, the beginning track, The Threat is Real, with its odd eastern-inspired opening stands out significantly. It goes on to be one of the heaviest songs on the album, continuing its standing out. Post American World is obviously the most politically charged of the songs, but the anger and purity of what is felt there is quite true, and it shows out significantly in the songwriting. It ends up coming across as probably the best song on the album, only challenged by the next one to be discussed by name.\n\nPoisonous Shadows ends up being the last of the most significantly standing out tracks in my opinion, with the alternation between slow and heavy being quite noticeable, especially with with the extremely tasteful double bass roll dropped in.\n\nAlthough not quite as memorable, the last few songs on the album, end up quite heavy and quite fast, with some being more punk-like than the others. This does avoid the trap that some bands fall into to put their rawest work at the beginning and leave the ending a bit too weak. This makes the whole album a good listen, not tempting one to drop off near the end.\n\nOverall, the album is one of Megadeth's best albums, being a significant highlight of their career. Only a couple of their earlier albums, such as Peace Sells... and Rust in Peace end up matching its consistency. It's one of their heavier pieces of work, and ends up being a quite solid piece of work. It also ends up being their most politically and emotionally charged record in a long time, which is likely a significantly influencing factor on its quality, given the correlation with Megadeth's output and such things. If they continue with this, then I'll like what's coming next.\n",
        "\nPerhaps unsurprisingly, Megadeth took a far more considered approach when they recorded the follow up to Killing Is My Business which, as we all know, resulted in 1986's thrash masterpiece Peace Sells.... The change is results in a more multidimensional, progressive second album, a noticeable reduction on the lightning fast frenzy than the debut.\n\nThis sounds like a noticeable improvement on the debut, no? Well, I don't hear it that way. I'll readily accept that I'm in the minority on this, but the debut has a certain charm, largely down to it being four guys on a shoe-string budget trying simply to be as fast and crazy as possible. And there's the fact that it's the album that got me into Megadeth, so I'll always have a soft spot for it for that alone. Peace Sells... however, is an advancement in almost all respects, but I just don't dig it as much as Killing.... Also, the song to song consistency varies far more on here than ever seems to be mentioned (no one talks about how \"I Ain't Superstitious\" and \"Bad Omen\" are a lot worse than ever other track, for example).\n\nThat said, when this album gets it right, then hooooly shit. \"The Conjuring\" transports you right to a Satanic ritual, with some of the most badass lyrics in metal history (the opening line, the title of this review, is a particular highlight), and the music to match, all at once apprehensive and undeniably thrashy once you get into the meat of the track. \"Devil's Island\" is more of the same, with tempo more reminiscent of the debut, driving guitars and vivid lyrics telling the tale of a man spared execution by God, though he has to live on an island for the rest of his life. Actually, that is a real highlight on this album: the lyrics. Every lyric written for this album is pure, unadulterated badassery in lyric form (even the unintentional hilarity of how much like \"Nipples Island\" the final refrain of \"Devil's Island\" sounds). Particular praise in that respect goes to \"The Conjuring,\" \"Black Friday\" and the sardonic title track.\n\nMusically, this album has far more diversity than Killing. Mustaine's singing has noticeably developed, for one thing. In addition to his now-signature nasal snarl from the debut, he now adds a sinister low-pitched tone, for use on songs such as \"Wake Up Dead\" and \"The Conjuring\". Ellefson has also been cranked up further in the mix, and boy can he play. He adds loads of fills all over the place, and just listen to his thunderous work on the closer \"My Last Words.\" Mustaine and Poland continue to have riffs, leads and solos for days: listen to the fervour and technicality on display in \"Wake Up Dead,\" a song which is an brilliant example of the genius of the Mustaine/Poland duo They positively rip through this album, and perhaps the ultimate testament to Peace Sells' brilliance: every damn guitar line on here is memorable. And Gar Samuelson has the opportunity to lay down more killer grooves than he did on the debut, and equal amounts of high-speed insanity, so there's that. What else can I say about him, excepting genius?\n\nA note to add: if, like me, you have the Capitol remaster from 2004, you get four Randy Burns mixes, which essentially are the same but with even more prominent bass, and a louder, fuller snare sound. There's also a minor change to the arrangement of the title track: the music doesn't stop for the \"If there's a new way...\" line. That's about it. To wrap up: the highs are infinitely higher than those of Killing, but the lows also lower. It's a much better album when it gets it right, but there's still a couple of expendable tracks here. The way I see it, there are two kinds of Megadeth fans: those who prefer this, and those who prefer Rust in Peace. And while Peace Sells... is a damn fine album, I'm in the Rust camp all day.\n",
        "\n1986 may have been the year that thrash reached new heights for extremity and speed, what with Reign in Blood, Pleasure to Kill and Darkness Descends pushing the genre further into the murky depths that would eventually evolve into death metal, but a year earlier we had Megadeth's debut record, which can be called a definite precursor to those three albums, and even a catalyst for the growth of the more extreme side of thrash in general, with pure anger and levels of speed and technicality that were insane for 1985.\n\nWe all know the story of Dave Mustaine's less than harmonious split with Metallica (after writing the two best songs on their debut, no less), and the essential thing to take from this is that he wasn't a happy bunny afterwards and founded Megadeth to \"destroy Metallica\". Of course, it was no matter that in 1984 Metallica had released one of the best metal albums of all time, since it is widely known that speed + anger = destruction.\n\nThe upshot of this is an album on which Dave and his most technically proficient line-up play rings around anything his former band had recorded up to that point, but are somewhat caught lacking in terms of variation here. That's not to say that this massively detracts from this as a whole, 'cos I like this album a whole damn bunch. In fact, I'd say I like this the most of their pre-Rust in Peace offerings.\n\nMusically, Killing is My Business... goes straight for the jugular. More or less everything here moves along at breakneck speed, with the exception of the intros to three songs, and by and large this works to great effect (see \"Chosen Ones\"). Mustaine and his colleague Chris Poland rip through these 31 minutes armed with a legion of incendiary riffs and leads (\"Rattlehead\" in particular), the eternally talented Gar Samuelson blasts along happily underneath them, and Ellefson can be easily heard thumping along in the background. He isn't quite afforded the prominence he gets on Peace Sells or later efforts, but he's still far less buried in the mix than a majority of bassists. His performance is also a lot simpler here than on this album's immediate successor, with no real fills or solo spots, with the sole exception being at the end of \"Chosen Ones\".\n\nBut none of those things define the album. Nope, this album is predictably defined by the love-em-or-hate-em vocals of Dave Mustaine. He snarls and growls his way through here with as much boundless energy as the music. Personally, I'm all for Dave's vocals, particularly on here, where he spits out things like the chorus of \"Loved to Deth\" and the title track with such ferocity that it's nigh impossible to deny that he suits the music perfectly, and even has his own charm here, despite the vocals themselves being undeniably pretty poor.\n\nNotably, when Megadeth decide to cool off temporarily with the speed, they deliver what is hands-down the best track on the album, \"Looking Down the Cross\" (which, incidentally, plays as I write this). A dissonant guitar intro gradually builds to a rhythm and foreboding intro, with lower register vocals from Mustaine, and it speeds up, though only to a midpace. In fact, the band only ever semi-thrashes with this one, and this happens well after the halfway point. And yet, it remains one of my all-time favourite Megadeth songs. Which just goes to show, you don't necessarily need speed, kids. \n\nThere's only one real negative I can point to on this release, and it's the inclusion of \"These Boots.\" Quite why it's here is beyond me: did Mustaine really not expect someone in the Sinatra camp to not take issue with his, ehm, \"alterations\" (I mean, it was the guy who wrote it that got pissed but still) and as a result I get a version with a good 60% of the lyrics replaced by an annoying bleep. Now this isn't really an issue with the original album, but why include it on a remaster in a form so ridiculously censored? Actually, by 2002 Megadeth were rich enough that they could, I'm sure, have settled with the writer to use the full lyrics or something. Oh well. Point is, it really drags things down.\n\nOne final parting thought: upon exploration, I discovered \"Mechanix,\" a song I consider pretty fucking fast only clocks in at 129 bpm. I say \"only\" because I would soon after discover that the Sisters of Mercy's \"Walk Away\" is 136 bpm. So maybe this album isn't as fast as it seems. Or maybe the amphetamines really kicked in when Andrew Eldritch was writing that one. Who knows? Anyway, this is a great fucking Megadeth release, which in my humble opinion is even better than their legendary sophomore. Essential listening for self-respecting thrasher.\n",
        "\nI wasn't a metalhead when\u00a0Super Collider\u00a0came out.\u00a0 In fact, I had only gotten into metal the year before\u00a0Dystopia.\u00a0 When Megadeth announced their fifteenth studio album, I was pretty cynical.\u00a0 I have no clue why I wasn't as naive as most other young metalheads.\u00a0 I guess I just assumed it would be bad because it was a later album from a popular band and I was under the impression that only the first several albums could be good (my opinions used to be highly influenced by the average scores albums received on the Metal Archives).\n\nIt was my birthday (or something like that) and one of my gifts was this album.\u00a0 I was excited nevertheless because who doesn't like being gifted new music.\u00a0 I didn't even have to pay, so it didn't matter if it was good or bad at that point.\u00a0 After spinning it, I was pleasantly surprised to enjoy the album.\u00a0 And I still put in on the player to this day.\n\nDystopia is a very nice checkpoint in Megadeth's discography.\u00a0 It has an album cover that is nice to look at, the riffs are all relatively fresh, and the good tracks are pretty evenly spread throughout the album.\u00a0 There are only a couple of tracks that I don't particularly enjoy, specifically \"The Emperor,\" \"Post-American World,\" and \"Bullet to the Brain.\"\u00a0 I also don't like the cover, but that's just because it's a bad song in general, not because of Megadeth.\n\nTo start things off, this album is, like I said, a nice break, especially as Megadeth's previous album,\u00a0Super Collider, was pretty awful.\u00a0 The album starts off with technicality that can be traced back to\u00a0Rust in Peace and riffage that is similar to that on\u00a0United Abominations.\u00a0 Examples of this technicality are \"Poisonous Shadows,\" \"The Threat Is Real,\" and \"Fatal Illusion.\"\u00a0 \"Poisonous Shadows\" is an interesting track.\u00a0 Combining orchestral-sounding background noises with thrash metal, it's actually a pretty good song.\u00a0 The riffs are great, but once the verses start, they become pretty mediocre, causing the vocals to be the driving force.\u00a0 \"The Threat Is Real\" and \"Fatal Illusion\" both have great riffs and themes, proving that Megadeth can still do what they're known for.\n\nNot only have the riffs gotten better, but the lyrics have also improved.\u00a0 The lyrical themes are like that of their 2007 release: politics.\u00a0 This is another aspect of this album that is a plus.\u00a0 The lyrics are well-written.\u00a0 I may not agree with them, but it doesn't take an idiot to know that these are good lyrics, something that their last several albums lacked.\u00a0 The only lyrical segment I don't enjoy is the spoken-word outro of \"Poisonous Shadows.\"\u00a0 Despite the spoken-word, the piano is awesome.\n\nThis album is a huge improvement.\u00a0 The solos have emotion and feeling, the instrumental, \"Conquer or Die,\" is completely badass, and the songwriting is much better.\u00a0 But, of course, like any recent Megadeth album, there are flaws.\u00a0 \"The Emperor\" is a pretty big one.\u00a0 The riffs and lyrics on this track are pretty lame.\u00a0 I mean, what were they thinking when they wrote these riffs?\u00a0 Sure, they can be okay at times, but it's way too repetitive for my liking.\u00a0 In total, this song sounds like a lost recording from\u00a0Cryptic Writings.\n\n\"Poisonous Shadows\" is a pretty popular song, but I can never get into it.\u00a0 It sounds like something off\u00a0The System Has Failed with it's cheesy, melodic chorus and boring, chuggy riffs.\u00a0 Even the background noises are annoying to me, reminding me of the industrial dabblings that seem to be scattered throughout their discography.\u00a0 The lyrics are fine, the structure is okay, but the track as a whole is very disappointing.\n\nMegadeth have made yet another comeback.\u00a0 At this point, I really don't know what to expect from these guys because their entire discography up to this point has been hit or miss.\u00a0 But, despite some small flaws,\u00a0Dystopia\u00a0is definitely a hit.\n\nOverall Rating: 86%\n\nOriginally written for themetalvoid.wordpress.com\n",

        "\nA lot of things happened to Dave Mustaine between 2001 and 2004. Of course, a lot of things happen to Dave Mustaine every year, but these are pretty big things, even in the context of a man who self-supported as a drug dealer at age 15 and has possibly (if he can actually keep count) been to rehab 17 times. One of the things that happened during that three-year period is that Mustaine allegedly took a nap, slept with his arm hooked over the back of a chair, then woke up to find he couldn't move his fingers or make a fist. He couldn't play guitar, which is rather a problem for a man better known as a guitarist than a vocalist. He was also getting sick of his band (a recurrent theme in Megadeth history), so decided that it would be better to break up than go on. During this time, Mustaine became a Christian, which seems to be a product of one AA meeting too many - or too few, who knows. In any case, his arm recovered, but by that point he had decided that he didn't want to play 'The Conjuring' live anymore. And then, Mustaine got it back together and thought that maybe making a solo album wouldn't be such a bad idea.\n\nThat context both does and doesn't explain why The System Has Failed sounds the way it does. On the one hand, this is slightly more focused than the sprawling The World Needs a Hero from three years earlier, yet it also experiments with the sound of more traditional rock and non-specific heavy metal, a trend which Mustaine began in the late '90s with Cryptic Writings. Therefore, this doesn't go off the beaten track as one might imagine from a solo album (the label urged a release under the band's name to fulfill a contract) despite the fact that Chris Poland was the only memento of days past. Barring the excerpt from Psalm 23 in 'Shadow of Deth', the Christianity doesn't make itself felt very much, since Dave is still sceptical about the government and imagining ways for them to get killed: the opening news snippet about an Air Force One disaster doesn't seem to be a very charitable sentiment, although there are different kinds of Christian I suppose. Basically, this just seems like a natural step on Megadeth's wandering path from '90s success back to '00s relevance.\n\nAs for the radial neuropathy, it doesn't impact very much on the guitar style. Perhaps Chris Poland was relied on more than usual for solos, though there hadn't been much in the way of shredding or melodic mastery in the preceding 10 years anyway, while the absence of thrash metal in any form is an accurate indicator of the complexity of the riffs. Many of the songs take a relaxed approach to metal, some like 'Of Mice and Men' and 'Die Dead Enough' falling closer to hard rock with a steady drumming pace, some nostalgic and inspiring vocals respectively, plus a couple of gently winding riffs that aren't too difficult to play. These two were released as music videos, so are fairly representative of what the album was aiming for. There are heavier songs that go some way to suggesting that there were still the smoulderings of Rust in Peace lurking under the surface, though 'Kick the Chair', 'Back in the Day', and 'Blackmail the Universe' are only the MTV versions of thrash metal rather than anything approaching the real thing. However, despite 'Back in the Day' proving a creditable take on melodic speed metal, I suspect that the purpose of that song and the whole album wasn't to excite fans of late '80s thrash but just to play something Dave likes, which - quite clearly - isn't all about thrash metal.\n\nOne of the interesting feelings I get from this album is a sense of nostalgia from some of the songs. It was a definite feature on two highlights of the previous album, '1000 Times Goodbye' and 'Promises', and a positive idea to return to that atmosphere with the strings at the beginning of 'The Scorpion', the keyboards and Hammond organ that crops up at times, plus the lyrical themes prevalent in the second half of the record. In fact, the solos Poland peels off are wide of the mark on some of these tracks, seeing as they are slightly too technical and attacking, meaning it might have been a plan to tone down the guitar work in order to match the moods of 'Something That I'm Not' and 'Truth Be Told'. It's also a matter of instrumental settings, the tone of the guitars being too aggressive for that reflective vibe, while I'm not convinced that the band knew where to angle their energy because making a truly different album would have alienated too many old fans. On that score, 'Tears in a Vial' gets perhaps the most distance out of the \"ponderous Megadeth\" style, while 'Die Dead Enough' is just a catchy song on its own terms.\n\nI feel it's somewhat of a shame that Mustaine didn't allow himself to make the album he wanted to with The System Has Failed. This feels like there was a novel direction prepared, but then label pressure and considerations of income caused it to be shoehorned into a more typical set of songs to appease all parties. In the end, this is a fairly poor effort because of the mismatch of styles impeding total enjoyment, though it does have its moments and isn't a redundant recording by any means. It would be inaccurate to say that the system had failed - this is more like a reboot.\n",
        "\nIf Mustaine once set out to create a louder, faster, better band than Metallica (hell, as bold as that was - he managed to exceed or match their best on occasion), his post-Rust in Peace 90's output displays very little of that. Youthanasia is a failure on many levels; primarily being that it's mostly forgettable, more than definitely underwhelming and, if you'll excuse the oxymoron, extremely mediocre. For all its faults, Metallica's eponymous \"snakey boy\" album was as catchy as it set out to be, as well produced as it ought to be and could compete with its true rivals in terms of hits (by which, I mean other ridiculous big-hitters like child-too-friendly synthetic man-mush, Michael Jackson, and Sheffield sell-outs, Def Leppard). In comparison, Megadeth's two \"grey albums\" lack a lot of their force and the majority of their staying power. Whereas Countdown to Extinction managed to at least muster some hits, Youthanasia really falls flat on that count. Only the syrupy, aimed-at-Francophone-radio ballad 'A Tout Le Monde' succeeds in being hooky in an AOR-friendly way (it's Megadeth do 'Winds of Change', in case you were wondering - it never reunited Germany, unlike the Scorps). \n\nOf course, Megadeth don't thrash or rage here but that's hardly to be held against them. On the other hand, what they do attempt is to create a vocal-centric album with one of the most idiosyncratically scratchy, weak sounding vocalists in metal's storied history. Mustaine must have been having a bad week as, while in-tune, his voice is a rakish, waif-like presence hovering high in the mix when it really has no place doing so. Prior Megadeth albums succeeded due to the fact that they had high-flying instrumentalists playing dazzling stuff to detract from any short-comings from Muistaine's voice. Here, however, the drums and guitars are reigned in and Muistaine is, somewhat embarrassingly, taking centre stage. I really don't know what he was thinking... perhaps he thought he'd come into his own as Hetfield had done? At any rate, the somewhat thin production, the spartan instrumentation - by their standards, at least - and overtly familiar verse-chorus nature of the album exposes Muistaine as, while not a bad vocalist, totally inadequate for what the album requires. As a matter of fact, I genuinely enjoy the vocals on Megadeth's earlier albums, it's just here that he overreaches and misses the mark massively. \n\nHonestly, I'm somewhat baffled by the praise this album receives. It's a metal album, sure, in the most barren plains of 90's thrash metal but it's just the most mid-paced, radio-orientated, vanilla, accountant-metal imaginable. It occasionally references classic metal but in the most restrained, beige way. Aside from the ballad, the slight break in the title track and the closer everything is so dull that you struggle to make it through the rather brief playing times. I mean I suppose 'Train of Consequences' has a catchy riff in that \"thrash goes rock/you wish they'd just retired instead\"-way but in no way, shape or form does any part of this album show Mustaine at his best (and he is one of the best rhythm guitarists in metal). Songs are barely worth mentioning as they follow a similar pace and style. Does this make Youthanasia the Reign in Blood of mid-1990s AOR metal? Perhaps, perhaps. \n\nOn a more personal note, I bought this album around fifteen years ago, as an ardent Megadeth fan; their blazing energy and style was just so impressive and this album just left me stone cold. So, it's nice to see that my impression is a completely unchanging one. I'm more than happy to reevaluate my impressions of an album and, hell, it's always great when you get into something you weren't keen on, however, this tepid, tepid album just refuses to sink its (lack of) hooks into me. \n\nI dunno, though, if slogging through 50 minutes of grey-metal with occasionally nice solo sections that makes Savatage's Handful of Rain seem like Skeptics Apocalypse in comparison is your bag... go forth, be fruitful, hang a baby on the line. The rest of us should listen to Megadeth's first four albums and continue to forget about this duller-than-dishwater album.\n",
        "\nAs far as Megadeth's albums have been going pretty lately,\u00a0United Abominations is literally a savior.\u00a0 Every track on here has character, the production is nice, the riffs are thrashy and fun, and the lyrics are bearable.\n\nLet's look at the riffs.\u00a0 When the album started off with \"Sleepwalker,\" I wasn't too thrilled.\u00a0 It's a good song, but this was how\u00a0The System Has Failed started: a good song followed by 40 minutes of snooze.\u00a0 But once I got past the first four tracks without being completely revulsed, I wasn't too worried for the rest of the album.\u00a0 It's weird how Megadeth does this because it's like every time they release a shitty album, they release a good one afterwards.\n\nOne of the singles from this albums was \"Washington Is Next.\"\u00a0 This is probably the best song on here because the vocal structure is actually good and the riffs make sense coming from Megadeth.\u00a0 Yes, finally, a Megadeth song that sounds like Megadeth!\n\nAs far as riffs go, this album actually sounds like a Megadeth record.\u00a0 It actually sounds a lot like\u00a0Dystopia, which is funny because a lyric from \"United Abominations\" is \"the threat is real.\"\u00a0 Let the conspiracies begin.\u00a0 Anyway, there are plenty of good riffs on here, something that has been quite uncommon in the previous few Megadeth albums.\u00a0 \"Never Walk Alone... A Call to Arms\" is one example of this.\u00a0 The riffs and leads are all on point, almost sounding like something off of\u00a0Rust in Peace.\u00a0 \"Play for Blood\" and the title track are also good examples because of their fun thrash metal riffs that are wonderfully fast.\u00a0 They also both have nice leads.\n\nThe lyrics aren't anything new.\u00a0 It's pretty much typical cheesy Megadeth.\u00a0 No, not\u00a0The System Has Failed or\u00a0Risk cheesy; this album's \"Amerikhastan\" cheesy.\u00a0 Or maybe \"New Yorqatar.\"\u00a0 Yes, that's a lyric from track nine.\u00a0 Also, the intro to \"United Abominations\" sounds like a real newscast, but it's fake, so if you thought it was real, that's unfortunate.\u00a0 If it is real, then that's pretty unethical broadcasting because it's very biased and passive aggressive.\u00a0 Also, it's really lame and edgy.\n\nThe production, music, and lyrics are all nicely done.\u00a0 So what don't I like about this album?\u00a0 Well, there's always the pretty obvious option of \"A tout le monde (Set Me Free) (feat. Cristina Scabbia of Lacuna Coil).\u00a0 For those who don't know, the original \"A tout le monde\" was released on the album\u00a0Youthanasia and it became a pretty big hit (like, big enough that my mom knew about it).\u00a0 Re-releasing it on this album is just Megadeth doing what they've been doing the past three albums - bringing back small elements of their better years into their music, not by making new material, but by copying the old material.\u00a0 It's quite pathetic, really.\n\nAnother thing I don't like about this album is the structure.\u00a0 All of the good songs are grouped in the first half of the album.\u00a0 This is something relatively new as on the four albums before this, the good songs were spread out more evenly.\u00a0 That's probably because they knew they were shitty albums so there needed to be something keeping it going so they accomplished that by strategically placing the good tracks among the bad ones.\u00a0 This album starts to get boring around \"Gears of War,\" picks back up, then it disappoints with \"A tout le monde.\"\u00a0 Then the last three tracks are just pretty boring with a good riff every once in a while.\n\nAnother thing I hate about this album is the album cover.\u00a0 What the hell?\u00a0 It's almost as bad as Iron Maiden's\u00a0Dance of Death.\u00a0 It's garbage and it hurts my eyes to look at.\u00a0 It's like the guy who makes art for the Mission Impossible movies discovered Microsoft Paint.\u00a0 Okay, that's a bit of a stretch, but whatever.\u00a0 The point is it sucks.\n\nThat's pretty much it.\u00a0 At this point, I can't say I know what Megadeth are going to do next.\u00a0 Their discography up to this point has been all over the place, never staying consistent for more than two albums.\u00a0 Well, at least this one was good.\n\nOverall Rating: 81%\n\nOriginally written for themetalvoid.wordpress.com\n",
        "\nAfter\u00a0United Abominations was a success, one could expect\u00a0Endgame to be one as well.\u00a0 And that's exactly what happened.\u00a0\u00a0Endgame took the flaws that were on\u00a0United Abominations and corrected them.\u00a0 Other than this, the album is pretty much the same as their 2007 effort, having similar riff styles, themes, and emotions.\u00a0 Also, the solos are more melodic on this release, something that Megadeth forgot to do in the late 1990s and early 2000s.\n\nThe riffs are good, utilizing the same themes as what were seen on the previous album.\u00a0 \"Bodies\" reminds me a lot of \"United Abominations,\" having similar riffing styles.\u00a0 The quality of these riffs are also really good, especially for being track six.\u00a0 On the previous release, Megadeth grouped all of their best songs in the front of the album.\u00a0 This is something that they did not do this time, having songs like \"Head Crusher\" and \"Bodies\" near the middle and end of the album.\u00a0 Speaking of \"Head Crusher,\" it's a really damn good song.\u00a0 The riffs on this song are relentless and fast, reminiscent of their first two albums.\u00a0 There are a couple of speed metal parts on here that remind me of their 1985 and 1986 releases, one being \"head Crusher,\" and the other being \"1320'.\"\n\nThere are plenty of other well-done songs like \"This Day We Fight\" and \"The Right to Go Insane.\"\u00a0 \"The Hardest Part of Letting Go... Sealed with a Kiss\" is another one of these good songs, but it's only good for its riffs.\u00a0 The clean guitar intro and outro are nice, but it's the lyrics that get me on this one.\u00a0 They're about love and romance and stuff, both things I don't want to hear about on a Megadeth record.\u00a0 It's like when Massacre released\u00a0Promise, that one death metal album full of love songs.\u00a0 Other than that, again, it's a good track.\n\nOther than track eight, this album is full of good lyrics, something they are improving upon.\u00a0 On\u00a0United Abominations, the lyrics got a lot better, but there was still a lot of edgy themes and phrases.\u00a0 On this release, there are less of those.\u00a0 This is good to see Megadeth finally getting their lyrical content back together because it's the first time I've heard decent lyrics from them since 1994 when they released\u00a0Youthanasia.\n\nThis is a good album and I fail to find any flaws.\u00a0 The lyrical content is good, the riffs are well-written, there aren't any backing vocals, industrial influences, or harmonicas that ruined their sound in the 1990s.\u00a0 It's a solid release from a band that has been releasing fairly shitty albums recently, so this is a nice relief.\u00a0 However, it could have been better.\n\nOverall Rating: 83%\n\nOriginally written for themetalvoid.wordpress.com\n",
        "\nIs it bad that I thought the woman voice over that started this album was Dave Mustaine?\u00a0 I mean they sound very similar...\n\nAnyway, let's take a look at Megadeth's 10th album.\u00a0 Over the course of nine albums, Megadeth took us on a roller coaster of sounds, most of which were shitty.\u00a0 This album is pretty terrible.\u00a0 It isn't\u00a0Risk, but it isn't quite up to par with\u00a0The World Needs a Hero, an already shaky album.\n\nSince\u00a0The World Needs a Hero, things have been looking pretty good for Megadeth, however, this album, like I said, is pretty terrible.\u00a0 One of the only promising tracks is \"Blackmailing the Universe\" because it actually has thrash metal riffs.\u00a0 Also, the fact that the first track is one of the better tracks isn't a very good sign for the rest of the album (and, trust me, the rest of the album isn't great).\u00a0 Everything after this is pretty much 90%\u00a0Countdown to Extinction and 10%\u00a0Risk.\n\nThe riffs are mostly terrible.\u00a0 Exhibit A: \"Die Dead Enough.\"\u00a0 What a terrible song.\u00a0 These riffs sound like something I would write when I first started learning how to play guitar.\u00a0 They eminate that cringy phase of pseudo-thrash metal riffs that I used to write and think they were so cool and \"Slayer-like.\"\u00a0 Also, one of my favorite parts about the album is that stupid drum part at 1:20 of this song where Dave Mustaine is like \"My heart's beatin' like a drum\" and then there's this atrocious echo where the backing vocalist is like \"DRUM\" and the drummer (you guessed it)\u00a0hits a drum.\u00a0 That, folks, is the pinnacle of thrash metal.\n\nEverything about this album is disappointing.\u00a0 The previous album built up for some promising stuff, but this is not what I nor any other Megadeth fan wanted.\u00a0 It's an abomination.\u00a0 Exhibit B: \"The Scorpion.\"\u00a0 The beginning lead guitar is promising, but like this album, it is a disappointment.\u00a0 Why?\u00a0 Because the verse riff that comes in right after that cool intro is one of the worse riffs on this album.\u00a0 It isn't technical, jumpy, thrashy, groovy, or good in any way.\u00a0 It kills all flow built up.\u00a0 Oh, and they do it again.\u00a0 Yeah, after the chorus (which I regrettably admit is catchy), they play this really cool interlude with even more eeriness than the intro had!\u00a0 Then they ruin that flow as well with the same insipid riff.\n\nAnother example of terrible songwriting is \"Back in the Day.\"\u00a0 This is actually one of the more promising songs on here, until the end of the song where there's this great build up, only for the song to abruptly end.\u00a0 The next song, \"Something that I'm not,\" I feel is about Metallica and how Mustaine was happy to have been kicked out.\u00a0 It's a very edgy way of saying he's happy to be in Megadeth.\u00a0 I mean the backing vocals on this song are just so cringy.\u00a0 Then at the end of the song, Mustaine is like \"something I'm not... yet.\"\u00a0 Which is really funny because earlier in the song he says \"You never made metal, metal made you.\"\u00a0 Sorry, but what was everything between\u00a0Countdown and\u00a0Dystopia?\u00a0\n\nThe lyrics on this album are absolutely terrible.\u00a0 \"Die Dead Enough\" is a song whose title should do enough to let the listener know that the lyrics are bad.\u00a0 The title literally screams \"my lyrics are terrible.\"\u00a0 And they are.\u00a0 It sounds like a Bon Jovi ballad.\u00a0 \"The Scorpion\" isn't any better.\u00a0 The catchy chorus builds up to Mustaine saying in his nasally voice \"I am a scorpion.\"\u00a0 Track three is a clear throwback to \"Peace Sells\" as Mustaine says \"The system's for sale!\"\u00a0 But all of that is ruined once he shouts \"Kick the chair!\" right afterwards.\u00a0 I just strongly advise against reading the lyrics to any track on here if you would like to spare a few brain cells.\n\nSome other things I would like to point out that I think are terrible:\n\n- The slam riffs of \"Shadow of Deth\" that are behind a spoken-word Bible verse... but\u00a0 with bagpipes!\n- The industrial influences on \"My Kingdom\"\n- The chugging on \"My Kingdom\" that painfully doesn't lead anywhere\n- The utilization of backing vocals\n\nAmong all of the chaotic shit that dominates the run time of this album, there are a few redeeming factors.\u00a0 \"Blackmailing the Universe,\" like I said, is a good track.\u00a0 \"Tears in a Vial,\" although it's cheesy and, like every other track, has terrible lyrics, the riffs are much better than anything else on this album, reminiscent of\u00a0the good parts of\u00a0So Far, So Good... So What?\u00a0 \"Truth Be Told\" is another song that shows potential with fast riffs and nice leads.\u00a0 Also, the lyrics on this song aren't terrible.\n\nI could go on and on about how many bad lines are on this album.\u00a0 I could write several more paragraphs about the shitty riffs on here, but I won't because I think you get the point.\u00a0 This is a pretty bad album with only a few redeeming points.\n\nOverall Rating: 38%\n\nOriginally written for themetalvoid.wordpress.com\n",
        "\nWhat happened?\n\nI had to make sure that I wasn't listening to Zac Brown Band for Christ's sake.\n\nI'm getting vibes of nu metal, grunge, country rock, glam metal, and industrial, to name a few.\u00a0 It's like Bruce Springsteen listened to a Korn CD and was somehow inspired.\u00a0 There are so many things wrong with this album and I am having a hard time organizing all of them into one, cohesive review.\n\nOkay, I guess I'll tackle the first problem I heard: \"Insomnia.\"\u00a0 Is that industrial I hear?\u00a0 Yep, it is.\u00a0 That's too bad, I was hoping for maybe something decent for the first track.\u00a0 Nope, it's shit right off the bat.\u00a0 Also, the lyrics to this song are ridiculous.\u00a0 Look at these:\n\nInsomnia, footsteps on the walk\nInsomnia, I hear someone knock\nInsomnia, I wish it was a dream\nInsomnia, can you hear me scream?\n\nIf you have insomnia, screaming won't help, trust me.\u00a0 Screaming does\u00a0not help one sleep.\u00a0 Well, I guess they needed something edgy that rhymes with \"dream.\"\u00a0 Yeah, that makes sense.\u00a0\u00a0This is a literal identity crisis.\u00a0 I mean this goes from nu metal to country rock in an instant.\u00a0 Perfect examples are \"Wonderlust\" and \"Breadline.\"\u00a0 The horribly melodic choruses and twangy guitar give off the worst vibe ever put off by a Megadeth song.\n\nThere is no redeeming point on this album.\u00a0\u00a0Cryptic Writings had a few songs that were redeeming because it showed that Megadeth could still write a decent song.\u00a0 There is not one song on this album that reminds me of good Megadeth, something that I'm beginning to think was mere legend.\u00a0 I mean, did\u00a0Peace Sells actually happen?\u00a0 Or was it just an illusion created by a really shitty band?\u00a0 I bet we could get some good conspiracy theories out of this.\n\nNo, this is real.\u00a0 This heartless, empty, meaningless album called\u00a0Risk actually did happen.\u00a0 So, I mentioned glam metal in an above paragraph.\u00a0 Yes, just listen to \"I'll Be There\" or \"Breadline,\" and you'll understand.\u00a0 It's very reminiscent of their 1988 release,\u00a0So Far, So Good... So What?, but at least that album had decent guitar.\u00a0 That's another thing.\u00a0 I never expected a band that released \"Tornado of Souls\" and \"The Conjuring\" to release something so dull and blunt.\n\nFrom the vocal effects and industrial dabblings here and there,\u00a0Risk became the butt of Megadeth's discography up to 1999.\u00a0 Everything about the cheesy \"Crush 'Em\" and lame effects that struggle so hard to make \"Prince of Darkness\" actually eerie fail to entertain even the dullest of minds.\u00a0 Each of these songs attempts to leap at the listener with ferocity and atmosphere, but merely bounces off their forehead, leaving them unscathed.\u00a0 Every track is water on rock, but eventually, after the 51 minute runtime of the album, the water will erode every bit of happiness left inside of you because this album is that terrible.\n\nSpeaking of \"Crush 'Em,\" what the hell is this?\u00a0 The intro \"Enter the Arena\" builds up for something heavy... and what do we hear...?\n\n*effects and samples*\n\n(Bass:)\nBumbum\nBumbum\nBumbum (industrial dabblings in background)\nBumbum\n\n*clean guitar*\n\nWow.\u00a0 All of that buildup for a crappy bassline and some bluesy clean guitar lick?\u00a0 Cool, why don't you just stop listening because it doesn't get any better.\n\nOkay, fine, there is on very mediocre part that actually sounds amazing compared to all of this other shit.\u00a0 The only decent song on here is \"Time: The End\" because, not only does it mark the ending of this abomination, it also has pretty okay riffs and themes.\u00a0 All of this momentum is lost once the vocal effect kick in, but at least there is just a speck of hope left...\n\nI feel like a lot of the country influence can be blamed on\u00a0Cryptic Writings, but at least\u00a0Risk doesn't have (as much) harmonica.\u00a0 Then the grunge and nu metal can be traced to the times.\u00a0 Remember, people, this was 1999, and nu metal was just in its prime and grunge is starting to die down.\u00a0 Slayer went nu and grunge with\u00a0Diabolus in Musica and Sepultura went nu with every release after\u00a0Chaos A.D.\u00a0 Still, I cannot find a single thing I like about this new sound.\n\nOverall Rating:\u00a05%\n\nOriginally written for themetalvoid.wordpress.com\n",
        "\nIt was the turn of the century and Megadeth released\u00a0The World Needs a Hero.\u00a0 And, after their last effort,\u00a0Risk, the world indeed needed a hero.\u00a0 I mean, it was bad.\u00a0 Like, really bad.\u00a0 But this album came out of nowhere and is actually pretty good.\n\nMegadeth sort of do that, don't they?\u00a0 They released\u00a0So Far, So Good, a mediocre mid-paced thrash album with little excitement.\u00a0 Then they released\u00a0Rust in Peace, one of the best albums of their career.\u00a0 They released\u00a0Countdown after that and it was a complete dud only to have their following album,\u00a0Youthanasia, be a large success (in my opinion, anyway).\u00a0 Now, after the abomination called\u00a0Risk, they've redeemed themselves to some extent.\u00a0 There are a few errors on this album, however, and I will be covering them shortly.\n\nThis album is composed of mid-paced thrash metal songs that are like those seen on\u00a0So Far, So Good, but this time around, the riffs are not the driving force; the leads are.\u00a0\u00a0The World Needs a Hero took me by surprise because not once did I hear a harmonica or a twang on this album.\u00a0 There were awkward moments like the entirety of \"1000 Times Goodbye\" and the symphony of \"Promises,\" but no devastating errors... sort of.\n\nSpeaking of \"1000 Times Goodbye,\" why the hell is this on here?\u00a0 Six minutes of breakup garbage on a thrash metal album?\u00a0 Wow, that's what I want to hear.\u00a0 Guitar solos overlapping phone call soundbytes that are too loudly produced for\u00a0six minutes sounds like a treat.\u00a0 Even the riffs are bad.\u00a0 The opening riff is the least impressive opening riff ever written by Megadeth to this point.\u00a0 There is no hook, no direction, and no inspiration.\n\n\"Promises\" sounds like the band discovered that they could use Pro-Tools to make their own symphonies.\u00a0 Well isn't that cute.\u00a0 The entire song is placed awkwardly on the album, ending with an acoustic guitar that was cut too short, making the ending abrupt, and leading into a heavy riff right away.\n\nThe biggest problem with the album is this: \"Return to Hangar.\"\u00a0 It is clear that what Megadeth is attempting is another\u00a0Rust in Peace and this becomes certain when this song plays.\u00a0 It's basically a remake of \"Hangar 18,\" the classic song from their 1990 album that so many love.\u00a0 \"Return to Hangar\" is not a sequel, at least I don't think it is.\u00a0 It's a remake of the classic, using the same chorus and the lyrics are based off the originals.\u00a0 You can't just take a song from a previous album and slap it on your new record.\u00a0 That should be a law.\u00a0 Because it's so lame when bands attempt to relive their glory days, not by making new music (which would seem like the probably solution), but by remaking old music.\u00a0 I am aware that they wrote new riffs, but really?\u00a0 I don't find it that easily redeemable.\n\nOther problems that are quite minor are the grunge song and the long one.\u00a0 The grunge song is \"Losing My Senses,\" sounding like a shreddier Pearl Jam than Megadeth.\u00a0 The long song is the very last track,\u00a0\"When.\"\u00a0 Clocking at nine minutes, this song is a snooze.\u00a0 Maybe it's called \"When\" because no one knows when the hell it will end.\u00a0 The first four minutes are Dave Mustaine talking about some dumb stuff and it goes by very slowly.\u00a0 It isn't until this is over when the good riffs come in.\u00a0 The riffs aren't amazing, but they're okay.\u00a0 But with the four-minute intro, it's not even worth listening to.\n\nOther than a few flaws on the record, it's not all that bad.\u00a0 Well, compared to the previous two albums, that is.\u00a0 This album has some good songs on it like \"Burning Bridges\" and \"Recipe for Hate.\"\u00a0 Both of these songs show that Megadeth is still able to do what they do best: make fast and relentless songs with shredding riffs and solos.\u00a0 Despite some large hiccups like tracks four, six, and 11, this album isn't terrible.\u00a0 It's a good start after hitting rock bottom with\u00a0Risk, so kudos to you, Megadeth, for pulling your stuff together.\n\nOverall Rating:\u00a068%\n\nOriginally written for themetalvoid.wordpress.com\n",

        "\nThis was my first Megadeth album.\u00a0 I saw it in my local record store and listened to it when I got home.\u00a0 Liking what I heard, I bought it just in time for a trip to Canada, where I sat on a bus that left the station at midnight.\u00a0 In a total zone of peace and tranquility, I played my brand new Megadeth album that I just put onto my phone.\u00a0 Every time I listen to this album, I am reminded of that perfect bus ride.\n\nWhen the album starts, it is with a pummeling thrash metal riff that sounds like a better-produced\u00a0Countdown to Extinction song.\u00a0 In fact, almost everything on here sounds like it's from\u00a0Countdown to Extinction, except for the fact that half the songs on that album consisted on a lot of clean guitar.\u00a0 On\u00a0Youthanasia, most of the clean guitar has been consolidated to one track, \"A tout le monde.\"\u00a0 But, it is much more well-done than their 1992 effort, consisting of actual thrash metal riffs and melody.\u00a0 They still have yet to grasp at any technicality that was so present in their debut and sophomore releases, but this is fine, I guess.\u00a0 I mean, I don't hate it.\n\nIn fact, I love it.\u00a0 Was this my favorite Megadeth album at one point?\u00a0 Yes, but I hadn't heard anything else at that point until I bought\u00a0Peace Sells... But Who's Buying? on a whim from Amazon.\u00a0 It is not longer my favorite Megadeth album, but it's definitely my third favorite.\u00a0 The riffs, melodies, and song structure is all what\u00a0Countdown should have been.\n\nAs I've said several times already, this is what\u00a0Countdown should've sounded like.\u00a0 That being said, here are some major improvements Megadeth has made on this record.\u00a0 First, unpredictability has been re-adopted into their music.\u00a0 Just listen to \"The Killing Road\" or \"Youthanasia.\"\u00a0 This brings up another improvement.\u00a0 On this album, they didn't allocate all of the good songs to the front of the tracklist.\u00a0 They actually spread them out (!).\u00a0 \"Youthanasia,\" one of the strongest tracks is at track nine, \"The Killing Road\" is track six, and \"Train of Consequences\" is track two.\u00a0 These are just a few of my favorite on this album.\u00a0 Others include \"I Thought I Knew it All\" (track 10), \"Addicted to Chaos\" (Track three), and \"Family Tree\" (track eight).\u00a0 The better songs are spread out thoroughly, a nice thing to see every once in a while.\n\nIs this album composed of mid-paced thrash metal?\u00a0 Yes.\u00a0 Is this a turn-off?\u00a0 Absolutely not.\u00a0 I could listen to this album all day and not be unamused.\u00a0 I can say with utmost confidence that this album is the peak of their 1990s years (excluding 1990's\u00a0Rust in Peace, of course).\u00a0 The mid-paced riffs aren't that bad because they actually do it right this time.\u00a0 On\u00a0Countdown, the slow thrash riffs were absolutely painful, but on\u00a0Youthanasia, the majority of the riffs are still entertaining, despite their speed.\n\nThe biggest downfall, for me, on this album is \"Victory.\"\u00a0 After one realizes that Mustaine's just running off track titles from previous Megadeth albums, it becomes a disappointment.\u00a0 It doesn't help that the riffs aren't that great either.\u00a0 I can see why they put this song last, as it is a testament to everything they've written up to 1994, but it's still a disappointing ending to such a surprisingly good successor to\u00a0Countdown.\u00a0 But, hey, the solo is pretty awesome.\n\nOverall, this album is great considering the death of popular thrash metal bands had occurred by this time.\u00a0 Death Angel fell off the map, Slayer just released\u00a0Diabolus in Musica to succeed the already mediocre\u00a0Seasons in the Abyss, Sepultura just dove off the deep end with\u00a0Chaos A.D., sounding like a watered-down Pantera, and Metallica was just being a bunch of dicks when they released\u00a0Load and\u00a0Reload after a five-year hiatus.\u00a0 The only bands that continued doing what they were doing were Sodom and Artillery.\u00a0 Despite this, Megadeth released a good album in 1994, despite showing many signs in their 1992 release that they were definitely slowing down, and it was a good album.\u00a0 Bravo, Megadeth... but will you be able to keep it up in\u00a0your next release?\u00a0 (The answer is sort of).\n\nOverall Rating: 89%\n\nOriginally written for themetalvoid.wordpress.com\n",
        "\nOne day, not too long ago, I was listening to some Megadeth and \"Sweating Bullets\" came on.\u00a0 I'm just going to say it: I hate this song (I'll explain shortly).\u00a0 My girlfriend was sitting across the room.\u00a0 I was like \"Hey listen to this chorus it sucks ass,\" and they said \"did he just say 'sweating balls'?\"\n\nDave Mustaine might as well have said \"sweating balls\" because it couldn't get any worse than what it already is.\u00a0 Why do I hate \"one of the greatest Megadeth songs of all time\" you may ask?\u00a0 The lyrical structure, lyrical execution, vocal effects, and the lyrics themselves.\u00a0 The song starts out very promising thrash metal riffage, only to be ruined by Mustaine going \"Hello, me, meet the real me.\" in that nasaly voice he has.\u00a0 Does Megadeth do spoken word now?\u00a0 Then there's the chorus \"sweatinnnng bulleeeeets!\"\u00a0 It's terribly placed, awkward, and uncanny.\u00a0 The effects near the end with Dave overlapping his own voice come off as lame.\u00a0 I get that the song is about going mad, but they could've done better.\n\nI saw this album referred to as \"Megadeth's Black Album.\"\u00a0 This is true, except I enjoy most of the music from\u00a0Metallica.\u00a0 Metallica's 1991 release's main downfall, for me, was its overall length.\u00a0\u00a0Countdown to Extinction is just a bunch of watered-down thrash anthems with one track that has a country twang (\"High Speed Dirt\").\u00a0 I will admit, despite the country aspect of \"High Speed Dirt,\" the twangy guitar solo is pretty good.\u00a0 The last track on the album has to be the worst for me.\u00a0 The verse riff is just a power chord that bites at my eardrums in the worst way possible every time it is plucked (which is quite often).\u00a0 At over six minutes long, this song is the worst way to end an already mediocre album: slowly and painfully, and adding the echo effect at the end did not help this song in any way.\u00a0 At least the solo is okay.\n\nEverything about this album is a disappointment for me.\u00a0 It's mediocre thrash that lacks original melody and overall technicality.\u00a0 There are almost as many acoustic/clean guitar sections as there are actual electric guitar riffs, and unpredictability is something that Megadeth forgot when writing this album.\u00a0 Even the album cover is disappointing.\u00a0 Every other album cover had Vic Rattlehead doing something cool.\u00a0 This time, it's some shriveled-up old dude with a loin cloth around his waist, screaming.\u00a0 ...It sort of looks like Dio, but if he were dead for several years (which, in 1992, he was not).\u00a0 Maybe this was a prediction to what Dio's corpse would look like after Last in Line shit on his reputation.\n\nI don't want to come off as someone who just hates songs because they're popular.\u00a0 These are my legitimate opinions.\u00a0 This album is the clear transition, if not the abrupt halt in their discography that identifies their change in sound.\n\nOverall Rating: 48%\n\nOriginally written for themetalvoid.wordpress.com\n",
        "\nAs far as I'm concerned, this album sounds like a combination of\u00a0Peace Sells... But Who's Buying? and\u00a0So Far, So Good... So What?\u00a0 If you have read my previous reviews for the latter of those two albums, you will know that I do not like it that much.\u00a0 It's no doubt that this is a well-done album, unlike its predecessor.\u00a0 But I do not think it's as well-done as their first two albums.\n\nIt's missing the speed metal riffage that I love so much about\u00a0Peace Sells and\u00a0Killing Is My Business.\u00a0\u00a0Rust in Peace certainly has fast riffs and hooks, as well as lightning fast solos, but, again, they aren't the same.\u00a0 The technicality is there still, but, for whatever reason, this album reminds me of a band like Atrophy or Testament after 1988.\u00a0 That is to day, it's just thrash metal, other than some speed metal-esque riffs of \"Lucretia.\"\n\nThe riffs on here are great.\u00a0 Like I said, they're fast.\u00a0 They have good melody, speed, and technicality.\u00a0 I'm going to try and not compare them to Megadeth's first two albums any more and just review them as they are on their own.\u00a0 As far as riffs go, I think that \"Tornado of Souls,\" \"Rust in Peace... Polaris,\" and the first three tracks have the best riffs.\u00a0 As far as solos go, \"Tornado of Souls\" wins.\n\nStanding on its own, it's really great.\u00a0 It's like what\u00a0Master of Puppets should have been.\u00a0 Aside from the riffs, as I have already given my opinions on them, the bass is good too.\u00a0 I feel like they tried to revive \"Peace Sells\" with \"Dawn Patrol.\"\u00a0 This may not be the case, but I can't help but think it is.\u00a0 It's a nice bassline, but it's just okay.\u00a0 The bass on this album isn't anything stellar.\u00a0 It's not like Ellefson's left the band or anything because he certainly did not, it's just that the bass isn't really doing anything beyond mimicking the guitar.\u00a0 If there's a moment on here where that isn't the case, then it must not have been very memorable.\n\nThis is a good album.\u00a0 It's got technicality, speed, thrashy riffs, and melodic solos.\u00a0 The bass sounds good, and the drums don't sound as poppy as their previous album.\u00a0 Overall, it's pretty much what thrash metal should be.\n\nOverall Rating: 91%\n\nOriginally written for themetalvoid.wordpress.com\n",
        "\nThere are, believe it or not, some people out there who think this is a bad album. Those fools can get bent. Granted, it's a smidge of a let down compared to its predecessor, which just had thrash hit single after thrash hit single, and its successor, which was the final form of power thrash (if one chooses to make such a deep classification). I would rank this on par with, maybe even a little bit higher than the debut.\n\nThe argument can certainly be made that this is more of a speed thrash album than any Megadeth album before or since. Songs like Hook In Mouth, 502 and Set The World Afire should have very little trouble convincing any skeptics of its power. Granted, it's about a 7.5 or maybe an 8 compared to the 10s of Eternal Nightmare, Beneath The Remains and Reign In Blood on the speed scale (perhaps South of Heaven, which was also released in 1988 would be about a 9 or an 8).\n\nIf nothing else, the album is seminal for one of the finest compositions Mustaine has ever produced: In My Darkest Hour. Carrying more emotional power, talent and weight than any so called Metallica ballad ever could, this song exudes perfect duality. Imagine if Disney gained the rights to make an animated musical Super Mario Bros. movie. In My Darkest Hour would be the song Bowser sings after having been utterly defeated, but is still alive and shall swear vengeance once he regains his strength (in the sequel of course, because why the fuck wouldn't that be successful, especially if this song was in it). Mustaine says he wrote this song while in tears after having been found out third hand that Cliff Burton had just died. But there is not a single whiny nanosecond in this song. THIS is how weakness and vulnerability should be displayed in heavy metal.\n\nOf course I'd be remiss to not mention the first of many, many, many lineup changes Megadeth would have throughout their illustrious career. Jazz virtuosos Chris Poland and Gar Samuelson are gone, replaced by more conventional rockers/thrashers Jeff Young and Chuck Behler. While lacking the chops that put Megadeth ahead of the technical game in 85-87, they most certainly hold their own on this record. The finest moment of each member being Set The World Afire, with Chuck giving an Olympic performance on the songs opening salvo, and Jeff laying down a simply exquisite melodic guitar solo around 4:47 of the track. But yeah, these two are really just keeping the seat warm for Marty Friedman and Nick Menza, and I'd say they are quite capable of at least tuning their respective successor's instruments.\n\nSo Far, So Good So What is essential to any metalhead's collection. Maybe not the first Megadeth album you should buy, but don't let it slip beyond your third or fourth purchase. Hell, if you wanted to buy it before Rust In Peace, just to see the band building toward that centerpiece, that is also an acceptable reason.\n",
        "\nOne year after their debut record, Megadeth got back in the studio, cooking up one of their biggest records of all time.\u00a0 \"Peace Sells... But Who's Buying?\" is renowned as a thrash metal classic.\u00a0 It wasn't until 1990, when \"Rust in Peace\" was released, did thrash metal fans rave over Megadeth so much.\u00a0 This was released in 1986, a year I like to call \"the Year of Thrash.\"\u00a0 It was in 1986 when Slayer released their most commercially successful release, \"Reign in Blood.\"\u00a0 Metallica released what most critics called their peak album from their early years, \"Master of Puppets.\"\u00a0 Groove metal was invented by Exhorder when they dropped their 1986 demo, \"Get Rude.\"\u00a0 Other notable albums released were Onslaught's \"The Force,\" Sodom's \"Obsessed by Cruelty,\" and Sepultura's \"Morbid Visions.\"\n\nIt is very clear that this album is a classic.\u00a0 From the cheesy, trying-too-hard-to-be-tough lyrics of \"Peace Sells\" to the fast riffage of literally any song on here, there is a reason that this album is considered a classic.\u00a0 It has the humor that Mustaine brings to the band so well in \"Wake Up Dead.\" It has the technical leads and hammering rhythms of \"The Conjuring\" and \"Good Mourning/Black Friday\" that can be traced back to their debut release.\u00a0 It's everything Megadeth is in one album, and, for only taking a year to write, it's pretty damn amazing.\n\nLet's take a look at the riffs.\u00a0 So I mentioned they're technical; I am going to reiterate that.\u00a0 They're technical.\u00a0 Just take \"The Conjuring,\" for example.\u00a0 The opening riff is that eerie guitar riff with that groovy bass line behind it.\u00a0 It becomes this speed metal-infused thrash mayhem that has one of those epic Mustaine solos over it.\u00a0 In the middle of the song, it decreases in tempo and goes into this breakdown (not the modern definition of breakdown) that is super groovy and is only made better with Mustaine's leads.\u00a0 This unpredictable song structure can be seen throughout the entire album on each song.\u00a0 Each riff seems to be thought out considerably more than their previous release.\n\nThe production on this album is superb as well.\u00a0 I can hear every bass line on this album.\u00a0 This is fairly common for 1980s thrash, but I like to mention it anyways, just because the bass on this album is a large part of what makes this album so good.\u00a0 I mentioned \"The Conjuring\" earlier with its bass line in the beginning.\u00a0 Or the title track, \"Peace Sells.\"\u00a0 This paragraph exists because of the bass line of that song.\u00a0 I wouldn't be surprised if every metal bassist on the planet knows how to play or has tried to play the bass intro for \"Peace Sells.\"\u00a0 It's like the most well-known metal bass intro ever.\n\nTo sum things up, this is a technical thrash metal masterpiece - from 1986.\u00a0 I mean most thrash releases from 1986 were influenced by a lot of punk and NWOBHM acts such as Venom and Savage.\u00a0 Most tech thrash came out around 1987-1989 (with the exception of Watchtower and, obviously, Megadeth).\u00a0 So, no only is it an amazing album, but it was also helping to redefine thrash metal as it was known in the 1980s.\n\nOverall Rating: 98%\n\nOriginally written for themetalvoid.wordpress.com\n",
        "\nSo, for some perspective, it took one year to write and record the masterpiece that is \"Peace Sells... but Who's Buying?\" and almost two years to write and record their third album \"So Far, So Good... So What!\"\u00a0 And what was the product of those two years?\u00a0 Complete mediocrity.\u00a0 I don't understand how the transition between Megadeth's two most famous albums is such a dud of an album.\n\nIt was a nice surprise when the rest of the album didn't have that horrible guitar tone that started the album out.\u00a0 But it was a much less nice surprise to hear that the first track, \"Into the Lungs of Hell,\" was three minutes of power chord progressions lead by tapping.\u00a0 That's pretty underwhelming.\u00a0 Cool, Dave, you can tap.\u00a0 So what (pun unintended)?\u00a0 So far, so bad (pun intended).\n\nThe next track is okay, starting out with a recording from The Ink Spots' \"World on Fire\" followed by an atomic bomb (inevitably reminding me of Fallout 3).\u00a0 At times on this track, I feel like I'm listening to Whitesnake.\u00a0 After this comes Megadeth's version of the Sex Pistols' \"Anarchy in the UK,\" the shittiest Megadeth cover ever (at least their Fear cover on \"Dystopia\" had energy).\u00a0 At least on their past two albums, they had the decency to slap their cover on the B-side, let alone track three.\u00a0 I mean we've only had one real song at this point on the album because the intro was a waste!\u00a0 This cover has no life to it, no alterations to the lyrics (other than saying \"USA\" instead of \"UK\") or the guitar, and no good whatsoever.\u00a0 The only reason I could see them placing it here is to make a political statement.\n\nI mentioned in the last paragraph that I feel like I'm listening to Whitesnake at times.\u00a0 Yep, there's a lot of glam on here.\u00a0 It' like their producer was like \"Hey, could you guys be more pop-sounding in your music so we could get more money? Thanks.\"\u00a0 And I wouldn't be surprised if that was what happened.\u00a0 I mean just listen to the drums.\u00a0 They are glam metal drums.\u00a0 You know when you're listening to Bon Jovi and there's that terrible pop-sounding snare in the background being hit in the cymbal-snare-cymbal-snare pattern (no, not a blastbeat) at a very slow tempo?\u00a0 That's how the drums on this album sound.\u00a0 And the mid-paced guitar riffs don't help them in this case.\u00a0 In other words, I would like a Megadeth album in which I don't have to check my phone to make sure I'm not listening to Dokken.\n\nThe most thrash metal song on here is \"Set the World Afire,\" the one with the Ink Spots song.\u00a0 Everything after that is just thrashy Whitesnake.\n\nSo what does this album have that the two before it don't?\u00a0 Glam influence.\u00a0 What does it not have that the others do have?\u00a0 Well, for one, it doesn't have a good cover.\u00a0 Also, it doesn't have many great riffs (a few can be found on \"Set the World Afire,\" \"Mary Jane,\" and \"502\").\u00a0 And it's not technical.\u00a0 Their past two albums were technical all over the place.\u00a0 Maybe not technical as we know it today, but, for their time, it was technical.\u00a0 In fact, Metallica is more technical than this album (granted, \"...and Justice for All\" was their most progressive album).\u00a0 Some remnants of Megadeth's lost technicality can be seen midway through \"Mary Jane,\" but the first couple minutes of this song are clogged with mediocre riffs and slow, glam-filled sections, so who would want to sift through the track in the first place?\n\nThis isn't a terrible album, but it's definitely Megadeth at their lowest point as far at their \"ellipses\" albums go (for those who don't know, the ellipses is the three periods).\u00a0 I am very unimpressed by the whole album and can now see why I never see anyone praising this album.\n\nOverall Rating: 69%\n\nOriginally written for themetalvoid.wordpress.com\n",
        "\nMegadeth was formed in 1983 as Fallen Angel.\u00a0 Dave Mustaine formed it with intentions to destroy Metallica in a thrash metal war that is still going on today.\u00a0 Mustaine got a band together and put out a full-length in 1985 called \"Killing Is My Business... and Business Is Good!\"\u00a0 For 1985, this album is definitely ahead of its time.\n\nAround this time, thrash was being pioneered by Slayer, Anthrax, and especially Metallica, as they had two albums out at this point and were the first thrash metal band.\u00a0 Looking at Anthrax and Slayer, it is very punk-influenced, and Metallica was very NWOBHM-influenced.\u00a0 Looking at Megadeth, the influence here could be traced back to Venom or Mot\u00f6rhead because there is a lot of speed metal on here.\u00a0 But Megadeth has a very technical edge to their music, something never seen before in thrash metal, speed metal, or any other genre at this point.\n\nThis band was truly formed to destroy Metallica.\u00a0 I love Metallica's \"Kill 'Em All,\" and \"Ride the Lightning\" is good, but, from what I am able to hear, they can't compare to \"Killing Is My Business.\"\u00a0 The leads on this album are out of control, Mustaine's vocals are relentless, and the speed of every song leaves your head spinning.\u00a0 Even the last track, \"The Mechanix,\" is a masterpiece.\u00a0 Not only did Metallica release the song first, but Mustaine is beating them at their own game - two years after it was released.\n\nLet's take a look at the music.\u00a0 The album starts with a classy intro that isn't all that great, nor is it a very good intro.\u00a0 They would've been better off just leaving it off the album.\u00a0 But once \"Loved to Deth\" starts, there is no going back as relentless speed metal riffs and technical leads start to pummel one's eardrums.\u00a0 All the way until Mustaine's raunchy rendition of Nancy Sinatra's \"These Boots Are Made for Walkin'\" this album keeps on giving.\n\nI don't have any problems with this album.\u00a0 In fact, I think it's a perfect portrayal of Megadeth.\u00a0 It has the humor of Megadeth shown in the Nancy Sinatra cover, and a lot of history throughout the album as well.\u00a0 One can see the origin of Megadeth's mascot Vic Rattlehead on the song \"Rattlehead\" (no shit).\u00a0 More history can be found with \"The Mechanix,\" an obvious middle finger to Metallica.\n\nFor those who know about the shitfest between Metallica and Dave Mustaine, move on to the next paragraph.\u00a0 When Metallica formed, Dave Mustaine was the original guitarist.\u00a0 He was kicked out of the band (with no second chance, as the popular meme likes to remind us) for repetitive drug use and alcohol consumption.\u00a0 During his years in Metallica, he wrote the guitar parts for seven of the ten songs on \"Kill 'Em All.\"\u00a0 However, he was kicked out before they released the album.\u00a0 Metallica hired Kirk Hammet from Exodus (you can see the Exodus influence in Metallica's \"Metal Militia\"), which also delayed Exodus' first album, \"Bonded by Blood.\"\u00a0 \"The Four Horsemen,\" a song from Metallica's debut album, was one song that was written by Mustaine and was originally called \"The Mechanix\" on the \"No Life 'Till Leather\" demo.\u00a0 This is why having Mustaine's version of \"The Mechanix\" on his new band's debut album is a clear \"fuck you\" to Metallica.\u00a0 And, to be honest, I do like Mustaine's version better.\n\nThis is a strong debut from the thrash metal pioneer Dave Mustaine.\u00a0 It is fast, technical, and a hell of a lot of fun.\u00a0 Also, this album has a kick ass title.\u00a0 This album embodies thrash metal with its fun and creative name.\u00a0 Just think about this: \"Killing Is My Business... and Business Is Good!\"\u00a0 I think it's a great thrash metal album title.\u00a0 Good job, Dave, I think you've built a foundation for a discography that will indeed destroy Metallica.\n\nOverall Rating: 94%\n\nOriginally written for themetalvoid.wordpress.com\n",
        "\nAh, the eternal struggle between the forces of Dave Goodstein and the Lars Ul-reich of Evil\u2026 Metallica and Megadeth fans, that is. Never quite understood why it rages on with such passion, especially for MegaDave's fans. I guess some people just identifies with romanticizing the tale of vengeance and redemption, the fact that Dave got sacked from 'tallica in such a humiliating way only to return stronger than ever and vented his every will into trying to pay back Metallica in kind\u2026 never quite achieving it really, and ironically following their footsteps in everything they attempted, even towards \u201cselling out\u201d by mid-90s. I mean, 60+ reviews here on the Archives between Dystopia and Hardwired\u2026 to Self-Destruct, most of them stating how Megadeth kicks Metallica's ass so hard. Talk about some of the biggest butthurt in the history of music. \n\nI must confess, without an ounce of shame, I'm more of a Metallica fan than a Megadeth fan, even though I enjoy both bands, even some of their more recent stuff. I've seen both bands live three or more times each, and even though I have concluded that Megadeth sucks live and Metallica kicks ass, what really makes my mind when responding the extremely subjective question, \u201cwhich is the best band\u201d, it all comes down to answering another question in turn: Which band has the best 80s discography? After all, that was the decade in which both bands were trailblazing, forging extremely influential metal, and even carried that momentum into the early 90s. For me, the answer is simple: Metallica. Why? Well, because of this 1988 release, So Far, So Good\u2026 So What!. I will not delve in comparisons between this one and \u2026and Justice for All, but if we address that issue briefly, the Metallica album helped push thrash metal into proggier, more technical territories, whereas the third Megadeth release\u2026 \n\nLet's be honest, it isn't even a decent thrash metal record, let alone a top shelf one, especially not when taking into account the class of 1988. Likening this to History of a Time to Come, Endless War, Mallevs Maleficarvm, The Sane Asylum, or even more traditional straightforward '88 thrash like Eternal Nightmare, South of Heaven, Survive, or Violent Restitution, would be like putting a bottle of Budweiser among a collection of prized vintage wine bottles. Let's not forget this has a Sex Pistols cover, which might be amusing to hear for the first time, but ends up being just cute after that. Even though the album starts magnificently with the instrumental \u201cInto the Lungs of Hell\u201d, packed with incendiary solos y a great set of riffs, and it is followed by a more than decent second punch in \u201cSet the World Afire\u201d, it then falls flat on its butt for the most part. \u201cMary Jane\u201d is a particularly weak and forgettable track, although side B opener \u201c502\u201d is an entertaining tale of speed racing, even with its distracting sampled mid-section, and the over-long chaotic ending. \n\nThe real jewel of this record is without a doubt Dave's heartfelt tribute to his fallen comrade Cliff, \u201cIn My Darkest Hour\u201d. And to spike the ire of all those 'tallica-haters out there, it has the more mid-paced flavor of the original Four Horsemen than the speedier Megadeth formula. The acoustic intro, the tranquil built up, and the sped up finale with a soulful if virtuosic solo. 'Things will be better' oddly sounds quite similar to 'so let it be written' from \u201cCreeping Death\u201d. Perhaps it would be best to separate things, but it is impossible to not make comparisons, especially when I feel this album kinda gets over-lauded not because of its musical merits, but because of its commercial brand. The vile-spitting but dumbly written \u201cLiar\u201d and closer, anti-P.M.R.C. jab \u201cHook in Mouth\u201d cant\u2019 hide the fact Mustaine wasn't particularly inspired for this one in the songwriting department, as there are painfully few riffs or solos that really standout, most of them appearing within the first 8 minutes of this under-35-minute excuse for an album. \n\nBut Mustaine is not the only one to blame. The rhythmic section feels particularly standard and uneventful, Ellefson's usual pounding charisma nowhere to be found. Coat everything in mediocre production vales (somewhat made a bit more acceptable for the Capital Records reissue), and you've got yourself a subpar thrash album released in what is arguably metal's finest year, from a masterpiece per band point of view. Luckily for the world, Rust in Peace would be unleashed two years after this, probably the greatest thrash metal album of the 90s, and a top ten all timer. But the fact can't be ignored, So Far, So Good\u2026 So What! stands as one of the weakest albums released during the 80s by one of the so-called 'Big 4' of American thrash metal. And thus, a simple and unequivocal truth is revealed, fellas\u2026 Metallica Megadeth. At least, in terms of their classic legacy.\n",
        "\nThe aptly titled Th1rt3en is the band's thirteenth studio album and features thirteen songs. (Anvil did a similar thing a few years back with This is Thirteen that included thirteen songs.) Th1rt3en is the first studio album since 2001 on which co-founding member and bass guitarist player Dave Ellefson performs.\n\nMegadeth have been in a solid groove since 2007's United Abominations. The past few albums have grabbed influences from the band's early years and mixed them with the more melodic stylings of their 90's outputs. While none of these albums sound exactly like the next, they all sound like Megadeth. Dave Mustaine has fallen into a comfortable groove and knows what Megadeth should sound like. So, even though the songs run the gamut from the more melodic to the fast and frantic, none seem out of place. Megadeth's Th1rt3en continues this trend. There\u2019s some parts that are influenced by Peace Sells and Rust in Peace with a few bits of the hooky melodic metal of Youthanasia but just a few.\n\nThe compact disc opens with a track that is a balls-to-the-wall thrasher titled Sudden Death. The song is not exactly new, as it was originally released in 2010 and originally recorded for the Guitar Hero: Warriors of Rock video game. Since I am not a gamer and never bothered to download the song, it is absolutely new to me. The song features a mean guitar riff and is peppered with furious guitar licks throughout. If this song had been included on Rust in Peace or even Countdown to Extinction, it would have fit in perfectly. There are a few other tracks included that are from the bands past. Black Swan was originally released as a bonus track for members of the band's fan club who pre-ordered United Abominations. It's a good track but does not deserve to be more than just an obscure b-side. Millennium of the Blind was demoed by the band in the early 90s and turned up a bonus tracks on the remastered Youthanasia. Its decent but does not go beyond just okay.\n\nNew World Order has quite the history. It was originally written by the Rust in Peace line-up during the Clash of the Titans Tour in 1991. The song was demoed and not released on a Megadeth album until 2004, where it was released as a bonus track on Youthanasia. Instead underground thrashers Z\u00f6etrope recorded the song and released it on their 1993 album. The Megadeth version of the song was eventually released and included on the 1999 Duke Nukem soundtrack. It's a fantastic track with a huge hook and a groove-based riff that recalls songs like Angry Again and Symphony of Destruction.\n\nPublic Enemy No. 1 is the first single from the album and is definitely one of the album's more melodic tracks, though to be honest, I think that New World Order might have been a better choice for a single. Although both tracks are well worth hearing. Songs such as Never Dead is one of the pure thrashers on the album. This song is simple, direct and straightforward, driven by a fast guitar riff and some scattered double bass parts. It was surely inspired by the band's 2010 tour and their live performances of the entire Rust in Peace album. Mustaine\u2019s toothy sneer is as prevalent and nasty as ever, attacking various political and social issues such as in We the People and once again New World Order. Guns, Drugs, & Money addresses the unrest in Mexico currently but really is a weaker song on here. Another weak song is called Deadly Nightshade. It really is mediocre although the excellent Public Enemy No. 1 was written about 1920s gangster Al Capone.\n\nTh1rt3en is a good collection of songs. Just not great. It certainly sees the band repeating itself a bit, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. For some, Megadeth's current groove might be a bad thing. Megadeth in the 80's and 90's were a bit unpredictable. However, those like myself that have found the past few albums to be completely enjoyable will also find Th1rt3en to be equally enjoyable.\n",
        "\nBut with this record it won't seem that way. Dystopia is the fifteenth full-length studio album from Megadeth and features an interesting new band line-up with Angra\u2019s Kiko Loureiro and Lamb of God\u2019s excellent drummer Chris Adler. As is the norm, Dave Mustaine still writes a huge percentage of the music, so despite the new line-up, it doesn\u2019t suddenly sound much like Angra or Lamb Of God either, although you can definitely pick up on their involvement during certain parts of songs. \n\nAs might be expected, Dystopia is more or less the same Megadeth album that the last four ones have been, with about the same level of similarity and similar forays into pushing the boundaries of their songwriting. It is slightly heavier and much more consistent than the more then slightly disappointing Super Collider, its slightly more consistent than Thirteen and a bit thrashier than 2007\u2019s United Abominations. There are a few moments where the band pushes beyond the normal Megadeth output, such as a the piano and spoken-word at the end of Poisonous Shadows or the Spanish guitar introduction on Conquer Or Die. However, for the most part the band sticks close to what Megadeth does best. In fact, the closest album to this one is Endgame. As such, Dystopia is easily one of the best Megadeth albums in the last eight years. \n\nThe album starts off with a punch in the face! It is easily one of the band's best songs and should be included in their live set for years to come. This is the closest the band have come to being the thrash band that we saw on Rust In Peace. As well, the title track is reminiscent of Hanger 18 with its straight-forward riffing and song structure. Loureiro presents is felt in this song with his guitar licks fitting along alongside Mustaine\u2019s vicious riffing. Fatal Illusion is just a heavy song! This is one of those songs that proves that you don't need to be down-tuned two and three steps to be the heaviest band on the planet! It's all about writing heavy riffs, which is exactly what you get here. Poisonous Shadows takes Megadeth into the power metal landscape. Though I didn't check the liner notes, if Kiko had any songwriting credits at all, it would be on this song. Much like Angra there is an almost symphonic feel to the song and features some stellar, virtuoso guitar playing and some fast drum triplets from Alder. The album ends with a cover of Fear\u2019s Foreign Policy which fits in well thematically and with the general vibe of the album. \n\nOverall, the album doesn\u2019t particularly have any stand-out tracks or obvious attempts a hit singles, unlike some past album. Dystopia isn\u2019t an album with a few highlights and a bunch of filler. Rather is very consistent and is filled with spectacular guitar playing and brilliant riffing. The guitars are sharp and lethal, the vocals have the gnarly Dave snarl and the lyrics are typically political in nature. This is \"business as usual\" for Megadeth, and why not? This album should please most Megadeth fanatics who are craving more of the same from the metal mongers.\n",
        "\nMegadeth return in 2009 with their fastest, heaviest release since 1992. No, not 1990. Had Endgame been the follow up to Rust or even Countdown to Extinction, metal fans around the world would have hailed them as the kings of thrash metal. Instead, it was 2009, and thrash metal has become somewhat of a trend in the metal underground and Megadeth have chosen to show the followers just exactly who the leaders are. \n\nEndgame opens up with a short instrumental shredfest in which Chris Brodererick and Dave Mustaine trade off leads. This seriously has that same angry aggression that was heard on those early Megadeth albums. The song has immediate comparisons to Into the Lungs of Hell with it\u2019s angry punk riffs and blazing guitar work. The fucking wonderful thrash of Dialect Chaos then opens way into This Day We Fight, a fast and furious thrasher with Dave\u2019s cocky snarl. To me, these first two songs sound like Dave once again has something to prove. The follow-up 44 Minutes is a more mid-paced track, yet has every bit of the attitude that the first two songs had. 44 Minutes is the first song on the CD that I found myself remembering immediately. The hook on this song is more immediate than many of the faster songs. Head Crusher, on the other hand, completely blew me away. Now this is what I want to hear out of Megadeth! This song is a fast thrasher recalling the greatness of Hanger 18 and was an excellent choice for the first single. 1,320 has a very old school feel with some riffs that would have been at home on Kill \u2018Em All or Killing is My Business. If you don't believe me just listen to it. Bodies and The Hardest Part of Letting Go are more melodic tracks sounding a bit closer to the material on Youthanasia. The Hardest Part of Letting Go is a dark, acoustic ballad but I don't recommend it. Take my word for it and skip this track. Bodies is a much better experiment that should be listened to and would have probably fit on Youthanasia.\n\nOne thing that makes Endgame so enjoyable is all the lead guitar work. There are leads peppered throughout this CD, with more than half the leads belonging to shredder Chris Broderick. A nice introduction to the newbie in this ever changing line-up. It\u2019s also notable that the production is outstanding. Unlike some other recent releases, Endgame isn\u2019t so loud and compressed that it sounds like your speakers are blown. While each instrument is heard clearly, the overall mix isn\u2019t overly clean and the guitar tones are simply crushing. As usual for Megadeth, there are themes of war, violence, politics and end times. The usual thrash metal fare I suppose, \n\nEndgame is an outstanding offering from Megadeth and proves that they still have plenty of life in them. I've liked everything Megadeth have put out in the last few years since The World Needs A Hero, so take my opinion with that in mind. Yes I was one of those who thought The World Needs A Hero was very decent. Perhaps my excitement about this album will die over time, but for now, I\u2019m cranking it and loving it.\n",
        "\nIn the past couple years I have known people who have seen Megadeth live three times. My friends say all three times they put on a great show. The band was tight and their set list was peppered with a collection of all their past works. In all three shows, Dave played some new songs from United Abominations. I always thought the new material fit into their set well and sounded as good, if not better than some of their newer material. \n\nWeeks before United Abominations was released officially, the songs had been leaked onto the internet. I decided to take the old fashion approach and actually wait for the album to be released so that I could crack that cellophane off and give the album a solid listen. I did the same for System Has Failed and was disappointed. Whereas System Has Failed fell way to close to the melodic side of things (al la Youthanasia but no where near that record in quality), United Abominations holds some of the melodic nature of Megadeth while leaning slightly closer to the thrashier, Rust In Peace timeframe. \n\nThat's not to say that United Abominations is Rust In Peace II either. Far from it. Rather what happened is Dave added some speed and thrash elements back into the band's song writing. The best examples of this are probably album opener Sleepwalker, Never Walk Alone, Your Dead and the second half of Burnt Ice. The riffs and songwriting seem a bit more complex, certainly moreso than anything since Rust In Peace. Glen Drover's leads are simply outstanding. I also think that Dave has given us a lot of really good hooks, without sounding forced or cheesy. Tracks like Sleepwalker, Gears of War and United Abominations are reminiscent of some of the more memorable material on Countdown to Extinction.\n\nI also think that this album flows together as a whole very well, with one glaring exception, A Tout Le Monde (Set Me Free). I had read that this song was recorded as a b-side, but the record company insisted using it as a single since it features a duet with Cristina Scabbia. Personally, I like this song as it was originally recorded on Youthanasia. This version is a cool alternative, but it is clearly a b-side and in my opinion should have been released as such. Otherwise, United Abominations is exactly what I expect from Megadeth. I can't understand how any longtime fan of Megadeth wouldn't find something to like here. United Abominations isn't Rust In Peace II, but then who would want it to be? Why try to relive the past when the future sounds this good? As far as I'm concerned, Dave Mustaine has released a winner here.\n",
        "\nI have been a Megadeth fan since the very early 90s and over the years I have continued to follow them and to buy all their albums as new releases at least some of the time. Had a live album been released with the line-up of Mustaine, Ellefson, Marty Friedman and Nick Menza I would have rushed out to buy it too, even with the $20+ price tag. However, after canning Nick, and then Marty leaving, it's almost not the same band. I mean, Dave and Dave are Megadeth after all, but the line-up I described above, most fans would describe as the quintessential line-up and era of the band. Rude Awakening features the line-up of Mustaine, Ellefson, ex-Suicidal Tendencies drummer Jimmy DeGrasso and guitar virtuoso Al Pitrelli. So, because of this and the fact that most stores were selling this disc for well above $20, I couldn't bring myself to buy it as a new release. Even used copies were selling close to $20 on eBay and SecondSpin. Well, I finally picked up a copy of this with a price tag of about $18 way back over 15 years ago. Still a bit pricey, but more reasonable then well over $20. \n\nI haven't seen Megadeth live over the years but I know that they usually would put on a stellar performance regardless of the line-up. However, no one can deny that there was also a certain chemistry between the band that seems to be missing from this live set. Having said that, however, Rude Awakening is a far better career retrospect than the shoddy Capitol Punishment compilation and certainly a fine way for one of thrash metal's finest band's to go out at that time in early 2002.\n\nDave pulls out songs from every Megadeth album all the way back to the debut record. The band sounds tight throughout this disc. Several songs feature extended solos, including She-Wolf which includes a dual guitar jam by Dave and Al and a drum solo that bridges the top ten best Megadeth song Reckoning Day. I was totally stoked to hear Mechanix. Dave makes mention of there being two versions of this song, \"their version\" and \"our version.\" Of course when Dave says \"their version\" he is referring to Metallica's Four Horsemen that he wrote for the band before they gave him the boot in the early 80's and of course \"our version\" is the better version. I agree with that. Its better then The Four Horsemen. Overall, a good live album and one that will see many spins in my CD player. Megadeth will always be remembered as the kings of speed metal that they helped pioneer, and Rude Awakening is a testimony to that fact.\n",
        "\nBut also more then a few missteps along the way. Megadeth with the last three or four albums have been on a roller coaster ride of very good and simply just decent material with nothing really standing out. The music contained here on this compact disc is no different really. \n\nAfter releasing thirteen this record is what we got. I went into this release with expectations of it being better than thirteen. Overall it was almost up to par with that release. However nothing on Super Collider was as strong as the beginning of the former record. Of course I am referring to Sudden Death. The title track also being a good song. I liked the acoustic introduction.\n\nHowever this is not a review of that album. The few tracks on this album that impressed me such as Kingmaker, the title track and Forget to Remember were good enough to be stuck in my memory. No pun intended. But not much else really. Nothing about those songs really stands out. The main problem is not Dave Mustaine's vocals, they sound like usual and I have gotten used to that a long time ago. His vocals fits the music almost in a perfect way. In fact I don't know what the problem might be. It's certainly not the soloing on here. This is one thing this record has an abundance of. None of them are bad at all. Far from it. But the majority of the instruments on the rest of the album just sound phoned in. \n\nThe drumming is far from terrible however very confusing. It just sounds plain but also still very aggressive. Does that makes sense? Like for example the track Kingmaker. This song speeds around at a frantic pace. I can't find any faults with this track and the solos here may be the best on the record with the possibility of Don't Turn Your Back being a little better. In here you also get a guitar solo that is well worth hearing with above average guitar riffs. The song ends on a guitar solo and of course its a great one.\n\nThis release sure isn't bad. Nothing here is terrible or put together in a bad way. But this is a Megadeth release and just being good enough isn't great enough. This band has released several classics, and their glory days are not over however here we have a step in a wrong direction. A direction that was thankfully done away with on the next release.\n",
        "\nMegadeth's career reminds me of the roller coaster in Final Destination 3, it goes up and down and all around and killed several people in the process (the people being metalheads). Now i can enjoy some stuff off of \"Risk\" and \"Cryptic Writings\", but holy shit this album.\n\nSound wise Megadeth is going through Deja Vu again; after a disappointing reaction from critcs/fans for seemingly making a sequel to \"Risk\" (i.e. Super Collider) and goes back to a familiar mix of regular heavy and thrash metal. It certainly sounds more heavier and packs more punch then \"The World Needs a Hero\"; but in doing so they sacrificed the clean yet fuzzy tone of their guitars and bass, which we will get to in a bit.\n\nGoing into this album Mustaine said he wanted to make a political album in the rise of bullshit we call the 2016 Presidential Election; now I am all for that I mean Rage Against the Machine built an entire career off of it, but I think Dave must've been listening to too much \"InfoWars\", cause the ramblings he proceeds to go off on this album are ridiculous. A song like \"The Threat Is Real\" which is all about illegal immigration; features lines like \"A culture made of cover ups, Where leprosy touch their flesh\"; as if implying the U.S. has swept this whole situation under the rug, oh trust me Dave even before Trump was in the office the U.S. couldn't stop babbling on about this; and leprosy part combined with dave calling them \"vultures\" and saying \"Their cancer now eats us alive\", if that ain't blatant xenophobia then I dunno what is.\n\nBut then there's the basic and not all descriptive \"Fuck the System!\" songs like \"Post-American World\", \"The Emperor\" that any other band with edge could write. But then we got a couple outright laugh out loud songs like \"Look Who's Talking\" and the brilliantly titled \"Me Hate You\"; the former basically being a diss track to a former friend Musatine had (according to an interview he had on a SiriusXM's Liquid Metal) who was starting to question his personal beliefs regarding politics and people in general, after hearing this album I can completely understand!; and really Mustaine just makes himself look like a fool who fell for an obvious troll on YouTube, clearly the better route would've been to talk to this guy in person like an adult rather than write a diss track to try and show this guy any pity. Then with the latter being as basic it gets, a song about how much this certain unnamed individual makes Mustaine's blood boil, honestly Simple Plan could write this if they had a bit more edge.\n\nAnd even putting the lyrics aside the production on this album sounds like a mess, I haven't had an issue with previous Megadeth albums but this...it seems like they succumbed to the stereotypical \"modern metal production style\" where the guitars are heavily compressed and give this djent like \"CHUG CHUG CHUG\" riff style. Now Mustaine co-produced this album with some other bloke named Chris Rakestraw, the latter hasn't really produced any noticeable albums by noticeable bands so he probably hasn't gotten his craft down yet.\n\nBottom line this is more cringe-worthy than the soft metal most complained at them for doing on \"Risk\" and \"Super Collider\", I hope Mustaine pulls his head out of his ass or else him and Megadeth will forever be mocked due to a frontman that doesn't know when to keep his mouth shut.\n",
        "\nSure, I'll admit it. I'm long past my Megadeth phase, partially due to my self-insertion into the liberal political realm colliding with Dave Mustaine's egotistical and ignorant political views. There is no doubt in my mind, however, that they have had more impact on metal than most bands out there and they have created a (small) handful of albums that can be considered true classics. Dystopia is not one of those albums. Following the band's previous identity crisis-based trajectory and kicking a dozen people out along the way, Mustaine meticulously crafted which is probably not his worst album but definitely not his best.\n\nOkay, let's discuss sound quality. There's nothing wrong in this department, except that Mustaine seems to have made a final decision to completely discard the classic thrash guitar tones and replace them with digitally altered amp simulations that sound more like a high-powered vehicle than a guitar. The drums are clearly heard, but are obviously triggered. Bassist David Ellefson delivers in his style of playing whatever the guitarists are doing, so the quality of the bass is often hard to discern. The vocals have stellar production, but Mustaine fucks it up with his usual whiny, snarly style that somehow passes as singing. Overall, it sounds much like metalcore save a few thrashing riffs here and there. The mix is as good as can be, given all these problems.\n\nNow, the songs. Okay, it's true, there are some catchy choruses and stuff. But Mustaine has to ruin that too by throwing in his insolently bigoted lyrics that showcase his narrow-minded worldview. I'm all for musicians writing about politics, but not in a pro-Trump way. I have recently been boycotting Pantera due to Phil's actions at Dimebash, and I've created a list of black metal bands to avoid based on if they're openly racist. So given that, Dystopia is a little hard to stomach with songs like \"The Threat is Real\" and \"Post American World\" espousing xenophobic statements, and even the groovy chugs in \"Lying in State\" can't make up for the ignorant lyrics.\n\nSo you'll have noticed I gave this album a 45% instead of a 10%, and here's why. Kiko Loureiro, the brilliant guitarist from the Brazilian power metal band Angra. Kiko is by far the most talented musician to ever have played in Megadeth, and his solos are absolutely astounding. He fills every song with exotic-sounding lead runs and beautifully composed classical guitar arrangements. In fact, he's the only reason I still keep this album around. He's one of the best guitarists in all of modern metal, and that is a belief I will hold firmly for a very long time. While nowadays, most are obsessed with sweep-tap-Djent-sliding on their 17-string guitars, Kiko is one of the few that plays beautifully without sacrificing technicality, and vice versa. He even gets a whole song, \"Conquer or Die!\", just to himself, making it easily the best song on the album.\n\nSo over all: Only buy this album if you wanna hear some amazing guitar solos. Otherwise, stay the hell away from this abomination.\n",
        "\nIt's virtually impossible to review this album without comparing it to Metallica's self-titled \"Black Album.\" Many accuse Dave Mustaine of simply copying what Metallica during Megadeth's career. Getting kicked out of the band on another coast and being sent home did a real doozy on him. One can't help but wonder if Megadeth would have flat out ceased to exist if all of Metallica died in that 1986 bus crash. Mustaine's goal was to become a badder, more dangerous band than Metallica would ever be. One could argue that happened the second Killing Is My Business came out, but when Rust In Peace came out there simply was no comparison. Mustaine, Ellefson and his new members Marty Friedman and Nick Menza had put out a very, very strong contender for the greatest metal album of all time. The only people who didn't like the album were sloppy crust punks and who gives a fuck what they think? And Justice For All on the other hand, despite being Metallica's strongest commercial outing to date, received plenty of criticism from the metal community: The songs are too long; where's the bass; the production is awful; its Ride The Lightning again but even longer; etc. etc. From a subjective point of view, Mustaine had won the war. Except Mustaine wanted an objective victory. He wanted each of their heads on spikes for the world to see along with a big sign that said \"DONT EVER KICK ME OUT OF A BAND AGAIN.\" Except all that is illegal so the only objective way to measure such a victory is by dollars, cents, album sales, and awards. Megadeth certainly was no slouch in the first three categories for a thrash metal band, but the entire Rust In Peace had just lost a Grammy to Metallica for one single track and it was a fucking Queen cover! Thus began the commercialization of Megadeth.\n\nOn a lyrical level, this album is lock stock and barrel a much smarter, more socially relevant record than Metallica, even on a commercial level. Countdown to Extinction's first single was about how cult of personalities can manipulate their way into positions of power and have disastrous results for mankind, whereas Metallica's first single was about babies having scary nightmares. Countdown's second single was how corporate greed was driving farmers out of business, and Metallica's second single was about how someone can't grow and mature because they're afraid of being judged by their peers (projecting your bullshit much, Lars?). Countdown's third single dealt with social anxiety, schizophrenia and mental illness, and Metallica's third single was a glam metal power ballad. You get the drift. \n\nUnfortunately for Mustaine, there was a commercial ethos that he either never had the dishonesty to pursue, or never really figured out. The masses despise the smart, the educational, and being educated, preferring primal faux masculinity and James's ridiculous southern oohs and yeah-eahs. They like to think they're being deep and edgy without wanting to go the extra mile of alienating the alpha males at the bar. Lars, being the sniveling weasel that he is, recognized the stupidity of the masses and chose to exploit them. He was market savvy and schemed accordingly. Mustaine just wanted to turn venues upside down and deport all the glam bands to Uranus. For these reasons, Countdown could unfortunately never hope to achieve the commercial heights of the black album, despite being an all around more honest record.\n\nThe highlight of the album is without question album closer Ashes In Your Mouth. This raging thrasher just might be the greatest song of Megadeth's career for the simple reason that if you were to put it on any other Megadeth album, especially the classics, it would be considered the best song on the respective record, the only question being by how many sonic miles (mileage would of course vary by the record). Other respective thrashers include Skin O My Teeth and High Speed Dirt, great songs that wouldn't quite take top honors on say, Peace Sells, but certainly wouldn't stick out as turkeys either. Nonetheless, the album is yet another victim of the CD age, e.g. it goes on for too long. Plus during that critical moment of the audience beginning to look at their watches, Psychotron and Captive Honour just don't deliver. Bonus track Crown of Worms would have been a much stronger (and shorter) song to place between High Speed Dirt and Ashes In Your Mouth, giving the album more tightness and meat.\n\nCountdown To Extinction is a fine hybrid of thrash and traditional metal. If you're looking for the more dangerous, fiery successor to Rust In Peace, you aren't going to find that here nor likely anywhere in metal. But you will find a great collection of solid rockers whose messages are sadly more relevant today than they were in 1992.\n",
        "\nWhich original thrash band's debut begins with piano? It's one of those trivia questions you just expect to be asked and thank god I'm telling you the answer, because it's Megadeth people! Dave Mustaine's jumped-up Metallica also-rans didn't exactly rip off their Bay Area rivals by making Killing Is My Business...and Business Is Good!, certainly not if one were expecting 'Metal Militia' to jump out of the speakers the moment you hit play, since this is a few yards east (or west, it doesn't really matter) of Hetfield and co., playing more with speed metal brought kicking and screaming in through your front window (see potted plant story) than any actual nascent thrash. Sure, so I'm a big Megadeth fan and think that they had the creative edge on Metallica by a long shot, while also never succumbing to an overblown ambition that needed to lard up songs to nearly 10 minutes in order to pass up an album as forward-thinking. This album is a white-knuckle ride of rough edges and raw ideas that gets through its tempestuous 31 minutes on those qualities alone.\n\nRight from the start of Megadeth's album career, Mustaine decided to do things differently, proving very quickly that he was the finest metal guitarist in the city and not afraid to flash his fingers as well as that big ol' mane of ginger hair, combining the two areas of riffing and lead work in a honed team that Chris Poland proved himself more than capable of supporting. The manner in which songs like 'Skull Beneath the Skin' have no clearly defined \"solo sections\" shows the band's thinking clearly, with the two guitarists shooting licks and mini-leads across the chaotic verses, while David Ellefson is unafraid to join the party with basslines that lurch and shift through the rhythm guitar, particularly on the rougher earlier mix that I'm reviewing. Gar Samuelson is in on the action too, playing about with beats on different toms and snares that leave just about every other rhythm section from 1985 looking comatose from lack of energy.\n\nIf you want to source Megadeth's originality on this album, the place to go is probably 'These Boots', which is of course also the prime \"what the fuck?\" moment of the release since it's a cover of Nancy Sinatra's staple, though one that includes copious whammy bar abuse, several head-crawling speed metal riffs, and a set of lyrics that differs from the original only in the speed of their delivery and the insertion of lines like \"You've been kissing when you ought to be screwing\". That's how much of a fuck Dave gives about what you were expecting. Naturally, there are bits and pieces that you might have heard from Kill 'Em All, but not nearly as much as you've been told and sounding very different with the tomcat howl and blitzkrieg leads that are unique to this group. Also, a minor point of contention is that a few of the ideas would crop up again in similar form on the next Megadeth album Peace Sells...But Who's Buying? although retrospectively penalizing a lack of freshness seems rather harsh on my part.\n\nI guess it's important to decide whether this still stacks up in 2018 (since 33 years is rather an eternity in heavy metal terms) and it's definitely still exciting to give 'Chosen Ones' a blast even if the production robs it of the edge it deserves and turns it into a jangly racket of speed, like The Cure got hyped on amphetamines and thought that they wouldn't be let out of the rehearsal room until they had gone over 200bpm. Some of the more atmospheric parts get swallowed in that jangly production, especially the menacing opening of 'Looking Down the Cross', which is the only song that troubles five minutes. Everything else wastes little time in getting down to riffing, either stomping through some 'Wake Up Dead' style grooves or rushing like pure adrenaline without worrying about the finish line. With just eight tracks and such a brief running time, it's a relief to hear that nothing is excess, nor do any of the songs disappoint; however, this seems to fly by so quickly that I would be in favour of another track or a slightly expanded running time on the likes of 'Rattlehead' and the title track.\n\nNevertheless, it's a sign of clear quality that can make such a whirlwind experience of a rickety old album, so it's hats off to Mustaine's boys that this album is practically essential and still sounds sloppily skilful as all get out. Compared to the more polished and finished Peace Sells, this gives away a few yards, though arguably does a whole lot more than 1988's So Far, So Good...So What! with a similar formula, ensuring that the songs are packed to bursting point with furiously aggressive and melodic content. Despite sounding more like a really great demo than a debut proper, Killing Is My Business is still a great speed thrash release in its own right.\n",
        "\nCryptic Writings is Megadeth\u2019s answer to Metallica\u2019s controversial, self-titled release; it is a very disappointing record to a lot of fans who either want the incessant thrashing of Killing Is My Business or the technical and melodic heavy metal of Countdown To Extinction. While such disappointment is understandable, this particular release does have a few charms, unlike the misfire that was Risk, a few years later. Like the Black Album, it contains several tracks, which if released as a mini-song compilation, would have made a killer EP. The producer of the album is one Dan Huff, who is a former member of 80s AOR band, Giant. Huff obviously has a knack in bringing a pop sensibility to any song as proven by his resume, working as session guitarist for an eclectic group of clients, from Whitney Houston to Faith Hill (I am indebted to Wikipedia for this info). Obviously, his production style is the missing ingredient Dave Mustaine was looking for, to level the playing field against his eternal rivals, Metallica. Huff is the key to producing the album\u2019s mostly bland, inoffensive sounding songs geared for radio airplay. \n\nWhat Dave wanted to do on this album is to record songs that would go toe-to-toe with his ex-band mates\u2019 chart hits. The previous release, Youthanasia, did not quite achieve what he wanted in terms of sales and popularity, given that it had a single called \u201cA tout le monde\u201d which was obviously trying to compete with Hetfield and Co.\u2019s \u201cThe Unforgiven\u201d. In order to outdo James and Lars at their game (which at the time were coping with the furor and backlash from fanboys highly disappointed by their Load disc), Dave had to further commercialize the signature Deth sound for casual metal listeners in order to achieve his dream of chart domination. The dubious marketability of the material contained in Cryptic Writings though would seem trivial as 1997 was a turning point in the masses\u2019 taste in music as proven by the saturation of the airwaves and MTV\u2019s excessive rotation of videos by the Spice Girls and the soon emerging boyband movement led by the Backstreet Boys. Grunge was virtually dead by this point in time (but was soon to be supplanted by nu-metal) and people were sick and tired of pop songs masquerading as loud music (which grunge obviously is). They wanted something light and fluffy like \u201cBarbie Girl\u201d by Aqua or \u201cDon\u2019t Speak\u201d by No Doubt, not the depressing and dreary atmosphere of songs like \u201cA Secret Place\u201d.\n\nThe album starts strong with single \u201cTrust\u201d; the song begins with an ominous drum fill from Nick Menza, later followed by a sorrowful guitar passage before the main riff kicks in. \u201cLost in a dream\u2026\u201d Mustaine croons above the cacophony; his voice here is surprisingly easy on the ears, in contrast to his harsh and spiteful 80s vocal delivery. In the mid to latter section of the song, a bridge comprised of mourning guitars paves the way for Marty\u2019s guitar solo which represents the song\u2019s climax. \u201cTrust\u201d is noteworthy in that it quite rivals another Megadeth power ballad, \u201cIn My Darkest Hour\u201d for its dynamics and song structure. It also achieved what \u201cA tout le monde\u201d failed to do as a song tailored for mass consumption or at least as a single, aimed for a top forty slot. Another commendable song which is quite outside the winning Megadeth formula of thrashing guitars and technical solos is the quasi-ballad, \u201cA Secret Place\u201d. An anguished ode to isolation, this particular track succeeds in being a worthy contender to Metallica\u2019s \u201cSad but True\u201d. What I really like about this song is the chorus riff which is simplistic and cyclical in construction but is very expressive and poignant. The remastered version though ruined the \u201cUoh! Uoh! Uoh!\u201d part before the chorus by drowning it in some kind of layered sound effect, which took away from the original and overall emotional impact of the track. \n\nAfter the two notable songs, we go to the recordings that truly make this album the equivalent of the Black Album in its notoriety as an insipid and boring disc. The first offender in this regard is obviously \u201cUse the Man\u201d which is one of several songs here that were quite a chore to listen to. It starts in similar fashion to \u201cSet the World Afire\u201d: a song sample of a Beatles sounding ditty serves as an introduction before the actual song begins. The song tries hard to channel a neurotic mindset but the conviction sounds fake and forced; in fact, it comes off as corny; Dave's vocal delivery of the line \"he hung his head inside the noose!\" in the latter portion of the track is just one of the few hilarious moments off the album. Which gets you to thinking if the genuine angst of \"A Secret Place\" was written and recorded under a bad combo of alcohol and hard drugs because he was unable to duplicate this morose feeling with the other brooding song on the disc. Okay, so Dave's just projecting the thoughts of the narrator in his songs, it is the mark of a true artist to be able to express honestly, the emotions and feelings demanded by the material (this is especially true in movie actors, for example); with relative success though, it seems Dave has real difficulty trying to conjure negative emotions in a lot of his mid 90s work. As a rockstar, he has enough money in the bank to buy several mansions and a brewery in Spain or a fleet of Rolls Royce, he has a hot wife and two beautiful children, surely nobody in that state could be that glum or miserable (but is definitely an ingrate for sure). Unlike in the early to late 80s where pure, undistilled rage and despair fueled songs like \"Set the World Afire\" and \"In My Darkest Hour\", the decade of political correctness saw Dave merely pandering to the whiny attitude of suburban slackers and Ivy League college kids. These types of songs were an attempt by the band to win the affections of bi-polar rock fans who were deeply into Nirvana and Marilyn Manson (Kinda unrelated but Dave in the 90s, wore a lot of flannels, in a deliberate move to ape the fashion sense of grunge musicians. Perhaps it is a way to fool grunge fans into buying his albums). Aside from \"Use the Man\", \u201cHave Cool, Will Travel\u201d is another representative of the album\u2019s weak, pop orientated tracks, sounding like a triter version of Black Sabbath\u2019s \u201cNever Say Die\u201d; it is too happy sounding, to be honest. \n\nWithout a doubt, the record\u2019s hodgepodge of stale hard rock (\u201cMastermind\u201d), radio friendly filler tracks (\u201cI\u2019ll Get Even\u201d and \u201cAlmost Honest\u201d which are definite growers and are kind of noteworthy for their candid honesty) and the occasional average but good song (\u201cSin\u201d) would\u2019ve made the album into an ideal frisbee if not for the four authentic metal tracks on the disc. \u201cThe Disintegrators\u201d is classic speed thrash and has an unmistakable Killing Is My Business vibe; \u201cShe-Wolf\u201d earns a lot of brownie points for its progression and subtle power metal influences; \u201cVortex\u201d is epic arena metal goodness while \u201cFFF\u201d is a tantalizing, short but sweet thrash/heavy metal fusion. This four song attack is very similar to the quadruple punch of the Black Album\u2019s \u201cThrough the Never\u201d, \u201cOf Wolf and Man\u201d, \u201cThe God That Failed\u201d and \u201cStruggle Within\u201d.\n\nWhile Cryptic Writings may not have been a full-on return to Megadeth\u2019s roots, it is indeed a natural progression from what the group was doing on Youthanasia. It\u2019s not as ridiculously bad as Risk but is basically MegaDave\u2019s Black Album though his ex-bandmates\u2019 eponymous effort is probably the better of the two because, at least, it did not have as many half-baked and stale radio songs. With alternative leaning songs and faceless, generic hard rock, Dave and his comrades do not quite achieve Matchbox 20 or Oasis levels of mainstream success but there are a few catchy and accessible tracks on this record that could serve as gateway songs for the beginning metal fan.\n",
        "\nOh, what do we have here? The first in a string of thrash metal classics? Darn, you'd think that wouldn't need explaining... oh my bad it doesn't. So for anyone who managed to miss out on the debut of one of the biggest metal bands, somehow clicked this review instead of the other dozen or so reviews and is now being introduced to the album via literary components rather than actually listening to it, I gave it a 90% because it's great album, a good contender for Megadeth's best if I were being honest.\n\nThis album is great because it was forged completely in betrayal, venom and ambition. After being kicked out of his former band by people he thought to be his friends, replaced and then hearing songs that he was largely involved in the creation of performed by aforementioned band and guitarist one can expect Dave Mustaine would be a bit angry, the fact is he made a point not just to out do another band but to outdo his own material. He gathered the most talented musicians he could get on board, together they composed some of the most vicious and fastest riffs and technically demanding solos of the time. They coupled the aggressive angry drumming of thrash metal with jazz tricks to create something unique and demanding. They created an album that was intricate but also venomous and full of hostilities, they broke new ground.\n\nIt's more than just ground breaking though, they wrote something that stands the test of time, even in over 30 years of thrash metal mania this album provides riffs that stand out and are memorable and remain influential. The sheer venom in Mustaine's vocals is rarely reproduced in other bands, or even by Megadeth later in their career. Songs here remain as live staples even amongst the massive rock hits the band would later create and there are still debates as to whether The Mechanix or The Four Horsemen is the better version of the song.\n",
        "\nMegadeth is one of those bands most of us have probably loved at some point. Dave Mustaine is one of the greatest composers and guitarists of all time, having more or less invented thrash riffing as well as set several standards for it. These days, however, it is a whole nother story. While Megadeth is still one of the most popular metal bands today, the ongoing decade has not been a strong one for them musically. In fact, everything they've released since Endgame (2009) has been very mediocre if not plain out bad, and the albums that came out during the previous decade weren't exactly masterpieces either.\n\nAfter the band's previous album, the epic failure known as Super Collider, Dave lost half his band (guitarist Chris Broderick and drummer Shawn Drover) and decided to use his bitterness (seemingly due to their sudden exits) to make a real thrash album once more. To make things even more hyping, Dave recruited Lamb of God's Chris Adler to lay down the drum tracks. It's easy to see how any die-hard Megadeth fans would get stoked about this album after all this, and they sure did as well. But like the pessimistic realist I can (and tend) to be, I look at it all with reserved hope.\n\nAs Dystopia finally dropped fans got real excited and the album met with overall praise. Personally, however, I thought it was just more or less the same boring crap Megadeth had been putting out for a few years already. Just like with the band's previous few releases, this is just another modern and stale thrash release with the usual complex guitar solos, drumming and general instrumentation you'd expect from Megadeth, with nothing being very memorable. That's just the problem with this album - it's essentially soulless. This is mostly due to Dave Mustaine's horrible vocals and the plastic production which, of course, is brick-walled and makes the album clip badly throughout its duration. The songwriting also feels generally uninspired and forced. So much for all the hype of having fresh blood in the band, eh?\n\nAt the end of the day Dystopia is nothing but another turd in Megadeth's catalogue which has, strangely, met with such great acclaim. If compared to Super Collider alone, it's a masterpiece indeed, but if compared to almost anything Megadeth did before 2010, it's just one of their worst releases by far. It literally adds nothing of interest to the band's catalogue except that it's a forced attempt at going back to their thrash roots (yet again). Although things were somewhat made out to put the blame on Broderick and Drover for the direction the band had taken on the previous few releases, a real Megadeth fan will always know that Dave Mustaine and no one but him runs the show. That's exactly what I was thinking when all the hype for this album was being bred, and just like I predicted they took another musical direction but maintained the same old tired songwriting. It's just not the same being a poor, angry and rebelling 25-year-old thrasher versus being a 55-year-old wealthy multi-millionaire, and this release makes that fact painfully obvious.\n\nIn my perhaps overly pessimistic but honest opinion, Megadeth should've hung it up years ago and gone out gracefully. Instead they are now into their third strike of releasing crap. It's sad to witness one of your old favorite bands go down this road like so many others have done already. For what it's worth, the title-track was a bit fun and the album's cover art is bad-ass, but that's really about it. What can I say? If you're new to Megadeth, do not start with this release. If you're already affiliated with them, do not expect too much of it. Megadeth is just a dystopian remnant of its former self at this point.\n",
        "\nTrying to pretend that Megadeth didn't release an album with a front cover apparently showing a still from a '90s Japanese children's cartoon is more my concern than whether this is thrash or a return to form or politically invalid. In any case, I'm 10 years late, so there's not really any logic to wading into any of those battles anymore. What I will say is that I'm a fan of anything that Megadeth has ever done that has been either fast, snotty, or musically precocious, while consistency and reasonable production quality have also been in my mind when deciding on the group's worthwhile output. That means that I don't really like almost any of the '90s music put out by ol' ginger and his bunch of ruffians, nor do I feel that the weak and flim-flam albums preceding this one are worth anything more than a passing interest in my book. Dave Mustaine has been \"coming back\" from the band's post-Youthanasia slump with every release since 1994, but I would put United Abominations down as a little more of a comeback than most of the others.\n\nIn the first place, pairing up with Glen Drover was a good move that led to an even more comeback-ish album in the subsequent Endgame, repairing Megadeth's status as a guitar band. Even if the riffs aren't up to scratch that often, the leads are proof that Mustaine was focused on playing intricate melodic metal that seeps out (I was going to write \"erupts\" but nothing is quite that flamboyant here) on tracks like 'Washington Is Next!' and 'Blessed Are the Dead', the latter of the two in the smooth and winding riffing as well as the solos. The addition of rhythm duo James LoMenzo and Shawn Drover also livens things up a bit on some of the more forcible cuts, 'Pray for Blood' having all the percussive presence of a boot to the skull, especially handy since the strings are in stomping mood, the bass grunting and swearing as the guitarists ply big size 12s in stop-start fashion before drizzling gasoline solos all around the body.\n\nWhat keeps United Abomination down (and remember you can't keep a good man down) is that it isn't very consistent, showering shots all around a target that one would consider to be wide enough with the number of styles Megadeth have gone through since the beginning. I mean, I get it, 'A Tout Le Monde (Set Me Free)' was remade as a single and wasn't supposed to make anyone happy who had heard the original, but it didn't turn out as either a great showcase of Megadeth's contemporary sound nor a fascinating duet with Cristina Scabbia. I guess the idea was to get fans of each band into the other, but I could have told you that that was a stupid idea even on paper, since Lacuna Coil were then an increasingly poppy post-gothic rock/alternative band with not many guitar solos, while Mustaine was just powering back up on the guitar stakes and could barely hold onto a harmony if it was attached to the trigger of a gun that was pointing at James Hetfield. Other than that, there are some curiously soft moments that are not rock but just...soft, particularly in the title track, 'Never Walk Alone...a Call to Arms', and 'Blessed Are the Dead'. These tend to miss the mark, owing to the fact that they seem pretty limp and lacking in conviction.\n\nThe songs that go either for the jugular, like those late on in the album, or towards less obvious areas, such as the opening pair and 'Gears of War', are all the better for it. I'm quite a fan of 'Amerikhastan' despite people claiming that the narration ruins it, finding that it's a much more fun romp than the subject matter should make it and a style that Mustaine eventually perfected on 'Look Who's Talking' from Dystopia. The direct punchiness of 'Burnt Ice', 'You're Dead', and 'Pray for Blood' make a strong case for the album before it closes, while 'Sleepwalker' is probably the best thing on offer, seeing as it has the most intriguing lyrics on an album of overdone diatribes, not to mention making the count in terms of nice riffs and some of the highest-ranking solo action available on this release. On the subject of those lyrics, though, it fits in with the whole children's cartoon cover that Dave would try to go for the American establishment (and/or the UN, which isn't terribly clear), since that was the done thing to do a decade ago, as if these singers were kids rebelling against their parents.\n\nI'm not quite as thrilled with United Abominations as I was with Endgame or Dystopia (or even Th1rt3en come to that), but I know why I've always had the impression that this was a strong Megadeth effort. That's because it starts and ends strongly, with at least five or six good songs seemingly magnetized away from the slightly dull mid-section, meaning that I've mostly focused on those parts of the experience and paid little attention to the dross in between. However, tonight my girlfriend phoned me during that weaker spell, so I dwelled more heavily on the downtime (you can tell I was listening to my girlfriend, right?) and have come to see that this is only a minor success. In any case, United Abominations won't be totally left out of the Megadeth mixtape, and that's something I guess.\n",
        "\nJust as the thrash era was coming to a close, Megadeth managed to squeeze out one last onslaught before falling into the valley of commercial-minded post-grunge metal that consumed practically every 80s thrash band in the following decade. And what a parting shot it was. Rust in Peace finds Dave Mustaine at the height of his creative power. Stuffed with theatrical, ambitious playing, creative riffs and a chemistry between the instrumentalists that scientists say technically counts as a form of magic, Rust in Peace is the high water mark of the original California thrash scene.\n\nMegadeth has never been the band one points to as an example when somebody asks \u201cWhat is this 'thrash metal' you're always going on about, Brian?\u201d Despite fitting into the genre's mold, Mustaine's always had a way of putting riffs together in a fashion that didn't quite fit in with what his West Coast contemporaries were doing and a habit of going all out with his soloing. With this in mind, Rust in Peace is the Megadethiest album of the band's career. The riffing is unconventional but never seems outright bizarre or lacking in energy (just listen to the madcap bouncing throughout most of 'Poison Was the Cure'). The soloing, meanwhile, is frenetic, complicated, and flashy. And it\u2019s everywhere. Mustaine and Friedman, then a newcomer to the band, cram solos seemingly wherever they can. People who would criticize the 948 minutes of guitar solos in the second half of \u2018Hangar 18\u2019 as excessive are right but it\u2019s that sort of over-the-top showmanship that makes this album such a delight. \n\nOn the mic, Dave Mustaine is of course not as skilled. Luckily, Dave knew what his limitations were. Despite some incredibly fast singing in \u2018Poison Was the Cure\u2019, he never ventures too far out of his sneering comfort zone and he always manages to fit the mood. Nick Menza, meanwhile, was a powerhouse drummer, which is made perfectly clear in his energetic playing here. Rounding out the ensemble, David Ellefson is equally monstrous on the bass and indispensable for some of the album's tensest moments, like the eerie crawl of 'Dawn Patrol' and the mounting panic in the into to the already-praised 'Poison Was the Cure'. This is sort of the ultimate thrash album for instrumentally-minded people, delivering a stampede of recognizable and invigorating riffs, an avalanche of great solos, and some busy bass and drum sections that round out the release. \n\nMustaine should also be commended for his refusal to use standard structuring in most of these songs. Some tracks eschew the whole verse-chorus-verse construction entirely and some stick a little closer to it but almost every track here at least has an instrumental section that seems to interrupt what might have otherwise been a predictable song. This lack of by-the-book construction allows the band to throw in plenty of unexpected treats, like the bombastic crescendo-building dash to the finish line that closes the final song and Marty Friedman's awesome Middle Eastern-sounding solo in the first half of 'Holy Wars...the Punishment Due'. \n\nIf anything at all negative can be said about this album, it's that the production leaves everything somewhat empty and sterile. The playing on this album though, renders this point moot because the passion, energy, and instrumental skill in the performances can't be covered up by a slightly dry production. And, hey, the bass is easy to pick out (and it's doing interesting stuff) so that's a plus. \n\nDespite being conceived for the sole purpose of being more metal than Metallica, Megadeth has never been about being faster/harder/heavier-than-thou. While many other bands were racing to see who could be the most intense, Mustaine took a refreshing approach that emphasized difficult, unconventional riffs and an emphasis on dazzling solos. Rust in Peace takes those excesses about as far as they can reasonably go and still ends up being brilliant. There's plenty of substance amid all the showboating on this monumental release. Rust in Peace is an indispensable treasure of the genre that spawned it and a definite must-have for anyone remotely interested in thrash metal.\n",
        "\nLiking Megadeth and liking this album are not necessarily the same thing. If you ask 100 metalheads whether they know Megadeth, most will say that they do, though when asked which songs they know by the band it's odds on that 90% of the songs mentioned will be from the first 10 years of the band and possibly the most recent 10, leaving quite a chunk of a 34 year career in the mental ditch at the side of the mind's highway. This album is buried pretty deep at the bottom of that ditch, not because it's the worst Megadeth album (chances are that accolade will go to Risk, but there are plenty of contenders), just for the fact that it came at about the lowest point in Dave Mustaine's career and doesn't outright suck, meaning that most people will probably forget it rather than ladle shit onto it. Therefore, liking Megadeth and liking The World Needs a Hero are not the same thing: you're more likely to like this if you like Mustaine, since there's a lot more words on the songs here than on most of his other releases, some of which are fairly silly and makes me dub this \"the verbal diarrhoea Megadeth album\".\n\nIn case you hadn't gathered from my moniker for The World Needs a Hero, the emphasis has moved away from guitars and onto vocals, which is accompanied by the same kind of rockier style as the previous two albums with a dose of the catchy metal riffing that made Youthanasia at least a passable excuse for no longer playing thrash. Explaining the sound for people who haven't listened to Megadeth is a little awkward, since Mustaine's voice is distinctive and incomparable - a kind of snotty snarl that practically talks its way through some songs - and the music jumbles together influences like Diamond Head ('When' uses several of the band's riffs in a kind of collage), Alice Cooper (I can sort of imagine him singing a few of these cuts), White Zombie (it's odd, but the guitar grooves and heavy sampling makes me think of them), and the period of Metallica when everything was going wrong, since this is rather a confused album in the same vein as Load. There are some songs that play out as catchy singalongs ('Moto Psycho' and 'Dread and the Fugitive Mind'), some that attempt to go deeper into metal spheres with some heavier riffing ('Burning Bridges' and 'Disconnect'), and others that experiment more wilfully ('1000 Times Goodbye' and the title track), sometimes successfully, sometimes less so.\n\nThere are quite a few things to dislike about this approach, the first of which is the redundancy of two of the same string players who brought us songs like 'Hangar 18', who are certainly not used to their full potential. Al Pitrelli, though not quite Megadeth's best guitarist, was surely capable of much more than the lame medium that is required of him on songs like 'Burning Bridges' and the title track, where a couple of average riffs and a perfunctory solo are enough to earn him his bread, Mustaine never letting rip with anything more special either. It's not really a matter of pace either, because Megadeth hadn't played fast for several years and sounded decent enough on Countdown for Extinction, but the nasty rhythms used when 'Recipe for Hate...Warhorse' decides to hot up neuter any potential excitement by stumbling on a childishly simple guitar riff, made all the more distasteful due to the production, which brings me to my second complaint. Never exactly fortunate in the studio, the rather weak, under-distorted guitar tone couples up to a flimsy lead tone, David Ellefson's vague sleepwalking bass, and the dull thud of Jimmy DeGrasso's drums. Those mediocre sounds mean that all the more focus falls onto Mustaine's vocals, so that a song like 'Losing My Senses' practically falls apart from the combination of his uninterested delivery and his bandmate's uninspiring efforts. On this song, the lack of effort is especially obvious, since there's a grammar mistake left in the lyrics - \"Yesterday's answers has nothing to do / With today's answers\". Are answers not plural, Dave?!\n\nTrying to appreciate all of the songs on The World Needs a Hero is going to do your head in, so here's a guide about what's alright and what smells. First of all, the heavier tracks are not necessarily better, a point evidenced by the amazingly well-formed 'Promises', which begins as an acoustic ballad that includes atmosphere, emotion, and an insistent chorus. 'Moto Psycho' is the best of the heavy numbers, keeping things simple and efficient with a decent riff and more hooks than a fisherman, while 'Dread and the Fugitive Mind' is a treat for anyone who liked 'Sweating Bullets', and 'Return to Hangar' makes a modest effort to pay homage to 'Hangar 18' in a punkier style. Just don't expect too much shredding at the end. If you like listening to phone conversations, '1000 Times Goodbye' will suit you down to a tee, fitting several long excerpts of a break-up call into the chorus and latter verses, which should be cheesy but I actually sort of like. Sadly, the title track also does a line in phone calls (\"The White House is calling / Tell them I'll call them back\"), but fucks up just about everything and takes the title of \"shittiest thing available on this album\".\n\nTherefore, it's not easy to recommend that Megadeth fans check out The World Needs a Hero, nor is it obvious which other demographic could be enticed to willingly participate. What saves this from being actively poor for me is that, even though some of it is pretty bad, it's rarely boring or totally annoying, my face settling more for a permanent surprised expression as things just sort of happen for the best part of an hour. As such, you probably won't want to listen to this but it won't do you any harm.\n",
        "\nTo say that Metallica completely changed the playing field when it came to metal and more specifically, commercially successful metal is an understatement. Its influence on future heavy music aside, it opened the floodgates for multiple genre mainstays and their imitators to release albums that were a drastic change in direction. Following its 1991 release Anthrax went grunge, Sepultura went groove, and Megadeth, in all of Dave Mustaine's wide-eyed envy, took a similar approach to Metallica for this release. The two explore a lot of the same sonic territory, this came soon after Metallica and at an analogous point in Megadeth's career, and the two share a lot of the same flaws. And since the two are so similar, I'll get this out of the way - since people are so hasty to point out Metallica sold out and give the band crap, Megadeth did too. I don't know what makes people give this album or the band more of a pass for the same sin, as Dave sold out hard here and the music suffered for it.\n\nLike Metallica, this is a drastically simplified and scaled back album from the technical excellence, songwriting prowess and undiluted aggression displayed on this album's 4 predecessors. Most of the material here is written in a fairly melodic heavy metal/hard rock style, though there are some speedier holdovers. Virtually every song here is simpler in every respect compared to before, being built around a verse-chorus structure with little deviation in that formula, and the songs are more focused on catchy choruses and the vocals than ever. Dave does a lot more melodic and clean singing here and his snarling, nasally voice sounds at odds with the accessible direction the band is going in, mainly as he hadn't gotten used to singing in a more conventional and melodic fashion yet. He doesn't really emote much outside of aggression and when shooting for a less aggressive feel he sounds like a fish out of water; not bad but certainly odd and awkward. It's not a voice that is easy to get used to though once that happens he's not so bothersome. The drumming and riffs meanwhile are more minimal, simplistic, and less aggressive than before, with the riffs taking on a heavy/groove metal character. The shorter songs means the solos are shorter too, though technically they still are up to scratch as they have a great deal of flash and taste to them. The change in style here isn't a problem inherently, and unlike Metallica the band certainly don't extend their songs to the point of tedium on this one. The problem here is another one that dogged that album though - the music reeks of wasted potential as many of the songs here simply aren't that impressive and don't serve up much to interest the listener or commit the songs to memory, perhaps caused by deliberate restraint on the band's part and not being comfortable writing in a more accessible heavy metal style.\n\nMuch of the material here doesn't pan out so well, mostly due to not having interesting instrumentation or vocals - these tracks aren't bad or even that boring, just very plain and bland. There are a couple of quiet verse/loud chorus hard rock/heavy metal ballads (the title track, 'Foreclosure of a Dream') that progress in a very predictable fashion and don't bring much to the table instrumentally or vocally beyond catchy choruses, which are admittedly some of the best on the album. On the heavier side of things, 'This Was My Life' and 'Captive Honour' go in one ear and out the other (beyond the latter's stupid extended intro dialogue.) The band is obviously going for more hook-driven numbers but they don't bring the riffs, energy or choruses to make the songs stick, and so they aren't even catchy like the ballads. On the other hand, 'Architecture of Aggression' and 'Psychotron' clearly had more work put into them, featuring much stronger riffs that are more groove and thrash influenced. This stronger backbone the songs are built upon gives the songs and the choruses the energy and drive needed to stick. 'Skin 'O My Teeth' and 'High Speed Dirt' are a pair of uptempo numbers here that take speed/thrash riffing and aggression and inject them into a condensed and hook-centric verse-chorus formula. 'High Speed Dirt' feels a tad unnecessary as it covers a lot of the same ground 'Skin 'O My Teeth' did at the start of the album, but by virtue of having more energy, speed and aggression than a lot of the songs here it still remains a highlight.\n\nTo highlight how inconsistent the album gets, it manages to feature two of Megadeth's best songs and one of their worst. 'Symphony of Destruction' is an amazing single, combining a beautifully simple, hard-edged heavy/groove metal riff that is impossible to forget with snarled verses and one of the best sung passages on the album in the form of its catchy chorus and an always welcome set of leads. It's the best example of the condensed and commercial heavy/groove metal style on the album, and beats out nearly everything else in its field at the time. 'Ashes in Your Mouth' pretty much bucks every stylistic change seen here, being an amazing thrash epic that combines this album's more melodic, hook-driven formula with the aggression and technicality found on the albums that came before it. It's a very catchy song with an equally memorable and groovy main riff that has multiple phases to its construction, including a set of extended solos that form its bridge. It alone makes this more than worthy of any Megadeth fan's collection and would not be out of place on Rust in Peace. However, there's also the laughable and silly 'Sweating Bullets' which is inexplicably a popular song for the band. It's truly a stain on the band's catalogue; there's nothing enjoyable about its crappy and tedious stop-start riff, the corny spoken word narration that form the verses or the descending melody that forms its irritating hook. \n\nUltimately like the album Dave wanted to replicate so badly, this winds up being a perfectly decent if inconsistent foray into commercial waters, and a waste of potential given what had come before it. It contains some of the band\u2019s best and most iconic tracks but has a lot of filler to go with the killer, though even some of the weaker songs here are catchy and pleasant enough to work as mindless entertainment, and outside of \u2018Sweating Bullets\u2019 nothing here is skip-worthy. This is definitely essential for any Megadeth fan due to its highlights and place in history of the band and metal as a whole, but be prepared for a less than stellar effort.\n",
        "\nThis is undoubtedly a Megadeth album, which means that it has all of the elements of a classic 'deth album. Super tight riffs? Check. Dave's snarly howls? Check. Top tier instrumentation? Check. So why did this album get a 40% and not a 90%, per se? Because these things are what the album is based on. Instead of combining the vicious attitude of the previous albums with the things listed above, the band took a lazier approach in songwriting and in maximizing its musical abilities.\n\nIf this album was talked about in terms of food, this album would've been an outdated slice of pastrami between two freshly baked brioche buns. Despite the huge differences in musical approach and intensity, you can see that the band has maximized the potential in every one of the buns (which are Rust In Peace and Youthanasia) to a point where there are barely any weak moments- a thing which is very evident in this album. \n\nAs said before, Countdown to Extinction is very lazy, and in fact, the laziest Megadeth album of the nineties. Songs like \"Captive Honour\" and \"Countdown to Extinction\" just make you want to throw your palm against your face. What the hell were they thinking? The riffs are great. The drums are tight. The solos are top notch (name a more iconic duo than Dave and Marty)- but still, the songs seem too dragged, forced, and not very motivated. Take the demo versions of \"Psychotron\" and the title track for example. These had so much balls and power, but the studio versions of these songs which appeared in Countdown just squeezed every drop of intensity the demo had.\n\nDon't get me wrong- there are a few notable tracks which saved the album from being a total trainwreck. The obvious examples such as \"Symphony of Destruction,\" \"Skin O' My Teeth,\" \"Sweating Bullets,\" \"High Speed Dirt,\" and \"Ashes in Your Mouth\" seem to provide the best Megadeth experiences throughout the album and are not lazy or forced by any means- but the real issue with Countdown is the filler tracks. After numerous listens, recalling any part from the obvious filler tracks has become quite an impossible mission- how come so many good parts were put in songs that are devoid of any intensity. The creativity within these tracks is pretty unrecognizable as well, because of how brutally it was sterilized- a thing which is evident in some of the stronger and mediocre tracks as well. Even when revisiting the album the stronger tracks seem to be huge letdowns. The studio versions of these songs seem to be lazier as well, which is another thing that completely destroys the album. There is a HUGE difference between seeing these songs being played by the band live and between listening to the studio versions of the songs. \n\nThe production job in this album is one of the shittiest ever heard in a Megadeth release. Instead of making it sound warm and inviting like the four albums before this one (we're talking thrash here, not black metal), or crunchy and powerful like the next two, this album sounds completely mechanical and artificial. What was the band thinking while producing this? The bass is almost inaudible, the guitars seem to lack any power and only the drums are correctly produced and equalized within the mix. And let's not talk about the 2004 remaster which destroyed that as well. \n\nThis album is one of the only Megadeth albums which features some killer, and mostly filler material. The non utilized potential that is held here is huge, and it's a real shame that instead of maximizing the skills, intensity, and attitude Megadeth is known for, the band has provided the world this half of a letdown. Pretty disappointing.\n",
        "\nAs this album represents the beginnings of such an incredible and important thrash metal band as Megadeth, I will start by giving a little bit of background. Most probably are familiar with the story-Dave Mustaine was fired from Metallica, and pissed off, he decided he was going to start a new project and crush Metallica in every possible aspect, namely technicality, speed, and aggression. The debut, Killing is My Business...And Business is good is the fruit of his mentality at the time, and it is also somewhat reflective of the less than ideal conditions under which the album was recorded. The record company grave the band a relatively small amount of money to record with, and a good portion of this went to personal expenses (such as drugs, which also play a role here). The amount of money left was insufficient, and led arguments regarding production, and thus a very demo-like sound. The production is one of the reasons this album is not worshipped alongside 'Peace Sells' and Rust in Peace. When I first heard it, I found it atrocious. I have since grown accustomed to poor production, and it is now the rule rather than the exception in most of the music I listen to, therefore I have no problem with this sound.\n\nAs soon as this album begins, with the eerie, classically sensible piano intro of \"Last Rites/Loved to Deth\", the band express their incredible musical skills. The song is extremely fast, such that the riffing is incoherent and runs together. Metallica's Kiill 'Em All, released two years prior, seems like a very accessible album compared to this siege of pure speed and technicality. If one were in the 80s, assessing the thrash metal scene in real time, one would be started upon hearing this, coming from a Metallica perspective, due to Dave Mustaine's odd vocals. Granted, he sings in a more mundane, less mocking manner, however his voice is still quite strange at times. It's high pitched and a little thin, but he does an excellent job using his natural voice to his advantage on this album. As for his guitar playing, he is miles ahead of the guys in Metallica. This is, of course, nothing against the aforementioned; they are incredible endurant, well rounded musicians, however, Dave Mustaine's playing is insane, especially for someone who was, at the time, heavily into drugs. There aren't many normal, stereotypical thrash riffs like one might hear on Exodus's Bonded by Blood here. Dave's style of thrash consists more of fast, technical run downs (the title track), intricate hammer on/pull off sections (\"Loved to Deth\", \"Chosen Ones\"), and some more creative stuff as well. Not to mention, his riffs, especially the main one of the title track, are very tight and catchy; this one takes a scale based rundown and slides into a very heavy, headbangable groove.\n\nChris Poland wise, I don't find much to be impressed by. He is an excellent guitarist, but I feel that his individuality didn't surface until the next album. The shredding solos here are good, but both he and Dave Mustaine sound like Kirk Hammett on a concoction of amphetamines and steroids, lacking distinctiveness. Slayer would be an adequate comparison as far as lead work goes as well, it's chaotic and noisy, not really smooth and melodic like it would be on 'Peace Sells'.\n\nBy far, the highlight of this album is \"Looking Down the Cross\". It's one of my favorite Megadeth songs, and it is essentially Megadeth's take on an epic song. Harmonics, mimicking the sound of distorted bells, create a sense of impending doom. Chris Poland actually does a cool solo here, by the way, consisting of some tapping over the drawn out chords of the rhythmic section. Dave snarls out sort of a personal mantra, then the song gets strange. The main sections combine a very 70s blues rock riff with tight, intricate thrash metal. The song gets better and better as it progresses, and is both the highlight of Dave Mustaine's creativity, and also his vocal performance. The song reminds me of a thrash metal version of Led Zeppelin. Other highlights (excluding already mentioned songs) include the Occult themed \"The Skull Beneath the Skin\", which tells us the story of a man being turned into the band's mascot, Vic Rattlehead, in the process of some kind of ritual torture. \"Rattlehead\" and \"Mechanix\" are two songs showcasing the band's more fun side. The former is a thrash metal anthem, more anthemic than the stuff from Kill 'Em All. \"Mechanix\" is the original version of \"The Four Horsemen\" from the aforementioned album. It's faster and it's lyrics tell the story of how automobiles procreate. Not as cerebral or interesting as 'Horsemen', but it's still a fun, catchy song.\n\nBefore closing this review up, I'd like to mention the obligatory cover. Dave Mustaine did a cover on all of his early albums. In this case, it was Nancy Sinatra's \"These Boots\". It contains some tasty playing with brutal thrashing, and has little in common with the original. The writer complained about how the sexual lyrics were a defacement of the original, and there was some kind of threat of a lawsuit. In total irony, they were required to bleep out not only the offensive sections, but also those that Dave casually changed. The constantly bleeping is complete ear rape, and is more offensive than the lyrics are if you ask me. Kind of funny. Anyways, Killing is My Business...And Business is Good is certainly an essential thrash metal album. Of course it is not Megadeth in the full fruition that was Rust in Peace, but it is an excellent piece of music.\n",
        "\nI never thought I'd write a review for which 27 rhetorical accounts run the gamut of mild praise and disappointment to sheer worship back to mediocrity again. Oh, well, here's to keeping the ball rolling...\n\nNot only is 1990's Rust In Peace Megadeth's finest hour but also one of the more memorable releases from my youth. While it's doubtful the metal World needs yet another elaboration on the iconic L.A. thrashers' fourth full-length, I figured I'd serve up some quirky, out of left field feedback. \n\nI also concede thrash metal ain't my \"bailiwick\", yet, then again, this highly technical gem is the equivalent of the holy grail of fretboard wizardry. That said, I spent the better part of my adolescence attempting to smoothly pull off all the complex parts to \"Lucretia\" and my favourite Megadeth track by far, the incredibly volatile \"Tornado Of Souls\". I'm also not ashamed to admit I'm an inferior musician for whom mastery of the electric axe doesn't come easy; I'm still - and from the tarry looks of it - a far way off from achieving this musical goal. Suffice to say, however, I'm grateful for fellow, er, \"archivist\"'s input, as it has unabashedly put flames to my boots (hence, compelling me to sit up and brainstorm!)\n\nWhile admittedly bizarre filler such as \"Five Magics\", despite neat lyrical ode to nefarious Middle Age alchemy, and the unnecessary \"Dawn Patrol\" (imbued with Dave Mustaine's lugubrious mole-like croaking - this was achieved by drawing air over his bottom lip while biting down on his upper teeth!), in addition to closer \"Polaris\", are readily skippable, the rest of RIP is unyielding in Mustaine and especially Marty Friedman's technical execution, not to mention team Dave Ellefson/Nick Menza's (RIP!) thunderous rhythm section. \n\nBearing witness to Megadeth's delivery of the bridge to \"Holy Wars\", as well as crystalline twinkling leading up to \"\u2026The Punishment Due\" alongside their tight, stellar leads and, also, of course, one-of-a-kind dramatic build-up/poignancy of \"Hangar 18\", as impressionable twelve year old at very first heavy metal show - at Verdun Auditorium, having grown up in Montreal - knew I was witnessing something magical. To this day, it's still my most memorable show. (Hell, I came back from my first mosh ever, during the crazed rendition of \"Tornado of Souls\", minus a shoe!)\n\nThen you've got the frenetic call to arms \"Take No Prisoners\", which sounds like forgotten track from the rough hewn So Far, So Good\u2026So What?!\" (\"Take no prisoners! Take no shit!\" Ah, good times\u2026), followed by - barring the weaker, bass heavy \"Five Magics\" - the deceptively difficult-to-play \"Poison Was The Cure\". Actually, check out this super skilled German dude Ristridi's insane cover of it on youtube sometimes, but make sure to have spare socks handy, as those on will be blown clean off! Said shredder knows the score.\n\nTo such end, keep in mind I've yet to even elaborate properly on the best tracks; namely \"Lucretia\" and \"Tornado Of Souls\", as I'm sure many imagine (and agree!). Short of sounding like a broken record, let's just say the slick, mesmerizing intro, following a sardonic witch's cackle, and wickedly economical \"spider\" riffing/incrementally maneuvering power chords and evil, bamboozling solo of the former + sick B (natural) Minor with some B Dorian chromatic riffing - to perfectly timed natural harmonics - of latter are, fondly put, to die for. \n\nWith half of \"Hangar 18\" highlighted by kick-arse continuum of lead trade-offs and Friedman's complex, laborious and much loved exotic solos on \"Tornado Of Souls\" I'm left completely stupefied. His natural level of talent and dexterity is mind boggling. To quote Friedman in a 2002 interview: \"When I finished the solo to this one, Mustaine came into the studio, listened to it down once, turned around and without saying a word, shook my hand. It was at that moment that I felt like I was truly the guitarist for this band\". \n\nIt's not my style to flog a dead horse but I figured it was time I step up my game and rub shoulders with wider variety of writers. (Now I can get back to that long-suffering review which warrants a considerably lower score.)\n",
        "\nIn my mind, MegaDave's brand of thrash metal has always been a hit or miss affair; this is proven by the albums they put out in the 80s: \"Killing Is My Business\" can be considered as a heavier and faster \"Kill \"Em All\" that was messed up by shoddy production, \"So Far, So Good, So What\" is a remarkable singles album with a lot of noteworthy standalone, catchy and accessible songs. The album \"Rust in Peace\" in particular, is hailed as a thrash masterpiece by countless metalheads around the world. Dave and Co.'s fourth studio effort is a showcase of technical prowess and virtuoso musicianship; the music is truly difficult to duplicate by musicians of lesser talent and ability, for its complexity and arrangement require a level of skill, physical dexterity and mastery of one's instrument.\n\nWhere the album fails is the total lack of memorable riffs in a majority of the songs. A large portion of the tracks truly tries your patience, \"Five Magics\" for example, has this meandering intro which serves no other purpose or function. I mean what was the idea behind this or the other lengthy intros? Maybe to show listeners how tight the band is musically? If it is to build tension or atmosphere, then it is a complete failure. If not for two or four songs, this record would not have received the undeserved praise and attention. \"Holy Wars\" is Dave's answer to Metallica's \"Master of Puppets\" (the song) and it is quite obvious, RIP was an attempt by Dave to, at least approximate the epic and melodic scope of the album from which that song came from. \"Hangar 18\" is the other commendable track, featuring dueling leads between Dave and Marty which admittedly is an interesting technique to close the song. Frankly though, such a method is annoying when done solely to show off but in this case, it works. \n\nRIP is indeed an ambitious and lofty undertaking but it is eventually bogged down by vanity and self-indulgence. No amount of guitar acrobatics could save the album from its majority of bland songs and half-baked riffs. The lack of build-up and development of tension ultimately contributes to the record's failure both as a concept and as a vision by Dave to craft a worthy contender to James and Lars' MOP. Impeccable technique cannot substitute for real, honest to goodness songwriting. The album uses every parlour trick in the bag but in the end, they fail to deliver the goods. The songs do not take off but sputter and whine. It's all foreplay and no actual penetration is made.\n",
        "\nOne of the legendary big 4 of American thrash, Megadeth comes out with a new record that's supposedly a return to form. Chris Adler from Lamb of God is on drums, Kiko Loureiro from Angra is on guitar, David Ellefson returns on bass. This lineup is killer. The album is getting glowing reviews from critics and fans alike. This should be a great metal album, right?\n\nWrong! This is one of Megadeth's worst records. It's not as bad as Supercollider or Risk, but it is still top 5 material in my book. I'm not asking for Megadeth to make another Rust In Peace here, but they can do so much better. This album is full of mind numbing chugging from beginning to end with some surprisingly generic modern thrash despite Megadeth being one of the genre's forefathers. The instrumentals on this album are so boring to listen to. I'd expect better than a rehash of Endgame from this lineup.\n\nOf course the biggest problem with this record is Dave Mustaine. His lyrics are full of the conspiracy theorist garbage you'd expect from Infowars. The lyrics seem to paint this image of America being wiped out by a large influx of immigrants which is a laughably stupid and fantastic concept for a sub genre of metal that is known for biting political satire and the complete lack of irony is what does it for me. The lyrics aren't even that well written, with Post American World and Lying In State standing out as particularly god awful examples. Dave delivers one of his worst vocal performances to date on this album. He sounds like he stopped giving a shit years ago. His menacing snarl has been reduced to pathetic mumbling.\n\nFatal Illusion is probably the best track on the whole thing. It was dynamic, heavy and the lyrics were actually decent. It had some slower parts that made it more unique than the chuggachug bullshit on the rest of the album. Hearing it when it came out gave me hope for this album to be good. Hope that was greatly diminished by The Threat Is Real. Dystopia probably had some of the heaviest riffing on the whole album. However, it ends with a pretty mediocre cover of the hardcore punk classic \"Foreign Policy\" by Fear. I'm not sure if this was a bid to seem anti-PC or if Dave was trying to make a serious political point here. Either way seems kinda silly. If it was the former, then it fails because people have thicker skin than back in the 80s and there is less stigma around criticizing the government. If it was the later, it fails because Fear songs were only designed to offend people and not to make a serious political point. A properly weak and baffling ending to a weak and baffling album. Overall, I can't see the hype. It is a an absolute train wreck of generic robotic tech thrash riffs, dumb lyrics and atrocious vocals. Dave hasn't just gone off the deep end, he has jumped off the high dive, into the deepest end of an empty swimming pool. Overrated trash. 3/10\n",
        "\nLike many budding, stunted and confused metalheads, many found solstice in the big four. I found solstice with Megadeth. The crushing heaviness made it stand out from the crowd, plus Dave Mustaine man, he can make some serious lighting fast riffs! It was the closest thing a kid can get to without listening to Slipknot. The lyrics were at least edgy enough in my eyes of little me...then I got older. And man, am I glad.\n\nNowdays, I now hold up the notion that the earliest Megadeth records are fucking masterpieces - from Killing is My Business, to Rust in Peace to Countdown to Extinction, with Youthanasia and...wait for it - Cryptic Writings as decent rock efforts. Yes, I hold Cryptic Writings as one of the last decent Megadeth albums. Everything else became shit when ol' Dave's brain went kaput, and became the egotistical and paranoid shithead we know today. That said, at least they tried in their newer efforts, despite Dave's batting at the conspiracy theory pinata, some of their newer songs had some alright composition, particularly in Endgame (even if the rest of the album was balls). Now enter Dystopia, supposedly a return to form following the much loathed Super Collider. People really fucking love this album. The riffs are crushing, the lyrics are stronger, it's got a sense of dread as ever - like classic Megadeth. It's gotta be good, right? \n\nSorry, but no. Dystopia is much more of the same Megadeth's been cranking out in the past years, and feels like a crappy sequel to Endgame. The only major difference is that there's two new members - Dick Verburen and Kiko Loureiro, taking the place of where Shawn Drover and Chris Broderick had. They are radically different and bring a new dimension in the musical world Megadeth made, yet they play second fiddle, but they at least bring more crushing, headbanging energy than Super Collider. The big ol' elephant in the room is our buddy pal friend Dave Mustaine. He's just as bad as he was previously. His voice is fucked and his lyrics are equally fucked too. Make no mistake, Dave is a bad vocalist, but it worked with the music. Now, whenever he sings, he sounds disinterested, unemotional and wants to get the entire thing done and over with. The lyrics are, while less politically deranged and actually touching on other material, still suck balls to the point of amusement, but that's not the worst part. As I stated before, it's a sequel to Endgame. Dystopia (the title track) is reminiscent of Endgame lyrically. Some of the songs are just lyrically retarded, especially for Megadeth standards, with Post American World and Lying in State are the worst offenders here, and sometimes they're so bad it makes me feel like that one of these days, Dave's gonna be nuts enough to write a track that rips off the basis of \"Cartman Gets an Anal Probe\". \n\nThe sole reason Dystopia isn't as terrible as the previous albums is because the riffs and composition of the songs are ten times more better than the previous albums. Finally, they're slaughtering us with the riffs! It's a reason why Fatal Illusion and...I hate to say it, the title track, are actually pretty tolerable when it comes to production, structure and rhythm. They're at least taking good effort in the songs, but it is nowhere near their best efforts in the early 90s, but it's a incredibly better effort than Super Collider, and that's saying something. It's just that Dave sucks as a songwriter at this point, and has to bog down this album with much of the same shit that's been in Endgame, with the conspiracies and Obama eating babies and all sorts of other shit to where he's almost self-plagiarizing himself. Dystopia's just another run of the mill Megadeth album, but with the fact that they at least tried to make it sound good yet bogged by the same terrible lyrics we heard dozens of times before.\n\nOkay, now you can commence the hate mail I'm gonna get saying that Cryptic Writings was their last decent album. I can take it.\n",
        "\nFrankly speaking, after the legendary metal group Megadeth released their state of the art speed/thrash metal chef-d'\u0153uvre record Rust in Peace and hearing the succeeding Countdown to Extinction album, I had started to lose interest on Dave Mustaine's song writing proficiency. It's just that their later crafts after 1990 did not contain the intense and passionate overall elements that the preceding materials held. Referring to what I had stated above, after hearing about a latest offering by the band earlier last year, I did not get my hopes up. When the album was issued, I was in awe of the output that Dave (along with David Ellefson) and his new line-up came to produced.\n\nDystopia, the recent record that I am talking about, have proved that Dave Mustaine can still fabricate great songs even after all these years of failing to deliver. The album carries great guitar riffs form both Dave and Kiko Loureiro, and it also has that clear production which allows the bass to amplify it's heavy impact to the materials in the album. Also, the tunes here are played at a fast-paced level which were thrown in with great melodic solos, and the composition of the songs are very well constructed. There are even moments in Dystopia where the guitar section will remind the listeners a lot about Rust in Peace. The drumming of Chris Adler also fits well with the tracks in the album. He did quite an explicit and very firm work on his performance with Megadeth. This shows that Dave made the right choice of picking Kiko and Chris in taking part of assembling this record.\n\nNow I wasn't expecting that Dave's vocals will deliver well due to the fact that the dude has aged, but he actually manifests a more effective, angry, and intense delivery in this offering. The dude's pissed off approach in the vocal work is, in my own opinion, one of the factors that were missing in their previous disappointing releases. The lyrics also showed a more revitalized and reanimated Mustaine. It's pretty clear that he is in a more ingenious state when he was making the lyrical contents of the tracks in the album.\n\nThis record really is an awesome comeback after years of shortcomings in producing a decent and fine album releases. It brings forth a few memories of the times when Megadeth were still killing the fans with complex and ultra-modem offerings that long time followers had enjoyed listening to and have grown to love. It may not be as good as \"Killing Is My Business... and Business Is Good!\", \"Peace Sells... But Who's Buying?\", \"So Far, So Good... So What!\", and \"Rust in Peace\"; but Dystopia is an album that provides sufficient elements that the band's long time fans have long been waiting for.\n\nIn conclusion, this record is above the state of mediocrity yet below the level of their finest classic. It's an album worth purchasing and keeping even though it is not superior to its 80s and 90s predecessors. At least Megadeth didn't take the path that Metallica did with their career.\n",
        "\nLet me tell you something: if you were told this was Megadeth's comeback after Risk's -not so big- failure (I kind of liked it), you were lied to your face. This was nothing but a desperate attempt to regain fans' trust after their major commercial disaster. Believe me: Megadeth's old school sound in this album is nowhere in sight. This could be just me putting my expectations too high (I was told it was a good album, and it may be), but you can be sure that there is no reason for you to think that \"Megadeth has gone back to the roots\".\n\nNow, for those looking for thrashy elements on the album, you won't find any; tempo is too slow, guitars aren't as distorted as they should be, and the only strong feeling you get after listening to it is the burning desire of throwing it away and killing the son of a bitch that recommended it to you. WARNING: you may be misled by some of the riffs and drumming at the beginning of some songs like Disconnect or Recipe for Hate, in which you might find some Set the World Afire \"leftovers\" during the solo, but the overall impression is that thrash has been long forgotten by the band.\n\nMoreover, most songs in the record are too pretentious and boring (they aren't as fast and angry as they should be), and some others like 1000 Times Goodbye or Promises are deliberately meant to make you want to kill yourself. But the worst part is having to listen to Megadeth's \"The Unforgiven II\", Return to Hangar (seriously guys, what were you thinking?), which is the biggest joke of all, so you could easily say there's not one serious track on the entire thing.\n\nBut don't worry: Megadeth will never go back to their original sound; we know that for sure. So from now on, try to keep your expectations low, so you don't go through the same disappointment I went through.\n",
        "\nAfter the controversial Super Collider, Dave Mustaine decided to fire Shawn Drover and Chris Brodderick. The band needeed a consistent formation and an album to show what they\u2019re still capable of being a still relevant band. Two new guys were brought: Chris Adler, the drummer of Lamb Of God, and Kiko Loureiro, the legendary guitarrist from the brazilian power metal band Angra. The desire of Mustaine to prove that he can still make relevant songs again make Dystopia one of their strongest efforts since Rust In Peace.\n\nThe first thing we can note listening to this album is a return to the more heavy and thrashy roots of Megadeth. It is not heavy as the first albums but is still heavier than Th1rt3en and the extremely commercial Super Collider, the last albuns with the last known line up. Again, Mustaine follows his politics themes in the entire album, sometimes making interesting critics and in others, sounding like a total patriot lunatic.\n\n\u201cDystopia\u201d is a great title track and represents the album pretty well: solid writing, great riffs, fast playing and melodic solos. The decision of adopting a more clean production allows the listener to note how well done the guitars are here and makes the bass audible, giving heaviness to this work. Kiko shows how talented he is in his style of playing and along with Mustaine shines in the tracks \u201cPoisonous Shadows\u201d and \u201cConquer or Die\u201d. The problem with the very clean production is how it affects Mustaine\u2019s voice. Sometimes, he feels like a robot talking, taking out the agression that he was known in the past while singing. But luckily, it doesn\u2019t happens all the time.\n\nIn the year of 2016, we had several thrash metal albums shining. Dystopia is not a return to the old speed metal style from the early years of Megadeth, but it is the their most strong effort since 1990. We can define the sound here as a evolution from everything that the band has been doing in all those years: a tribute to the past looking forward to the future. Well done, Dave Mustaine.\n\nHighlights: \"Dystopia\", \"Death From Within\", \"Poisonous Shadows\", \"Conquer Or Die\" and \"The Emperor\".\n",
        "\nFirst of all, let's get the whole The Black Album thing out of the way. Sure, Dave Mustaine must have seen the dramatic commercial success that greeted Metallica's radical shift in style and probably thought that it was another opportunity to try to outdo his old bandmates. However, comparing those two albums, Countdown to Extinction doesn't really deserve the label of sell-out, whereas Metallica's effort is clearly a grasping attempt to become suitable for an audience of stadium rock fans and keg-party morons. (Disclaimer: I am not aligning those two groups of people.) The over-simplified riffing, stomping rhythms, and conventional songwriting structure - so far away from And Justice for All - was practically an insult to Metallica's fans and, although those who loved Rust in Peace might have hated Megadeth for a while, there seems to be less of an attempt to actually dumb down the music here, as well as the lyrical content.\n\nWhat is in fact fairly interesting about Countdown to Extinction is that despite looking like a commercial album (simpler cover, more consistent song lengths, generally verse-chorus song structures) it has a lot of detail and skill added to it that takes it whole levels above mere commercialism. Starting with the lyrics and Mustaine's vocals, one would not expect this to be a release that charted at No.2 with such themes as contained in 'Sweating Bullets', 'Captive Honour', or the nerdy 'Psychotron'. 'Architecture of Aggression' contains some of the more overtly political lyrics, with this choice nugget:\n\n\"Ensuing power vacuum, a toppled leader dies\nHis body fuels the power fire and the flames rise to the sky\nOne side of his face a kiss, the other genocide\nTime to pay with your ass, a worldwide suicide\".\n\nNot exactly Michael Jackson, is it? Then there's the vocals too, which are rather odd when one considers them in context: Mustaine doesn't have an especially skilled voice as a singer, can't wail like a power metal vocalist, can't sing anthems like a stadium giant, can't even do James Hetfield's rough roar, yet he acts his way through most of the songs, using a range of styles from sombre disapproval on 'Countdown to Extinction' to tough phlegmy growls on 'Symphony of Destruction' to snarling insanity on 'Sweating Bullets', plus some more melodic moments. His voice sometimes sounds inappropriate, though he's used it to his advantage for the most part.\n\nThe same kind of variety is to be seen in the instrumental ideas too. David Ellefson does more than most bassists would dare to do with the title track, propelling not only the intro but also keeping the verses afloat by himself and providing more fuel for an otherwise very melodic chorus. I have the remaster from 2004 and he's certainly mixed high on that edition, while there's a demo version of 'Countdown to Extinction' that features a nice bass solo. Nick Menza has a good time of it on drums too, ripping the album open with his fill intro to 'Skin o' My Teeth' and never resorting to Lars Ulrich's favourite slow stadium beat. As for Marty Friedman, he isn't doing nearly as much as he was on Rust in Peace, though there are few albums where anyone does that much in terms of skillful leadwork, so maybe it's not such a surprise. He and Mustaine still turn in some great solos, the most interesting of which might be the regular lead fills on 'Psychotron' or the inspired latter part of 'High Speed Dirt', which incorporates some fun clean solos in rock 'n' roll style without losing any of the song's thrashy momentum.\n\nDue to the shift in style, the riffs are obviously not such a main feature as in Megadeth's earlier speed/thrash output. That said, the catchiness of some of the riffs is welcome, the best examples being on the rollicking opener, 'High Speed Dirt', and the bridge of 'Sweating Bullets', which are mostly the quicker numbers. The slower songs aren't bereft of content, featuring melodies that one might be caught humming in the shower, even the unusual folky swing of the title track's chorus. There are a few songs that don't seem to quite hit it off due to a lack of momentum or slightly plodding verses, such as 'Architecture of Aggression' and 'Foreclosure of a Dream', while 'This Is My Life' is the only time that I suspect I'm listening to Hetfield and co., suggested by the stomping riff and Mustaine's unfortunately stolen \"Hey\" before the chorus. However, most of the songs are good, even if they aren't as viscerally exciting as the band's older material, nor as technically profficient. The reissue also has a pretty good bonus song called 'Crown of Worms' done with Diamond Head that's worth a listen.\n\nIn general, Countdown to Extinction doesn't give me the same feeling as Megadeth's heavier work, nor do I believe it's as good, but don't let that stop you from checking it out since there are good songs to be found and some catchy music as well. In a just world, this should be bigger than The Black Album, although if it were really a just world Rust in Peace would have been huge and Megadeth would never have needed to change their style.\n",
        "\nI was pretty certain that I would not listen to \u201cDystopia\u201d, or even review it for that matter after the train-wreck that was \u201cSuper Collider\u201d. I didn\u2019t even care about the new line-up changes. However, when I saw a wide range of people greeting this album with open arms and flattering words, I decided to take a look. I\u2019ve even heard some people calling this album the best since \u201cRust in Peace\u201d. I can spoil that for you right away. It\u2019s not. But it is still a pretty solid outing.\n\nBefore I even get to the album itself, I want to criticise the wide selection of editions there are of this album. The standard edition of this album features 11 tracks, but when you combine all the editions there is a total of 15 tracks. There\u2019s the standard edition, iTunes, Best Buy, Spotify, Japanese and a limited edition. I don\u2019t think that an approach like that is consumer friendly in any way, and it\u2019s not like there is a big label dictating all of this, as it is released through Mustaine\u2019s own label, Tradecraft. I\u2019m not in favour business-models like this, and I never will be. All of this will of course not count in my rating of this album, but I will be accounting all 15 tracks into it.\n\n\u201cDystopia\u201d is a move far, far away from what both \u201cTh1rt3en\u201d and \u201cSuper Collider\u201d was. This time we see a return to the more thrashy and heavy roots of Megadeth. Of course an artist should explore the ways they want to and not be subjugated to what fans want. Some bands are really good at making diverse albums, but when a band\u2019s main songwriter is just one guy, like in Megadeth, it can hit and miss. I definitely don\u2019t belong to the group of people who thinks that Megadeth only writes good albums if it is thrash albums. \u201cYouthanasia\u201d is among my favourites. With this new album we\u2019re offered a very well produced album and some solid songs, but a lot of them goes into one ear and out the other. One song that definitely does catch on is the title-track, Dystopia. A very well composed mid-paced song with great melodic elements that you will hear from the beginning. It also features some great solos on top of that, which you also will encounter on the album opener, The Threat is Real. From around the middle of the title-track and until the end it is instrumental with riffs, and solos between Mustaine and Kiko Loureiro and also harmonies. That specific structure and feel does remind me a bit of Hangar 18. The more I listen to the title-track the better it gets, and it is one of the best composed songs Megadeth have released in years. It is without a doubt the absolute shining highlight of this album. Another track from \u201cDystopia\u201d that gives me somewhat of a \u201cRust in Peace\u201d-vibe, and that is Conquer and Die, the instrumental of this album. When it breaks into the electric guitar section, I just think back to their 1990 album. But that being said, do not expect a part two of \u201cRust in Peace\u201d, because that will never happen. My apologies if I erected an excitement boner. All of the nods towards the album is, however, a pleasant listen.\n\nThe production on this album is really, really good. The guitars in particular sounds perfect for a Megadeth album, they sound just the way they should. The bass is right beneath the guitars adding a certain heavy feel to the thrash and that is without a doubt a good thing. In spite of this, I do definitely have a problem with a certain aspect of the production: the vocals. Mustaine\u2019s vocals have never been known for a ton of range. He has definitely lost some and that is clear to hear on this record, and that ties in with the production. The vocals on \u201cDystopia\u201d rarely sounds clear. Sometimes there is some kind of effect on Dave\u2019s vocals, and at other times it sounds like he recorded the same line twice, but at a different pitches to give it more of a punch. But it does not really work for me. If you listen to Look Who\u2019s Talking, in the beginning of the song Dave uses his normal talking snarling voice. But as soon as the song breaks into verse, it just sounds different. This can also be heard on Lying in State where it starts out with the altered vocal but in the middle he shifts to the before mentioned talking snarling voice, and the effect is gone. And on The Emperor you can hear it with the first line of the song, \u201cWho do you think you are?\u201c. When he stretches out \u201care\u201c, I can\u2019t help but cringe. All of this is apparent throughout the entire record and it hampers a lot of my enjoyment of this album. The Threat is Real, Dystopia, Poisonous Shadows and Conquer or Die. Those are the songs I enjoy the most from this album, and they are all on the standard edition. I don\u2019t feel like any of the bonus tracks really add that much to the rest of the album.\n\nI do not think that \u201cDystopia\u201d is as good as \u201cEndgame\u201d, and that comes down to the songwriting and the vocals. That does not mean that there is nothing worthwhile on this album because there certainly is. There is a lot of great solos and interesting riffs, but overall it is does not feature as many memorable tracks as \u201cEndgame\u201d did. Please don\u2019t encourage the shoddy business model for this album and just get one edition. Before this album I had written this band completely off, but this new album, and this new line-up has rejuvenated my interest in Megadeth. \u201cDystopia\u201d starts off really strong and it can make you extremely ecstatic, but as it goes on it starts to dwindle. However, this is an album that a wide range of Megadeth fans can enjoy. It stands on its own, and I am looking forward to see this line-up reach its full potential on upcoming albums.\n\nWritten for Reigning Damnation.\n",
        "\nRitchie Blackmore claimed that his musical inspirations were jazz and symphony orchestras. But he also recognized that if he was going to con the working class out its money and women (as any rock & roll artist set out to do), he would need a much simpler approach\u2014 an approach which utilized the simple riffs of The Who and The Kinks. Dave Mustaine and Dave Ellefson did not set out to challenge this idea. They were too busy following the logical path their music was forging, being carved by some intangible that every great artist is blessed with briefly in their career.\n\nNow the intangible on the other hand, thought, \u201cwhy the hell should great rock & roll be carried with simple, one note riffs? Our goal is to illuminate the collective subconscious, we should be making these riffs as technical as possible but still just as memorable as I Can\u2019t Explain or Purple Haze.\u201d Folks, it is one thing to watch a fingering exercise, but it is quite another to remember how to particular exercise sounds hours after you're done hearing it.\n\nMustaine, Ellefson and their newfound crew of Marty Freidman and Nick Menza set out to establish the next level of tech-thrash beyond So Far So Good So What, which was, in turn, to make the most technical rock & roll available without degenerating (a term I use cautiously) into freeform jazz. And goddammit, they did exactly that. Using every possible technique available to rock guitarists in the book, Mustaine crafted so many riffs and melodies that were not only the next generation of the top guitar riffs of all time, but they made you feel like a golden god while you air played them or otherwise. Last time I checked that\u2019s what the whole thing called heavy metal is about, empowerment.\n\nThe Metallica albatross around Mustaine's neck served as gift of inspiration and a curse. With Rust In Peace, Megadeth rocketed right out of Metallica's shadow and became superstars. In fact, I postulate that Metallica chose to go the Motley Crue route because they realized that they were simply outmatched, pound for pound. And Justice For All, the bands most epic effort to date was criticized for a number of reasons, but the most scathing had to have been that the album was too bloated and the songs were too long. Nobody said that about this album. There was practically zero criticism for this album, and those who did were from people who just never got it anyway. After years of misery, Dave Mustaine had finally achieved his goal of out-metalling Metallica. It\u2019s such a shame that the drugs and record company made him re-evaluate his situation and foolishly realize that you aren\u2019t a better musician unless you outsell someone. To be fair, while this album isn't quite as technical or progressive as No More Color or Control & Resistance, but Control & Resistance just doesn't have a song as good as Take No Prisoners on it. A song like that would be its big hit single. Here? Maybe the the second or third \"worst\" on here. It really is that good, rivetheads. This record stands alone as a zenith of so many endeavors. To have not experienced it is to deprive yourself of essential human minerals that flush the fats out of your body. Which is fine by me. \n\nFatass.\n\nRecommended Songs:\nTornado of Souls\nRust In Peace\nHoly Wars\nHangar 18\n",
        "\nI\u2019m not normally into thrash metal (though I\u2019ve certainly given it a fair chance) but this has got to be one of the most accessible and melodic of all the famous thrash albums. And for me, melody is very important.\n\nThe very first thing that comes to my attention is the insane shredding in the opening minute and a half of Holy Wars\u2026The Punishment Due. It blows my mind how good, intense, and catchy those guitar parts are. Thankfully that level of shredding is frequent throughout the rest of the album, reappearing on every song except the slow groovy, funk metal song Dawn Patrol, which has no need of guitar anyways.\n\nWhile there isn\u2019t a bad song on the album, for me the standout tracks are Holy Wars, Hangar 18, Lucretia, and Tornado Of Souls. Those songs just take the melodies, riffs, shredding, and musicianship to another level. The very first song I ever heard by Megadeth was Tornado Of Souls, and while I didn\u2019t like it at the time (it was too heavy for my young ears) I was immediately struck by how tight and crisp the entire band was. All these guys have chops! Great drum fills!\n\nMy first complaint is that Dave Mustaine is not much of a singer. However, to give him credit, he seems to be aware of what his voice can and cannot do well, and so despite this limitation he sings to his strengths. The best vocals are when he sings or speaks in a deep voice inflected with evil. It also helps that the vocals have been mixed in such a way that they don\u2019t stand out too much without being lost in the mix. Overall a good job making the most out of a weakness.\n\nMy only other complaint is a minor one, but the songs do tend to sound pretty similar on the first few listens. Which is better than the songs starting to sound the same after the first few listens mind you, and there are the occasional variations such as the aforementioned Dawn Patrol (which works well as an intro of sorts to Rust In Peace\u2026Polaris) the slow intros to Five Magics and Poison Was The Cure, and the beautiful flamenco guitar break in Holy Wars. That part fits in surprisingly well!\n\nIn summary, this is one awesome dose of good melodies and epic shredding!\n",
        "\nSo you\u2019re Dave Mustaine and you\u2019ve just released the biggest piece of shit you\u2019ll ever release. Yes, I think \u2018Super Collider\u2019 is worse than \u2018Risk\u2019. What will be your next step? Record an album that\u2019s easily your best in over a decade of course. One has to admire his resilience; Mustaine has had enough misfortune to make any ordinary musician quit five times, but his determination always forces him to get back up when he\u2019s down. This time, the result is \u2018Dystopia\u2019, a sharp, fierce blend of thrash metal and traditional heavy metal with spectacular guitar work. In deed: the mark of a great Megadeth record.\n\nMaybe it\u2019s the new lineup. The Daves (Mustaine and bassist Ellefson) have enlisted the help of Angra guitarist Kiko Loureiro and Lamb Of God drummer Chris Adler this time. The former is a master of his craft who luckily gets enough room to display his talent and the latter simply sounds better than he ever has. The drum sound helps, but I think his parts are infinitely more interesting than what he does in his main band. Maybe these two guys were just wat Mustaine needed to write another scorching Metal record.\n\nThen again, the songwriting is cranked up a notch as well. Occasionally, you can hear that Mustaine had a little trouble coming up with an ending for a few songs, but after a song and a half, you\u2019ll have heard more good stuff than on all of \u2018Super Collider\u2019. The first two songs are among the album\u2019s best anyway: opening track \u2018The Threat Is Real\u2019 is nice and thrashy, while the title track has a passing nod to \u2018Hangar 18\u2019 with its highly melodic midtempo main riff \u2013 well, midtempo by Megadeth standards \u2013 and the sudden tempo change for an amazing guitar solo section near the end.\n\nStanding out for me is \u2018Poisonous Shadows\u2019. With its dark, brooding nature, vaguely Arabian-sounding string section and amazing chorus, it shows that Mustaine can write an excellent catchy track if he really puts his effort into it. Furthermore, the high octane instrumental \u2018Conquer Or Die!\u2019 is a showcase for Loureiro\u2019s skills on the electric as well as the nylon string acoustic guitar, \u2018Fatal Illusion\u2019 and \u2018Lying In State\u2019 are delightfully aggressive and the slower tempo makes \u2018Post American World\u2019 a perfect vehicle for a darker, more threatening take on the band\u2019s sound.\n\nWhile \u2018Dystopia\u2019 may not be the big return to the \u2018Rust In Peace\u2019 brand of Speed Metal some people may have been hoping for, I think it\u2019s excellent at finding the middle ground between heavy and thrash Metal, which is exactly what made 2004\u2019s \u2018The System Has Failed\u2019 such an awesome record as well. Mustaine\u2019s lyrical views may be a tad far-fetched every now and then, but I\u2019ll take a Mustaine I disagree with politically over the insipid drivel that dominated the previous record any day. At least this Mustaine sounds inspired, vicious and aggressive. And let\u2019s face it: isn\u2019t that how any fan of his work would want him to sound?\n\nRecommended tracks: \u2018Poisonous Shadows\u2019, \u2018Dystopia\u2019, \u2018The Threat Is Real\u2019\n\nOriginally written for my Kevy Metal weblog\n",
        "\nSome people I know think 'Thirteen' was a bad album because the album contained too many reworkings of older songs. Justified, but at least there was quite some memorable stuff on the record. \u2018Thirteen\u2019 contained at least five songs I really liked. \u2018Super Collider\u2019 has one. And a couple I consider somewhat enjoyable. But a good album, this is not. I have no problem with Megadeth playing something closer to hard rock than thrash metal, but imagine \u2018Youthanasia\u2019 or \u2018Cryptic Writings\u2019 without the good ideas. That\u2019s what \u2018Super Collider\u2019 is.\n\nThis album\u2019s title track was the first thing that surfaced from the album and it\u2019s easily one of the worst post \u2018Risk\u2019 songs by the band. But then again, heavy metal has never really been about the singles, has it? First single \u2018Can I Play With Madness\u2019 could never prepare the listener for the unbridled brilliance of Iron Maiden\u2019s \u2018Seventh Son Of A Seventh Son\u2019 either. Sadly, \u2018Super Collider\u2019 is no \u2018Seventh Son\u2019. The songwriting is bland and I can only hope that this is a one-time mistake for Dave Mustaine.\n\nAlso, Mustaine was known for his sharp lyric writing in Megadeth\u2019s heyday. Even though I didn\u2019t always necessarily agree with his views, his lyrics had a conviction and an indispensable, clever wit. A lot of the lyrics on \u2018Super Collider\u2019 seem to have been written with a rhyming dictionary. The next person who rhymes \u201cfire\u201d with \u201cdesire\u201d, I will slap in the face. In addition, it seems that these days, when Mustaine wants to make a point, he starts a spoken part. It\u2019s a feature that dragged down the title track of \u2018United Abominations\u2019 six years ago and now mutilates the otherwise decent \u2018Dance In The Rain\u2019, which also features a pointless guest appearance by Disturbed frontman David Draiman doing his best to sound as much as Mustaine as possible. \u2018Burn!\u2019 is also marred by insipid lyrics and a horrible chorus. The verses are awesome though.\n\nMaybe that\u2019s the most frustrating aspect about \u2018Super Collider\u2019. It\u2019s not like Mustaine lost it. Opening track \u2018Kingmaker\u2019 is an impressive heavy metal tune with a killer riff to boot. \u2018Forget To Remember\u2019 is a pretty good melodic hard rock tune with possibly the best set of lyrics on the album and \u2018Off The Edge\u2019 and \u2018Built For War\u2019 would have been good with better words.\n\nThe album\u2019s production is alright, just a torture to listen to on headphones. It\u2019s got too much treble, accounting for a pretty restless listening experience. Also, closing an album with a cover (even when it\u2019s a Thin Lizzy tune) has never been a good idea. You could try to get the edition with the bonus tracks, but those aren\u2019t all that good either. Especially \u2018All I Want\u2019. It\u2019s hard to believe that song has been written by the same man who gave us \u2018Hangar 18\u2019, \u2018Tornado Of Souls\u2019, \u2018Skin O\u2019 My Teeth\u2019 or \u2018Trust\u2019.\n\nWith this lineup possibly being the strongest the band has had musically, I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll come up with something better after this. I\u2019ll just listen to \u2018Rust In Peace\u2019, \u2018Countdown To Extinction\u2019, \u2018Cryptic Writings\u2019, \u2018Endgame\u2019 or \u2018The System Has Failed\u2019 in the meantime.\n\nRecommended track: \u2018Kingmaker\u2019\n\nOriginally written for my Kevy Metal weblog\n",
        "\nI kind of hate this album. It isn\u2019t just that it\u2019s sandwiched between two of the most definitive thrash albums of all time. It\u2019s also because it\u2019s uninspired as fuck, when it really shouldn\u2019t have been. This is not just the weakest of Megadeth\u2019s classic library. It\u2019s also one of the weakest releases of ANY of the Big Four\u2019s classic albums. I think \u201cFistful of Metal\u201d might actually be the only one that\u2019s worse than this. \n\nThere are a few songs on here that are OK, but there\u2019s nothing especially mind-blowing. Really the only things approaching highlights are \u201cSet the World Afire,\u201d \u201cIn My Darkest Hour,\u201d and \u201cLiar.\u201d I feel like I need to breakdown the better songs on the album so...continue on, dear reader!\n\n\u201cInto the Lungs of Hell\u201d is mildly pointless, but it\u2019s got solid riff work, so hooray, I guess. The song wasn\u2019t exactly improved by the weird synth-horns, which are total 80\u2019s cheeseball bullshit. So then we get into \u201cSet the World Afire,\u201d which is probably the best song on SFSGSW, and it feels like it\u2019s going to set this awesome tone for the rest of the album, but then\u2026.then the band just starts sounding like it\u2019s going through the motions. \u201cAnarchy in the UK\u201d is pretty whatever but it\u2019s listenable. It also thankfully marked the end of Megadeth\u2019s thrash covers of songs that don\u2019t need thrash covers. \u201cIn My Darkest Hour\u201d is a pretty good song, but needs a fuckin' trim because it's a touch too long. The next song on this album that actually feels like it catches any kind of fire is \u201cLiar.\" Nice placement, Dave! You always want to hide your best songs at the end of your fucking albums! SFSGSW would have made a pretty solid EP if Megadeth would\u2019ve just cut out all the bullshit filler (i.e. all the other songs I didn't mention).\n\nProduction values are nothing to write home about: It\u2019s competent, everything sounds the way it should, all instruments and vocals are present and accounted for in the mix. B+ work! Good, not great. I don\u2019t know what happened with this album, musically. Maybe the lineup had something to do with it. Everyone plays competently, but there just sounds like there was a lack of chemistry going on here that probably fucked with how good this album could have been. SFSGSW is the least essential \u2018Deth record until maybe Cryptic Writings. Don't, like...avoid it or anything. Just manage your expectations if you're new to Megadeth.\n",
        "\nMegadeth really fell off of the wagon for a lot of people with their 1999 full-length album \"Risk\". Hell, even I often question why the band thought this was a good idea at the time and I actually enjoy the album to an extent. It became quite clear to the band that fans were very upset by this album and even today, it's still regarded as one of the most failed experiments to come out of a legendary heavy metal band. Dave Mustaine made the decision that Megadeth would not venture further down the road of alternative rock, although this caused a bit of chagrin for fellow guitarist Marty Friedman, who left the band before this album came out. He wanted to expand the alternative style Megadeth had embraced and because no one else agreed, he went off on his own. This was probably for the best, anyway. \n\n\"The World Needs a Hero\" was released in 2001, two years after the aforementioned \"Risk\". It showcased Megadeth moving back to a heavy metal style heard on albums such as \"Countdown to Extinction\" and \"Youthanasia\", with a dose of the band's thrash metal style here and there. This is seen as a \"return to form\" by some fans but for myself, it's only a step back in the right direction. It is very inconsistent and can't seem to make up its mind. Is it a heavy metal album? Or a hard rock album? Or a thrash metal album? Truthfully, it takes all of these styles and scatters them sporadically around the album's nearly 1 hour runtime. The track \"Disconnect\" opens the album and seems to be more along the lines of heavy metal and rock, with a slow, melodic guitar solo and some chuggy yet watered-down riffs. This is unfortunate because I feel Mustaine really halfassed a lot of this. Songs like \"When\" and the heavy/hard rock song \"1000 Time Goodbye\", which is one of my favorites here, work this style very well with ultra-melodic riffs and kickass solos. However, while it's not a terrible song, I feel \"Disconnect\" didn't allow the album to take off at full potential.\n\nSo, like I said, \"1000 Times Goodbye\" and \"When\" (also Megadeth's longest song) are great cuts and show how good the album can be. They aren't thrashers but very good melodic metal tracks. \"Return to Hanger\" is the album's thrashiest song and serves as a sequel to the legendary \"Hanger 18\" from \"Rust In Peace\". It follows in \"Hanger 18's\" footsteps and while it doesn't outdo it, it certainly does it justice. Especially the outro with its multiple solos! Unfortunately, for every great song here, there are duds. Take the album's single \"Moto Psycho\". What the fuck, Dave? This song is awful. The lyrics are childish and the riffs are bland. This also is one of the album's thrashier tracks which makes it even more disappointing, because it's very watered-down thrash metal. \"Losing My Senses\" also fails to please with just an overall boring structure. This album is pretty much 65-70 stuff that sounds decent to very good, and the rest of it, well...disappoints. Hence my rating of the album. It's not as low as \"Risk\" but due to inconsistency, it ain't much better.\n\nI don't really have much to say about this album, because for me, 1999-2004 Megadeth was the band at its worst, not counting 2013's abomination that was \"Super Collider\", proving to be Megadeth's worst album overall. So none of the albums from 1999-2004 are horrible, as I have said before. They just fail to captivate me the way any of the other albums Dave and co. have put out. This one just seems like an awkward attempt to transition back to thrash metal, only succeeding in a few areas.\n",
        "\nAfter the fairly big success of Megadeth's 1997 album \"Cryptic Writings\", Dave and Co. decided to continue down the route of mainstream heavy metal and rock music. Unlike \"Cryptic Writings\", however, \"Risk\" is not a metal album. Really, there's hardly any metal here at all. Save maybe for a few riffs. \"Risk\" is definitely a decent album and at times pretty darn good. But is it a good album by Megadeth? No, not really. This album would have totally been fine if it had been released by Dave Mustaine as a solo album or something but really, it should not have been released under the Megadeth name. \n\nThis album just sounds...weird at times. \"Insomnia\" is one of the album's singles and right off the bat, something feels a little off. There are some catchy riffs and a violin which is something Megadeth had never incorporated into a song before. Some of these cool ideas exist throughout the album but they really are few and far between. \"Insomnia\" really is one of the more boring songs, but is definitely better than the horrible disco abomination that is \"Crush 'Em\", which was another of the album's three singles. So, what was the other single? One of the album's strongest tracks, actually, titled \"Breadline\". This song has a bit of a classic rock vibe and maybe something along the lines of ZZ Top. This song has some really catchy riffs that, while poppy, really work well. The solo is probably one of the album's best (let's face it, this album only has like two or three really good solos) although it's fairly simple, to no surprise. Another pretty cool song with some awesome riffs is \"The Doctor is Calling\". \"Prince of Darkness\" also shows a bit of a doom influence but this song sounds far more boring in my opinion, which is one of the album's main flaws. It's a fairly decent song but drags far too long. There is almost an atmosphere of grunge, doom metal, and classic/glam rock molded all together into one. \"Wanderlust\" is also one of the album's best songs and showcases a western bluegrass/country rock hybrid sound. Yes, you heard that right. This song's chorus, solo, and that section in the middle of the song is sick! The album's closing tracks are the real gems, though. \"Time I\" is a somber piece of acoustic music that definitely retains a grunge influence but doesn't sound weak or cheesy. This is followed by \"Time II\", obviously the second part. Out of all the songs on this album, it may be the hardest. There is even what sort of resembles a speed metal riff at the beginning of the song. This is the ONLY moment that even slightly hints at Megadeth's classic sound. The solo in this song is also really, really cool.\n\nSo yes, the guitars have some moments and I'd say 5 of the 12 songs are really worth listening to all the way through. Although most songs do contain some cool ideas spread sporadically around. Unfortunately with only a few riffs sounding like something Megadeth actually would have written, and some songs like \"Seven\" and \"Crush 'Em\" sounding downright silly, this is definitely the worst album by Megadeth before the abomination and the far inferior \"Super Collider\", which I already reviewed. Dave's vocals here sound a bit lackluster and sometimes he just sounds weird. Like when he growls in \"Prince of Darkness\". This isn't even a growl that would sound cool in death metal or something. Instead, it just sounds like he's trying to be...mean? I don't know, but it's weird. I'm glad Megadeth decided to play metal again after this album for awhile because the entire band, save for Marty Freidman who wanted to further his venture into alternative music by leaving Megadeth to play J-pop, realized this album was a misstep. Well, I know Dave Mustaine realized this. I'm sure most of the other members of Megadeth thought the same. \n\nIn conclusion, this is a pretty decent album for the rock/alternative genre and has it's share of killer songs but should not have worn the Megadeth logo. This 1999 album will always remain infamous as Megadeth's most experimental album but to me, it's not their worst. It's just their second worst!\n",
        "\nMegadeth's 1990s outputs, for the most part, seem to be less controversial and spat upon than those of Metallica, save maybe for \"Metallica\" in some cases. Unfortunately, this really only applies to \"Countdown to Extinction\" and \"Youthanasia\". 1997's \"Cryptic Writings\" saw Megadeth moving even further down the road of pop, hard rock, and radio metal. This was not as drastic of a change that we eventually got with \"Risk\" and a huge amount of the metallic bite was still retained here. Still, \"Cryptic Writings\" remains a controversial topic of conversation between most Megadeth fans. Taking this album's sound into consideration, it's quite easy to see why.\n\nThe guitars on this album are quite stripped down and far more simple than anything the guys had released before. Instead of focusing on technicality, Dave and Marty seemed to really put an emphasis on blues-influenced rock riffing with a sharp metal edge and a key focus on melody, albeit a much more simple melody. This is different than melody heard on \"Tornado of Souls\" or \"Holy Wars\". Really, at this point, if you were expecting another \"Rust in Peace\", you were living in a world of false hope. Megadeth was not making thrash metal anymore in 1997, save for a few songs on this album. The guitars mainly focus on groove and a very catchy flow. \"Trust\" was this album's main single. After a drum roll somewhat similar to \"Enter Sandman\" (sorry again for the Metallica comparisons), a memorable guitar riff makes itself audible. This is the riff utilized throughout the song's chorus and shows how the album works as both a metal AND a pop album, all in one. The solo, of course, is great as well. \"Almost Honest\" immediately follows. This song features similar themes of trust, or rather, distrust. The riffs are somewhat similar in that they sound quite poppy. There is still that metal bite as well, used more as undertone. \n\nSo while most of these songs are heavily rooted within hard rock and pop, blues seems to make a huge impact on the overall sound as well. \"Use the Man\" is a somber piece about Dave Mustaine's battle and observance of heroin addiction, hence \"using the needle\". This song begins with a bluesy acoustic passage accompanied by some sporadic hints of electric guitar. The song picks up later on to a faster paced heavy metal track while still retaining the blues atmosphere. \"Have Cool, Will Travel\" is definitely blues influenced with a really unusual harmonica thrown in the mix. The riffs are a bit odd and sound a little weird, for lack of a better word. This only makes the song that much more interesting. \"I'll Get Even\" seems to mix the styles of pop and blues with its extremely catchy yet bluesy chorus. This song seems to be similar in structure to \"A Secret Place\" by following a similar overall formula, kind of like \"Trust\" and \"Almost Honest\". This is a beautiful, powerful song that does not get the recognition it deserves, in my opinion.\n\nSo while this album mainly showcases Megadeth's pop and blues side from a metal standpoint, there are some songs that stick to a more heavy metal formula, and even some that retain Megadeth's old thrash/speed metal sound, believe it or not! \"She-Wolf\" is one of those more traditional heavy metal tunes with a kick ass solo and one of the most melodic riffs on the entire album. This is one of those songs that has become a staple at live shows and a fan favorite, for good reason. This is the song that really sticks out on the band's heavy metal side, but what about that aforementioned thrash metal sound that sometimes pops up on this album? Take the track \"The Disintegrators\". This is the first of the two REAL thrashers on the album. This song is a nice throwback to the 1980s sound of Megadeth and while it still has that \"Cryptic Writings\" feel to it, this doesn't cause the song to derail whatsoever. It's a nice breath of air from the old days. You'd think that it would not fit in with the rest of the songs but really, it only enhances the album's quality. \"FFF\" (Fight For Freedom) is the other thrash song, and is actually the album's closing track. This song is short, clocking in at under 3 minutes in length. It manages to be the fastest song on the album with a fairly aggressive riff and galloping thrash/speed metal sound. Kind of a weird way to close a more rocker of an album but it works nonetheless. Maybe it should have been placed in the middle somewhere, though. \n\nCompared to \"Youthanasia\", Mustaine's voice sounds even better here. Like I said previously, his voice pretty much had improved on every album up to this point but on this one, he was at his best. It's not their best album, no. But vocally, Mustaine offered his best performance this time around. His voice contained the perfect tone for the music and nothing was annoying about it, nor did it detract from the music. When he needs to sound painful and emotional, he gets the job done. I really can't find anything wrong with the performance in terms of vocals.\n\nThe drums are fairly simple here aside for the two thrash metal songs. There's nothing really technical about them, and for the most part, that seems to work. I do wish some more of that jazz influence was thrown into the mix that the early Megadeth albums had. I know Gar was long gone at this point but even Menza had a bit of that jazz influence and I feels it goes to waste here. \n\nReally, aside from a few flaws and some cheese, \"Cryptic Writings\" is a MUCH better album than most would like to admit. It's the precursor to \"Risk\" and kind of shows where the band was going to that point, although keeping most of the metal in there as well. A solid album, this was a \"pop metal\" album that actually worked, and it worked quite well.\n",
        "\nAs we all know, Megadeth had entered into the mostly thrash-less 1990s era of metal with their album \"Countdown to Extinction\" released two years prior. In my eyes, that album was the logical answer to Metallica's 1991 album. With \"Youthanasia\", we see the band moving further down into commercialism and leaving their thrash metal roots even further behind. This album basically expanded the sound Dave and Co. were going with on \"Countdown to Extinction\" and added more of a traditional heavy metal/hard rock soundscape to the already commercial-aimed music. \"Youthanasia\" was released in 1994, during the height of the grunge/groove metal movement and managed to stand out quite a bit regardless. Here, we see Megadeth writing songs that could be played both on MTV at the time and the radio, as well as at your standard heavy metal show. This is still obviously a Megadeth album and really, it's not a HUGE departure from the band's previous sound.\n\nThe guitar work on here is similar to \"Countdown to Extinction\" but Dave and Marty have both seemed to add more melody and catchy hooks to the mix. If you came here looking for thrash, you'll probably only be slightly satisfied. Songs like \"Reckoning Day\" and \"The Killing Road\" and the lyrical oath to Megadeth, \"Victory\", all contain some nice speed metal riffs. However, these songs are still very much in the vein of 1990s Megadeth. There really is no thrash metal to be heard here. Instead, the band takes \"Countdown...\" and slows down the pace, even more, adding more radio-friendly aspects to the music. This is metal, but it's commercial metal. It's still not as simplistic as Metallica's infamous album released three years prior. There is a lot more going on here. Dave is able to put far more emotion into his guitar playing in here than he had before. \"\u00c0 Tout le Monde\" is a fan-favorite from this album. Really, most people I talk to absolutely love this song, even if they're stuck in the days of 80s thrash metal. It's a somber piece, and translates to \"To All the World\". This song captures Mustaine's emotions absolutely perfectly. It's not a particularly complicated song in terms of structure, however, it is very effective in creating a melancholic atmosphere. The solo in this song is also fairly simple when compared to earlier works such as \"Holy Wars\" or \"Devils Island\" or most of the stuff released during 'Deth's glory days, but its simplicity actually complements its beauty. There are other songs that follow in this path of beauty, such as within the acoustic intro to \"Blood of Heroes\" and even the lyrically incestual-based \"Family Tree\". Songs like \"I Thought I Knew It All\" and the aforementioned \"Family Tree\" actually are two of my favorites on the album due to the choruses of these songs being absolutely breathtaking. Sure, they're catchy and radio-friendly, but very controlled and effective. \n\nThe guitar work coming from Dave and Marty was probably at its most mature point on this album. Now, mature can mean one of many things. Either the band sold out and stopped playing heavy music, they got more melodically mature, they changed their sound to appeal to an audience, or they started playing music that your fucking grandfather would enjoy. When \"Countdown...\" came out, Megadeth had already matured. And here, it's the same thing. They've matured a bit, but in a positive way. This would be maturing in a more melodic way, with a key emphasis on songwriting and overall musical flow. This album has NOTHING on \"Rust in Peace\" or \"Peace Sells...but Who's Buying?\" and while those albums both get much higher scores than this album from me, \"Youthanasia\" contains a certain melodic element and musical flow, as I said earlier, that the band's thrash albums never had. While the band's classic thrash albums focused on technicality and precision, the 90s Megadeth albums, including the abhorred \"Risk\" from 1999, all focused more on simpler ideas of flow rather than long, technical solos. Make no mistake, however, we still got plenty of amazing guitar solos from Megadeth in the 90s. \"I Thought I Knew It All\" and \"Elysian Fields\" for example, as well as the groovy title-track, are amazing when it comes to guitar solos. Luckily, as with Megadeth tradition, all 12 songs on this album have ripping guitar solos. Most Megadeth songs at least have a somewhat interesting solo and these songs are no exception. I'm glad the band didn't let the simpler song structures affect the guitar solos. \n\nRemember how I said Dave Mustaine's vocals on \"Countdown to Extinction\" were his best offering up to that point? Well, now that we have \"Youthanasia\" here, that changes. On this album, Dave offers an even better performance than prior. He sounds more spiteful and far more focused here. Honestly, here, he even rivals James Hetfield in terms of quality. Anyone who really knows me knows I like Hetfield's vocals more, regardless of the music as a whole. Dave manages to rise to his level here. Hell, maybe even above that! The emotion he puts behind his vocals is nearly unmatched here. He still utilizes the traditional higher-pitched voice that he had been using at the time but it works in favor of the music. \n\nThis album, to my ears, is the finest Megadeth record of the 1990s. While 1997's \"Cryptic Writings\", the album following this one, would be Megadeth's second best 1990s album, this was really their best for the time. Hell, it's even better than some of their 1980s work! Truly a testament to heavy metal and a kick in the face to the 1990s alternative style, \"Youthanasia\" remains one of Megadeth's finest albums and should be celebrated as such.\n",
        "\nAfter releasing what I believe to be the best thrash metal album ever in 1990, \u201cRust in Peace\u201d, Megadeth surely had a lot to live up to. Their mission was to craft a follow-up album that would bring the band to new heights. Of course, during the 1990s, thrash metal was experiencing a massive decrease in popularity. With this new decade, metal as a whole seemed to be changing. Most of the thrash bands that were exploding in the 1980s moved away from their roots. Sure, Slayer still mostly stuck to their formula, but Metallica adopted a simple, standard heavy metal/hard rock sound, Anthrax started incorporating influences of grunge and alternative metal, Testament started experimenting with death metal, and thanks mainly to bands like Pantera and Machine Head, groove metal basically overthrew thrash metal. This is not including the numerous grunge acts that began popping up. I\u2019m not saying anything bad about these bands changing and new bands emerging, but thrash had all but died. Megadeth dropped much of the thrash out of their sound as well, beginning with this album, incorporating a more melodic heavy metal sound with slight traces of thrash still scattered about. \u201cCountdown to Extinction\u201d is Megadeth\u2019s fifth full-length album and was released the year following Metallica\u2019s self-titled album, otherwise known as \u201cThe Black Album\u201d. Now, unlike that album, which would go on to sell 16 million+ copies in the U.S. alone, \u201cCountdown to Extinction\u201d is a solid heavy metal album from start to finish. The songwriting is far superior and the songs aren\u2019t as boring or simplistic. Unfortunately, this album would only sell around 2 million copies in the U.S., which is significantly less than Metallica did. As if album sales were indicators of quality, anyway. \n\n\u201cSkin O\u2019 My Teeth\u201d shows an immediate shift in sound for Megadeth. Unlike the aggressive thrash riffs of old, this is more of a melodic rocker with an overall traditional heavy metal sound. The riffs are slower yet still fairly speed metal influenced, albeit less aggressive. The song that borrows the most from the band\u2019s previous thrash sound would have to be the closer \u201cCrown of Worms\u201d. \u201cAshes In Your Mouth\u201d is also fairly thrashy at times but really, the closing track is pretty much an all-out speed/thrash metal song. The rest of the album follows a more mid-paced heavy metal sound. Make no mistake, though, there is plenty of heaviness here. \u201cSymphony of Destruction\u201d has become one of the band\u2019s most memorable songs, and rightfully so. After an extremely brief symphonic intro, a heavy riff explodes out of nowhere. This isn\u2019t a very complex song, save for the solo, which every song seems to do a good job of providing, but damn that riff is crushing! Not only that, it\u2019s positively catchy as well. \u201cSweating Bullets\u201d is the album\u2019s other song that achieved significant attention. Unfortunately, for me, this song falls a little short. It\u2019s just not that great to my ears and is far too broken sounding. Really, this is probably the album\u2019s weakest track. Thankfully it is followed by one of the album\u2019s highlights, \u201cThis Was My Life\u201d. This basically describes the album\u2019s overall sound quite well. It\u2019s extremely melodic and accessible but very much a Megadeth song. The album\u2019s title-track is similar in formula, beginning with a melodic bass riff that explodes into a guitar riff and has one of the catchiest choruses on the album. The title-track also shows Mustaine writing about themes the band had never really touched on before this album.\n\nLyrically, this is a new stepping stone for the boys. The title-track, as I said, showed Mustaine\u2019s lyrics moving in a different direction. This song deals with humanity and how humans are killing off different species of animals to extinction, basically. \u201cCaptive Honour\u201d seems to deal with the state of prisons and what happens inside them. This song also starts with one of the most beautiful acoustic riffs Mustaine has ever written. I also must admit the \u201cyour soul better belong to Jesus, because your ass belongs to me\u201d makes me giggle every time. \u201cPsychotron\u201d seems to be a little less on the serious side, which most of this album sticks to. It\u2019s pretty much just a song about robots. One last song I will discuss here is \u201cHigh Speed Dirt\u201d. It becomes clear someone is going to die, judging by the \u201cI\u2019m off to meet my maker\u201d remark. This song adopts lyrics alluding to someone heading towards the ground at full speed. Yes, this is a song about someone free-falling out of the sky on his way to certain death once he meets the ground as a \u201cdirt torpedo\u201d. So these lyrics range from really deep topics to thought-provoking themes, and themes of robots and falling from the sky. There is a lot of lyrical diversity here.\n\nArmed with new lyrical ideas, Dave\u2019s voice had been steadily improving through Megadeth\u2019s career at this point. At the time this album was released, this was definitely Mustaine\u2019s best vocal performance. I still wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s mind-blowing or amazing because his vocals certainly aren\u2019t the reason I generally listen to Megadeth, but they are much better here and more of a pleasure to listen to. They sometimes sound a little off, such as with \u201cSweating Bullets\u201d to an extent, but they generally sound good. \n\nCompared to Metallica\u2019s self-titled record, where drummer Lars Ulrich probably only used two or three different drumlines throughout the entire album\u2019s length, Nick Menza actually used a lot of drum variation on here for a more groove-oriented metal album. His technicality was not as highlighted as with \u201cRust in Peace\u201d, obviously, but he was still able to shake things up here and even throw in a bit of the old speed metal influence in his playing, which is something Metallica totally failed to do throughout the 1990s. This reason, along with the still-present yet commercialized guitar technicality and precision, is the reason \u201cCountdown to Extinction\u201d is a FAR superior heavy metal album than \u201cMetallica\u201d was. Unfortunately, this album did not sell nearly as well and did not quite get the recognition it deserved. Really, this could be said about anything Megadeth had put out in the 1990s, which was all superior to 90s Metallica in every way. Oh well, Metallica is pretty much a \"brand\" within the metal genre, so of course it will sell better. That doesn't necessarily mean it IS better. \n\nSo with this album, Megadeth launched themselves into the world of 1990s commercial radio metal. But was it a failure? Was it a mistake? No, not at all. This album isn't up to the quality of most of what Megadeth has written prior, but really, comparing this to \"Peace Sells\" or \"RIP\" would be ridiculous because it's not in the same league. That being said, it is still a worthy album to bear the Megadeth logo and definitely outshines Metallica's self-titled album.\n",
        "\nI'm not sure where I read it, but years ago, I read that Megadeth's \"Rust in Peace\" is \"so technical and musically sophisticated, it is near impossible to rip off\" or something like that. I'm not sure how accurate this is but judging by the sound and sheer intensity of the music, I can definitely see why someone would say this. Released in late 1990, \"Rust in Peace\" is Megadeth's fourth full-length studio album. This album, along with \"Peace Sells...but Who's Buying?\" both seem to garner the \"best Megadeth album\" or even \"best thrash metal album\" labels, depending on who you talk to. It seems \"Peace Sells\" is usually given that honor. Of course, that album happens to be my second favorite from Megadeth. This album, in my opinion, is the best thrash metal album of all time. It's followed very closely by albums such as \"...And Justice For All\" by Metallica, \"Pleasure to Kill\" by Kreator, \"Darkness Descends\" by Dark Angel, \"By Inheritance\" by Artillery, \"Agent Orange\" by Sodom, and even the more modern album \"Black Future\" by Vektor. Those are all legendary albums for sure but Megadeth's \"Rust in Peace\" manages to outshine all of them. At this point, Dave and Co. reached their creative peak. \n\nCombining melody with technicality and a fairly mature style of songwriting, \"Rust in Peace\" almost seemed to be Megadeth's answer to Metallica's aforementioned \"...And Justice For All\". Granted this album was not nearly as rooted in progressive metal, nor are there any 9-minute plus songs on here. These guys managed to make an album far more impressive than \"AJFA\" without needing super long tracks. The guitar work here is by far the best on any Megadeth album. It's melodic yet at the same time, extremely technical. And it's not the wanky technical, either. The solos here almost sound impossible to play even for the most seasoned of guitarists. And these guys were on drugs when they recorded this album! Which, of course, was standard throughout much of the band's early discography. But I digress, this album literally seems too good to be true.\n\nBack to the guitar work. The introductory track \"Holy Wars...the Punishment Due\" starts off in a speed metal frenzy that eventually breaks for a melodic interlude with a middle-eastern influence (which shouldn't be surprising, look at the song's lyrical content!). This acoustic interlude is then ended with a melodic, heavier electric guitar riff. This is one of the most beautiful moments on the entire album. Of course, where would this album be without its solos? This song has two guitar solos that really stick out, one that's slower and more melodic and one that's much faster and more aggressive. I have to wonder, after recording this album, how did Dave Mustaine and Marty Friedman still manage to have fingers? It seems impossible. While they decided to start the album off at its strongest point with its best track, the rest of this beast only maintains the sheer intensity and complexity. \"Hangar 18\" is another one of the band's most well-known song and while it's a little simpler than \"Holy Wars...\", it's still extremely proficient and technical. There are plenty of slower moments on the album. \"Poison Was the Cure\" starts off with a slow bass riff and then explodes into a thrash assault. Speaking of bass, \"Dawn Patrol\" is the shortest track on the album. It's just under two minutes and serves as an interlude drum and bass track with spoken word passages. This song is preceded by \"Tornado of Souls\" which, while \"Holy Wars...\" still remains the best track overall, this song contains the best guitar solo on the album. The riffs are very melodic and catchy but not to the point where they sound cheesy. This song reeks of technical precision. The title track of this album ends the show with a bang. Talk about a riff-fest! It's pretty amazing how such a guitar driven album manages to not let up in intensity, even when the songs take a more melodic turn. Megadeth certainly hasn't managed to write riffs of this quality since this album and honestly, I doubt they ever will again. \n\nAs this was Marty Friedman's first album playing guitar for Megadeth, this was drummer Nick Menza's first as well. There seems to be a bit of a jazz influence in the drumming, and it almost sounds like something Gar Samuelson would have recorded. Granted it's not as jazzy, but Menza manages to give off one hell of a performance. The drumming is top notch and is mixed perfectly in the music. The mix overall is absolutely perfect and none of the instruments overpower each other. Even the bass can be heard as mentioned earlier! This is one of the strongest vocal performances Dave Mustaine has ever provided. I wouldn't say it's the absolute cream of the crop, but it's close. He sounds very powerful here and nothing sounds forced. \n\nSuch as the case with a lot of these classic albums that have a million reviews as it is, I really can't say anything that hasn't already been said. This album is perfect from front to back. It is 40 minutes of thrash excellence that still manages to have not been surpassed by any other band. Sure, plenty have came close but honestly, I don't think any band will ever reach this level of musical perfection. And I'm aware there are more technical albums out there as well. My opinion still stands. This is the best thrash metal album ever made.\n",
        "\nAfter releasing the near-perfect \"Peace Sells...but Who's Buying?\", Megadeth returned with their third full-length album \"So Far, So Good...So What!\" in 1988. Musically, this album is a bit of a step back from the previous album although still better than the band's debut. This album is often seen as the weakest link of the band's four original thrash metal-era albums, and while I don't quite agree, it definitely is not on the same level as the band's second and fourth albums. What we have here could be described as almost awkward in terms of musical composition and ideas but there still is a lot of good to be heard here and the album overall is still considered a classic, even if it is the lesser album.\n\nAfter the heroic intro track \"Into the Lungs of Hell\", \"Set the World Afire\" takes off furiously. This was, I'm pretty sure, the first song Mustaine wrote after his exile from Metallica. Originally entitled \"Megadeath\", the band eventually renamed it to its final title after changing their name from Mechanix to Megadeth, dropping the \"a\" in \"death\". This is probably the strongest song on the album and unfortunately, this caused issues for me. This left a lot of filler to be heard during the middle sections of the album. The Sex Pistols cover of \"Anarchy in the U.K.\" just sounds awkward and forced, probably because it doesn't quite capture the atmosphere of the original. \"Mary Jane\" is a fairly haunting song that builds kind of cool but most of it bores the shit out of me. I realize a lot of people love this track but for me, I find it lacking and boring. The final track I find to be lackluster was \"Liar\". A verbal assault on Chris Poland for stealing Mustaine's gear for drug money, this song just sound generic and uninspired. I always find myself skipping it when I throw this album on. The five other tracks are pretty good most of the time, and aside from \"Set the World Afire\", \"In My Darkest Hour\" is one of the best songs Megadeth had ever written. It's the album's slower song, and a musical tribute to former Metallica bassist Cliff Burton after he died in 1986. This song begins with somber acoustic guitars and has some of the most melodic riffing on the album, which is to be expected from a \"ballad\" such as this. \n\nThe production on this album is probably the second dirtiest Megadeth had ever managed to pull off. It's cleaner than \"Killing Is My Business...\" but has a lot of grit and mess on top of it. This helps the music sound more organic and less polished. While Metallica was writing long, progressive, technically driven songs at this point in their career, Megadeth was sticking to a less complex thrash sound. It also was definitely not as well-produced. The guitar solos are as proficient as ever but it seemed that Mustaine preferred the speed metal aspect over the progressive sound. They would eventually embrace a far more technical sound on \"Rust in Peace\". What's strange is how this album is actually more underproduced than \"Peace Sells...\" was, and that album came before this one. It seems that this album was rushed and unfortunately, that was likely its downfall. \n\nThis was the only album to feature guitarist Jeff Young, as well as drummer Chuck Behler. Replacing Gar Samuelson, Behler was actually his drum technician and was immediately hired as the replacement. Unfortunately, he definitely falls short of Samuelson. We don't really have that jazzy influence Gar had and while Chuck can certainly play fast and thrashy drumlines, something just didn't feel right here. Thankfully, for the following four albums, he was replaced by the far superior Nick Menza. I'm not saying Behler was bad or anything but he had huge shoes to fill and unfortunately, he fell fairly short. \n\nThis was just an album that fell short of its precursor. That's it. It's not bad. Actually, it's pretty good. It's a solid thrash metal album with more punk elements than usual, probably due mainly to the Sex Pistols cover, but there are plenty of Megadeth albums that blow this one out of the water. Following this album, Mustaine and co. would put out \"Rust in Peace\", and they would take the title of \"best thrash album of all time\". In my opinion, of course.\n",
        "\nIt's not exactly like more opinions are needed for an album as discussed and disputed as 'Rust in Peace', but maybe the time has come to reconsider the music from Megadeth's 1990 incarnation in a different light. In the first place, there are 9 reviews below mine that I don't trust since all of them bear the 100% stamp that means someone has become carried away and let their emotions rule the rating. However, that's not to say that we can't learn something from those scores, because if an album can draw that kind of reaction then there must be some truth that its quality and effect on the listener are both extremely strong indeed.\n\nMy personal experience of this album might shed some light on the situation. As a very young metal fan (I suppose I was 12 or 13 when I bought this), I was rather confused and not especially excited by the songs on offer here, although I had already noticed the quality and riff content of 'Holy Wars...The Punishment Due' and played that song the most. Later, I became more interested in the rest of the album as I warmed to the style, though I would still select certain songs for listening, usually turning my nose up at 'Take No Prisoners', 'Five Magics', and 'Poison Was the Cure', which seemed to me either muddy, aimless, or a combination of the two. Nowadays, I can listen to the entire album and hear the ideas and detail that has gone into the making even of my less favourite songs, but I still can't really say that this album approaches perfection or that all those ideas are that awesome. I suppose that my young self kind of had a point about 'Rust in Peace', mostly because I was initially left cold to some of the songs that showed technical proficiency though were not very attractive or those that were structured in odd and unhelpful forms.\n\nThe unattractiveness and odd structuring need to be addressed, because there isn't much to complain about from a technical point of view and anyway I'm not the guy for that job. When I say that a song like 'Take No Prisoners' is unattractive, I don't mean that it's ugly exactly - this ain't The Dillinger Escape Plan or necro black metal - nor that it's plain, yet I'm not drawn to the sound or the movement of the song as I am with 'Tornado of Souls', for example. Maybe it's the overwhelming growl and grunt of all the bass work from David Ellefson, because the whole aura of that song is dirty and messy (I have the 2004 Capitol remaster if that helps), without proper definition for either the slightly sloppy bass or the fuzzy scramble of the guitars, while the drums are too soft, especially the kicks, actually competing with the floppy bass sound. Then Dave Mustaine's voice is a bit too far up the mix and quite scratchy (the vocals were actually rerecorded for this song, so it might sound different on different versions), which means everything is out of balance. Then there's the song itself, which never settles down to really do that much except provide a platform for the bass solos and licks. Compare that to another song - even a less lauded one like 'Lucretia' - and you can instantly hear just how clear the intention of the band becomes, with great momentum and much better clarity, plus a bass solo that is integrated into the song instead of the other way round.\n\nThe structuring of 'Take No Prisoners' is my main grumble, but moving on from that song I also wonder what made 'Five Magics' take the form it does. I mean, the intro is fairly cool and goes through plenty of changes that generate atmosphere and give each instrumentalist a chance to show themselves, yet when the meat of the song arrives it suddenly seems dispensable, as if it was just something interesting that the band had thought up. The same goes for 'Dawn Patrol', which is clearly inessential yet sort of entertaining in a totally different way to the shredding in 'Hangar 18' or elsewhere. I wouldn't have such a problem with the off-the-cuff structuring and inclusion of ideas if 'Rust in Peace' felt like the kind of album where the musicians were just having fun with ideas; however, it doesn't, since the level of technical ability and forethought (mostly) on show utterly disagrees with the concept that the band were jamming or having fun. I suppose that is probably my biggest criticism of 'Rust in Peace', since there isn't a sense of fun or spontaneity about the songs here, while 'Peace Sells' (the other sacred Megadeth release) does have those things. Maybe it's the mix or the production or the technical concentration that goes into some of the songs, but I can't always just enjoy what's happening here despite the extremely high level of quality.\n\nFor most of the music on offer, however, I must say it is not only skillful but also exciting. Enough has been said about the merits of the best songs that I don't need to add anything, though let it be known that I utterly agree with those who reckon the opening pair of songs, 'Tornado of Souls', and the title track are among the best speed/thrash tunes out there, while 'Lucretia' is also a great underrated listen. For aggression, melodic sense, and pure artful shredding, you would be hard pressed to find a better album. On balance, this is still a fantastic album and essential listening for almost any metalhead, yet it doesn't maintain the quality that it shows for the most part, struggling with clarity and structure in a few places, especially the dim squelch of 'Take No Prisoners'. Expect a lot, by all means, but not 100%.\n",
        "\nWell, here it is. Megadeth's highly acclaimed second full-length album. Released a year following the debut \"Killing is My Business...and Business is Good!\", \"Peace Sells...but Who's Buying?\" showcases the band already evolving vastly above what they were doing before. And again, it amazes me how these guys made this music while on all of the drugs. This album took their thrash/speed metal sound and basically lessened the speed metal aspects. They're still there of course, because thrash metal basically evolved from speed metal. However, overall, this album is far more a pure thrash piece than anything. It is far more sophisticated musically, in terms of songwriting, technicality, and melody. This was also the album that pushed Megadeth further into superstardom, and gained them even more positive media attention than they were already accumulating. \n\n\"Wake Up Dead\", although only having a few lines of lyrics, was already one of Megadeth's finest pieces of music the band had yet to create. It was placed right at the beginning of the album. The riffs in this song are heavy as balls and pure thrash! This album seems to be a bit darker than the first record. There are still lyrical ideals of the occult, with tracks such as \"The Conjuring\", \"Devils Island\", and \"Good Mourning/Black Friday\". The third track I just mentioned also has a beautiful acoustic intro which screams an influence of classical music. It's dark and haunting and quite beautiful at the same time. These songs, unsurprisingly with their lyrical themes, are among the darkest on the album. Not only that, but some of the darkest the band has ever written. This album also was where Dave began to include political themes. Of course, I'm speaking of the title track \"Peace Sells\". The lyrics are basically questions of a political nature with Mustaine answering them afterwards. This is one of the most recognized, iconic Deth songs, and with good reasoning. It positively rips! In terms of guitar, with this album's many overly impressive solos and riffs, we are treated to an absolute masterpiece that Megadeth wouldn't top until \"Rust in Peace\", which would come four years later in 1990.\n\nDave's vocals are, again, my least favorite aspect of this album. I've stated I'm not a huge fan of his singing and that still stands with this record. That doesn't matter though. The music is just too good. As with the previous record, Gar Samuelson preformed drums on this album. He was a skilled drummer playing in jazz fusion bands before and the jazz influence in his drumming is completely obvious here. He was probably the most skilled drummer Megadeth ever employed, dare I say. His technical proficiency is unmatched. Unfortunately he would not play on anymore Megadeth albums, as he was fired due to his hard drug abuse. I believe Mustaine was trying to clean up at this point, and did not tolerate Gar's drug use (which is totally understandable). Still, it's quite sad, and he would eventually pass away. His legacy definitely lives on with this record.\n\nI really can't say more about this album, honestly. It's not their best, as I said earlier, but it is very close to a perfect thrash metal album. With these classic releases, so many people have thrown their input in and provided reviews. I feel like I owe these albums reviews, though, and so I shall. I love that we can provide reviews for the music we enjoy on this website and I love how relevant it had become. \"Tell me something, it's still we, the people, right?\"\n",
        "\nYou know you're bored when you're writing album reviews for the archives on a fucking airplane on the way back from Poland, while using your iPhone because you lack the space to use your laptop. Also, I'm doing this on the \"Notes\" application, as I would rather not pay for WiFi. Anyway, I have multiple series of discography reviews going on at the moment, but decided I'd go ahead and begin one for Megadeth. As we all know, Megadeth is the birth child of guitar mastermind Dave Mustaine after his exile from Metallica. We all know the story of how Metallica kicked him out due to his heavy substance abuse and sent him on his way on a bus. He formed Megadeth originally as \"revenge\" and retaliation against Metallica. He wanted to be bigger than Metallica. He wanted to be better. Sadly, his music never reached the popularity of Metallica's. They've had a few albums that have sold over the platinum status but Metallica's worst albums even sold a few million copies. Megadeth's last record to sell well at all was 1999's \"Risk\", which went gold. This is unfortunate, really, because from a musical standpoint, Megadeth has usually been superior to Metallica. Sure, I enjoy some Metallica albums more than certain Deth ones, but I find I enjoy Megadeth much more overall. Sorry for the long introduction but seeing as this was the first album, I figured I needed to start out saying a bit more.\n\n\"Killing is My Business...and Business is Good!\" was Megadeth's first album, released in 1985. By this time, Metallica had already released two albums, and Anthrax and Slayer were already making a name for themselves as well for the budding thrash metal scene. Megadeth came out of the gate a bit late but seeing as Mustaine was an original guitarist in Metallica, he already had his foot firmly planted in the thrash scene. This album was created to show Metallica just how good a guitarist Mustaine was because apparently, his former band was claiming he wasn't a good guitar player. Obviously that's a crock of shit accusation because his skills are absolutely highlighted here. It's interesting how a band that was heavily under the influence of drugs could create music as solid and proficient as their first four albums. Although this is probably my least favorite Megadeth album of their original thrash metal era, it was the first, and therefore, it is one of the most important. \n\nThe sound here is extremely raw in comparison to the albums that would follow it. They originally had a budget of 8,000$ to record and produce this album. However, over half of this money went towards drugs, alcohol, and food. Thus, they kind of screwed themselves and had no choice but to fire their original producer. This caused Mustaine and Megadeth to produce the album themselves. The album cover was primitively done and, as I said before, the production suffered a bit. It seems sloppy at times and that's the main reason my score of this album dropped to an 83. Even so, the musicianship and songwriting is great and for its time it was highly impressive. Like I said earlier, I don't see how these guys could have been constantly messed up on drugs and alcohol and still wrote this music. The guitars here are usually faster paced and almost sound more along the lines of speed metal than they do thrash metal. Don't get me wrong, these songs are very thrashy. But the speed metal aspects can't be ignored. \"Last Rights / Loved to Deth\" is the first song on the album and begins with a classical piano and then flies into a furious, fast riff and aggressive drumming. Unfortunately, while the playing is proficient, these 8 songs all seem to blend together a bit too much for their own good. Even the cover of the classic pop hit \"These Boots\", with its perverse lyrical content deviating from the original lyrics, is a fast song with impressive soloing that just sounds like everything else on here. \"Rattlehead\" is a fan favorite and is one of the faster songs on the album. I feel like I'm repeating myself by saying these songs don't do too much to deviate from one another but unfortunately that's just the reality of it. The album closes with the classic \"Mechanix\". You remember \"The Four Horsemen\" from Metallica's \"Kill 'Em All\" released two years before this album? Well, originally, Metallica had a song called \"The Mechanix\" that evolved into \"Horsemen\". They slowed it down a bit, added a mid-section and a melodic guitar solo, and it ended up being a bit over 7 minutes long. Here, this song is closer to the original, but is sped up even more and comes in at over 4 minutes. There is no melodic mid section and honestly I feel \"Horsemen\" is the better of these two. Yeah, yeah sue me. \"Kill 'Em All\" was superior to this album in many ways and I may get shit on for that but it's what I feel. The one thing I can say here, however, is this album is far more energetic than \"Kill\" was, probably due to its break-neck speed.\n\nI've never been a huge fan of Mustaine's vocals. I can take them or leave them. Here, Dave offers, in my opinion, one of his most lackluster performances. He just doesn't sound that good to me. This hurts my score of the album a bit as well but musically, it's proficient enough to keep me engaged, and it has been played fairly often from my collection for years. \n\nThe drums are very tight and well played even thought the production is a bit shoddy. They follow the traditional thrash/speed metal formula and sound better than most of what Lars Ulrich had ever done. I feel there is more variation here in the drums department. It makes up for the overall similarity of the music and doesn't completely stick to the thrashy gallop so many bands overuse. It's mainly just a mixture of such, as well as mid-paced rock drumming and some nice fills. \"Rattlehead\" and \"These Boots\" contain, most likely, the most impressive drum work on the album.\n\nSo here it is, ladies and gentlemen. The first installment of many Megadave albums to come. It's definitely good and was highly important in establishing Megadeth as a relevant band in heavy metal overall as well as awarding them a position as one of the \"Big Four\" alongside Metallica, Slayer, and Anthrax. Dave and co. surely improved on the following album but seeing how this album was produced and how screwed up the band was, this was a good start.\n",
        "\n\"It's not like we're gonna change our next album to try and follow the trend. We don't really change with the times.\"\n-Marty Friedman\n\nMarty, I love you, but you could not be more incorrect. This album may not exactly follow the grunge fad that was on its last legs, but it follows the musical direction of another band. A band that Mustaine is well associated with. After the gargantuan success of The Black Album, it seemed that Megadeth had to sacrifice their thrash metal roots on their next album in order to compete with Metallica. In some ways, it worked. Countdown to Extinction was a huge critical and commercial success. It sold like hot cakes and enjoyed the praise from critics, as well as fans. I myself, very much enjoyed Countdown to Extinction despite its simpler sound. It's not on par with Peace Sells...but Who's Buying? or Rust in Peace, but for what it's worth, it's a fantastic album. Now, the band reaches a dilemma. Should Megadeth switch gears and go back to their thrash metal style resulting in mainstream irrelevance or should they continue down this path to make a profit? Well, Dave and the gang chose the latter and they should've regretted that decision. This album is horrible.\n\nI'm not trying to be some douchebag who goes against the grain of the popular opinion just to seem special. I hate this piece of shit. It takes Countdown to Extinction's worst qualities and turns it to eleven. All of this album's problems can be seen on \"Elysian Fields\". What a shitty track. You're initially intrigued by what sounds like an alien spaceship landing, but then you're hit with Dave's whining vocals. God, Dave, what the hell happened to your voice. Your vocals always sucked, but at least they often fit the music. Here, they just stand out against the music. They're more high-pitched than usual which makes his trademark snarl sound even worse. That's before we even make it to the bridge. Seriously, who thought it was a good idea to let Dave do \"harmonies\" if you can even call them that. They sound like the sound you make right before you sneeze. Oh, and that chorus. Dave just clamps a clothespin on his nose and cries, \"Elysian Fields!\". Speaking of which, what are these \"Elysian Fields\". Well, in Greek mythology, they served as the final resting places of the souls of the heroic and the virtuous. Does this watered-down horseshit sound like it incites that at all? Not even the instrumentation makes up for it. Junior's bass is far less prominent than it was on previous albums. I can barely fucking hear him. Nick's drumming is simplified to a kick-snare approach only to be broken up by a motherfucking cowbell. What is this? An overrated SNL skit? Marty is by far the worst offender given that offers up one of the worst solos in his career. It's just a squealing mess that's as far from shredding as it comes. This song has lackluster instrumentation, horrible vocals, intrusive production quality, poor songwriting, and an overall watered-down sound. You see how that one song perfectly represents this album? I could end this review right here, but there's more.\n\nI can't ignore the elephant in the room for much longer. \"A Tout Le Monde\" is a horrible song. The song itself is not that bad compared to the rest of the album. By that means, it's probably the best track off here right next to \"Addicted to Chaos\". No, but the impact that this song had is what makes it so bad. This song is almost as overplayed as \"Symphony of Destruction\" and I'm tired of it. It's overplay made this touching, tonally inconsistent song reviled by my ears. Not to mention, the United Abominations version is simply awful and doesn't help the original's case very much. It also doesn't help that this song's beginning notes are an instant earworm. It just gets stuck in your head and has you singing along to Mustaine's Butchering of the French language. I hate the lyrics to this song most of all. It has this woe-is-me attitude to them, and maybe it's because I have the emotional complexity of a brick, but I can't sympathize with that at all. Dave, you're not someone that deserves self-pity. It doesn't help that he doesn't even bother to rhyme the lyrics, but if that's your biggest complaint, then I wish I was you.\n\nIn conclusion, I highly do not recommend this album. It's watered-down sound is more present on this record and it's not even catchy. Clearly, Mustaine was more concerned with album sales than their integrity. The instrumentation is incredibly weak and not a hint of virtuosity is present on here. This album is the first sign that Dave Mustaine's vocals are increasingly getting worse for wear and weaker. The lyricism and songwriting takes a nosedive in quality to create some outright stupid lines(Yeah, making an entire song referencing your better work is so clever). As I implied, there are a couple of average songs here, but the damage has already been done. Sadly, this was just the beginning of career slump that the band wouldn't recover from until Endgame. Sigh...kill me.\n\nBonus: The 2004 digital remaster includes four bonus tracks. Three of them we'll be skipping, because they're just demos. The bonus track \"Millennium of the Blind\" sucks. It was originally recorded as a demo back in 1991 which explains why it's heavier than its contemporaries. However, it's rather short and lacks any substance. It features Dave Mustaine directing sort a mass of blind people in the lyrics. The lyrics are quite cheesy and lack any clever ways to insert the theme of the song. It just bangs you over the head with it. It has a somewhat interesting guitar interlude in the middle, but it's pretty insignificant beyond that. Overall, I wouldn't recommend picking up this album up for the bonus track. Then again, even if the track was good, I still wouldn't recommend getting this album in any way.\n",
        "\nNothing about this album sounds serious, almost as if it were meant to be a joke, or a parody. By this point, Mustaine sounds like a full-blown cartoon character with that goofy, nasily bullshit voice he does, especially on the songs \"Sweating Bullets,\" \u201cPsychotron\u201d and \"Captive Honour.\" The riffs have this strange, cheerful circus-y vibe to them, and make the album sound silly and light-hearted, as opposed to menacing or serious, as one should expect with a thrash band of this status, let alone a band fronted by one of the men who pioneered the genre. The whole thing just feels like an episode of Spongebob if he and his nautical friends were to front a Megadeth satire band.\n\nThis is the point at which Megadeth began to spiral into a self-parodied caricature of their former thrash selves. Just listen to how ridiculous, simplified, and novelty \u201cSweating Bullets\u201d is; a song that while happening to be one of the band's most beloved works, is just a unintentionally comedic shell of their former selves. It seems Mustaine and co. have swapped their trademark soaring, technical riffage for gimmicky fluff and fillers, which first shown it's face on the track \u201cDawn Patrol.\u201d Some of the problems that started to surface on otherwise excellent \u201cRust in Peace\u201d not only come full force here, but pretty much define the album \u2013 those awkward low-pitched talking vocals as well as the cringe-inducing, high-pitched squealy ones, the squeaky, overly sterile production, the cartoonish atmosphere and subject matter, as well as the overall lapse of thrash aggression abound. Don't expect anything like the brilliant \u201cMy Last Words\u201d or \u201cPoison was the Cure.\u201d The riffs have been dulled to silly little radio-rock grooves and hooks \u2013 they don't inspire like they used to, they don't work to awe and capture your imagination, they just sit and lazily plod underneath the obnoxious, fucking cheesy as hell vocal work. The riff work overall is incredibly weak and over-simplified, and is possibly inspired by the entire B-side filler-fest that was the second half of \u201cCowboys From Hell.\u201d From this, the songs rely almost entirely on \u201ccatchy\u201d vocals and sing-along choruses to carry the songs.\n\nMost of these songs are mildly catchy in a pop-rock sense, and some even have some elements injected into them that make them somewhat interesting or standout. For one, most of the solos are great, as expected with Marty Friedman. As well, Nick Menza's (R.I.P.) drumming is pretty decent, picking up the pace here and there, and the playing overall is tight and spot on, never sloppy. The best songs by and far are the brooding, environmentally-conscious title track, the crushing \u201cEnter Sandman\u201d retread \u201cSymphony of Destruction,\u201d the token ballad \u201cForeclosure of a Dream,\u201d and heavy-as-balls \u201cArchitecture of Aggression.\u201d\n\nEverything else pretty much sucks as they are stuck in the confines of their forgettableness and pop-rock induced silliness. \u201cAshes in Your Mouth\u201d and \u201cPsychotron\u201d have some catchy grooves and riffs here and there, but are otherwise forgettable, the later having really cringe-y vocals and lyrics about a half human, half cyborg (he says it's not a cyborg, but the lyrics appear to be dealing with a humanoid-robot, which is, indeed, a fucking cyborg, at least partly). \u201cHigh Speed Dirt\u201d recycles some elements from \u201cSkin O'My Teeth\u201d, which itself seems like a slightly catchier rehash of the thrashier \u201cLiar\u201d, released two albums earlier. \u201cHigh Speed Dirt\u201d benefits from some more intricate blues-rock elements and solos thrown in, but this song about sky diving is otherwise a slow, uninteresting snooze-cruise. \u201cCaptive Honour\u201d has a cool, bluesy chorus to it, and some cool riffing, but the opening talking narrative is just so strange and awkwardly embarrassing that it ruins any value the song may have had. The same sentiment can be made for \u201cSweating Bullets,\u201d a song which crystallizes the unintentionally hilarious nature of this album. I remember the first time I heard that track, my friend and I were in tears laughing. \u201cThis Was My Life\u201d sounds like a pop song, and is possibly the most forgettable song on the album, next to \u201cHigh Speed Dirt.\u201d\n\nFolks will attack Metallica's self-titled 'till the end of days, but will inexplicably defend this tooth-and-nail. They will make statements like \u201cwell, at least this album still retains some speed/thrash metal elements,\u201d which is complete bullshit. At least James didn't sound like Freddy Krueger sucking down helium, receiving an enema. This album more or less falls in the same trap as Testament's \u201cPractice What You Preach,\u201d in that the members decide to throw away anything resembling thrash, and inject more \u201cfun\u201d and \u201ccatchy\u201d parts, resulting in a goofy, overly colorful mess. This album is certainly competent and much better than what has followed, and may have some good songs and catchy moments, but it is too hard to take seriously in its tamed, commercial nature. Unfortunately, like many thrash bands in the 90's, Megadeth never really managed to escape the pit of metal inferiority, progressively getting worse and worse each album, only barely scrapping out a decent song or two per album. This album lost to \u201cAchy Breaky Heart\u201d on the commercial music charts when it was released. I'll let that set in.\n",
        "\nLet's do this the other way. The way where we pretend that Megadeth are not a household name, have not gone through an epic career slump, and did not release 'Rust in Peace' or 'Peace Sells' or whatever album their reputation has grown upon. Let's pretend this is just music and we're just listening. Difficult, I know, but someone needs to have a go. (I did totally the opposite with 'Dystopia', so just if you're wondering - personal hypocrisy noted.)\n\nOne thing that I like about this album that might jar with more traditional fans is that the production caters to power and crunch over precision and atmosphere. In many ways, that surely suits the music, since there isn't much in the way of subtlety going on here, the majority of songs blustering ahead with sharp, simple riffs, attitude, and a flurry of lead guitar. And, to be honest, if you're going to stick around here, you're probably going to do it for the latter reason. Megadeth have always been about lead guitar and 'Endgame' is no exception, separating itself from the majority of 2009's thrash/heavy metal albums by having not only an abundance of lead guitar but also a sense of purpose and direction to those leads, rarely slashing across the songs in random fashion. Even on those songs that don't bring riffs to the party ('44 Minutes' is notable in this aspect), Dave Mustaine and Chris Broderick sprinkle plenty of fills, licks, melodies, and fleshed-out solos into the mixture, striking the intended target nine times out of ten and proving that if the riffs are slightly plain, the leads must prove artful and diverting.\n\nThat's something else that must be said: there aren't many great riffs. Verses tend to merely chug or shift about on very standard guitar patterns, while choruses focus more on melody and memorability than any specific musical themes. The songs that make a direct attempt to engage with musicality must surely be 'This Day We Fight!' and 'Head Crusher', both of which pack in more aggression and pace than the other numbers. Then '1320' covers a lot of bases in terms of rhythm guitar, though feels a little half-hearted compared to the two previously mentioned, plus the title track packs in a meaner, slower expos\u00e9 of the band members' skills, changing pace and allowing Shawn Drover to scatter his hands across the drumkit. James LoMenzo's instrument sticks out as a meaty gurgle during several songs, yet doesn't add much when he appears except the virtue of sounding cool. The structure of the songs doesn't usually do much to surprise either, most of them progressing from verse into chorus to bridge without complication, barring a few leads sporadically appearing unannounced.\n\nWhen put together, this means that 'Endgame' comes off as a rather uneven album by any standards. One should always expect a certain rise and fall in quality between songs, which happens here, but the overall choice of style seems unbalanced, with the dynamic production aiding heaviness despite the fact that most songs progress at medium pace and aren't really that heavy to begin with. Then there's the mismatch of the creative leads and the common riffs, plus the notably airy choruses that take the foot off the gas, resulting in half an album for fans of guitar work and the other half for those who like more mainstream rock and metal. The pick up at the end of 'The Right to Go Insane' sounds completely out of place considering how pedestrian that song is before it goes off on its instrumental section, highlighting the lack of cohesion instead of suddenly elevating excitement, as it is clearly meant to. Added to that major grumble, Mustaine doesn't sound like he believes in his lyrics all that much and can't bring much character to songs such as 'Bodies' and 'How the Story Ends', leaving them rather barren and lacking hooks.\n\nRegardless of its complicated place in Megadeth's discography, 'Endgame' has purely musical problems that are best expressed as \"unresolved differences in style\". Despite some strong songs and very good lead work, it remains inconsistent and lacking that magic spark that would turn it into an excellent effort.\n",
        "\nIt has been a long, long, LONG time since I gave anything new by Megadeth any real consideration. The most recent thing I heard from Dave and co. was \u201cThe System Has Failed.\u201d YEAH. It\u2019s only been about 12 years since I gave a shit about anything Megadeth has done. What\u2019d I miss? Oh, was it a whole big pile of nothing? OK, then! I\u2019ve been of the opinion since I heard TSHF that Megadeth was firmly in its Greatest Hits Era, and anything it\u2019ll release from now on would just continue to be the sad wet farts of a once-great band, pathetically trying to reclaim some small part of its glory days as it spirals further into irrelevance.\n\nBut then, a few months ago \u2013 as if from nowhere \u2013 everyone started talking about Megadeth again! Could it be true? Have one of the Big Four finally rearisen? \n\nWell, apparently they totally have.\n\nMy first impression is that \u201cDystopia\u201d sounds like an evolution of the classic \u201880s and early \u201890s Megadeth formula\u2026a bit like a cross between \u201cRust in Peace\u201d and \u201cCountdown to Extinction.\u201d What I mean, is that in terms of sheer aggression and technicality, it feels like the logical successor to RIP, but it has more in the way of CTE\u2019s melody. Like 80% RIP and 20% CTE. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s the exact formula they used, OBVIOUSLY that\u2019s a Dave and co. trade secret. But seriously, this new Megadeth crew knows what it\u2019s doing, because this is probably hands-down the best album this band has put out since its heyday. And to be totally real: \u201cDystopia\u201d shits all over \u201cKilling Is My Business,\u201d and \u201cSo Far, So Good, So What.\"\n\n\u201cDystopia\u201d also has some of the most well-written lyrics I\u2019ve ever heard out of this band. OK, that\u2019s not exactly the highest praise in the world, but they\u2019re actually not that bad. For the most part the lyrics are fairly sophisticated, mature, and intelligent. They\u2019re preachy and obnoxious at times, but hey, we\u2019re talking Megadeth, here. You\u2019re not listening to Megadeth right if you don\u2019t occasionally want to tell Dave to shut the fuck up.\n\nThe only song I\u2019ve got a legitimate problem with the lyrics to is fucking \u201cPost American World.\u201d Over-seasoned with psycho-patriot bullshit and less subtle than a fat, shirtless redneck standing on a monster truck at a Trump rally, a Coors Light in one hand and a loaded shotgun in the other, firing blindly into the sky and shouting something incoherent about immigrants. \u2018Murica. Actually the real hell to \u201cPost American World\u201d is that it\u2019s a pretty good song. So, thanks, Dave, and also fuck you.\n\nProduction is nice and tight, but the music doesn\u2019t feel like it\u2019s been engineered into oblivion. I\u2019m pretty sure humans can make these sounds. The one addendum to that is that they clearly studio-magicked the fuck out of Dave\u2019s voice. No beef with that, really. It\u2019s been consistently weak, so you do what you can.\n\nHighlights: \u201cThe Threat Is Real,\u201d \u201cDystopia,\u201d \u201cFatal Instinct\u201d just for that fuckin\u2019 killer bass riff at 0:56, \u201cPoisonous Shadows,\u201d \u201cLying in State,\u201d and \u201cThe Emperor.\u201d\n\nWho the absolute fuck could have guessed that geriatric old Megadeth could still thrash with the best of them? New school thrashers gotta step their game up after this.\n",
        "\nThis has to be my most played album this year. Apart from anything, it's the only album released in 2016 that I actually own (though I'm looking through my crosshairs at Grand Magus) and, hands down, it's the one that's been in my head the most since I first listened to it. A history of Megadeth is not necessary here, but I would like to delve back as far as 'Th1rt3en' and my review of that album, which was easily summed up in one word: fun. Most Megadeth fans would lay their chips beside 'Endgame' as the best post-'Risk' release, though I guess that was mainly as a result of the album's heaviness and grit, while 'Th1rt3en' was pure entertainment. What makes 'Dystopia' a success is that it has taken a bite of the heavier, more deliberate side of Megadeth, while not ignoring the band's ability to write fun, catchy material.\n\nTherefore, stylistically, this album receives very high praise from me, since it fails to fall into the trap of being technical but soulless, as well as that of being musically redundant. A definite factor in distancing 'Dystopia' from the last few albums is also the line-up changes, which have resulted in a specifically modern sound on some songs. We never slide right into metalcore territory, though there is a rather conspicuous breakdown lurking in 'Poisonous Shadows', while there are plenty of verse riffs that chug meatily with Chris Adler setting the pace. The crunch of the rhythm guitars and the gurgle of the bass will please new listeners and interest old fans (particularly after 'Super Collider'), while the leads still soar over most songs with vicious grace, though some of them just seem to miss that finishing touch that would have made them the highlight of the song, instead of merely a feature.\n\nIn terms of songs, 'Dystopia' also does pretty well. In my memory, there is no Megadeth album that has turned in great songs from start to finish, simply because Dave Mustaine's writing style is uniquely open to risk, so it would be foolish to expect a bursting bag of treats. Almost overwhelmingly, it is the more lyrically involved songs that prosper here, while those with simpler hooks sound more instinctive and are just a touch more effective. 'Post-American World', for example, is dark and brooding with some rather tricky soloing in its latter half, but has nothing that can make it ignite, remaining simply quite good, while the likes of 'Fatal Illusion' and 'Lying in State' opt to rip through a few riffs as Mustaine spews out polluted poetry, gaining much from the energy and enthusiasm. In the past, lyrics such as \"The perfect plan / Must have an alibi / And the perfect pawn / To spew the party line / Of the perfect falsehood / Spoke a thousand times / The perfect words / Cover the greatest crime\" would have been cynical and bitter, though here they turn into a kind of theatre that I'm only too happy to join in with - it's this kind of feature that gives the album great replay value. For pure infectiousness, 'The Emperor', the verses to the title track, and the bonus track 'Look Who's Talking' take the prize, while the storytelling in 'Bullet to the Brain' and 'Fatal Illusion' is a highlight too.\n\nHowever, the first criticism I want to make is also about 'Look Who's Talking'. I just want to know: who the fuck decided to make that a bonus track? I mean, sure, it's not quite as serious or as technical as 'The Threat is Real', but sure as shit it's a better song. Mustaine on a rampage against a big mouth, great solos, and a chorus that you will need therapy to forget. Next, the title track, while excellent for its melodic first half, disintegrates into a poor man's 'Wake Up Dead' in its second, trying too hard to be that song and falling short of the kind of excellent rhythmic ideas that made it so irresistible. Then there's an instrumental and a cover that are both take-it-or-leave-it numbers (not bad, but inessential) and a few parts that just get away from the band, like those unfinished leads on a couple of songs.\n\nSo, Megadeth 2016 is surprisingly good, but predictably imperfect. What we have here is manifestly a good album and a very enjoyable listen with a few minor grumbles that are not too hard to accept. Cutting a perfect line between heavy and catchy, modern and classic, and familiar and novelty, 'Dystopia' deserves most of the praise that has come its way.\n",
        "\nIn my opinion this is the most under rated Megadeth album, and one of their best. It's hard to say which albums make the top three, because in Megadeth's long career they have consistently created some of the finest musical pieces of artwork of any genre; however, this one cannot be denied, and it is certainly an essential part of the band's golden years of thrash. Sometimes regarded as a rushed and immature follow up to Peace Sells, it was actually a testament to the strength of Dave & Dave as a writing and performance team at the time, and a sign of their ability to keep up with any other band out there by standing on their own two feet.\n\n\u202aSo Far So Good So What is easily overlooked for a few reasons, and I believe one of them is due to the fact that this album had the line up that I consider the 'here today gone tomorrow' line up. You know those two guys who you might not recognize, care about, or even consider in the same league as the other outstanding musicians who have played with Dave & Dave. Of course I am talking about Jeff Young and Chuck Behler. Both were picked up amidst the hassle of firing Chris Poland and the late Gar Samuelson, two admired legends who will go down in history thanks to \u202atheir contributions to Peace Sells, But Whose Buying as guitarist and drummer respectively. It's hard to recapture the energy from such a seminal album, and both Young and Behler were really pressured to do so when they jumped into the new roles. Unfortunately due to a combination of reasons, Young and Behler were gone immediately after the So Far So Good So What tour ended. Their faces and part in the band may best be remembered for being in the documentary \u202aDecline Of Western Civilization II, otherwise unless you're a close fan of the band you may not even notice who they are or what part they played in Megadeth for a year. Let us also not forget that the talents of Behler and Young hit a pretty high standard. Of course they weren't able to really leave any creative footprints on the band due to the fact that they were picked up in the middle of the album's recording period, and they were gone before another album went in the works, but they kept up and performed strongly on each track. \n\nNow as for the album itself, in my opinion it's a masterpiece that really could not have been a better follow up to Peace Sells, especially given the conditions that the band were working with. A lot of reviews done at the time of this album's release hailed it as a transformational epitome of thrash metal, and \u202ahailed it as the beginning of Mustaine's longevity as an artist. The album also had the commercial success to back up those words, with hundreds of thousands of units being sold in its first month alone, and it would go on to be a platinum record for the band. I think the critical praise it had in 1988 still holds true today, although many industry experts call this one a juvenile album in retrospective. I think calling it juvenile is a half truth, or maybe a quarter truth, because there are certainly some words I have about the \"Anarchy In The U.K\" cover, but that track was really an example of the times. Few thrash metal bands were not pressured to put a recognized rock track into the mix when they were releasing new albums, and almost all of those covers were embarrassing. \n\n\"Mary Jane\" is still a fan favorite after 27 years, and \"In My Darkest Hour\" is one of the greatest heavy metal songs ever written. From front to back So Far So Good So What is an adrenaline fueled frenzy of speed and aggression coming from one of the darkest if not the darkest period of this band's history. The drugs were everywhere, and probably at no point was the thrash metal scene as competitive as it was between '87 and '89. Dave knew that he had to make an album that would stand out. There was no time to relax and just take it in after the success of Peace Sells. If he released anything short of the most killer album out there, Megadeth would have taken a backseat to bands like Exodus, Slayer, Overkill, Testament, Kreator, Sodom, Anthrax, and of course that other band... Metallica. If So Far So Good wasn't a genuine M60 hail of bullets out of the gates, then Megadeth may have become one of the countless other cult bands that released one or two great albums and then disappeared. I do think that pressure played a part in the band's creative process and the rush it took to hurry this album out of the recording studio, but to Megadeth's strength, they had two of the greatest musicians in the industry and a very strong creative team behind the warhorse. Ellefson and Mustaine could come up with a magnum opus on demand, and they did. No one, and I mean no one in the business have the collaborative gift that they shared and still share today. Again, I think there are some truths to the criticism that is attached to this album, but to focus on them is like complaining about a girlfriend who loses her keys a lot but is otherwise a perfect match and usually a killer lay.\n\nIf this album had a vagina, I would fuck it every day of my life for a lifetime. On the other hand if the riffs on this album were a sexual activity, I would be able to stay alone forever. \"502,\" \"Hook In Mouth,\" \"Liar,\" \"Set The World Afire,\" and of course you could not forget the fan favorite instrumental \"Into The Lungs Of Hell,\" all set a higher precedent for what was expected in Megadeth's territory of raw thrash metal. Was Megadeth ever stronger than this? Again, it's hard to say, because Megadeth has constantly shown to be a band that succeeds with multiple transitions, but I don't think that Megadeth could have been any stronger for where their focus was at that point as a purely fucked up thrash metal band. Each track drips with nasty grooves and contempt, and lyrically either A) cuts right to the chase of a self-destructive world in an intellectual way that provides examples of where we're heading as society, or B) inspires a self awareness of individual destructive behaviors that were all but universal in the extreme metal scene at the time ex: \"502,\" a song about drunk driving, and \"Mary Jane,\" a track that clearly suggests an individual who has fried their brain in an attempt to escape from reality by means of drugs. \n\nThe depth of this band's catalog is unlike anything else out there, and dismissing So Far So Good So What's place in that catalog is simply repulsive. In contradiction to the claims that this was an immature follow up to Peace Sells, So Far So Good has a lot of lyrically matured themes that hadn't fully evolved into the fold yet on their second album. The scathing social criticisms of \"Hook In Mouth\" and apocalyptic revelations so abundantly clear on \"Set The World Afire\" would go on to be enduring assets to the band's career with each album that followed after. They're a huge step forward from the title track of Peace Sells. I couldn't say that the album is as influential as Peace Sells or Rust In Peace, but I think that it is just as important. In fact So Far So Good So What may have been the most critical album in Megadeth's career. They came out of a really dark shadow that hung over them in an uncertain drug fueled period that usually destroys a band, and followed up the thrash metal masterpieces of '86 with one of the best thrash metal albums ever recorded.\n\nNow without further adieu, I leave you with one of my favorite lines in metal;\n\n\"No survivors, set the world afire!\"\n",
        "\nMuch has already been made of Megadeth's fifteenth studio album, including the parallels that it has to past achievements like the classic Rust In Peace and the surprisingly satisfying Endgame. Like those two efforts, the recruitment of a new lead guitarist and drummer (Angra's Kiko Loureiro and Lamb of God's Chris Adler, respectively) reignites the energy that had been fading from the lineup before it and results in renewed senses of aggression and technicality. Dystopia may be a retread of an established pattern but it does develop a few tropes that had merely been hinted at through Megadeth's long career.\n\nSeeing how Thirteen and Super Collider got their share of flak for moving away from the standard Megadeth sound, it is interesting to note that Dystopia may be the style dialed down even better than Endgame ever did. Not only are the songs more energetic and Dave Mustaine's vocals tougher, but the songwriting makes use of the structural complexity to extents that haven't been seen in some time. This is most evident in the opening songs as the ultra melodic title track crosses the drive of \"Hangar 18\" with the closing stomp on \"Wake Up Dead\" and \"Fatal Illusion\" dances about numerous tempo changes in a way that recalls \"Bad Omen.\" \n\nBut what really makes Dystopia stand out is the heightened sense of drama compared to their other recent efforts. Megadeth has always flirted with backing vocals and classical instrumentation but it's never taken on such a cinematic quality. From the Middle Eastern vocals that open \"The Threat Is Real\" to the climactic vocal lines on \"Death From Within\" and building swells on \"Conquer Or Die,\" Dystopia showcases theatrics that haven't gotten their chance to shine in quite some time. Props must be given to Loureiro for working in his power metal influences in a way that Marty Friedman or Chris Broderick never pulled off.\n\nOf course, the album still has its share of imperfections. The heightened technical prowess and polished production job do highlight Dave Mustaine's diminishing vocal performance and less commanding energy. In addition, the attempts at rock & roll attitude on \"The Emperor\" and take on Fear's \"Foreign Policy\" end up sounding out of place and close the album on a rather underwhelming note.\n\nWhile Dystopia isn't a perfect album and I may actually prefer Endgame by a hair, it is interesting to see Megadeth once again assume the role of the strongest band left of the original 80s thrash scene. The songs find ways to be memorable and the overall presentation elevates them to a greater level of grandiosity. Considering the trajectories that occurred in the wake of the band's past successes, it'll be interesting and potentially horrifying to see how things evolve from here...\n\nHighlights:\n\"The Threat Is Real\"\n\"Dystopia\"\n\"Death From Within\"\n\"Poisonous Shadows\"\n\"Conquer or Die\"\n",
        "\nAs I have explained in my reviews of Endgame and Dystopia, Megadeth is a bit of a \u201croller coaster\u201d band. The band kicked off their career with a series of six albums during the 80\u2019s and early 90\u2019s that ranged from very good to amazing. The mid 90\u2019s to early 2000\u2019s saw a dip in quality and creativity, before roaring back strong in the mid to late 2000\u2019s, then taking yet another dip in the two albums prior to the massive comeback of Dystopia. The System Has Failed was largely a step in the right direction after the disappointing late 90\u2019s-early 2000\u2019s albums, but 2004\u2019s United Abominations is the album that truly got Dave Mustaine and the gang back on track.\n\nThe sound on United Abominations is very polished, so even the faster songs don\u2019t sound all that \u201cthrashy\u201d. That doesn\u2019t hurt the album in any way, though, as the melodies are infectious and sound is still rather heavy. If anything, United Abominations is more of a 21st century answer to Countdown to Extinction. There are still some faster, more aggressive songs such as album opener Sleepwalker (which takes a fast riffing mid-paced melody approach), You\u2019re Dead, and Burnt Ice. The fast-paced Washington is Next! (arguably the best song on the album) and the slower-paced title track are the songs that will really stick out and the listener will most likely find themselves singing the choruses days after hearing them. Gears of War and Blessed are the Dead are strong mid-pace powerhouses, although both seem to stop short of a third verse and chorus in favor of a solo section. However, this serves to show off the impressive chemistry between Dave Mustaine and Glenn Drover, a strong guitar duo in their own right before the arrival of Chris Broderick. This album also has some of Dave\u2019s finest lyrics, largely politically-charged yet still sarcastic and humorous at times (Amerikhastan being a prime example). Dave\u2019s songwriting has always been at its best when he sings about something he\u2019s passionate about, and we all know how passionate he is about politics, war, corruption, etc.\n\nWhile Play for Blood is rather unremarkable, the remake of A Tout le Monde is the only song that really did not need to be on this album. If anything, THIS should have been the bonus track rather than Black Swan (although that song would become one of the highlights of the eventual Th1rt3en album). Cristina Scabbia is a fine singer, but she does not add anything truly meaningful to this version and applying a more polished production value to a song that sounded good on the slightly more gritty Youthanasia further takes away from it. Stick with the Youthanasia version.\n\nWhile the middle is a bit hit-or-miss, a strong opening and a solid finish make United Abominations not only one of Megadeth\u2019s most underrated albums, but also one of their best. Fans of Countdown to Extinction and Youthanasia will find plenty to love, and even the more diehard thrash fans will enjoy Burnt Ice, You\u2019re Dead, and Sleepwalker. The band would continue this momentum with the excellent and slightly more thrash-oriented Endgame two years later. Still, United Abominations is the album Megadeth needed to prove they were still among the kings of heavy metal.\n",
        "\n\u201cKilling is My Business\u201d was fueled as much by all the drugs the band could get their hands on as it was Dave Mustaine\u2019s bottomless reservoir of rage because he got kicked out of Metallica. Given those two things, it\u2019s kind of a surprise that this is one of my favorite Megadeth albums.\n\nAll the money that should have gone toward producing this album probably ended up as a LOT of puddles of vomit. So we\u2019re kind of off to a rocky start. This album sounds like it was recorded in a shed. With one microphone. That was 50 feet away from the shed. That was on the original recording, though. The 2001 re-release fixed most of those original sound problems, but it really doesn\u2019t make \u201cKIMB\u201d sound better, just a lot less shitty\u2026kind of like it was recorded with second-hand gear in a garage. \n\nI\u2019m generally cool with music that has more organic-sounding production, but there\u2019s a tiny little asterisk next to that preference: it kind of only works when the music lets it. Less technical styles of music (punk, black metal, etc.) benefit from it because of the raw energy and lack of precision those kinds of music have. \u201cKIMB\u201d is just too technical to be charming with below-average production values. So the overall sound tends to suffer on \u201cKIMB\u201d because Dave and co. snorted up all their production money. At least the music is still solid, right?\n\nLike, half right. There are mostly legitimately great songs here. The title track, \u201cLoved to Death,\u201d \u201cThe Skull Beneath the Skin,\u201d \u201cRattlehead\u201d and \u201cLooking Down the Cross\u201d are all amazing and classics of the genre. \u201cMechanix\u201d is just a faster \u201cThe Four Horsemen,\u201d and no, I\u2019m not really impressed by that. The reason the song is even on here is about as subtle as the lyrics (did you know they\u2019re about sex?): \u201cRawr, Metallica made Dave\u2019s FEELINGS hurt!\u201d Metallica did it better.\n\nI don\u2019t know what the fuck \u201cThese Boots\u201d is doing here. Yeah, Dave changed some lyrics, but it just sounds like a pissy little breakup letter. And on the re-release, every lyric that was changed is literally bleeped out. The music is still generally OK, but it's so hard to get past that \"BEEEEEEEEP\" every other lyric. So\u2026yeah. Pretty skippable. \n\nMegadeth never were wordsmiths, and their earlier stuff is\u2026God damn it, it\u2019s really bad sometimes. \u201cKIMB\u201d has songs about the Punisher from Marvel Comics (\u201cKilling is my Business\u201d), and that stupid killer bunny from Monty Python and the Holy Grail (\u201cThe Chosen Ones\u201d). Two things: \n\n1) If you\u2019re going to write songs about that kind of stuff, you better make sure people know you have a sense of humor. Real quick, imagine Dave Mustaine telling a joke. HAHAHAHA. You can\u2019t because he\u2019s an angry, humorless man, and Megadeth is not a jokey band to begin with. There\u2019s literally nothing about either of those songs that indicates they\u2019re supposed to be tongue-in-cheek\u2026and speaking of which: \n\n2) Writing metal songs about comic book characters and killer bunnies without some kind of humor or self-awareness is basically the dweebiest thing you can fucking do. Metal, Monty Python, and comic books are all kind of dweeby to begin with (sorry about your rage, but this isn\u2019t exactly a truth bomb I\u2019m dropping here), but when you combine them the way it\u2019s done here\u2026I swear to God, you can almost smell the Doritos and Mountain Dew. Hey, does anyone know if a song can grow a neckbeard and live in its parent\u2019s basement?\n\nDespite the production and stupid-ass lyrics, the music, as I\u2019ve said, is very well done. The thing that I think impresses me the most about \u201cKIMB\u201d is its level of musical maturity compared to Megadeth\u2019s later releases. This is by far the most mature-sounding debut album of any of the Big Four. Megadeth had a lot less far to travel, musically, than a lot of other early thrash bands (*cough* Anthrax *cough*) between its debut and sophomore albums, and I have nothing but respect for that. \n\n\u201cKilling is my Business\u201d is a good record, but it gives up some seriously easy points.\n",
        "\n2016 was not off to a good start for us headbangers with Lemmy Kilmister's passing, but I am happy and proud to say that this latest Megadeth statement helped jerk me out of my mourning phase. \n\nMore than thirty years into their career, Megadeth has managed to craft one of their stronger all-time records. As the excellent cyborg-apocalypse album art shows, the band has its finger on the fear and anger over the state of our world in 2016, with strong, tight, relevant music to match. \n\nThe first three songs are the ones that have gotten the most attention thus far, and it's easy to see why as it shows right away that the new lineup (Mr. Kiko Loureiro on lead guitar and Mr. Chris Adler on drums) gels excellently with the Megadeth experience. The requirements for this are well-known by this point: be able to have a quality guitar duel with Mustaine, and master the energetic riff-and-rhythm shifts that make the band's finest moments so essential.\n\n\"The Threat Is Real\" has a wondrous Middle Eastern-flavored guitar intro and a high-powered, ending drum break. The title track is the Kiko Loureiro show, with his computer-like tapping standing toe-to-toe with Mustaine's shredding. Even Dave \"Junior\" Ellefson gets in on the party with his bass solo spot in \"Fatal Illusion.\" Make no mistake, the new lineup is here to shred. Taken together, this trio of heavy hitters is one of the overall \"best starts\" to a Megadeth album.\n\nMustaine's vocals are deeper, more intense, and meaner--no doubt he is pissed off. Occasionally with the harmonization, his vocals sound cyborg-like, as though he is snarling through Vic Rattlehead's new helmet. His lyrics shrink not from political topics--his frightful, dystopian vision of the future illustrated in \"Post American World\" features one of the best guitar duels on the record, and a splashy, energetic drum performance to back up the simpler riffing.\n\n\"There's creeping hate if you resist the false narrative/Crushing all the dissenters who still think for themselves,\" he preaches.\n\nHe continues the verbal assault on those in power with \"Lying In State\" and \"The Emperor,\" reminding us of the classic tale of the emperor having no clothes, and wondering how future, undoubtedly more-enlightened generations will portray us. No matter who is in charge, Mustaine can always be counted on to call them out somehow. But even these songs are not mere vehicles for a political scree: \"Lying In State\" features a killer riff outro, and \"The Emperor\" wails along with catchy string bends reminiscent of an air-raid siren...\n\nRemain calm, citizen. There is nothing to see here...\n\nThe band is once again all about the thrash for the most part. Exceptions are parts of \"Post American World,\" which has a quasi-ballad pace for half of the song, touched up with piano and strings, and the flamenco-tap intro on \"Conquer or Die!\" The latter instrumental quickly winds itself up into yet another thrilling guitar battle. And as a finale, Dave reaches all the way back to his hardcore-punk roots for a cover of Fear's \"Foreign Policy,\" a forceful, intense quickie that is my \"other\" favorite track on Dystopia.\n\nThe dark-comic backstory of Dystopia (including the origins of the cover art) also gets filled in from the music videos filmed for the album and shown on tour, so be sure to catch it if you want the full-body immersion! No matter what devastating losses may come to its musicians and fans, these will not stop metal's boldest from soldiering ever onward. My hat is absolutely off to MegaDave and this fantastic new lineup for reminding me of this truth. Dystopia is the first metal masterpiece of 2016.\n\nOriginally written for www.headofmetal.com\n",
        "\nIt seems like ever since the early 1990s came to a close, Megadeth has been a good band and they've been making good albums (with some bad ones as well), but they just haven't done anything that can be considered great. Some albums were pretty good, but just not great. They have tried to return to form from time to time again, but it just hasn't worked out for them. The radio material was the least successful material of it all, but the non-commercial material got a much warmer reception. But many (myself included) have had a much warmer reception to the classics. It was very obvious that what the band desperately needed was a return to their thrash roots. They have done that before, but they just didn't make it quite the same. What the band really needed was to do an album that contained thrash metal done right... and following over two decades, they have finally crafted that very album.\n\nThis album is a MASSIVE comeback. It was made during the time when everybody was beginning to doubt that the band was still capable of what they were, during their classic days. This was the band's medicine for it. For the majority of people, myself included, it was effective. This album is the result of the decision made by Dave Mustaine to never write another radio song ever again. When you listen to this album, you know that what he decided on was for the better. The music here is bold, stripped down and heavy. It doesn't have any sappy moments whatsoever and it does all that it needs to do to please fans of old school thrash metal. It doesn't try to be overly dark and/or atmospheric. what it does try to do is just be one of the most awesome, gritty and as in-your-face albums as possible. In many ways, it succeeds. Sure, it has its flaws, but it is the positive material that outweighs the negative.\n\nThe title track is quite a highlight for me. It has a simple, yet astoundingly effective main riff and some very effective drum-rhythms as well. Good lyricism and a satisfyingly tight songwriting structure come together to make a very amusing track. Another song with a simple, but tightly effective main guitar riff is \"The Emperor\". Lyrical metaphor galore on this track makes it all the more charismatic. That's pretty much a prominent thing that can be found on this album... stripped down music with big lyrics. That's what Megadeth is known for. It's something for everyone to enjoy. Another track with a great riff is the Spotify bonus track, \"Melt the Ice Away\". It has a very 1980s speed metal feel and it doesn't let you relax for a moment anywhere, which is just what is required of a song like this. The riff is catchy and actually is one of the most (if not the most) complex ones on the album. It sounds a bit similar to the material that you would find on Helloween's \"My God-Given Right\", which was released during the previous year, 2015. The ballad, ''Poisonous Shadows'' doesn't really focus all that hard on having a good riff, but having a melody line that everything else just soars over. It excels masterfully and proves that the absence of all of that quite well-known big bad riffing does not make their music not turn out to be good (although the riffs are one of the best things about their music) and it can actually be quite decent.\n\nSome of the material that I never really was able to enjoy as much was the album's opener, \"The Threat is Real\", which seems to have the usual ingredients, but it just doesn't execute them as nicely. It seems unoriginal, bland and kinda boring to be, but it has a few cool bits and pieces here and there. \"Fatal Illusion\" has some good riffs, but everything else just seemed to be filler. They didn't seem to focus on what everything else had and just put all of their thought into the rhythm-guitar work. Even the solo here seems a little lackluster. Solos are one of the best things that come up in a Megadeth song. This just doesn't make sense.\n\nOne thing that is often addressed about this album is the lyricism. People are saying that there is nothing new here and Dave Mustaine seems as if he just has the same pessimistic social views as he did thirty years ago. Sure, the lyrics are nothing new, but they are just as powerful as the ones thirty years ago. They address popular social issues and they always seem to make a good point. Sometimes, they are not even put within the minds of many listeners and non-listeners alike. For example, \"Post-American World\" does a great job of giving off the idea of the so possibly dystopic world after the fall of America, if it ever happens. Sure, it doesn't always do this, but for the most part, it seems to be a group of rather insightful lyricism.\n\nThis album is a return to form and it was just what the band needed. It's the album that we have all been waiting for and despite its flaws, it does not prevent itself from being great, almost exceptional. Hopefully, there will be more thrash releases such as this from the band, as well as more of them overall. There haven't really been enough of them lately. Metallica has an album that seems promising. Maybe it is a build on the return to the ever so bountiful form that was \"Death Magnetic\", but as of the first month of the year, this is the best comeback of the year and best thrash release to be put out in a rather decent amount of time. This is a pretty good accomplishment for a band that's been around for the amount of time that Megadeth has.\n",
        "\nSo Dave Mustaine is back with his newest incarnation of Megadeth. After the last two albums did not sit well with most fans of this classic band, one was forced to begin thinking that Dave was done. Topped with half of the band calling it quits I was left to wonder where would Dave go from there. Once it was announced that highly skilled axeman Kiko Loureiro (Angra) was joining the band on the new album there seemed to be some hope but even then I realized that, even with the inclusion of such a talent, at the end of the day it would be the songs that matter. So when their fifteenth full length, Dystopia, dropped, I was pleasantly surprised with the finished product.\n\nI think the one thing working in Dave's favor here is his decision to allow Kiko and guest drummer, Chris Adler (Lamb of God), to have some creative input into the album. It's apparent because this is a well thought out album with some great moments, even some moments that are not typical of Megadeth's sound but are still great metal nonetheless. The opener, \"The Threat is Real,\" comes out of the gate with a cool Eastern feel before it kicks your ass. The solos are incredible as one would expect from the talent on display here. Then the title track kicks in sounding very melodic with some cool lead riffing. This is not a real heavy thrash song. Instead you have a well constructed heavy metal song that has a lot of power metal elements in it. Kiko's solos are fucking incredible and some of them actually remind me of Marty Friedman. So this is where I begin to think that this is going to be a winner.\n\nOf course you have songs like \"Fatal Illusion\" that has Mustaine's signature all over it. A fast thrasher with some killer guitar battles going on. I'm not a big fan of Lamb of God or that metalcore style but Chris Adler proves here that he is a pretty impressive drummer, especially on this song. \"Bullet to the Brain\" and \"Post American World\" are interesting songs that have some cool grooves to them. Dave's singing in a lower register and almost sounds like Chuck Billy in places on the former and the latter is pretty much one of Dave's pedestals to which to let us all know his political views but in a rather catchy song. It's by this time that you'll discover that the inclusion of Kiko Loureiro into this band was a brilliant idea. I can't mention his solos enough as he just shreds through every song.\n\nThe true star of this album is \"Poisonous Shadows.\" This is a complex song with many layers and this is the song that sounds like a true group effort. After a nice clean intro the song get's that Eastern feel to it with the opening lead being so melodic and clean. Then comes the thunder with Chris Adler showing his meticulous timekeeping mixed with some serious skills. The song's darker feel is done with class and skill with the chorus adding to the epic feel of this song with it's eerie melody. This is possibly the best song that Megadeth has done in a very long time.\n\nThis album does have a few flaws which, fortunately, do not take too much away from the great moments on this album. \"The Emperor\" is not that great of a song and could have been left off the album. I have the Limited Edition with the two bonus tracks and you're not missing much here either. \"Last Dying Wish\" is the better of the two because between the silliness in which he presented the lyrics there's a pretty good tune here. The message is that he did listen to the fans and he's right, this was his last chance for me because one more turd and I would have given up on this band for good. \"Look Who's Talking\" is one of those songs that gives the Dave haters ammunition. As mature as this album is, this song is an immature attempt for Dave to keep his bad ass image intact, I guess. I'm not sure but whatever the case, I have little use for \"I'll kick your ass\" songs.\n\nSo at the end of the day, it seems Dave has redeemed himself with me, for now. He does seem to have a history putting out a monster album only follow it up with a turd so we'll see what the future has in store. All I know is that this is a really good effort by a classic band and one that caught me by surprise. I was not expecting to like this but I'm glad I was caught off guard. Now let's see how he follows this up.\n\n\nThe Elitist Metalhead\n",
        "\nDystopian fiction has been a very appropriate template for many great metal albums, owing mostly to the aggressive tendencies of said musical style matching up perfectly with the feelings of revulsion that the reader experiences while reading such works. But the adoption of the generic title of said genre as an album title can be a bit cryptic, as the term could potentially denote a possible future or even a critique of the present in a more direct way than the metaphorical medium of fiction. A few years back Jon Schaffer took on the title for an album that largely depicted a number of famous works of fiction, though one could infer that he did so due to his recently discovered social consciousness and political activism in anti-establishment circles, culminating a separate side project dubbed Sons Of Liberty. Dave Mustaine, also no stranger to mixing politics with metal, has opted for an even less subtle approach and simply blurts out \"Hey, the world is screwed up, and I'm going to beat you over the head with the reasons why until you acknowledge it!\" on Megadeth's latest offering Dystopia.\n\nBut the overlapping worlds of politics and fiction aside, Mustaine has managed to do the virtually impossible yet again, namely rebuild the Megadeth lineup and hit thrash metal pay dirt yet again. While technically speaking the inclusion of Lamb Of God's Chris Adler is not in a full member capacity, his presence along with 6-string shredding genius Kiko Loureiro of Angra fame are an all out boon to Megadeth's sound, bringing a sense of virtuosity not seen since Rust In Peace and a sense of modern aggression not seen at any point in their history into the equation. The musical consequence is an album that, while borrowing heavily from Megadeth's past stylistic template circa 1988-1992, comes off as completely brand new, fresh, and in a class all its own. It embodies all the neck-wrenching percussive thunder and riff-based heaviness that one expects from a pure thrash assault, but tempered into a multifaceted whole where atmospherics, melody and shifts in feel trade blows with the otherwise largely up tempo assault.\n\nIn contrast to Megadeth's last exemplary offering Endgame, this album comes closer to matching the compact yet elaborate and hard-hitting character of the old days, often echoing some of the old classics through a darker medium. Perhaps the most overt examples of this trend towards revisiting the past with an eye to the future is the title song \"Dystopia\", which sounds pretty close to an unofficial third installment of \"Hanger 18\" with Kiko perfectly impersonating the blinding stream of notes approach of Marty Friedman, and \"Post American World\" which has a fairly similar character to that of \"Symphony Of Destruction\" mixed with a bit of \"Trust\" at times, though at times faster and more agitated sounding. In fact, the overall trading of leads throughout this album between Dave and Kiko is probably the most successful recreation of the old Dave and Marty trade-offs that occurred during Megadeth's early 90s era. \n\nThen again, at other times the band finds themselves in brand new territory due to the involvement of either Kiko or Adler. While this album's second promotional single \"The Threat Is Real\" has all the trappings of another guitar oriented thrasher from the Rust In Peace playbook, the ambient intro with the Middle-Eastern vocal tune is a new one on this band and gives the album a far more ominous air from its very beginning. This is echoed in introductory material intermittently placed throughout the album, be it a creepy acoustic intro that kicks off the down tempo yet meaty \"Poisonous Shadows\" (Alder's drum work gives this one a bit more bite than a typical down-tempo Megadeth offering), another acoustic intro with a military snare line kicking off the chunky groove number \"Bullet To The Brain\", or the flowing stream of classical guitar brilliance to make Andres Segovia proud the leads off the instrumental \"Conquer Or Die\", followed by even more virtuoso brilliance out of Kiko, who seems hellbent on upstaging every single one of his predecessors.\n\nAll of the praise being heaped on this album is rightfully deserved, regardless of whether the lyrical content contained within is nothing new to anyone who listens to more than three metal bands and Dave possessing about half of the vocal range he had back in the 80s. This is an album that is built off of punchy riff work, spellbinding guitar soloing and a thunderous rhythmic section, and it does not suffer an iota from Mustaine's voice being a bit haggard and rough around the edges or from his tendency to play the narrator as much as the singer, which is mercifully less often than some previous efforts. Some songs hit a little harder than others, but this is a consistent thrill ride from start to finish that surpasses recent and respectable efforts such as United Abominations and Endgame and blows everything else this band has done since Youthanasia completely out of the water. Though they're getting some decent competition from the guys in Anthrax of late, with this album Megadeth has yet again reasserted themselves as the current leaders of the so-called Big Four, and it's a foregone conclusion that if Metallica manages to get an album out this year that it won't come close to touching this.\n",
        "\nJust when I thought it was safe to effectively write off Megadeth as officially out of ideas (or at least good ideas), I am treated to this collective of powerful, thrash metal perfection called Dystopia. As a friend of mine remarked on social media, I'm not sure what fire was lit under Dave Mustaine's ass, but we like it!\n\nWhat we have here is a seemingly reinvigorated quartet that just kicked off my year nicely, considering last year's musical output was, for me, lackluster for the most part. When I say this is the best Megadeth album in the last 20-years, I say that with no trepidation whatsoever (and I actually rather enjoyed a large portion of Endgame). The addition of Kiki Loureiro from Angra has proven to be one hell of an acquisition; I'm not sure if the new blood was what kicked this album into gear, but this lineup is probably the best Megadeth line-up in as many years. I'm ecstatic to see the band back to the familiar form of a hungry, heavy metal machine. \n\nThe album kicks off with \"The Threat is Real\", a slow build-up emerging into my ears, followed by a tremendously speedy riff galloping perfectly into my sensory chamber. Dave's vocals are a bit gruffer with age but a solid fit due in large part to his not attempting to push boundaries where none are to be pushed. What I find most engaging are the guitars - fast and furious, yet stylish with some great hooks - and I'm even more enthralled to find that this isn't a one or two-off occurence; the album is rife with such moments of musical lucidity. We seem to get a taste of every single era of Megadeth wrapped up in Dystopia, though the Youthanasia to Countdown to Extinction era is quite prevalent throughout. I feel like a 19-year old kid again that's overly excited by a Megadeth release, and there's nary a weak or contrived moment herein.\n\nAside from a stellar production and revitalized musicianship, the added flavor of this album is the lyrical content, where Mustaine doesn't deviate far from any suggested blueprint. Social segregation, dangerous and forbidden liaisons, a degenerative society crumbling under the weight of political correctness (without overt preaching) are all covered with a swift, yet finely-crafted energy that never falls into trite predictability. The title track is destined to become an instant Megadeth classic, while \"Post America World\" is a somber warning on the current state of the world and just what lies ahead. This type of cryptic musing is Dave Mustaine's strong point and always has been, and it hasn't been nearly up to snuff in recent years, starkly evident by Super Collider and its infantile musings that are almost cringe-worthy. From \"The Conjuring\" through \"Holy Wars...the Punishment Due\" up through \"Lying in State\" and \"Bullet to the Brain\", there is always a distinct shadow over Mustaine's writing that pulls no punches and awakens the stagnant mind's eye to both the hidden and plain-view horrors of modern civilization. After hearing this album for the third time I keep reminding myself that Megadeth, while largely hit-or-miss in recent years, is back with a rancorous vengeance, my friends. One word I keep seeing when Dystopia is mentioned is \"rejuvenated\", and it seems to be the mass consensus. It's about time!\n\nWhat has happened to Megadeth over the last few albums is a familiar sandtrap that too many bands fall into where an album has anywhere from one to three charging songs that resonate (if only momentarily), then falls apart in spotted, uninspired disarray. Metallica hasn't been able to crawl out of this particular hole since 1991, and many \"classic\" bands are also unwitting victims to this particularly unsilent killer. I can't state any more emphatically how good this Megadeth album is from start to finish. I've seen some random comments on social media about how many people gave up on Megadeth but decided to give this current album a go-round after I praised it for being a return to form. I guess when you're known to be particularly hard to please in my middle-aged old fart state, some folks take it to heart when I actually hail something on such high. So far I've only read one unimpressed comment amid a sea of surprised and excited sentences, and that makes me feel damn good. Megadeth is a large part of my life and many people's lives, good, bad and ugly, and to see them return to a nearly-forgotten form is both illuminating and thrilling.\n\nOne of the 11 standouts on the album is the instrumental \"Conquer or Die\", a groovy little three-minute-plus venture that transitions from subtle acoustic harmony smack dab into a crunching scale-driven opus of sheer orgasmic polish. The Fear cover of \"Foreign Policy\" is brilliant, showcasing Dave Mustaine's longtime love and admiration for the punk era. There is a tight-knit uniform surrounding the Daves, Kiko ands Chris Adler from Lamb of God who is handling the drumming on the record, and I sincerely hope that the core of this line-up stays around for a while. I believe there was a Megadeth album that stated that \"...the world needs a hero\", and this piece is a definitive hero all over. For me, I think this album might be a top five contender at year's end, and I've a distinct feeling I won't be alone in that assertion.\n\nWelcome back, Megadeth...we've missed you! \n\n(Originally written for www.metalpsalter.com)\n",
        "\nMegadeth's 'Dystopia' is an interesting one. Here, front-man Dave Mustaine writes directly from the heart. His lyrics have always been about war, death, terror and New World Order type of things, but never has it been as extremely... well, obvious as on 'Dystopia'. Needless to say, for a post-apocalyptic world, where everything has gone wrong for humanity - America in particular - his paranoia-inducing lyrics fit the bill, I assume. What about the music?\n\nWell, looking at the album cover could give the about-to-listener an idea of what the sound is like. It looks mechanical / robotic, and unfortunately that's the downside of 'Dystopia'.\n\nThere absolutely are some pretty catchy riffs here and there. Album opener \"The Threat Is Real\" has a pretty old-school thrash metal vibe to it with excellent lead-and-solo guitars. The title-track \"Dystopia\", is actually really good. It's a melodic piece that sounds like a song that could be on Rust In Peace. Shortly after, though, the problem with 'Dystopia' becomes evident. While the leads and solos continue to be good, the riffing can become a bit stale. There's too much robotic chugging.\n\nAlso, Mustaine's vocals; while never good, are fucked. He sounds like a caricature of himself on this album; and the combination of this and the mechanical guitars can soon become overwhelming. The blame for the headache-inducing sound lies with somewhere with the production work. The music itself isn't at all that bad, but the vocals and guitars are SO thick and high in the mix that it drowns out any other elements of the album (with the exception of the cleverly-utilized keys on \"Poisonous Shadows\").\n\nWith 'Dystopia', Megadeth have crafted an album that quite comfortably stands as their strongest in two decades. Fans of the band's old school fiery leads and solos will find some joy here; as will fans of the more melodic and emotional side of metal music. The mid-section of the album is a haze, but it opens and finishes strongly. If only the guitars and vocals didn't completely drown out the bass and drums...\n",
        "\nTo generally sum up my thoughts, I\u2019d say that Dystopia is overall solid; it has a good mix of mid-paced chuggers and fun thrashy numbers that are diverse enough to not get monotonous. Stylistically, it's right in between Rust In Peace and Countdown to Extinction. I think for the most part each song has its feet firmly planted in one camp or the other, but as a whole album, Dystopia fits snugly in the middle. Interestingly, I judged from the three singles that this would sound like Endgame, one of my favorite \u2018deth albums, but there wasn\u2019t as much of a similarity as I was expecting. Fortunately that\u2019s not a bad thing, as the sound was different enough to make the album feel fresh but still familiar.\n\nIt isn\u2019t a perfect album, of course, so I\u2019ll get my complaints out of the way first. While Dave sounds re-energized here, he re-uses some ideas too often; for example, any variation of a fade-in intro. I think over half of the songs have that, and it starts getting tiresome. On the opposite side of the song, the speed-up-double-time-to-the-finish outro is used too much as well (I\u2019m talking about the kind at the end of the title track and a few others). It sounds good at first, but they resort to it a few too many times instead of mixing it up. There\u2019s one song I actively dislike, which is \u201cPost American World.\u201d The intro/verse riffs aren\u2019t bad, but the pre-chorus and chorus are weak, drone-y (not in the good way) and annoying. The solo section is also very awkward and out-of-place and doesn\u2019t add much to it. Fortunately, that\u2019s the only truly bad song here.\n\nApart from those complaints, though, the whole album ranged from good to killer. The first three songs, all singles, are inspired and fun headbangers that kick off the album nicely. \u201cDystopia\u201d and \u201cFatal Illusion\u201d have noticeable parallels to \u201cHangar 18\u201d and \u201cBlack Friday,\u201d respectively, but are still very original-sounding. \u201cDeath From Within\u201d is similar but starts to stray into more unfamiliar territory; there are some lightning-quick guitar licks in the verses that sneak up and surprise you, and Chris Adler really makes his presence known on drums when he smashes away at the cymbals. \u201cBullet to the Brain\u201d mixes it up with a 2/3 time signature in the verse and gives us a lot of guitar leads to chew on. \u201cPoisonous Shadows\u201d is an effective ballad that sounds almost power-metal-like at times but remains aggressive. Parts of it sound like \u201cThe Hardest Part of Letting Go\u2026Sealed With A Kiss\u201d from Endgame.\n\n\u201cConquer or Die\u201d is a decent instrumental with a nice, tasty solo that goes on forever. It\u2019s not Megadeth\u2019s best instrumental\u2014it doesn\u2019t even touch \u201cInto the Lungs of Hell\u201d\u2014but it gets the job done. That leads into \u201cLying in State,\u201d which is probably the thrashiest number on the album. Once again, Adler is a beast on the drums, and Dave\u2019s vocals sound pissed off and\u2014dare I say it?\u2014youthful. \u201cThe Emperor\u201d is a very punky song, which at times reminds me of \u201cWashington is Next\u201d from United Abominations. The album closes with \u201cForeign Policy,\u201d a Fear cover that, oddly enough, sounds more metal to me than \u201cThe Emperor.\u201d At any rate, it\u2019s a blistering and fun-as-hell ride to cap things off and features some of Dave\u2019s best vocal work on the album.\n\nWhile I haven't heard any of Kiko's previous material and therefore can't give him his due credit, I will say that his effect is felt profoundly on Dystopia. The lead guitars sound different from any other Megadeth album. The dual guitar section on \u201cBullet to the Brain,\u201d for instance, features two very different but equally good leads played together. They counterpoint each other excellently and create one of the album's best solos. Another favorite moment is in the intro to \u201cDystopia,\u201d featuring a lead part which, while simple, blends beautifully with the Iron Maiden-like riff underneath. And there is a LOT of lead guitar on this album, but it rarely sounds dry or repetitive.\n\nI could go on more, but I think that suffices. Dystopia is a solid, strong offering from the new Megadeth lineup. It doesn\u2019t push as many boundaries as I would have liked, and some ideas are recycled a few too many times, and there is one song I don\u2019t care for, but all that aside, I think this is a great comeback effort from Dave. He sounds inspired and energized by the youth around him, and hopefully we can see more good material from this lineup in the future. I give it a 7/10.\n",
        "\nI often suffer from being a permanent optimist, and Dave Mustaine has, on more than one occasion, been the cause of my suffering. Megadeth were one of the first bands I ever truly loved - a 'genesis' band, if you will. I discovered them around the time \"The World Needs A Hero\" was released (yes, I'm only 22). The following \"The System Has Failed\" was a varied and incredibly exciting album for 11-year-old me. \"United Abominations\" came as something of a disappointment which grew over time until the smackdown of 2009's \"Endgame\" knocked me on my ass. I felt alone in my appreciation for \"Thirteen\", and \"Supercollider\" was the biggest flop of 2012 from any band ever. So what mixture of emotions was I supposed to experience upon the release of 2016's \"Dystopia\"? Well - relief and sheer joy, as it turns out!\n\nI'm sure we can all agree that Dave Mustaine is a massive dick. His pseudo-political ramblings and questionable viewpoints should always be ignored in favour of the excellent modern thrash metal he is capable of writing. I mention this now, because if you can't get over right-wing lyrics, then opening track \"The Threat Is Real\", with its eastern melodies and not-even-subtle themes, will turn you away like sour milk. What is actually on offer is some galloping chugging, blazing fretwork and snarling sneers from our man Mustaine. Once the first verse reaches its climax - \"The vultures have come home to nest!\" - one can't help but smirk with content and think 'Dave got it right, the marvellous bastard!'.\n\n31 years after Megadeth's debut, it's a little futile to mention line-up changes; however, the re-jigged cast-list on \"Dystopia\" sure helps inject a lethal dose of energy into the sound. The two mainstay Daves, Mustaine and Ellefson (the Maindaves, if you will), come across as hungry as they did back in 1985. Kiko Loureiro's riffwork is downright thrashtastic, and the occasional licks he provides can easily live up to Mustaine himself. There was plenty to be said about Chris Adler's involvement all over the internet - however, it's clear that the Lamb of God man suits the Megadeth crew down to the ground. The double-bass frenzies rattle like Vic, and he even throws in a few irregular rhythms to keep the listener on their toes (the off-kilter hi-hats in \"Death From Within\" especially).\n\nIt would be a step too far to say that Mustaine's songwriting has reached an artistic peak on this album. It's more accurate to disclose that he reliably churns out gem after gem of thrash classics that plainly have the patented Megadeth stamp on them. The irregular song-structures, the complex riffage, fitting in a guitar solo wherever he may think appropriate... It's been that way since '85 and he ain't stopping now. Take the title-track for example: it resembles \"Hangar 18\" in both structure and atmosphere. Right down to the haunting leads and rapid outro. And god, don't we love it?! The same can be said for \"Post American World\" and its similarity to the iconic \"Symphony of Destruction\". That mid-tempo chug is irresistibly headbang-able! \n\nThe spine-tingling moments on \"Dystopia\" are what prove Megadeth is still capable of carrying thrash forward further into the 21st century. \"Fatal Illusion\" embodies a futuristic vibe, especially with the layered vocals. But the progressive tinge and sense of drive keep it vigorously pushing directly into the listener's brain. \"Lying in State\" is surely the contender for 'thrash song of the year' - I don't care if it's only February. The opening riff utterly explodes with heaviness, thanks to the beefed-up guitar tone, and the section after the first solo is sheer thrash perfection. My neck hurts just thinking about it! Speaking of the guitar-tone; it's unbelievably heavy for such a technically reliant band. Listen to the verses of \"Poisonous Shadows\" - that grinding rhythm sounds as heavy as Megadeth could possibly sound.\n\nThe few oddities on this release are not what I would consider 'fodder' - but exactly that: oddities. \"Conquer or Die\", as the token instrumental, sets itself up to be the next \"Into The Lungs of Hell\" or \"Dialectic Chaos\" but unfortunately never crawls above a mid-tempo pace - wasting what could have been. Closing track \"The Emperor\" doesn't quite fit in with the tone of the album - emitting a more groovy rock'n'roll attitude. Cool as it is, it remains an oddity, and tempting to skip. But Dave thankfully shows off his hardcore punk influences right before the disc stops spinning with a furious cover of Fear's \"Foreign Policy\". Snarling, vicious and politically sharp - this is just the ticket for a Megadeth cover - echoing the brilliant Sex Pistols cover from 1988.\n\nYou can complain about the questionable variation of quality from Megadeth since the turn of the millennium - but at least they've given us plenty of material to work with, the majority of it of very high standard! Which is more than that...other band...can attest to. Metalli-whatsit? Mellacita? Something like that. Sorry Hetfield & co. - you grow continually more obsolete as aeons pass waiting for your next quality release. Meanwhile, the future of thrash metal can rest easy in the hands of Overkill, Testament, Exodus, Anthrax, Kreator, Heathen...and Vic Rattlehead of course.\n\n\"A fatal shot,\nA lust for blood,\nThe final act,\nThe threat is real!\"\n",
        "\nI've never been a fan of Megadeth due to their confusingly inconsistent line-ups, an almost constant and significant decrease in musical quality over the past twenty years and especially due to the increasingly weak vocals performing vapid lyrics. ''Dystopia'' comes as a positive surprise and is easily the best Megadeth output since ''Youthanasia'' twenty-two years earlier.\n\nThe success of this release is based upon several elements. First of all, new guitarist Kiko Loureiro of Angra fame delivers an excellent job. His guitar work is technically appealing, the melodies he plays are highly emotional and his style is diversified but still has a clear guiding line. He harmonizes perfectly with Dave Mustaine who offers some of the most gripping riffs he has ever written. \n\nThe second reason for this return to form is the interesting dystopian concept and the way the band dealt with it. The album has a constant dystopian atmosphere and the sum of the different tracks is even more convincing than its different parts. It's also positive to see that Dave Mustaine didn't include too much political propaganda on this record and the few references to contemporary American politics aren't too shallow, obvious and nasty. A closer look at the solid lyrics is definitely recommended.\n\nThe third reason for the greatness of this output is its diversity despite its clear intellectual and atmospheric guide line. ''The Threat is Real'' is an excellent opener with Indian folk chants, powerful riffs, a chaotic yet gripping chorus and numerous excellent melodic guitar solos. The mixture of melodic yet technically appealing guitar riffs and surprisingly melodic vocals in the brilliant title song ''Dystopia'' has an almost progressive metal touch. ''Post American World'' is a sinister mid-tempo stomper with dominating bass parts and more stunning guitar solos. ''The Emperor'' has more classic heavy metal and hard rock riffs and the whole tune is crowned with the record's catchiest chorus. Two other songs really stand out on this album. The epic ''Poisonous Shadows'' is filled with creative diversity including breathtaking guitar solos, fluid changes of atmosphere and style and a moving piano coda. This track is one of the best Megadeth songs ever written in my book. The closing ''Foreign Policy'' is a take on the Fear track of the same name and usually I'm not the biggest fan of cover songs but this one here's a real grower. The track reminds me a lot of early Voivod. It has an untamed punk vibe, dystopian solos and liberatingly angry vocals. Since no other band produces more realistic dystopian sounds than Voivod, this reference is quite positive and ends a very good album on a strong note.\n\nAnother amazing thing about the album is that the few average tracks can be found in different places on the album. The choice for the track list is very efficient. The opening tracks are really strong, the middle part is outstanding and the final part is also top notch. The record never decreases in quality. The five different bonus track are solid but they are bonus songs for a good reason since they can't catch up with this album's greatest cuts. That's why it doesn't matter at all which version you buy in the end.\n\nColour me surprised but ''Dystopia'' is more than just a return to form for band that has disappointed me for a very long time. This record does everything right where the previous albums failed for different reasons. Even the vocals finally sound convincing and suit the topic despite a slight decrease of skills due to Dave Mustaine's age and lifestyle. The band sounds hungry again and I hope this new line-up will stay together for a while. Fans of dystopian concept and good heavy, progressive and thrash metal can't get around this early highlight of the year.\n",
        "\nEvery time I so much as consider listening to my still unopened copy of Dystopia, I am quickly reminded of just how fucking bad the tail end of Megadeth's career has been up to this point. I know it is bad to not view an album's quality in its own right, but seriously. The band have basically been a lost cause since about 1999, with the odd spark of genius either through pure chance or deliberate manipulation (looking at you, Endgame!) And this is, musically, the nadir of this post '90s period for the band. It is basically on the same level as the musically serviceable but artistically bankrupt Endgame, all things considered, but moves far closer to the forgettable doorstop that was Th1rt3en in terms of pure musical quality. This is one of the most boring, tired sounding and flat out banal albums I have ever come across.\n\nOne of the most immediately offensive things about this album is Mustaine's vocals. There really are no words for them anymore, but let me just say that as my first exposure to anything Megadeth have done post 1994, it came as a fucking nasty surprise. His voice has no power to it anymore, no range, a very garbled and grating tone, and they just suck even by Megadeth standards on the whole. OK, saying Dave is a shit vocalist is nothing new, but at least he had character and energy back in his (and the band's) prime. Though his snarl remains to a degree, it is more a grumbling and bitter sort of tone that just stinks of an old man trying to be aggressive. Dave just can't sing at all anymore, and he doesn't even have any aggressive music behind him to justify putting even a bit of effort or aggression into his performance (though given how much creative control he has, that could very well be him accounting for his crappy voice or just another act of sheer laziness.) Even James Hetfield is more listenable nowadays with his infamous 'old man Metallicountry' voice.\n\nOn the subject of Mustaine, let us take some time to marvel at these wondrous lyrics. Ooh yes, there are many gems here, and this is easily the nadir of his writings. OK, once again, we all know his latter day work is terrible, but this really takes the cake - take for instance, the now infamous ramblings on 'Beginning of Sorrow'. Barring the fact that the very notion of Dave Mustaine, I repeat, DAVE FUCKING MUSTAINE, providing his opinion on abortion is one of the worst possible combinations of speaker and topic imaginable, the incoherent babbling on this song is insane. OK, so it goes 'girl finds guy, guy turns out to be less than stellar, so to speak, she is left with a rape baby, chooses not to abort, kid grows up in a foster home to become another rapist...' wait what? Too much stuff going on here Dave, is the focus on abortion for rape victims or just abortion in general? Why is the kid growing up to be a rapist relevant? Is it about the state of foster homes? What the actual fuck? \n\nHow about the senility themed lyrics on 'Forget To Remember' transitioning to some anti-vaxxer bullshit, or the ridiculous schizophrenia of 'Dance in the Rain' - from the dreaded 9 to 5 office job to 'DA GUBBERMINT ARE SPYING ON YOU' in the space of one song... and the word 'Al-CIA-da', just because. Take note also that this particular track is home to yet another one of Dave's vocally orientated political soapboxes at the beginning, and only picks up towards the end. I know lyrics are a pretty tangential thing in the grand scheme of an album, but when the vocals are mixed so highly, when that is literally all there is to focus on because the music is so incredibly uninteresting and weak, man do they get on your nerves.\n\nOh shit, the music, almost forgot to talk about that. Let me listen to the album for like, the 5th time since I bought it to try and remember some of these riffs, making sure to carefully sidestep my way around the hideous vocal and lyrical display like the week old festering turd that it is. The vast majority of these riffs are extremely boring, non-aggressive, non-driving and just unmemorable. There are a few good moments - stuff like the beginning of 'Don't Turn Your Back...', the latter half of 'Dance In The Rain', the earliest rumblings of 'Kingmaker', and 'Built For War' all display some sort of riff making coherency, and the existence of this thrash-like riffage is proof of how scatterbrained Mustaine's musical talents have become. However, these moments are few and far between, with the vast majority of the riffs being the same generic chord progressions or boring hard rock riffs that Dave has been writing since 1997. The songs are so lightweight and pacified that it beggars belief that this is a Megadeth album that doesn't also have the word 'risk' in the title.\n\nThe rest of the band is just as listless and uninteresting as the riffs. Oh sure, there are some solos here and there, but really these function in the same way that Dimebag's work did for Pantera's worst moments - a sort of horrid incentive presented by the artist for the easily impressed to sit through the meaningless, dull crap they write to listen to 20 or so seconds of shredding goodness. The drums are utterly lifeless and mechanical; they seriously could have got a drum machine to do that job. It is almost entirely simple straight beats, with very few moments on the pedals ('Dance in the Rain', 'Don't Turn Your Back...') and no immediately notable fill action. The same can be said of the bass, it basically melds into the background of the album and does what it should be doing - but at no point is it ever isolated (barring that bit at 'Beginning of Sorrow'), and not once can the bass itself really be heard, unlike even the abominable Endgame.\n\nThis record sounds really shitty, too. By that I mean that the production is shite. It is squeaky clean and very loud, removing most of the crunch from the guitars and destroying any sense of dynamics in the music (not that it had much to begin with), and reducing the drums to a lightweight, plastic-like and dull thud. The whole album sounds overly digitised, processed and sterile, a far cry from the polished but still natural Countdown to Extinction or the raw as fuck early recordings from this outfit. The bass can almost never be heard beyond a quiet booming underneath everything, and the vocals are mixed far too loudly and sound equally processed, in some ridiculous attempt to make Dave not sound like utter garbage.\n\nAnd the result of all of this decrepit mediocrity and banality is one inconsistent as hell album. The majority of this bloody thing is completely forgettable hard rock, whether it be the horrific title track, 'Off the Edge', 'Forget to Remember' or the particularly abominable 'The Blackest Crow'. That last song is a sort of terrible banjo-led thing with a banjo led rendition of 'My Last Words'' acoustic intro and a really awkward atmosphere on the whole. There are some tracks with a bit of meat to them in the riffs and occasionally the vocals, such as the dumb but enjoyable and groovy 'Burn!' and the (relatively) brackish 'Kingmaker'. And then there are the inconsistent songs, the ones like 'Don't Turn Your Back...' or 'Built For War', which have some potential with some decent riffs and vocals, but just go nowhere or throw it all away for yet another horrible attempt at a vocal melody by Mustaine or that comical mid-section of the latter song. Perhaps the track that best sums up the instrumental proficiency, lyrics and overall quality of this album is 'Dance in the Rain'. The first 3 minutes are a lyrical abomination, yet another soapbox for Dave's ranting, while the last minute is a sneakily placed furious bit of double-bass led thrash with comparatively amazing riffs and an exuberant vocal performance from David Draiman. The whole album spends its entire duration going from one batshit insane idea to the next, rarely getting its shit together and producing something of an acceptable standard.\n\nHowever, don't let this album's few highlights draw you in. The good points here are still forgettable by Megadeth standards, the whole album is thoroughly unenjoyable on account of the awful vocals, the schizophrenic levels of inconsistency, the production, and the overriding sense of bitterness and angst that fills every square inch of the all-too-prominent lyrical rantings about whatever is eatin' Dave right now. His completely scatterbrained approach to... everything is found at every turn on this album, and makes it extremely confusing and absolutely insane to listen to, in all the worst ways. This thing is also way too long - a whopping 50 minutes of Dave's rantings formed somewhat into... 's-s-ssongs(?)', qualified as such only by the crappy 'metal' beneath the vocals.\n\nFuck this thing; I ain't spending any more time with it. Let me put it this way: When the best song on your album is a motherfucking cover track, you know you DONE FUCKED IT UP!\n\nFUCKING AVOID!\n",
        "\nTo say expectations for this album were low would be an understatement. And after the (united) abominations that were Thirteen and Super Collider, can you really blame fans for not being as excited for a new Megadeth album as they once were? However, as each single was released, my expectations grew. I still wasn't expecting to be blown away by it, but I certainly was interested. So, does Dystopia revive Megadeth or finally prove that the band is truly dead?\n\nDystopia is as front-loaded as an album can be. I understand the reason for this, they needed to get people excited for the rest of the album, but they put the 3 already released songs first. To say this hurts the album would be putting it nicely. Firstly, it makes you wait about 15 minutes to actually hear new material. Secondly, these 3 songs are the best tracks on the album. This means that the rest of the album never lives up to the excitement the first 15 minutes built, or would have built had we not already heard the songs. Imagine if Ride The Lightning had \"Fade To Black\", \"For Whom the Bell Tolls\", and \"Creeping Death\" as the first 3 songs? It would make the rest of the album feel like a let down, even though the rest of that album is great. It's just a poor choice that makes the album feel like 3 great songs with a good number of after-thoughts. This doesn't mean that these songs are awful, just that they are drastically inferior. That doesn't mean there aren't awful songs on display here though. Even when not compared to the first three tracks, songs such as \"Post American World\" are absolutely laughable, and the song \"Bullet To The Brain\" makes me want to live up to the title. Where once Dave's voice was grimy and dirty, now it is just embarrassingly unintentionally cheesy. I'll talk more about his voice later though.\n\nNew band member's Chris Adler and Kiko Loureino don't exactly have much to prove, as both are well respected musicians from well known bands, but it was still uncertain how their playing would mesh with Dave's artistic vision. Megadeth has always been a true band, but a band with a very clear leader, and as such all member's contributions had to fit what Dave was wanting. Loureino's more power metal and neo-classical stylings and Chris Adler's more metalcore oriented drumming, while great in their other bands, easily could have not worked well with the Megadeth sound. However, both men both conform enough to the tradiotnal Megadeth fans happy, while providing enough of their own spin on things to help make this album stand out. Kiko's guitar work is reminiscent of Marty Friedman, but never sounds like he's trying to emulate his style. Both musicians are accomplished neo-classical musicians, but Kiko is above all else a power metal guitarist. Chris Adler's drumming is mostly focused on driving the music, never taking center stage but always powerfully propelling the music forward. Kiko's guitar-work helps the music feel grand and epic, while Chris Adler's drumming helps to keep things grounded. Not to take away from Mustaine and Ellefson, who both give their best musical performances since Endgame. Ellefson's bass gets to shine here a little more than usual, able to come to the front of the music occasionally and provide his typical groovy basslines. Mustaine also offers his most interesting riffs in years, being both complex and focused. This leads to Dystopia having the best music a Megadeth album has had in a long time, at least since Endgame. However there are moments where it seems that everyone was on different pages. This is expected, as half the band members are new and had never worked with anyone in the band before, while the other half has been in the band for 30 years. However, this doesn't happen often enough to severely hurt the album.\n\nWhile the music here is without a doubt great, there is a pretty big elephant in the room, that being Mustaine's voice. It's not unexpected for a 54 year old man to not be able to hit the notes he could at 24, but that fact does nothing to help the fact that the vocals on this album pretty much stay within a four note range the whole time. This makes songs that are distinct musically blend together, as Mustaine's voice is high in the mix. This problem isn't too noticeable when listening to the songs separate, but when you sit down for 50 minutes to listen to the whole thing, it becomes impossible to ignore. On top of that, the lyrics are pretty bland too. Blah blah blah the world is falling to pieces blah blah blah. It's stuff we've heard Megadeth deal with before, but done less well. That isn't to say the lyrics here are completely trash, it's just rehashed ideas that aren't as good as they were the first time we heard them.\n\nProduction wise, it's a step in the right direction for Megadeth, being less compressed that previous albums. In the era of the loudness war, it's nice to hear an album that hasn't had the life compressed out of it. The bass is nice and thick, guitars sharp and clean, and well defined drumming. Nothing too impressive, but it doesn't hold the album back in any way, shape, or form.\n\nIn short, Dystopia almost completely rights the wrongs of Thirteen and Super Colider. Megadeth has once again come back from the grave, and with a new lineup of diverse musicians, I expect for Megadeth to stay. Mustaine's voice is aging rapidly, but his guitar riffs sound as good as ever. It's all around a very solid record, one that every Megadeth fan at least needs to check out once.\n",
        "\nIn my mind, Megadeth have always been one of all too few thrash bands that have a real identity. I don't mean that they have an identity as a thrash band, because there are thousands of groups who only have an identity as a thrash band to make them memorable, which of course backfires as they get lost in the masses; what I mean is that Megadeth have always had an identity apart from as a thrash band, meaning that they really do stand out distinctly from their multifarious generic peers and imitators. In fact, if we really think about it, Megadeth are not really that pure a thrash band. Ventures into hard rock and commercial territory aside, Dave Mustaine and his many cohorts forged a thoroughly unique sound from the beginning, as 'Killing Is My Business' is quick to prove if you listen to its speed metal riffing, baggy bass, and frantic shredding. Probably for this reason, Megadeth can easily lay claim to being my favourite of the \"Big 4\" bands and - if they truly play thrash - also my favourite thrash band.\n\nIn this regard, 'Peace Sells...But Who's Buying?' is a typical Megadeth album, exhibiting all the assets and the few drawbacks that have made Dave and co. so consistently entertaining for so long. There are lots of riffs and speed; there's Mustaine's idiosyncratic voice(s); no sense of restraint in terms of solos; hooks that never lose their hard edges; finally, there's that ever-present sense of excitement that mostly comes from the friction between white-knuckle technicality and enraged sloppiness, which is almost certainly the defining factor of early Megadeth. What makes 'Peace Sells' a little more than just a typical Megadeth album is its invention and daring. Whenever Mustaine has gone all-out and fired everything at an album or a song, it has come out exponentially better than the times he has played it safe, even if the song is riddled with weirdness or poor production or that imposing sloppiness that only someone really crazy could ever pull off (not Metallica, naturally).\n\nThe invention is all there in the bulk of the songs on this record, often coming from the guitars, though by no means limited to them. The entirety of opener 'Wake Up Dead' is a testament to an intensely different way of thinking about music, right from the splurge of words that leads the album out of the gate to the combative riffs that chop up the middle of the song with so many different time changes to the stomping feel of the closing solo section, which remains one of the most distinctive moments of Megadeth's career. The creativity on display here is inimitable and fearless, making the entire song feel thoroughly unpredictable and exciting after the hundredth listen, however much it might spin the listener's head at first. Then there are those broken riff licks on 'The Conjuring', the legendary bass line from the title track, the bloodied tatters of fingers flying off guitar strings during 'Black Friday', the funky dip and groove of 'I Ain't Superstitious', and the climactic gang shouts in 'My Last Words' - this album has a lot going on in terms of ideas. It shouldn't really work with this kind of hectic creativity, though that's the difference between being good and being unique.\n\nFour men do their best to make this a great listen. The first one, I don't need to talk about, though I would like to say that Mustaine is underrated as a vocalist, since he crafts a whole load of different shapes from his voice and never sounds as though he's doing anything inappropriate. Chris Poland, while not as celebrated as Marty Friedman, may actually be as worthy of praise as the later axeman, particularly as his fills on the Willie Dixon cover and the album's title track are at once playful, skillful, and sound cool as fuck. David Ellefson has had his plaudits in the past, though 'Peace Sells' must be his best performance in Megadeth colours, doing way more than scraping around the guitarists and frequently putting his own stamp on fast and more measured sections alike. Gar Samuelson has not been endowed with the most robust drum tone on the 2004 remastered version that I'm listening to (there are a few beats that sound like he is throwing drum sticks at his kit from across the room), but he is super tight when the string players take off with their right hands and scatters fills about whenever he can. Perhaps his proudest moment might be the transition between 'Good Mourning' and 'Black Friday', where he rolls around all the drums before locking into a rock-solid beat.\n\nFor all this praise, however, there are some weak points in this album. The first one is the production, which I feel is imperfect on both the old and newer versions (I haven't heard the 25th anniversary version, but I have the original remaster). On the 2004 addition, everything still sounds pretty loose, with Ellefson's bass twanging tastily at times and rattling annoyingly at others, while OlympicSharpshooter's about \"chickenscratch\" guitars is apt in several places, where the E-string gets busy and we don't get a lot of joy from any real notes, just speed. A few of the solos also become rather abrasive at high-pitch, though that's not such a problem, since it gives these parts a physical punch that they would otherwise lack, guitars occasionally being thin. The second problem is a much more regular one, and that is the fact that 'Bad Omen', but especially 'Devil's Island', don't match up to the others in terms of quality or interest, remaining fairly predictable, though not completely bland. Since the other songs needn't resort to speed in order to surprise, these songs feel restrained in comparison whatever their pace, even if I rather suspect there are a fair few thrash bands who would have made them focal points of any of their own albums. The most bizarre complaint I have is that no else seems to be able to hear the totally obvious chant of \"Neville's island\" replacing the actual title of that song at some point in its latter half.\n\nSo, to sum up, 'Peace Sells' is a pretty obvious classic and plays more like an obvious classic nowadays than a few other 1986 peers, despite the signs of weakness in the production. There is a whole lot of quality packed into a relatively short album and even the less essential songs are exactly that - less essential, rather than inessential. The real selling point, however, must be the entirely unpeaceful attitude of this release, since it never lets up in terms of creativity and rarely gives the listener pause for thought either, unless that thought is, \"Fuck, I like this.\"\n",
        "\nWhen I first saw this album announced I had trouble really caring very much. 2013\u2032s Super Collider wasn\u2019t very good and 2011\u2032s Th1rt3en (which I still think was an absolutely abysmal title choice) before that wasn\u2019t great either. You have to go all the way back to 2009\u2032s Endgame to find the last Megadeth album I really cared for. But, despite my misgivings about the title, cover art, and what was likely to be the lyrical themes, I gave this album a shot.\n\nSome what surprisingly, Megadeth managed to cobble together a really decent, solid album with Dystopia. This album reminds me a lot of Endgame in the way that it is an attempt to harness some of the old school Megadeth sound that a lot of fans have been clamoring for after the disappointment of Th1rt3en. This obvious from get go as the album opens with \u201cThe Threat is Real\u201d whose verse riff is a sped up version of the main riff from Sepultura\u2019s \u201cTerritory\u201d. In fact, with the exception of the first half of the title track, the whole front half of this album consists of the sorts of heavy songs that would have felt right at home on mid period Megadeth albums like Countdown to Extinction and Youthanasia.\n\nUnfortunately the album sort of loses steam around the midway point. While songs like \u201cBullet to the Brain\u201d and \u201cPost-American World\u201d are not necessarily bad, they do not live up to the scorching beginning of the album. Additionally, the album's inexplicable instrumental track, \u201cConquer or Die\u201d, isn\u2019t terribly interesting, although it is a very well composed bit of music from a technical perspective.\n\nThe final tracks on the album rescue it from the dullness of the middle section to a degree. \u201cLying in State\u201d is arguably the best track on the entire album, and the \u201cThe Emperor\u201d, which is the final original song on the album, is also fantastic despite being a bit more rock tinged than some of the other offerings. Finally the album ends with a cover of Fear\u2019s \u201cForeign Policy\u201d which is pretty fun, although Dave managed to suck some of the energy out of the chorus.\n\n\u201cHow is are the instrumental performances on the album?\u201d you may be asking at this point. Well, in a word, great. Both Mustaine and newest guitarist Kiko Loureiro play some absolutely fantastic solos throughout the album. I would even say that some of Mustaine\u2019s solos rival his work on Rust in Peace. Chris Adler competently plays the part of drummer, and although the nature of Mustaine\u2019s writing don\u2019t give him many chances to show off what he is capable of there are a few fills and things here and there where he leaves his fingerprints on the album. David Ellefson is, as always, a fantastic bassist, and holds down the low end with great skill.\n\nSo do I have any complaints? Yeah, I do have a couple. One, Dave Mustaine\u2019s voice is fading fast, and he doesn\u2019t always seem aware of his diminishing abilities. He has never been a fantastic singer, but there are places on this album where his attempts at melody are somewhat painful. Two, dear lord someone should stop letting Mustaine write the lyrics. I know it is his band and all, but come on, does anyone really want to listen to his political musings and conspiracy theories at this point? That was possibly the best part of Endgame. While he got political on a few of those songs it was relatively calm, and was offset by songs like \u201cThis Day We Fight\u201d, \u201cHeadcrusher\u201d, and \u201c1320\u2032\u201d. We know you can do better Dave.\n\nAll in all this is a pretty solid album. I wouldn\u2019t say that it is anything special, but I\u2019m glad that I did listen to it and I hope that Dave will start moving back toward the older sound that is hinted at on this album, or at least not swing back to Super Collider style modern rock.\n",
        "\nI think the anticipation for this album, for me, had less to do with Dave Mustaine, and more to do with their new guitarist Kiko, who I've been a huge fan of since discovering Angra some 15 or so years ago. Seeing what he could bring to a band as large, important and storied as Megadeth, made this one of the most anticipated albums ever for me.\n\nKiko's influence is evident, and strong in his leads, especially places like the first solo of the title track where he lets loose some very signature motifs. His solos throughout the album add a healthy dose of his own flavor, without stepping on the proverbial toes of the band's sound, as well as even giving subtle nods to former guitarists' styles, namely Poland and Friedman. The songs that he has writing credits on are definitely the more unique on the album, especially Poisonous Shadow, which is unlike anything the band has done before. It has more of a European flair, with a somber, ghostly choir in the verse, and some intense doublebass/chugging patterns, recalling something Angra-like. Post American World sounds maybe not so divergent from the bands sound, until it gets to the bridge and there is a very proggy type of breakdown, using more of a complex rhythm than you are used to hearing from the band. Kiko did an absolutely stellar job here, his solos are completely on point and his song contributions added nicely to the band's sound. \n\nDave's guitar leads are much more classic and streamlined, lots of bends and a bit more \"rock\" oriented at times. His vocals don't have quite the bite that they've had in the past, but I'm not of the opinion that his voice is failing. Still one of the most distinct and iconic voices in the game. I've always been a big fan of Dave's lyrics and largely agree with his political views, and his message here is as potent, and more important, than ever.\n\nThe production of this album is exactly what it should be, not sterile, keeping some of that old school tone in the guitars and drum sound, but nice and punchy. The lead guitars could afford to be a little louder, but other than that, it's spot on production-wise.\n\nSongs like The Threat is Real, Fatal Illusion and Lying in State are some of the heaviest tracks the band has produced, thrashy, heavy, with lyrics that pull no punches. Even though I would have liked to hear a super fast beat drop in when Fatal Illusion picks up!\n\nBullet to the Brain and Poisonous Shadows sees the band using more \"modern\" style riffs, ones that really work in the band's favor. The main riff of Bullet to the Brain sounds much like newer Symphony X, which if you're going to sound modern, is one of the better ways to go. \n\nThe title track's main riff is pure gold. This is maybe the best track on the album, the solos absolutely destroy, the main riff is such a driving, melodic, head-banging riff, and the song has a cool structure that ends with a big crescendo at the end.\n\nChris Adler does a great job on drums, but I feel like his drum parts were maybe somewhat subdued per Dave's instruction. Just the feeling I get. Some of the beats don't seem like what he'd choose to play (some half-beats, where I feel he'd probably choose a much faster beats) and the complexity and fills to spice things up, seem a bit lacking. This leads me to what I feel is the only real weakness of the album.\n\nThe complexity and speed need to be nudged up, just a bit. Heaviness in the production is spot-on, but just a hair more brutality in the riffs, a few super fast drum parts (even blast beats), and some tasty bits of complexity would absolutely knock it out of the park. Even though Dystopia is one of the best tracks, it just seems to scream for added little licks and fills. I don't think they'd have to stray very far at all from what you see here to just add in a few new heavier, more technical aspects to the music. They easily have enough talent to pull it off with this lineup. With all the talk of Mustaine \"holding people back\", this seems like it may not change, but damn it would be such a sweet thing to see. Dave - use this awesome talent you have to it's full potential!\n\nThat said, this is a great album. Their best post-Risk release, and just behind Countdown in quality. Megadeth is definitely back on track!\n",
        "\nDystopia is very good. It has the energy and diversity of a rejuvenated band; Mustaine seems more intense and angry throughout, his vocals seem gruffer, his snarls more menacing and the tone of the album as a whole owes more to the angsty political persona of early Megadeth, heavily influenced by hardcore-punk bands like Fear ('Foreign Policy' is a Fear cover). Kiko Loureiro and Chris Adler are a near perfect fit for this refreshed sounding Megadeth: Adler's rhythmic and frantic pedaling brings back a pummeling speed-thrash edge and Loureiro's progressive-eccentricities (he has three writers credits on the album) brings about a rather flamboyant and creative touch. \n\nIt's a diverse album with tempo-changes, spiralling solo after solo, acoustic passages, melodies and groove galore and, I think to it's minor detriment, there is perhaps too much indulgence, or if not indulgence too much going on; the speed-thrash aggression pops up from time to time and that intensity mixed with progressive touches is when Megadeth are at their best, but too often it does not maintain that intensity, rather it slows down to a more groovy, still quite angry, and melodic NWOBHM-esque sound. It's ultimately down to taste, the slower tracks really aren't bad at all.\n\nThe first three tracks, the three singles, maintain a thrash-energy that permeates from song to song; 'Dystopia' is a great Megadeth song with a melodic groove and sleak transitions; it has an underlying aggressiveness that seems genuine, not forced. 'Fatal Illusion' opens with a crunching riff leading in to Ellefson's punchy bass popping into the mix alone segueing to dual guitars and the trademark Mustaine snarl: It's well written and certainly heavy-metal, a long way from the hard-rock filth that was Super Collider.\n\nFollowing on, 'Death From Within' seemed a little uninspired, it's steady and bland riffing littered with quite interesting licks, the drumming interesting, but it was all quite conventional; it didn't quite manage to reclaim the energy from the previous songs, although this would probably be the best song on Super Collider. \n\n'Bullet To The Brain' illustrates the importance of an imaginative rhythm guitar; Kiko and Mustaine interplay, they are both near-virtuoso's and they're not afraid to flaunt it: the solos soar and switch between dramatic and frantic, soft and forceful, the guitars sing as they harmonise and fluctuate back and fore. Kiko and Mustaine really seem to work well together. And Kiko's influence is even greater on the next three songs - 'Post American World', 'Poisonous Shadows', and 'Conquer or Die!' - as Kiko is attributed, along with Mustaine, with writer credits. These three tracks feel a lot more different: the acoustic opening to 'Poisonous Shadows' is a well-placed rest, there is an atmosphere that doesn't feel too cheesy or forced. The three songs have that progressive-power metal eccentricity that one attributes to Angra. But, and this one of my few gripes, my issue is that, although these three tracks are decent enough, they seem to stop the album in its tracks; it feels a bit plodding and less furious. 'Poisonous Shadows' is the closest thing to a ballad and, although not bad, is that what we really want from a Megadeth album? We know the band have so much potential, and they've shown us that with some of the previous tracks, so hearing this shift in tone is a bit of a let down. (Still better than Super Collider).\n\nThe rest of the album though, following on from the instrumental 'Conquer or Die!' is fantastic; it really sounds like old-school Megadeth at times and, with shitty 80's production values, I'm sure Dave Mustaine could try and palm off a few of these songs as once-lost-now-found unused studio recordings from Peace Sells. 'The Emperor' is another fun, fast-paced melodic gem; it's cheesy and eccentric and idiosyncratic with fantastic musicianship and catchiness (it even has a Tom G Warrior ughhh thrown in): isn't this all we really want from life? \n\nIt\u2019s maybe not a good thing that my two favourite tracks on first listen were covers: \u2018Foreign Policy\u2019 a cover of 80\u2019s hardcore-punk band Fear and \u2018Melt The Ice Away\u2019 (a Spotify bonus track, so it probably should not count, but I listened to it as part of the album before realising) a Budgie cover (Welsh hard-rockers from the 70\u2019s). Before knowing this I had noted the punk-thrash simplicity of 'Foreign Policy' and it made sense after finding out it was a cover. Even as a cover it's a fantastic track, each member really shines through. The same can be said for 'Melt The Ice Away', Chris Adler in particular has some great fills.\n\nAll in all I am pleasantly surprised by this album. I was expecting it to be good based off the singles and based off Mustaine's recent return to a reasonable level of sanity. It really does have that unpredictability and diversity that Megadeth do so well: solos melt in to solos, solos fuse into grooves and eccentric bridges, bouncing bass interludes merge with gruff snarls and diverse drumming. It's extravagant but still espouses an 80's thrash-hardcore-punk sentiment that Megadeth seemed to be missing before. The lyrics, I find, still make me laugh - more likely cringe - at times, but this is Dave Mustaine, he's more of a stereotype, a cardboard cut out of a rock-star these days; he seems a bit more normal but he is still an anomaly. Dave Mustaine is a concept, an idea, a feeling, a movement deep inside of us all; he is human - well, half-human half-robot - and so I can forgive him. \n\nWritten for Akerblogger: akerblogger.blogspot.co.uk\n",
        "\nEndgame is another in a long, long line of sub-par, mediocre and boring Megadeth albums that the band has churned out since the turn of the millennium and the release of The World Needs a Hero. Every last one of these albums is a disposable collection of filler with maybe two or three salvageable tracks, and this is no different. Despite this however, somehow this is seen as an amazing return to form from a revitalised band, instead of the tepid work of a washed up band well past their prime. The few standout tracks here may be significantly better than those on other modern Megadeth albums but the rest of it is just as bad as anything else they've done at this point in their career.\n\nThe two standout tracks in question are of course 'Dialectic Chaos/This Day We Fight!' (they are basically one song) and 'Head Crusher'. Both of these are some of the best tracks of their post-prime period, the former in contention for one of their best songs ever. They are a pair of absolutely destructive, high speed and high energy thrashers with fantastic riffs and lead guitarwork all round, a no-nonsense and bold attitude, great lyrics and catchy hooks, and a passionate and aggressive vocal performance. They truly are modern thrash classics, songs that show that the old warhorse that is Megadeth still has it as they proceed to upstage virtually every modern thrash band from the time.\n\nThe problem is that absolutely nothing else on the album stands up to them at all, but more to the point nothing here is even passable. It's all a bunch of go-nowhere filler that is merely a continuation of all the bad ideas Dave has been shoving into his music since the days of Countdown to Extinction; specifically all the mid-tempo forgettable fluff that has plagued a lot of Megadeth's albums since that one, as well as some more recent ideas. From a bunch of aimless, mid-tempo tracks with nothing interesting going on in them at all ('44 Minutes', 'Bodies', 'Bite the Hand') to a song loaded with overbearing political spoken word (the title track) to a miserable attempt at thrashing with no energy to it at all ('1,320') and a bafflingly terrible half-ballad loaded with strings and melodrama ('The Hardest Part of Letting Go...') it's all the same rubbish Dave has been peddling for years. Every last one of these songs has uninspired riffs, tired-sounding, ragged and terrible vocal performances (including some really awkward vocal melodies), no catchy choruses, rambling and ranting verses and a complete lack of inspiration and passion. The solos here are good, being as flashy yet tasteful as ever, but solos don't save miserable songs - which mostly go in one ear and out of the other, never to be remembered once the album stops. The best idea this album offers (an opening instrumental comprised of amazing lead guitar leading into a violent thrasher) isn't even novel; it's a trick borrowed from So Far, So Good... So What!. There is nothing fresh or new here (maybe that half-ballad is a uniquely horrible idea, even in the wake of the '\u00c0 tout le monde' re-recording), most of it is just re-treads of the worst aspects of the band's music.\n\nThe positioning of the two good songs at the start and towards the end of the album is perhaps why this is seen as such a great album; opening with a song as explosive as 'This Day We Fight!' and having 'Head Crusher' towards the end is guaranteed to colour pretty much every other song here in a more positive light, as the excitement these tracks build lasts for such a long time it's easy to ignore how bad the rest of the material here is. Isolate any one of these other songs however, and it becomes painfully obvious how pitiful the bulk of the track listing is. Aside from its few standout songs being amazing and the quality of the lead guitarwork, the only other positive this album has over the rest of them is the production, which makes the music sound crisp, vibrant and heavy. It doesn't do much to save the bad songs here but it really is the cherry on top for something like 'Head Crusher'. \n\nDo not be fooled by the hype, this is a bad album that isn't worth your time. Find 'Head Crusher', 'Dialectic Chaos' and 'This Day We Fight!' and avoid the rest of this release. It's a sub-par effort from a band that can clearly do so much better, and is the biggest case of the emperor having no clothes in the band's entire catalogue.\n",
        "\nAh, good old 'deth, the thrash band we all know. The band which released solid albums over their three decades of existence, with only a few of them ever disappointing (hey Metallica). After the letdown of 2013's Super Collider, Dave decided he had to come back to the thrash roots and to the original Megadeth essence. Accompanied by a new lineup which consists Lamb of God drummer Chris Adler and Angra's own guitar virtuoso Kiko Lourerio.\n\nThe new lineup is better by far than the last. Chris Adler's technical drumming is just as intense and powerful as it is in any Lamb of God album, with relentless double kicks dominant in the entire album. Dave's and Kiko's thrashing leads and rhythms feel like they came straight out of Rust in Peace and United Abominations, and as far as I can recall, these albums have some of the best Megadeth riffs ever made. It definitely seems that Dave gave some creative space to the new band members, and it is working perfectly. The flashy solos are better than ever and can compete with any Friedman or Poland solos ever played, and the riffs are creative in a way that resembles a more technical Peace Sells and Endgame. \n\nMegadeth have clearly proved themselves in terms of creativity and song structures, which vary from song to song: while the title track is melodic and is more heavy metal oriented than thrash, Poisonous Shadows is a chug-along Lamb of God- like groove song and Conquer....Or Die! having a Spanish-like acoustic intro. The most notable song here is undoubtedly Poisonous Shadows. It sums up the entire album and it does it perfectly- sharp solos and heavy leads, accompanied by almost drum-programm sounding machine gun double bass and accompanying Dave Jr.'s talented bass lines, and a damn piano outro (a piano wasn't used in a Megadeth song since 1985) which really badass and keeps the angry atmosphere of the album. Even Dave's vocals and Dave Jr.'s backing vocals sound energetic again, unlike the old men's moaning which ruled the previous release. Each song of the album goes in the exact same manner (except for the piano part), and doesn't seem to bore at all- even the Fear cover is made this way and surprisingly, it doesn't shame the original song at all.\n\nThe lyrics aren't the dumb Super Collider  lyrics anymore. No more \"Burn baby burnnnnnnnn or \"When you feel, life is bringing you down\" wankering, but instead, some very hard criticizing political lyrics which put the ones that were featured in United Abominations to shame:\n\n\"Demoralized and overmastered people think\nThe quickest way to end a war is lose\nDictatorship ends starting with tyrannicide\nYou must destroy the cancer at its root\" (Dystopia) \n\nThe production is nothing short but perfect. It is perfectly equalized, with each instrument and vocal being heard perfectly, and don't overrule the drums and bass. The only flaw in the album is the duration of some songs which could be cut down by a few, but overall, this album has definitely entered the top 10 Megadeth albums of all time. Recommended.\n",
        "\nI consider my perspective a lot different from the others on this release, so allow me to pitch in my two cents and justify my rating without getting emotional. \n\nWith respect to Megadeth, here\u2019s my profile: I\u2019m only a casual fan, never kept up with the latest Megadeth news, and to this day I haven\u2019t bothered to go buy another Megadeth record.\n\nThe CD attempts to overview the golden era of the band\u2019s career (the 80s and 90s) in a balanced manner. And, frankly, even with some great songs like \"Tornado of Souls\" missing, I still think this song selection represents the best of Megadeth well. Aside from obvious classics, I\u2019m glad \u201cTrust\u201d is here to showcase the band\u2019s more melodic songwriting, as well as lesser-known songs like \u201cTrain of Consequences\u201d, \"Kill the King\u201d, and \u201cAngry Again\u201d where the band finds a middle ground between melody and technical appeal. Not only did I get a good overall picture of what Megadeth is all about, listening many times to this release made me want to explore more of Megadeth, and I did go on to eventually listen through their albums I have not yet heard at the time I got this. \n\nI also find the song order to be agreeable here. While it isn't chronological, the older & highly rated songs are generally lined up first, while more recent (and not-as-highly-rated) songs tend to be towards the back end of the order. I am in favor of such an approach because the CD grabs the listener's attention with the best of the best, and keeps the listening experience interesting with diversity. It also sounds cohesive, despite putting songs from different albums next to each other. For example, the first three tracks - \u201cHoly Wars\u2026\u201d, \u201cIn My Darkest Hour\u201d, and \u201cPeace Sells\u201d - all flow very well from one to another, thanks in part to their instantly recognizable riffs. Compared to the other Megadeth compilation releases, I think this one is the best in terms of number of songs included and the order in which they are presented. \n\nNonetheless I can\u2019t give this release a higher rating - I have the version that came with a DVD, and the DVD is god awful. Its main feature is the live performance from 1999, but the sound mix is inexplicably bastardized by sporadically cranking up Dave Mustaine\u2019s solos to an obnoxious level where others are drowned out. To make matters worse, such mixing also exacerbates Dave\u2019s sloppy performance on that particular night. Drowning out Marty Friedman\u2019s solos is also a huge disrespect to Marty, who had a better performance than Dave in the film. Watching the band perform with Marty should have been a great pleasure, especially because this was one of his last performance before he left heavy metal for the world of J-pop, but the sound mix totally destroys the experience. I suppose the DVD also does a good job of representing what to expect from Megadeth (or, specifically, Dave Mustaine), in an ironic way. \n\nI will admit that the criticisms by others on this site (and elsewhere) do leave a very bad taste in my mouth. I had no idea for a long time that the songs on the CD were supposed to be chosen by fans\u2019 votes (which would have been very cool). I do feel really bad for the faithfuls for having their wishes ignored and betrayed. I also agree that Megadeth has put out too many compilations with similar set of songs, and I definitely don\u2019t like feeling like I spent my precious money on a cash-grab. \n\nBut, my $10 is gone and will never come back, and at the end of the day, I don\u2019t regret buying this. This release is good enough to satisfy my occasional and casual Megadeth fix. I\u2019m genuinely happy with what I have.\n",
        "\nSomething that you never seem to hear about Megadeth is just how fun they are. There was always something a little unhinged about Dave Mustaine's personality that suggested you shouldn't take your eyes off him, but at about the point where he stopped taking himself so seriously and ceased to be a total dick (a few people are still waiting, right Kerry King?), he actually became more interesting and actually kind of fun. His vocal personality, his errant soapbox lyrics and interviews, and the riff- and lead-happy tendencies of most Megadeth albums make this a hell of a lot more diverting for me than half of the \"classic\" thrash that spilled out of the 80s and has no personality and no apparent purpose. '13' is manifestly not Megadeth's finest album, not even Megadeth's finest 21st century album (I think I'm going with the populace and saying it's 'Endgame', though 'United Abominations' is no slouch), but what happens here is a sheer cavalcade of catchy, memorable songs that work well at high volume, with a beverage in your hand, and 'Rust in Peace' far from your mind.\n\nMegadeth's sound isn't terribly thrash-oriented anymore, so there shouldn't be any expectation that Dave & co are going to play fast. We only get speed on a few mildly aggressive numbers like 'Never Dead' and 'Fast Lane', though the successes on '13' come about more as a result of songwriting economy, hooks, and a talent for impact that goes right back to the beautiful construction of songs on 'Peace Sells...But Who's Buying?'. The lack of speed and aggression in the musical style doesn't make trouble in the way that might be imagined, because Mustaine has always been good at injecting snottiness and looseness in the vocal department, which counters the big production job that combined the talents of Mustaine, Andy Sneap, and Johnny K of Biomechanical fame. Guitars are bold and robust, with treble mainly saved for the leads, while the drums are muscular, precise, and never over-complicated. There isn't much in the way of experimentation either, the musicians generally preferring to get on with business in as punctual a fashion as possible. Just two songs top 5 minutes and most of the numbers here march through a verse, a chorus, repeat the trick, shred for 30 seconds, and then exit via another chorus. As a formula, it looks basic, but that's what makes everything work so well - it doesn't leave room for bad decisions.\n\nSince the focus is so heavily on songs, '13' builds no consistent atmosphere, yet the cocky strut of 'Guns, Drugs, & Money' perfectly suits its gangster subject matter, 'Deadly Nightshade' has an appropriately dangerous main riff, and there are some creepy moments in 'We the People' and 'Millenium of the Blind' that are mildly affecting. The first of these examples is a good measure of why this is such a fun experience. The ideas are big and dumb and the execution is larger than life, yet the confidence with which the band power through the song is captivating and turns this underdog song set into a combination that you'll root for. Plus, at the start of the second verse (1:34 if we're being precise), the guitars drop out for the vocal to come back in and something catches in Dave's throat that sounds just like a pistol being cocked. Fuck me, that's cool! If I'm counting songs that I consider to have those kind of large musical testicles, I get onto a second hand, so that's about half the album that sounds great.\n\nAnother thing that should attract old and new Megadeth fans is the blistering leads that flash out of most songs here. Though not quite as inspired as those on 'Endgame' Mustaine and Chris Broderick are on strong form, playing speedy leads that up both the tempo and the technicality of the songs, lending a shot of adrenaline to a mid-paced album. The recurring lead of 'Black Swan' is pretty cool, though that's one of the few songs where the vocals actually steal the show, using some great slower lines on the \"My angel's left me, sorrows are my own\" section, while the chorus is also executed impressively. At faster tempos, the material for both riffs and solos are slightly more generic, but mid-paced Megadeth is immensely productive on '13'.\n\nYou may have noticed that I haven't mentioned the slower songs, and that's largely because they suck quite a lot. The title track has a vaguely pleasant nostalgic tone to it, but certainly doesn't justify its running time, whereas 'Millenium of the Blind' fares worse, having only about a minute of worthwhile soloing to mark its passing. The reworked 'New World Order' also ranks among the disappointments, trying to scrape bland stock riffs under the carpet of the vocal-dominated verses, and only picking up after the halfway mark for a decent bridge section. Picking holes in the other songs is in fact fairly easy: perhaps one could complain about the overly percussive verse of 'Sudden Death', though the surge of movement in the chorus redeems it totally; maybe those simple chords in 'Whose Life (Is It Anyways?)' are just too direct, but the great hooky licks and the ridiculousness of the 50 year old Mustaine singing \"You hate the way I wear my clothes/You hate my friends and where we go\" makes up for it; certainly, 'Fast Lane' is such a clich\u00e9 subject for this band and the riffs are only so-so, yet, again, the song is difficult to resist once it gets going. That's the same for most of the album - no outstanding musical quality, but a hell of a good time.\n\nAs I have already said, '13' isn't the best Megadeth album by a long shot, though there's actually an outside chance that it might be my favourite to listen to. It shows that music needn't be brilliant, cutting-edge, or too serious in order to attract an audience. This may well have been another bid for commercial acceptance from the ill-fated Mustaine, but I don't care. This is fun as fuck.\n",
        "\nMegadeth's output over the past 20 years can be best described as inconsistent, ranging from brilliant moments of nostalgia aimed at their glory days in the late 80s to mixed bags of plodding modern metal and stagnant clunkers accompanied by a number of better moments. However, recently there seems to be a wholly different formula at work in the lead up to their 15th LP Dystopia, one that is definitely geared towards a thrash sound but actually manages to to embrace a fair amount of modern brutality without sacrificing the animated riffing style and shred-happy lead breaks that are often jettisoned in the name of embracing the present/future. Following a heavy, punchy beast of a lead-off single in Fatal Illusion, Mustaine and company have upped the ante even further with The Threat Is Real, while also providing a rock solid reminder of where this band came from, as well as a big part of where the Bay Area sound itself derived its unique character.\n\nAs far as formulas go, the structure of this single's A-side is fairly similar to its immediate predecessor, featuring introduction material and cycling through a series of twists and turns in a manner fairly reminiscent of the elaborate approach of Rust In Peace. But here a long, gradual move from a marching stomp feel at the beginning is traded out for an atmospheric middle eastern inspired prelude that is hauntingly beautiful despite the ominous picture that it paints, which is immediately followed by a more agitated riff set that has all the menacing clatter of an AK-47, but still with a general feeling of build up. The riff set is quite busy, the mixture of the whole resounds in a very heavy-handed way comparable to the percussive character of a modern groove outfit, and the lead guitar exchange between Dave and Angra's own Kiko Loureiro manages to recapture that primitive shredding vs. progressive noodling dichotomy that Mustaine originally shared with Marty Friedman.\n\nOf equal importance to the power of this short studio outing is the B-side, a cover of Fear's classic \"Foreign Policy\", highlighting hardcore punk's highly synergistic relationship with thrash metal in a manner quite similar to when Megadeth covered \"Anarchy In The UK\" back in the day. In terms of execution this song is more of a faithful reproduction with a few obligatory present day exaggerations, particularly a more wailing set of lead guitar noise during the brief instrumental breaks, a more gravely and nasty vocal display out of Mustaine, and an even heavier overall sound that is actually more aggressive sounding than anything Megadeth has pulled off in their more than 30 years of existence. This looks to be the precedent that will be set when Dystopia is finally unleashed next year, and the author of this review counts himself among the many that are waiting with bated breath.\n",
        "\nMegadeth has established themselves as both the most consistent and the most stylistically mixed of the media dubbed Big Four. They've generally stuck to a regular niche of heaviness and melodic contour that sets them a slight bit closer to the speed metal and NWOBHM style that paved the way for thrash metal, barring a few token interludes into lighter fair that can be best described as modern, at least in context of when they were released. Naturally some albums have had a bit more thrashing brilliance going on, while others have shied away to a more mid-pace, grooving, and almost hard rocking demeanor at times, and they've shined brightest when sticking closer to the former category though they have generally pulled off the latter reasonably well. Their last couple studio albums following Endgame, however, saw the band backsliding into a dull and plodding rut that had not been seen since their creative nadir at the turn of the millennium, and it's been hoped for, if not expected that at some point things would need to be shaken up for Megadeth to get back on track.\n\nThe exit of the somewhat longstanding involvement of drummer Shawn Drover and lead guitarist Chris Broderick could definitely be counted as things getting a shakeup, and if their recently released single Fatal Illusion is a consistent representative of what will be Megadeth's upcoming LP Dystopia, it will have been a good one. Though featuring some odd characters in newly recruited guitar shredder Kiko Loureiro of Angra fame (though perhaps not so odd given he comes from a comparably non-thrash metal background as that of Marty Friedman) and guest drummer of Lamb Of God Chris Adler, it's pretty clear that this is Mustaine's ship and he's captaining it with the same stylistic trappings that underscored the better moments of Megadeth's recent history. This particular song is relatively short in scope, but loaded with off-the-cuff switches and flashy guitar work that partially hearkens back to the Rust In Peace days, bearing some similarity to \"Holy Wars\", but being a bit thicker and closer to the punchy, darker character of Endgame and some fancier bass work at a few key points.\n\nWhile the future is still a bit uncertain as to where Dystopia will fall, it's pretty well stipulated that Mustaine and company have moved back into the realm of politics and cynicism, which has generally been their forte as far as honing their sound into a medium where it is at its most effective. Mustaine's voice is a bit hoarse and haggard sounding, the same tricks are generally in play as far as the duality between Mustaine's own straight-forward shredding vs. a much more flashy and unconventional foil, and the songs gets off to something of a slow start with a recurring, down tempo chug that is almost as repetitive and simple as \"March of the S.O.D.\", but this is a really solid slab of up-tempo yet measured thrash metal that will definitely appeal to those seeking a return to earlier forms in Megadeth's sound. If things follow this course on the upcoming LP, Mustaine will have yet again prove who ultimately got the last laugh after his ejection from Metallica.\n",
        "\nThe year was 2013. Megadeth released a brand new song, entitled \"Super Collider\" which would be the title-track from their upcoming album. Upon my first listen, I was immediately appalled. Flashback to 2011 when Megadeth put out the album \"Th1rt3en\", and especially 2009 when the thrash masterpiece \"Endgame\" came out. \"Th1rt3en\" was a little less thrashy than its predecessor, but it was still a very good melodic heavy metal album. With \"Super Collider\", it seems that Megadeth is trying to capture either the melodic metal elements of \"Cryptic Writings\", or the highly controversial radio-rock album \"Risk\". Speaking for a minority group of people, I actually enjoy \"Cryptic Writings\" quite a bit and I even think \"Risk\" is a good album, although it definitely should have been released under a different name than Megadeth. So, why is \"Super Collider\" such a bad album if it takes elements from two of Megadeth's albums which I actually like? It's not completely an issue with the album's mainstream sound, rather an issue of inconsistency and the album's boring, uninspired, and \"tired\" sound.\n\nThis wretched turd of an album begins with \"Kingmaker\". Out of these 11 songs, \"Kingmaker\" is the closest thing we get to thrash metal. It's actually a pretty good song musically, although the vocals are pretty bad, which I will get to later in this review. The riffing is pretty strong and tight, and really make this song a great Megadeth anthem. Alas, all good things come to an end because it is immediately followed by the awful title track. Yes, this song sounds like something that was released by Bon Jovi or AC/DC. It's a completely boring, unoriginal radio-rock track that really does sound like an inferior song from \"Risk\". One huge issue I have with this album is the inconsistency. We get a mix of some thrash metal songs with a huge influx of crappy pop rock songs like this one. Just take a look at the lyrics to \"Burn!\":\n\n\"Burn baby burn cause it feels so good.\"\n\nAre you freaking kidding me? Is Dave Mustaine seriously trying to sound like Katy Perry? Because his lyrics on this album are generally on the same level of intelligence or literacy. Not only is he using the dreaded word \"baby\" in a \"teen pop\" way, but the lyrics themselves otherwise are just plain dumb. Another example of lyrical immaturity would be within the song \"The Blackest Crow\", with an excerpt such as: \"This cold, empty house is so quiet now she's gone\". Sure, these aren't nearly as bad as the lyrics on \"Burn!\", but they do sound like something that would be written by a depressed teenager after his girlfriend left him. Certain styles of music typically contain lyrics like this, but Megadeth isn't necessarily a band I'd expect this from. Even songs like \"Almost Honest\" and \"1000 Times Goodbye\" from past records are better-written lyrically than this. \n\nAccompanying the usually sub-par lyrics are the tired, aging vocals from Mr. Dave Mustaine. This really isn't a surprising factor, though. To be completely fair, he was 51 years old by the time this album was released and he had been with Megadeth as the front man for 30 years. I'm sure all the singing he has done over the years have effected his vocal cords in a way. Still, his performance on this album is just bad. He sounds extremely lethargic and completely burned out. I've never been a huge fan of Dave's voice. Sure, he's not a terrible singer or even a bad one. He's just always been fairy average in this department in my opinion. He even sounds like he's on drugs in certain songs. Ironically, when he was doing drugs, he at least wrote better music. Note that while I say this, in no way am I condoning drug use. Say no to drugs, kids.\n\nThis album definitely contains some killer guitar riffs. Like I mentioned earlier, \"Kingmaker\" contains some classic thrash metal sounding riffing. \"Built for War\" is another prime example of this. However, when mixed with cheesy sounding pop rock songs like the title track, \"Forget to Remember\", and \"Burn!\", you get a very inconsistent, bipolar album that seems to suffer from an identity crisis. The thing that made \"Risk\" so good in my opinion was its melodic, rocking consistency. Sure, \"Cryptic Writings\" had a mix of melodic songs and thrashers, but it was a well-rounded album with a captivating sound and contained some amazingly consistent guitar work. This album seems to try way too hard to blend classic thrash with pop rock and fails miserably at this. This album really could have been something great. Dave Mustaine is still an amazing guitarist who is quite charismatic with his riffs and melodies. However, this album falls short of everything he's ever written, and this definitely not his finest hour. Sorry Dave, I'm just not feeling it.\n\nThis album really angered me when I first heard it. After sitting with it for two years and listening to it again for the sake of this review, does it sound any better to me? Has it grown on me? The answer to these questions is definitely a no, but I've grown a bit in terms of looking at sub-par music in a critical yet fair way, and I don't let it anger me. Instead, I now explain why this album is so bad in my opinion rather than simply saying \"it sucks\" or something along those lines. \"Super Collider\" is the worst thing Megadeth has written, but it's also following 13 albums, all of which I enjoy. Maybe Dave and Co. will come back with a better album to follow this one, maybe not. But this band certainly has had a great, successful career and will live on in history as one of the most important thrash metal bands, and for all of metal in general. However, only time will tell if they can recover from this mistake.\n",
        "\nBy releasing the ridiculously good Rust in Peace in 1990, Megadeth had achieved the pinnacle of songwriting that the thrash subgenre allowed for. With it, the band proved capable of interweaving stellar instrumental work within complex arrangements, resulting in a sophisticated product that was nonetheless very catchy and memorable. At that point in time, metal was on the verge of breaking into the mainstream, with Metallica releasing their famed self-titled album in 1991. And rivalry-fueled Dave Mustaine, ever-eager to outdo his competitors, decided that the only logical path for his band to take was to also expand their sound into a more accessible format. The result was Countdown to Extinction.\n\nCountdown to Extinction had its eyes on the grand prize of radio airplay and fame. As a result, the band has sacrificed most of the complexity that had accompanied Rust in Peace in favor of a more streamlined and polished sound. The songs are primarily straightforward four-minute rockers, sporting an emphasis on catchy guitar hooks, vocal lines and choruses. Despite this sharp turn in style and simplification of sound, however, the album's attitude still screams \"Megadeth!\". Mustaine's snarl hasn't lost its edge, and neither have the instrumental capabilities of Ellefson, Friedman and Menza who don't waste the opportunity to show off their prowess every now and then. The solo in Symphony of Destruction is still among the finest the band ever put out, whereas the tasteful opening bassline to the title track and the drum solo in closer Ashes in Your Mouth are successful as well. Even ridiculous-yet-cool design decisions such as the \"Hello me, meet the real me!\" monologue in Sweating Bullets don't take away from the fun factor that this release possesses. In addition, a high degree of consistency is achieved throughout the record's eleven songs, which successfully prevent this from being a singles album.\n\nThe band hasn't entirely lost touch with its past self, as there are a few moments which remind us of older Megadeth. Architecture of Aggression and Ashes in Your Mouth are heavier, more complex and more aggressive than the rest of the songs, even sporting some off-time 2/4 and 7/8 riffs here and there. Captive Honour, on the other hand, features a pretty complicated riff that almost sounds like a lead. If there are songs I'd criticise, one would be Foreclosure Of A Dream, which simply doesn't manage to be interesting. Also, High Speed Dirt, despite being decidedly catchy and upbeat, is about the quite dull and un-metal subject of skydiving.\n\nOverall, Countdown's crowning achievement is that it successfully breaks into radio-play territory without sacrificing the integral ingredients that make the music Megadeth and not some other band. Do listen.\n",
        "\nThe moment you set your eyes on 'So Far, So Good...So What?', you know there's something wrong with it. You don't really want to touch it, or you feel a little nervous about listening to it, or maybe there's a little fear thrown in there too. For me, it's the cover, as it so often is. That's a fucked up front cover for an album, not just because you know that dummy is wearing a uniform from a museum, which always smell stale and earthy and terrifying for no particular reason, but also because the Earth is appearing over his right shoulder, so we have to assume he's on the moon, which I can't explain at all. For grammar hounds, there's also the uncapitalised album title written in a primary school font that seems to say \"Class 4A, presentation week...enjoy yourself\". For those familiar with Megadeth, this album regrettably doesn't have any of the signature artwork, though that is supposed to be Vic Rattlehead...not that he's very easy to distinguish. The song titles are a warning too: there's a number ('502'), a woman's name ('Mary Jane'), a cover (Sex Pistols' 'Anarchy in the U.K.'), and an instrumental. For an 8 song album, that doesn't bode well.\n\nWe don't quite end up with bargain bin Megadeth, but this is the closest they came in the 80s. The first song on the album that I look forward to is 'Mary Jane', the fourth song. And fuck, that one's brilliant. The introduction is 20 seconds of everything getting thrown around - narration, lead fragments, time changes - and then it settles down into a mid-paced melodic riff and it's perfect from then on. Dave Mustaine manages to deliver coherent and emotional lyrics about a witch and her persecution, including the great line \"If I know I'm going crazy, I must not be insane\". The lead work is beautiful here too. The next song that I really like is 'Liar', the seventh, which has plenty of energy and spunk, then I also like 'Hook in Mouth' for lyrics and instrumental ideas. I'm not great at maths, but that seems to be three out of eight.\n\nI'm being very critical, but that's what one should be about this album. Dave Mustaine only turned out 6 proper songs, one of which is lazy (that's '502'), and the general quality isn't there to make all of those songs great. 'Set the World Afire' isn't a bad song at all, but sometimes when I listen to the riffs I feel frustrated, because some of them do so little, just chugging or moving on simple patterns. It's an old song, one of the band's first, and at times that's what it sounds like, as if it hasn't been updated since 1983. 'In My Darkest Hour' suffers too, whatever status that song has achieved: acoustic opening aside, the first half meanders and drifts without enough to hold onto, except Mustaine's sometimes-good-sometimes-not vocals, until it picks up in the second half. Really, for a thrash band, this album contains too many parts that are worthless or boring or poorly executed. It's a slow thrash album too, and clocking in at under 35 minutes, brings it very close to having too little content.\n\nAlso, I'm sitting here with the remastered version, and there's almost no power in the instruments. The rhythm guitar tone is thin and has little impact at all on some songs, which is why Dave Ellefson's bass plays such an important part on a song like 'Hook in Mouth', where he is more than audible - he's further up the mix than the drums - for its entire length. The medium-paced chuggers must have a strong tone to make them work: they don't, so the lead-driven 'Mary Jane' fares better, as well as the quicker second half of the album. The lead tone is pretty good, yet some of the more technical and high-pitched solos (on the opening instrumental and 'Set the World Afire') sound lke they are disintegrating as they are played, like a damaged spaceship re-entering the Earth's atmosphere. Everything mentioned thus far is a whole lot better than the drums, which are so flat and in the background that the songs aren't driven by them at all, and bass ends up as the main rhythmic presence.\n\nHowever, having trashed just about everything from this album (I didn't mention it, but the order of the songs is shit too), Megadeth are redeemed by a little something called attitude. If the Sex Pistols cover wasn't there we might not guess, but the punk spirit dominates this album almost from start to finish and gives some credibility to the ragged, half-arsed songwriting and instrumental performances. The snottiness of 'Liar' and '502' only works in this context: put one of those songs on 'Peace Sells' or 'Rust in Peace' and it would be derided, though there is something crazy and cock-eyed about this album that just about keeps them alive. I'm annoyed that I have to say it like this, but, as lazy and poorly composed as this album is, it manages to do something different from the typical thrash template and also stands alone in Megadeth's history. However, it's not a good album, with only a few great songs, and not every Megadeth fan will enjoy the experience.\n",
        "\nThis single was released for Countdown To Extinction. However, only the A-side is from said album, with the B-side being one of those rarities. And for a good reason.\n\nThis single's title track is one of 2 songs featured on their 1992 commercial breakthrough that conjure up any memory of their thrash days. It is a fairly rapid song, though not much in comparison to the faster moments on Rust In Peace. The song is very short and punchy, featuring old-school riff work, simple but fast drums, a catchy chorus and one of Friedman's trademark melodic solos. Most importantly though, it is driven and passionate, something just about every song after Megadeth's sell out would lack. It is overall a very good song, and really should have been featured on the previous album, along with Countdown to Extinction's closer, 'Ashes In Your Mouth'.\n\nHowever, I take issue with Side B. It is an industrial (not industrial metal, just industrial) remix of 'Holy Wars... The Punishment Due'. It is just so unnecessary, what were they going to achieve? Those who listen to Megadeth probably don't like industrial, so it isn't to rope in fans. It doesn't really improve on the song; it is not even inoffensive filler. This reeks of the experiments that Dave would undertake about 7 years after this, which proved to be quite the risk. The song itself is incredibly grating to my ears, being extremely repetitive and full of grating sound effects. It isn't even a particularly good conversion to the industrial genre. A song as complex as 'Holy Wars...' can't just be flattened into another genre like this, careful steps have to be taken. They also cut out the solos, and with guitarists like Mustaine and Friedman, as well as the removed metal edge, this is unforgivable.\n\nFortunately, you never have to suffer through this single's B-side, given that this single isn't too easy to track down and is really pointless too, the good material here can be found on Countdown To Extinction. Get that album instead, it features this excellent final thrasher and a whole lot more really good material.\n",
        "\nOverall this is great, but there certainly are some big questions here, so may as well get them on the table. First off, why the hell does Metallica get their own disc, and all three of the others have to share one? That doesn't seem like it should matter, until you find out that their setlist is way longer than the other bands. I get it, their the big guys, the popular ones, but come on man, they gotta all be even. Another thing, at the end when all four bands were out to play \"Am I Evil?\", why were there hardly any Slayer members out there? Granted, the others came out for the big picture at the end of it. Those are my only questions with the DVD as a whole, but note that for the rest of this, I will break it into one part for each band's performance.\n\nBeing chronological here, I will start with the performance of Anthrax. This one was probably actually my second least favorite of the four bands to play. I love Anthrax, but Joey Belladonna's voice just doesn't seem to do it for my live anymore or at least not as well. If this was made in the year 1989 or something along those lines, it would probably be pretty solid. His voice just seems to be out of range a lot and there's hardly any power there anymore. Thankfully the rest of the band does pretty well, but then again you usually don't lose instrument skills because of age, and that's all this really seems to be from. I like the setlist they picked, all of the songs on here are classics, however I probably would have replaced \"Only\" with something else. John Bush was not made for this band, and Joey singing his songs doesn't change anything. Scott Ian, I will say, seems to play just as well if not better than back in the heyday. Something that is evident in slowing down is \"Got The Time\". That's one of the fastest Anthrax songs that I know, but on here they could not quite keep up the pace anymore. No shame in that, they have had an incredible career and I am glad the boys were able to re-unite to do something like this. To sum it up though, I'd say it's good, but just not the same as what it could have been years ago. Granted I wasn't alive all of those years ago, but you get the point. My total scoring for this one would probably be 67%.\n\nMegadave, I mean, excuse me, Megadeth is next. Anymore the band lineup means nothing to me because it always seems to change. However Nick Menza on drums is the exception. He is the one drummer that is superior to the others. That means nothing since he is not on here. Regardless of that though, this was probably the best performance of the four bands. Dave Mustaine, although getting old and certainly showing age, does a pretty great job on this. His solos and playing techniques did not go down at all since the '80s, and even after his issue with his hand, he still kills it. Same goes for his vocals, if anything, they sound a little quieter, but I wouldn't say weaker. Hardly ever in metal is the bass ever that significant to me, simply because a lot of times I can't even hear it. David Ellefson is an exception, because his playing is very audible and sounds great on almost all of the tracks. Megadeth still has it in them for this performance. I also love how he takes one break in all of the songs. While the other bands stop and talk to the audience, he does that one time very briefly before the track \"Head Crusher\". And that's it! No more do you hear them stop and do anything like that. It just plays straight through til the end, with the Holy Wars Reprise that they seem to end every concert with. They did something similar when I saw Megadeth live in 2013 with Black Label Society, Device, Hellyeah!, and Newsted. Great performace, and overall get's an 89%.\n\nSLAYER! You'll hear that a lot at metal concerts in general. However I can't say at this one I would do the same. I was greatly disappointed by this performance, and would definitely say that this was the worst one. For years Slayer were great live performers, but like Anthrax I think the age is finally getting to them. Other live DVDs of theirs such as \"War At The Warfield\" or \"Live Intrusion\" are spectacular. But this one, definitely is a let down. I'd like to see Slayer soon so I can say I've seen them, before they completely die out. Anyways, Tom Araya has lost all sense of power in his voice. Take \"Angel Of Death\" and \"War Ensemble\". Both of those songs have long, loud, beastly screams. He either doesn't do them or does it very weakly in this. He also doesn't sound like he always has his breath for some parts, and overall just sounds weak. The rest of the band did pretty well, but that isn't enough to balance it out to me. Jeff Hannemen has always been my guitarist of choice for this band. His was pretty up to par, however Kerry King seems to only care about how mean he looks and the playing sounds a little slowed down. Then again, so does the whole band. It's the age, I'm telling you. Something else, I thought that the setlist was rather mediocre. There was too much new stuff and not enough classic. They played nothing from the first two albums, but then again, I'm not sure if they even could at this point. Yet they could do \"Chemical Warfare\", so I don't understand. Also, like I said, almost none of the guys joined at the end for the \"Am I Evil?\" performance. Come on guys, get off your asses and get out there. You're legendary! Slayer certainly went below their standards, and receive a 50%.\n\nLastly, the band absorbing the most fame, Metallica. Their performance was incredible too, almost as good as Megadeth's. Metallica have always seemed to be ageless when it comes to playing live. Sure, they aren't the long haired aggressive maniacs that we all know of and loved in the '80s, but they still certainly aren't bad. The only thing is, I don't really see why they get to play so much more just because they're more popular. Regardless, most of it was pretty good. James still sings his heart out, and gives off that vibe of just wanting to have fun. Lars is still a freak, not the best drummer, but still the same guy he always was. The instruments are top notch as always. Really, there's no disappointments on this. They probably could have cut out some of the newer stuff as well, much like Slayer needed to do. But they make up for it by at least doing everything well and having plenty of classics on here to balance it out. While most people get annoyed by bands that talk a lot, Metallica is fine by doing so. Like I said, James always wants to just put up a good show, so him talking to the audience a lot is not a problem at all. Something else that I never quite understood was why they always throw the tracks from \"Kill 'Em All\" at the very end. They did that here too. Perhaps they just like to close on an energetic note? Hey, at least they did a great job with it, like I said. Certainly nothing like it was but at least they can adapt their old stuff well. I give this one an 88%.\n\nIf you like all of the bands, I suggest getting this regardless of some of the flaws, just because it is something that every fan should see at least ones. It has it's good, bad, and ugly (definitely not talking about some of the band members at all there....). It's also good for background if you have people over and just want a concert on TV. Mostly good performances with some weak parts, that's all I've got to say.\n",
        "\nThis is kind of like... maybe all of the cut content and material from their 90s output with a modern twist on it all. Another half melodic thrash half melodic hard rock album. This would be nice and all except that as I already said it sounds like all the CUT material. Just not as strong.\n\nYou have no lack of melody spilling forth from the guitars (intro of I Know Jack). Between the solos and the riffs anyone looking for melody will be pleased assuming thats all you wanted. There is a lack of complexity, and all of those screaming guitar solos and break neck riffs have gone with it (something that I'm really starting to miss from their 80s days). Unfortunately though, there is a lack of any serious riffage, the guitar needs a bit more edge and power for that to work. The overall guitar lacks any serious aggression, which is unfortunate as the album seems like it was meant to be a return to an angrier more aggressive sound.\n\nThe drums have been reduced to nothing more then the keepers of time (putting it in much cooler words). More of your bass/snare patterns, which seem to be on their way to becoming Megadeth's norm. Not much complexity... correction, no complexity. The bass is basically inaudible. Another perfectly good bass player who's talents have gone to waste. He pokes through just enough to round it out and show that he isn't doing anything to really make it better.\n\nDave's singing lacks energy and enthusiasm. His energy has always been an important piece of his charisma and his singing isn't particularly strong. You can bet that really did a number on his performance, you would have done better to replace 2 of these tracks with instrumentals (something that they have had a lack of in this era), not bad (not really good either) but in desperate need of improvement. His lyrics this time around revolve around politics. Maybe political paranoia and conspiracy would be a better description.\n\nAfter hearing this, The World Needs a Hero and Cryptic Writings I must wonder if old Carrothead is scrambling for ideas. It would certainly make sense. These last two albums are clearly attempts to get back to the days of his greatest record sales but they don't exactly scream out with new ideas. Some of these riffs sound very alike (intros of I Know Jack and Back in the Day sound like the same idea, concept and rhythm but with different notes).\n\nNothing really special here, just another Megadeth record. Its not as heavy as past works, not as fast, the melodies aren't as strong, the songwriting isn't as good and it certainly isn't as enjoyable. Minus a few bad ass solos I imagine only fanboys will find this to be worth anything more.\n",
        "\nSo it turns out after Risk (and possibly Cryptic Writings) Mr. Carrothead and crew realized that while they were taking an admittedly unique and fairly experimental path that their career would be far more secure if they retreated back to familiar ground. So now we get The World Needs a Hero which can be summed up as sounding as if they couldn't decide whether to return to the melodic thrash of Countdown to Extinction or the melodic hard rock of Youthanasia.\n\nLuckily the two sounds mix fairly well as they both share the previously mentioned melodic roots. Much of the band's good ole early and mid 90s sound is back, but this is still a far cry from a complete return to form. Still lacks the anger, the aggression, the edge and the overall heaviness of Countdown to Extinction (and in most of those aspects Countdown pales in comparison to their 80s work). However you can tell the band are still trying to appease the fanbase and redeem themselves to the metal crowds, unfortunately they still clearly had the mainstream in mind as well during the writing process.\n\nDave has lots of energy but focuses it into more of a fun sound then an angry sound. He still swings away from the aggressive side of things as much as he can get away with. His singing is alright, very limited in range but very charismatic in performance. Pretty solid for the most part but he forgets to pack energy on some songs (1000 Times Goodbye). His lyrics now pander to a more radio oriented crowd with lyrics dealing with things like breakup (1000 Times Goodbye) or how desperately the world needs saving (the title track).\n\nThe guitars once again go for catchy hooks on the chorus but aren't quite as chorus centric now, with them attempting to sprinkle most every song with as many melodic riffs as they deem reasonable (an average of 2 or 3 to be exact). Its all midpaced and very simplistic as to offend as little as possible and to make sure it can still get decent marketing (another example being 1000 Times Goodbye, which by the way may be the most bland thing they've ever made). The soloing is all melody and is usually pretty predictable in placement, certainly nothing as shredding as Hangar 18 or Into the Lungs of Hell but admirable all the same.\n\nThe bass is reduced to the mere position of rounding it all out, on certain occasions the production pushes him up in the mix revealing some nice little bass grooves (opening of the title track). The drummer returns to his AC/DCish bass snare pattern drumming and mostly keeps time, he lays down some nice beats here and there but nothing too special about it. All in all its a decent laid back melodic album from a band that once released high speed balls of intensity and aggressive classics.\n\nStand out tracks: The World Needs a Hero, Dread and the Fugitive mind and Moto Psycho. Return to Hangar is also somewhat of a nostalgic blast, but doesn't hold a candle to Hangar 18.\n",
        "\nAfter setting aside speed and technicality for a more melodic path in the 90s that slowly became the hard rock sound found on Youthanasia and Cryptic Writings, Youthanasia was a solid release Cryptic Writings was a major disappointment. So of course many fans started passing on rumors of what the follow up would sound like. Only a small few of them at that time could truly predict what would come next though.\n\nThis is where Dave decided to play with all those genres that had been taboo through out his career so far, after releasing 2 hard rock albums it would seem he no longer saw a need to try and spoon feed metalheads material that would appease them, and so Megadeth saw the release of a pop rock album. One might argue there are too many influences (country, electronic, arena rock etc.) to simply sum it up as pop rock but most of these influences are pretty slight and only come in on a few tracks where as the pop rock elements are strong and present throughout. Either way its not the music you'd typically find on the shelf of any type of metalhead.\n\nNone of Megadeth's albums have ever had the same level of aggression and venom as Killing Is My Business, but this falls furthest from the tree. Dave shies away from aggression as much as he can, even their melodic thrash albums like Countdown to Extinction screamed out with anger but here its all different. He doesn't sound the slightest bit upset or even like hes trying to fake it, you can almost feel rainbows and sunshine spilling out of your speakers and ear buds on some tracks (Breadline for example seems very upbeat). As far as singing he does alright but he isn't anything special, especially with the lack of energy he seems to have. His emphasis is on how catchy he can make it (insomnianianiania).\n\nAs far as the guitar work goes its as simplistic as he could get away with, its mid tempo, not even really melodic except for the little jingle like hooks that are littered throughout; no technicality at all. Doesn't seem very energetic and has absolutely no edge at all. Its just there for those little hooks because like every other element to this album it revolves around being catchy, there are solos too but nothing of note. He treats us with some nice acoustic passages but they aren't utilized as much as they should be, they could make some pretty cool sections but exnay on that because he just wanted them there so that it wasn't all electric.\n\nThe drumming is so simple its practically 4 on the floor beats. Mean you often hear in basic level music classes that drums are just for keeping time and a nice simple beat for the instruments to follow and I swear to god this is the kind of thing they'd play after telling you that as an example. There is no substance to the drumming beyond that, might as well have fired the drummer and used a machine for this album. It has some electronic drum sections, which was a nice trick to throw things up and make something new, like the idea of the acoustic guitar it was one of the greatest ideas on this album but it was sorely under utilized. The bass just rounded out the sound.\n\nI really must applaud Dave for the idea of this, I like the versatility, I like the new elements and hell this is the only time I've found country music to be acceptable (Wanderlust) but there are so many things to be improved upon. It doesn't even bother me that this album isn't metal in any way but there needs to be more to these songs then catchy choruses and hooks. You had a bunch of styles to play with but you didn't let any of them shine through properly. These are usually styles I hate too so the mere fact I'm not shitting all over it should speak volumes about his adaptive abilities even if it does leave room for improvement.\n",
        "\nWhen I heard \"Back to the Start\" was to be compiled and released, I was annoyed. Really? Another Greatest Hits album? And I wasn't alone; all sorts of folks and fools I (once) knew derided this as nothing more than Capitol attempting to squeeze some more dolla-dolla bills from the group's fanbase. Funny how just about so many of these compilation albums that pop up is from this label, ain't it? But anyway...unlike other Best Ofs out there, this was promoted as something the fans on the Megadeth BBS could vote on; they're the ones setting up the track list, the songs they want the most. It sounded like a great idea, at the time, and if they/we truly got our way this could have been the comp. album to put other thrown-together corporate cash-in comps to shame. Our choice, our voice, if you will.\n\nBut what we got, instead, was an insulting fabrication. Looking back (still a bit fuzzy), I wonder if this was really up to the fans. Maybe a lot of them voted for some of the more commonplace staples in Megadeth's oeuvre, especially the ones that we know inside and out and love to death, but the whole track listing looks too much like your basic Megadeth \"Best Of\"; the most familiar, overplayed, and \"face-of-that-particular-album\" tracks. You know the ones I mean; Peace Sells? Oh, \"Wake Up Dead\" and the title track rather than \"Devil's Island\" or \"My Last Words\". Rust in Peace? \"Holy Wars\" and \"Hangar 18\" versus \"Poison was the Cure\" or \"Tornado of Souls\". Even something as unfortunately overlooked as Cryptic Writings didn't escape the \"been there, done that\" approach with \"Trust\" (which I'm personally sick of), yet \"She Wolf\" was a welcome surprise, I must admit. It's almost like the albums being represented only offered those specific songs rather than offering an entire disc's worth of material, at least half of which was worth their weight. And we know the former scenario is not the case at all.\n\nIt truly does feel like the head folks at the label tossed this together, had the band make a statement to the fans about this contest or whatever, and ran through a wall with songs we saw coming a mile away. If this was meant to be the fans' decision, were these the only options? Did we really get the entire Megadeth song list and ended up with a collection of the ones we're ultimately used to and/or sick of? Was \"Killing is My Business...\" off the table completely, as it tends to be with Capitol Records-borne compilations, save for \"Mechanix?\" I can't say what the actual results were as I said my piece back then and thought no more of it, but I do know that, according to my own introspections and other testimonials I'd collected, maybe 45-50% of these would have made the cut and many of the lesser known, yet ultimately better, songs would have been included. If they got enough votes, that is. But that wasn't up to us, it seems, in more ways than one.\n\nIn the end, as with just about every other Megadeth compilation (if not compilations in general), this was an unnecessary release that offers nothing more than a facade of the fans' opinions mattering. I could be coming off as too harsh against this given how much I loves me the 'deth, but seriously, enough's enough. We won't be wasting our time and money on multiple refried \"Greatest Hits\" any longer.\n",
        "\nIf your familiar with 80s and 90s cinema then you would probably argue that these aren't really 'hidden', as they all (except Paranoid) could be found on the soundtracks of movies (and Paranoid on a tribute album). Never the less though, Dave decided to compile them all somewhere where fans could purchase it and save themselves the money and time they would have to spend on tracking down the soundtracks. Its also probably a cash grab on his part, but unlike a normal compilation album where all the songs generally come from previous releases that most true fans already have this is a compilation of material that is a tad bit harder to collect.\n\nAs for the music presented, it mostly fits in with Countdown to Extinction and Youthanasia era material. Very midpaced and melodic. Nice catchy hooks and lyrics on the choruses, the type of stuff you can sing along to. Some gang shouts (Go to Hell). Good material for any fan of the two previously named albums.\n\nAlas though there is more to it then that, there are also 3 well done covers. Each performed with energy and enthusiasm showing that Dave truly cared about these songs and wasn't just piggybacking classic tracks for fame and fortune and to that I salute him, his covers (in general, not just these 3) show that he has a wide taste in music beyond just metal (unlike many of his fans unfortunately) and I feel that open mind towards music probably gave him a big boost in his song writing.\n\nNow, I said this already, but please take a second look at the track listing and note that none of these tracks were released on any previous Megadeth albums. Very few of them were even released as singles. If I were to place a bet why Mr. Carrothead chose these songs I would assume its simply because its really the only way to make them readily available to fans and to get a bigger chunk of the pie. Because let's face it, releasing a brand new song on an album featuring 11 other bands who take equal shares of the money and the movie producers who also try to get some money out of it because hey its their movie soundtrack you get a petty amount of money to compensate you for your work. \n\nWhen all is said and done though this works as much to the audience's favor as his own. How many people would actually hunt down Super Mario Bros. for one song? Not I.\n",
        "\nThe game of selling out finally has come back to bite Dave in his ass. Practically gone is the fragile balance of metal and the mainstream that made his last two releases so successful. I would love to be the open minded guy who's says \"take it for what it is, not what it isn't\" and preach that as the reason it demands respect. Well I am looking at it for what it is.\n\nWhat is it you ask? Its poorly structured hard rock tracks, simple riffs with no bite or edge, not particularly melodic, definitely not technical, definitely not fast, definitely not driving and chorus centric with weak choruses. \"Hey guys, let's make this extremely focused on mainstream style choruses but let's not use any guitar hooks or catchy lyrics\". Basically they made the mistake of writing an album without any type of appeal.\n\nSinging, yeah, Dave made some serious progress on the last album, only to bulldoze it here with sections that are just truly bad (the beginning of Use the Man for example). He has never been great at singing, but this... THIS!!! This is inexcusable. Plus he failed to even make most of the choruses catchy. Good job Dave, you proved that even you can make crap. The lyrics mostly deal with heart break and such, I'm sorry it came off as weak and whiny. He did so much better as the martyr of outspoken politics.\n\nGuitars? No bite, no speed, no groove, no real melody, no real anything. Those riffs are just there to be riffs, but they have no substance and don't seem intended to actually do anything. The solos are weak too, for all the same reasons. Bass too, seriously, did anyone in this band stop to think whether or not this was a good idea? Were they so stuck up on their own success that they believed everyone would love it simply for having their logo on it? I don't know. I just don't know what else to say, how many different times and ways can I say that this album has nothing to offer in anyway. How can an album be good when it lacks anything to make it good? This is proof that not all music has direction and purpose.\n",
        "\nThe second catchy album brought to you courtesy of Dave Mustaine and the boys in their crusade to out sell the Black Album. Unfortunately for them it didn't sell as well and did quite a number on the metal crowd of the day, it's often considered a misstep and not as well received as Countdown to Extinction.\n\nAt the end of the day there is one thing that prevents Youthanasia from being Countdown to Extinction part 2. Countdown to Extinction was definitely more melodic and centric on a catchy chorus but they still did their best to appease the thrash crowd that made them famous. Countdown to Extinction, Sweating Bullets, High Speed Dirt and Skin O My Teeth were all catchy and melodic but still definitely thrash. Here however the music rests somewhere between a melodic hard rock and a melodic heavy metal.\n\nFirst off, vocals and lyrics. Once again Dave chooses to preach his outspoken views of the world, however now he lays off politics and war a bit and moves towards more street oriented topics, obviously a move intended to give audiences something to relate to, bolstering his sales, but its also a healthy change in terms of how the album plays out. If I were to describe his actual vocals he still very energetic and enthusiastic, lots of charisma. To add to this his singing has improved so his choruses are a bit more smooth.\n\nThe guitars now have mostly abandoned the idea of speed. The riffs are still nicely muscled and melodic. The riffage seems to be put on autopilot though, still passable riffs but no one seems to be pushing for anything extraordinary. All the focus as far as songwriting goes went into the chorus parts to emphasize the catchy lyrics with strong guitar hooks. The solos are all still present but seem to be cut shorter to minimize time between choruses. For what its worth though pretty melodic soloing. The chances are though if you don't like catchy choruses you'll find this to be a complete waste of time and money, they're the complete focus of the album.\n\nThe bass again does what all reliable bass players have been charged with doing since they were incorporated in any form of rock or heavy music and that is to round out the sound. He does this job very well, he seems to have missed the \"everyone emphasize the chorus\" memo upon entering the studio because he does seem put a bit more effort into it. He has some nice bass lines sprinkled throughout the album. The drums are probably as dumbed down as they could be. They don't pound, they rarely go fast. I'd take bets that he was influenced by AC/DC this time around (the kings of love 'em or hate 'em with no real in between hard rock) because he just loves the simple bass snare bass snare patterns.\n\nAll in all though its still a pretty good album, even if it leaves an excess of things to be desired.\n\nStandout tracks: Train of Consequences, A Tout Le Monde, The Killing Road and I Thought I Knew it All\n",
        "\nIn his quest to beat Metallica Dave has done the drastic, he released an extremely mareketable album. Not really a sellout album...yet. It does a fairly good job of making a more marketable sound and still having it sound like a Megadeth album and for the most part is a good album.\n\nLyrically I feel Dave decided to add some new topics beyond his usual war, death and conspireacy. A bold move as it helps him share more of his worldly views and might get Megadeth into circles where they weren't present before and adding a layer that people can more easily relate to. Global awareness, (Countdown to Extinction) suicide, (High Speed Dirt) and mortgage troubles (Foreclosure of a Dream) have all been introduced. More melodic singing emphasizes the flaws in Dave's voice to a point where his natural charisma no longer covers it completely up, his vocals are still alright off the most part but a few tracks fall short (Captive Honour).\n\nThe guitar has almost completely traded its quick calculated riffs for slower more melodic riffs. This works out pretty well for the boys, the technicality is missed but the melody works just fine. There are also now guitar hooks added into the choruses. The solos are much slower but again add in another layer of melody. Forclosure of a Dream adds in a acoustic sections to fit as a ballad, ballads aren't new to Megadeth's music but they make more sense here. Not all the speed is lost though some tracks still rip along (High Speed Dirt and Skin O' my Teeth).\n\nThe drumming is slowed down and simplified. This really is a shame as its performance simply isn't as good now. The mixture of complexity and pounding did a lot for the performance and it simply doesn't sound right now. It also pounds a lot less to help with melody within the songs. I don't remember the bass doing much besides rounding out the sound and providing the basic backbone.\n\nNo, this isn't the Black Album and I'm sure many a metalhead like it far more however in the terms of competing with Metallica for popularity was a wasted effort (Black Album sold 16 million copies in the U.S. alone by the end of the 90s, pretty hard to beat) and ultimately while this album turned out just fine it foreshadows Dave's willingness to do whatever it takes to get the record sales and this foreshadows another release I'll most likely be covering before christmas, I'm sure Megadeth fans know what controversial piece I'm speaking of.\n\nStandout tracks: Countdown to Extinction, High Speed Dirt, Symphony of Destruction and Sweating Bullets\n",
        "\nRust in Peace is Megadeth's 4th album and one of their most well acclaimed with many referring to it as their greatest album. It definitely is a solid album and a worthy listen for any thrasher.\n\nThe lyrics deal with war (Holy Wars... the Punishment Due) and political conspiracies (Hangar 18). Dave's vocals are at a highpoint here. His enthusiatic and energetic delivery is hard to match. His singing is as good as he'll ever get, his voice lacks certain qualities but he is very charismatic and knows how to make up for it.\n\nMegadeth sticks more to midtempos on this album, (Holy Wars, Hangar 18 and Tornado of Souls) this makes a sound that is less technical but more melodic. Hooks have found their ways into some of the choruses. So the riffing is slower and more melodic then on previous albums meaning this is a bit of a game changer for Megadeth. I personally enjoyed the change and due to the reception it got I would assume this was a good choice for the band. The solos still tend to have that quick and calculated feel to them but with the advantage of more melody.\n\nThe bass follows the lead of the guitars and keeps tempo with them. Not as flashy or fancy as before. He does round out the sound and add support the guitars and has a place in the production where it can fill these roles with ease. The drummer lays off the pounding a lot and carries along with the others pulling out fanciful tricks as he sees fit.\n\nThis makes me ask a very important question though, Megadeth's rise to power was dependent on technicality. Its also how they tried so hard to out do Metallica, so why slow down and simplify it? I could only imagine that Dave wants to compete with Metallica in record sales and that is an extremely dangerous game to play. The only way for him to do that is make a more marketable sound, an almost guaranteed ticket to pissing off your fans and becoming a sellout and let's face it, now that Dave has crossed this line every album he makes has more and more potential to blow up in his face and become a disaster. Not one of his brighter ideas.\n\nStandout Tracks: Holy Wars, Hangar 18, Tornado of Souls and Rust in Peace\n",
        "\nEvery band releases something that doesn't live up to expectations eventually. Some bands do it repeatedly and some bands jump into a downward spiral. Luckily for Megadeth while it didn't live up to expectations this time around it was still pretty solid.\n\nDave's singing isn't as aggressive as Killing is My Business. Still full of energy and enthusiasm. He's very charismatic with his vocals. He has a limited range in his singing but the vocal parts in the songs don't require anything amazing, this teamed with his charisma still make his vocals a staple for the band.\n\nThe guitar work is pretty solid for the most part. Very fast, very calculted, very driving on the riffing, the riffs aren't very memorable though which is odd as I usually remember riffs very well. Its missing the level of melody that was present before however and this doesn't quite live up to expectation. The melody/technical mixture was also very crucial to Megadeth's sound so it doesn't sound quite as strong without it. The solos still pack the melodic/technical shredding punch and remain as highlights of the songs. Into the Lungs of Hell is one of the strongest tracks and is mostly just soloing.\n\nDave Ellefson is a solid bass player. He keeps up with the other boys really well. Fast and technical and at times throwing in stuff that's more attention grabbing then what his buddies on the guitar are doing. He mostly rounds out the sound though which is a pity compared to his past. The drummer is a new guy I believe, all the jazz elements from KIMB are completely gone now. He also isn't nearly as technical relying more on pure force and pounding, he sure likes his double pedal as many metal drummers do. He plays fast.\n\nStandout tracks: Into the Lungs of Hell, the cover of Anarchy in the U.K. and In My Darkest Hour\n",
        "\nMegadeth returns with their second classic and second album in total. Its a very heavy, technical and powerful album. Often advertised as brutal, but to be completely honest only grindcore, deathcore, raw black metal and brutal death metal feel brutal to me (and I only like 3 of the 4) I've just never found music to be extremely brutal. The album is less aggressive then before.\n\nThe solos shred at quick tempos, calculated, melodic at times, like an all in one combination. They show an impressive amount of skill. A nice sample of virtuosity. The riffs aren't all fast like they were on Killing is my Business. Some go at a midpaced tempo (Peace Sells and The Conjuring) others hit breakneck speed giving a nice diversity between tracks. There are also good melodic moments to be found (intros of Bad Omen and Good Mourning/Black Friday). Pretty well balanced.\n\nThe bass keeps up with the tempos, giving a nice backbone. It takes a nice spot in the mix where it can be heard pretty easily. It actually drives songs forward (Peace Sells) which is pretty unusual. He throws in little tricks of his own to remind us that the guitarists aren't the only showcasings of skill of here. The drummer doesn't use all the jazz tricks that were used before but he keeps some nice tempos. He shows his own skill in a way that is a bit more subtle and surprising to hear. He makes sure to use plenty of double pedal as expected from metal drummers and he makes sure to pound it out frequently.\n\nMustaine's vocals are energetic, enthusiastic and strangely charismatic which makes up for his lack of range and odd voice. Not as aggressive as before but he still spits a bit of venom and does this sort of one man call and response things at times (Peace Sells, where it also seems as if does call and response with the guitar). The composition is solid, the parts work well together instead of battling for your attention, clearly having more thought given to the whole instead of the individual performance.\n\nStandout tracks: Wake Up Dead, Peace Sells and Bad Omen\n",
        "\nSince I'll be finishing with my Slayer series tomorrow (hitting the World Painted Blood album and maybe a few of the singles if I feel like it before I write a prayer book in review form for Haunting the Chapel) I found it fitting to start on a Megadeth series today and cover all the big 4. I'll start by saying I won't mention production much like I did with Slayer as most of my listening will be done with Spotify which only carries Megadeth's remasters unlike Slayer where they have the original recordings. Just doesn't seem like it would be fair to judge classic albums by modern remasters that may have improved or castrated their original sound.\n\nAs pointed out by another reviewer it seems this album was made to outdo Metallica. Honestly this seems like the only way for Megadeth to have gained much traction. They came out in the middle of thrash revolution, the only bands who had definitive futures at this point were Exodus for practically inventing the genre and Metallica for putting it in a form that would reach global marketability. Megadeth had to prove themselves superior to their peers as well as get something that would make them unique. Add to this Dave was just kicked out of one of thrash's most successful bands at the time which made him a hard sell with producers and Metallica claimed to have kicked him out due to him being a drunk (nasty, nasty feud, glad its over), hearing that Kirk played Dave's riffs except faster on Kill Em All probably supported that rumor.\n\nSo that leaves Megadeth having to claim their place in the growing thrash scene and prove that they aren't headed by a talentless drunk. What better way then to outplay Metallica in every way. Faster songs, more aggressive and far more technical. Mission accomplished boys, your first album and you've already both outdone Metallica and made a classic. You've also kept it all within reason without out doing yourselves (some of their later material is too flashy and show offish to really work)\n\nThe only issues performance wise is vocals and chemistry. Dave gets the job done but he is not an amazing singer, he is emotive though, enough to spit out venom and fire in his performance. He simply cannot be replaced even if his vocals fall a bit flat here and there. The band don't completely mesh yet. It isn't a major problem but its a bit of rust on what would otherwise be a well oiled riff machine, they all fight for attention and to show off. The riffs are fast and calculated with a hint of professionalism. Like whirlwinds ripping their way through the ears of the ill prepared. The solos and rhythm sections too are fast and calculated, shredding technical pieces with a good level of melody added in.\n\nThe bass is more audible and utilized then is average. Generally bass just rounds out the sound and/or adds a backbone, here the bass player gets to show his chops, do some flashy stuff of his own. The drummer uses some jazz skills to great effect. I may be a total Metallica fanboy but Lars can suck a duck against this guy. He even manages to pound it out amongst all the technical aspects. The cover track isn't very strong, I'm not sure if it was just the remaster or not but it kept bleeping the 'walking' lyrics. It was obnoxious.\n\nStandout tracks: The Skull Beneath the Skin, Rattlehead and Mechanix\n",
        "\nMegadeth will always matter to me, no matter what. Even if I completely detach myself from the whole metal thing in general (which isn't wholly unrealistic), a part of me will always be loyal to Mustaine and Co. for being the one band that got me into metal music in the first place, and no matter how many twists, turns, scars and burns I've gone through from the mid 90s to now with regard to personal tastes they've always remained there, the top head on the musical totem pole. But it's not exactly blind hero worship; I've been awfully critical of the 'deth plenty of times, then and now, and if need be I can and will wag a finger or two at them for any questionable decisions they would undertake. And it was with that in mind that, when looking back at their 1992 breakthrough wrecking ball, I found not only their biggest album to date but, in my humble opinion, their most deplorable...\n\nAs history would denote, this ended up being a turning point for the band in a few different ways, not all of which are for the better. Made during in era in which Dave and crew tried their damnedest to go clean, \"Countdown...\" was their most tight and technically performed album up to this point. This resulted in a fine listen in its own right, as one can be able to discern actual notation and riffing schemes without needing a compass to cut through the chaos that came from their earlier, drug-fueled mayhem. The guitar work had a lot of sleek sharpness in both rhythm and lead work (albeit sounding somewhat dry in tone), the drumming was top notch and straightforward with no missteps, and Dave's vocals were some of the best he'd ever given us (actually learning how to be a vocalist will do that...), all of which came together in the cleanest possible production they could get at the time for a listen like no other.\n\nAnd the songs themselves? Well, I don't think I have to tell you. Every other track became a live staple for a reason, so it's not hard to pick any that don't definitively stand out; \"Symphony of Destruction\", \"Sweating Bullets\", \"Ashes in Your Mouth\", even the seemingly lesser-tier likes of \"Captive Honor\" and \"Foreclosure of a Dream\" given unto listeners the world over as much substance as they can/would allow. It really did seem like a new beginning for the band, the best possible example of maintaining your original sense of relevance while being able to snag in new, different listeners in the process.\n\nBut on the other hand, and I am quite loathe to say this despite all the positivity I've given it, this was really when the band seemed to lose their original burning spirit. Focus was diverted from making true, genuine works of bitter art to being the star of the show (admitted by Mr. Mustaine, no less...), and the recordings to follow suffered for it, yet none as badly as this. As a result, this is the one album of their entire discography I can claim to actually dislike. Yes, above \"Cryptic Writings\", \"The World Needs a Hero\" and even \"Risk\", for with those three I can accept what they are and find even a modicum of enjoyment. But in the end, with \"Countdown...\" there's just nothing here for me.\n\nMaybe it's the more than potently felt tonal/visionary shift, the decrease in chaotic heaviness and speed, the truncation of the songwriting, certain tracks on here I outright despise (I wish I could unhear the title track, I really do...), or maybe all of it, but I've never felt so detached from a record as badly as I do with this, where at times it feels like Megadeth were trying to pull themselves away from this listener as they ventured into parts unknown. And at the risk of somehow ducking the real reasons behind my personal angst, I can't exactly say what it is about it that really digs at me. There's something inexplicably wrong with this, some necessary yet ultimately invisible ingredient missing from the recipe, and as a result i just plain do not like this album. Not at all.\n\nIn the end this is, while a very competent affair, something I cannot bring myself to listen to again. If ever there was a face for a personal \"worst Megadeth album\", this would easily be it, and the one album of theirs that has since been deleted from my personal collection and history. But hey, at least the single live tracks aren't that bad...so there's that...\n",
        "\nOne of the more visible falls from grace in metal history undoubtedly has to be that of Megadeth. Everybody knows their history, everybody knows the relation to Metallica, everybody knows what I think of them (first five albums are great, Youthanasia is a decent hard rock album, everything else sucks), and everybody for the most part seems to agree. It's just generally accepted that Megadeth has been shit since at least 1992. It's really not even worth talking about, because it's all been talked to death. That's why I'm sitting here, rocking out to Rust in Peace, with a blank document on my computer screen. God dammit, I love their 1990 album more than almost everything, but it's so hard to review at this point. Everybody has the same opinion! Part of me wished they had at least one good album after Countdown to Extinction because then it'd at least make their career somewhat interesting instead of predictable and sad.\n\nBut BH! There is a good album in the last two thirds of their career! You're completely forgetting about Endgame!\n\n*sigh*\n\nNo I'm not. Endgame sucks, and you're all insane for not realizing it. Really, this album is just an exercise is the exact kind of subliminal manipulation that Dave spends so much time ironically shouting at the top of his lungs about. The only thing Endgame does well is order the tracklisting in such a way that you get tricked into thinking it's great. \n\nWhat do I mean? Well, ask anybody what their favorite song on this album is. 90% of the time it's \"This Day We Fight\", the other 10% says \"Headcrusher\". There's a reason for this, because they're positioned in such a way, surrounded by exactly the right amounts of boring, half hearted bullshit, that they managed to stand above the crowd. They're very good songs, the former of which is legitimately probably one of my top ten favorite Megadeth songs. It's just does everything right, it's the exact kind of violent aggression intertwined with masterful guitar playing that made Rust in Peace such a timeless classic. It never lets up, it starts with its foot on the gas and just plows through the listeners like zombies in a shopping mall. The chorus deserves special mention for being so bloody ear catching. The whole song is a rallying cry, a huge, pissed off anthem to remind everybody why Megadeth is a band worth listening to. \"Headcrusher\" is no different, with a pummeling main riff and ferocious vocal patterns that just emanate bile and fire. It's hard not to pump your fist and bang your head during \"DEEEEATH BY THE HEEEEEADCRUSHA\". Both of these songs are exactly what made the band so fucking good in the 80s (yes Rust in Peace is an 80s album, the 80s ended in 1992).\n\nBut here's the secret, they're the -only- two good songs on the entire album. It's so easy to miss because the beginning is so good that you find yourself just riding a high until \"Headcrusher\" comes in late, but it's true. You see, Dave, for all the cross eyed tongue waggling lunacy, really can manage to be smart sometimes. This is an example of his brilliance, because the beginning of the album emulates a previous classic in So Far, So Good, So What?, with \"Dialectic Chaos\" and \"This Day We Fight\" perfectly mirroring \"Into the Lungs of Hell\" and \"Set the World Afire\". The intro tracks are both hugely melodic and triumphant sounding shredfests, with only basic riffs being made up for with instantly memorable Van Halen leads and mindbending fretboard theatrics. The following songs are both big crowd rousing numbers with massive choruses and infectious-yet-punishing riffage. At this point, after you just sat through albums with such timeless classics as \"A Tout le Monde\", \"Of Mice and Men\" and \"Moto Psycho\", you'll hear that one-two punch of an introduction and promptly pass out due to all of the blood rushing to your reproductive organs. It's easy to forget that \"44 Minutes\" is the exact same awkward radio rock bullshit that plagued their 90s era, and it's forgivable to not notice that \"Bite the Hand that Feeds\" is almost a total rewrite of \"Skin O' My Teeth\" and \"Bodies\" is just \"Symphony of Destruction\" again. It's okay to immediately erase the embarassingly terrible half-ballad of \"The Hardest Part of Letting Go... Sealed with a Kiss\" from your memory because just as soon as you start wondering what the fuck it was, \"Headcrusher\" starts and makes you headbang yourself into a concussive state of amnesia.\n\nThat's really what makes up the entire album. Everything is either a blatant copying of a previous song that people already liked or it's just a new terrible idea that Dave has been unsuccessfully trying so fucking hard to make us like for a decade at the time of release. I mean let's be real here, who really enjoys the spoken word crap and tinfoil chewing nonsense that Dave spends half of the title track shouting about? Who really likes the awkward vocal cadences that have plagued the band ever since the early 90s? Who thought \"Captive Honour\" was so good that we needed to hear it again with a new title? I realize that a lot of the copied songs are songs from Countdown to Extinction, an album I openly enjoy the everloving shit out of despite its very obvious flaws. The difference really comes down to how fresh the songs feel, and Endgame just can't even compare outside of the two obvious songs. Countdown may have been an obvious attempt at cashing in on Metallica's new direction (and let's not pretend that \"This Day We Fight\" and \"Headcrusher\" aren't direct responses to the heavy throwback songs on Death Magnetic, but I really just can't bear to preach that obvious storyline any longer), but it was fun and exciting. \"The Right to Go Insane\" just feels like a reheated leftover, and \"1,320\" sounds like a paint-by-numbers how-to guide in regards to being just mediocre enough to carry the momentum that a previously great track can generate. Dave's snarl is just as lazy and tired as it has been for nearly two decades, excepting the two I keep namedropping. In fact, I'm really beginning to suspect that a different, better band actually wrote those two, because holy shit it just makes no sense that he can crap out those two masterpieces in the middle of an album full of rehashed speed rock in the middle of a streak of albums that range from hilariously bad to painfully mediocre. \n\nThere are just only so many times I can say the same thing, so I'll wrap it up here. \"This Day We Fight\" and \"Headcrusher\" are two phenomenal songs that absolutely deserve all the praise they've been getting, but the rest of the album contains nothing but bad reimaginings of better songs from their divisive transitional era. I'm aware that everybody's taste is different, and maybe the majority of people really do just think \"1,320\" is really just that much better than \"High Speed Dirt\", but personally I'll never buy it. Dave got a few things right by recognizing the best tracks and releasing one as a single and the other as the opening song, and also only focusing on politics for about half the songs instead of all of them. But that's it, everything else is just as bad as they've always been and I feel like I'm the one sober guy staring at the Emperor's naked asshole.\n\nOriginally written for Lair of the Bastard\n",
        "\nMegadeth's legacy needs no introduction. A band that put out such thrash classics as Rust In Peace and the immortal Peace Sells surely could not sink into an abyss of mediocre to crap albums, could they? Well, actually, they can. Megadeth proved it with their middle of the road commercial rock/dance attempt, Risk.\n\nIn 2004, Megadeth released The System Has Failed. This album was supposedly their comeback, and had initially been intended to be a solo album by Dave Mustaine. However, due to contract obligations, Megadeth had to reform to release this. Supposedly. In reality, all that happened was that Dave got together a group of session musicians including former Megadeth lead guitarist Chris Poland, and used them to release his solo project under the Megadeth banner.\n\nMusically, this album is a combination of all their previous body of work, taking some elements from each. It includes some thrash elements, although rarely, it includes the soaring choruses of the Youthanasia/Cryptic Writings era, and the commercial friendly structures of Risk. The resulting album is a 12 track, 48 minutes affair that is severely unbalanced and contains a number of glaring flaws.\n\nThe first would be the lack of riffs on display here. Megadeth are not a band known for slacking in the guitar department, so this should not have been tolerated. How can Dave go from writing shred-fests Good Mourning Black Friday and Poison Was The Cure to releasing 2-riff songs that follow the traditional verse-chorus structures that bore the fucking life out of the listener. \n\nThe main deviation from the verse-chorus format would be Blackmail The Universe, the opener. This has a number of slight changes in tempo, and a few nice riffs to propel it forward, with several well constructed solos to boot. This really is one of the best songs on the album, and is actually rather interesting to listen. However, this leads me into another one of the flaws of the album.\n\nThis song, and many of the others, are too fucking long. Knock a minute off some of them, or, in the case of a couple of songs, knock two minutes off, and they would be fine. The riffs would not get tiring, the song overall would not feel like a marathon to get through. The songs that would benefit from this are Blackmail the Universe, The Scorpion, Tears In A Vial, Something That I'm Not and Truth Be Told. The only song that is over 4 minutes that manages to make full use of that time is Of Mice And Men.\n\nOf Mice And Men is my personal highlight of the album. It is a good song, i enjoy the vocals greatly from Dave Mustaine, and it never sounds forced. However, on this song it is the lyrics that make it as good as it is. The lyrics deal with Dave Mustaine's faults to date, and are emotionally written. His voice complements these lyrics perfectly. There is literally nothing wrong with this song in my opinion.\n\nI Know Jack is a song that should just have been plain cut from this album. At 40 seconds long, with no real vocals to it, just some drumming and one long solo, it is nothing more than a distraction from the album as a whole. This song is a poor attempt to display Megadeth's shredding power alone, instead of using the whole band to full effect. Endgame would later prove that a wankery session could take place in Dialectic Chaos, without resorting to being grindcore length.\n\nThe real problem with this album becomes apparent after around five tracks. The band is trying too hard. This is one of the real problems with The World Needs A Hero as well, and they failed to fix it on here. Both albums show a band known for their ingenious thrash attempts that had dropped off the radar with mediocre releases, that just wanted to return to that style and mimic it. And they both fail. The System Has Failed really has got some great moments on it, but they are underpinned by the fact that much of the album just reeks of them trying too fucking hard.\n\nOverall, this is probably tied with Risk as my least favorite Megadeth album. However, it is not utterly abysmal. In fact, there are four great tracks, Blackmail The Universe, Of Mice and Men Kick The Chair and Die Dead Enough. But the ratio of good to great songs is far too one-sided for this to be considered a good Megadeth album. Megadeth are a band that it is impossible to accept mediocrity from, and this album just shows why.\n",
        "\nFew if any albums have left a legacy on the level of Megadeth's Rust in Peace. It is that one popular thrash album you don't have to be ashamed to admit loving in front of your hardcore metal-head friends. It's perfection 100% and I don't know a single metal-head who isn't in love with it. Song after song it shows how great Mustaine and crew really are.\n\nThere isn't a single bad track here, not a single song I want to ever skip. All the songs are both catchy, but truly metal. The solos are among the best ever written, especially Tornado of Souls. Plus, it's an album that works as both background noise and aa a deep listen, which makes it \"adaptable\" to how one wishes to listen on a particular day. It really shows how Megadeth had perfected their craft.\n\nLets start with the musicianship, and it is abundant here. All the members are great at their instrument of choice, and all their ability is used here. Some tracks like Hangar 18 show this more than others, but they all have a technical edge to them. Nick Menza's drumming is powerful yet complex, like a mix of Dave Grohl and Neil Peart. Mustaine, while not the best, is more than competent at guitar and his vocals are unique, and something I've grown to really love. Dave Ellefson is the least talented member, but he still knows his way around a bass and Megadeth wouldn't be the same without him. Marty Friedman... well Marty is God. No one has his ability to merge soul and technicality in such a perfect way. \n\nThe mix here is awesome. It is well balanced and super clean. The instruments are sharp and crisp, just the way Mustaine intended them to be. When Megadeth gets technical, this allows ever little detail to be heard, and its really something to behold. The mix on this album is among the best in metal ever, which this album needs to succeed.\n",
        "\nThis album is generally seen as a classic of the thrash metal genre, and a pinnacle of Megadeth's career. While there are undoubtedly some serious high points here, this is an extremely inconsistent record.\n\nHalf of the album is great thrash/speed metal, with very tight riffage, a good sense of dynamics and huge hooks everywhere you look [the chorus of \u201cRust In Peace... Polaris\u201d will remain in your head for weeks]. The musicianship and technical ability on offer are of a very high standard \u2013 the whole band sounds ferociously tight, disciplined and on top of their game, perhaps best showcased on \u201cHangar 18\u201d where the second half of the song is given over to Mustaine and Friedman trading guitar solos back and forth. The lyrics are also quite entertaining, even though they just go over some of the standard Mustaine topics of warfare, Armageddon, and conspiracy theories, there are some memorable lines in there [\u201cMilitary intelligence/Two words combined that don\u2019t make sense\u201d]. Mustaine\u2019s vocals are quite good and more even in quality than on his earlier output, which makes the album sound somewhat slicker than usual for Megadeth.\n\nThe strongest bits of the album are at the beginning, especially the opener \u201cHoly Wars... The Punishment Due\u201d which to this day remains Megadeth\u2019s finest composition and is the perfect way to open the album. Given the strength of this song and the one after it, the listener might think that they are in for a treat \u2013 but here is where the album falls flat on its face. The middle of the record is dead in the water. Not one of the songs after \u201cHangar 18\u201d has anything like the huge hooks, the catchy choruses, the sense of melody or the memorable riffs that make the rest of the album so good. The one possible exception is \"Five Magics\" which has an interesting breakdown halfway through that provides some interest, but the rest of the time these songs just pass by aimlessly. They sound sterile, flat, and very forced. Thrashing away, certainly, but thrashing away just for the sake of it, not to produce an interesting result. The middle section of the album just leaves no impression on the listener. It is, quite frankly, a blessed relief when \u201cTornado Of Souls\u201d eventually bursts into life \u2013 finally, an actual proper chorus! A hook! Interesting riffs! Sadly, it\u2019s too little too late to save the record.\n\nThis is a very strange album - one that excites tremendously for the first two songs, and entertains for the closing tracks, but in between completely falls flat and becomes lifeless. It cannot seriously be cited as the high point of Megadeth's career - the inconsistency is too much to tolerate. A possible comparison would be Judas Priest's Point Of Entry album, another record with stupendous highs but also some baffling sections of filler. However the contrast on Rust In Peace, because of the way the highpoints bookend a sea of mediocre songwriting and dull riffage, is even starker. The album doesn't just sag in the middle, it falls away completely. Overall, the first two songs alone validate the price of admission, and the performances throughout are extremely good, but this album is by no means the high water mark it's so often made out to be. Megadeth have produced far more consistent records than this. Worth a purchase, but preferably cheap.\n",
        "\nThis is a pretty well-executed album. None of these songs are really bad, and the band does a good job on their instruments. The problem is that the music ends up sounding similar and seldom very exciting. There are a few excellent songs on here, but there's also some less than ideal songs. To go along with this, when a song fails it makes the rest of the music more repetitive. The production is also partially at fault.\n\nThe production on this album is technically good. I would be surprised if this wasn't completely state of the art when this came out. The problem is that it's very dry and mechanical. Some bands make this work, but most don't. It essentially makes the whole album sound processed, like this was crafted in a boardroom meeting or something. This is possibly the most negative atmosphere I've ever heard, and most songs are dragged down by it. Credit where it's due, the instruments and vocals are mixed pretty well. This wasn't done cheaply, but neither really were the last two. You could pretty much hear everything on the last two as well, without this cold feeling. Ditto on the remaster for Peace Sells.\n\nAs to the more repetitive aspect, most of this album spends its time in the same pace. None of this is very fast, but very little of this is slow either. It's pretty much all mid-paced, but without the mayhem. This means that when a song fails, your attention turns to what goes into the song itself. By the second or third failure, you start to realize how similar the music is to each other. On Rust, you didn't have this problem. For one, there was more variety contained, and for two, it was mostly excellent. This really isn't particularly gripping music. The soloing is still technical, but even the riffing feels samey. There also isn't near the anger or passion present on some of the earlier material.\n\nAs to the song quality, most are alright at least. I'm partial to Aggression, My Life, and Psychotron, but there's some other songs of close or similar quality. The songs I'm much less fond of are Skin and Sweating, but they aren't particularly bad. This is an odd album in the sense that what you enjoy isn't going to be consistent. The songs are all pretty similar, with very little distinguishing between them. I wouldn't recommend hearing this all at once, as the similarity is odd the first time. I would suggest hearing this in pieces the first time around in order to notice the differences.\n\nThe playing itself is pretty good. Friedman is still very technical and catchy with his soloing. The riffing is more samey than it has ever been. This is a far cry from the variety seen on the earlier albums. Mustaine's vocals aren't helped by the improved production. The increased clarity and slowing down of the music, has intensified the effect of his vocals, and not for the better. The bass is more prominent, but he doesn't do any more than he usually does. I really don't even think he's more audible, it's just that the guitars don't sound as different from the guitars as they have in the past. The very mechanical feel means that everything sounds somewhat bassy. The drumming is not really special. Menza doesn't hit it as hard as usual, so instead he leans on his technical acumen. The problem is that his fills just aren't that creative. I think most of his fills were pretty stock in the 70's, let alone early 90's.\n\nFor all these flaws, it's still a good album. This is probably the peak of Mustaine's lyrical acumen, which mostly alleviates his vocal problem. Aggression is legitimately interesting from a certain angle. It's not insightful, but it's pretty good as a statement of the times. The soloing is still very good, as good as could be found at the time. This is probably the third best Megadeth ever did, so it is worth a listen. This is more a heavy than thrash album, but I'd recommend both try it. Each individual can sort out which songs they like the most, and then they can rip those songs.\n",
        "\nFor my taste, this is the greatest thrash album of all time. This might seem bizarre to some, but this is the one that registers with me the most. Peace Sells is also the album that got me into Megadeth. This has great riffs, an excellent vibe, very good instrumentation, and good lyrics.\n\nThis is a great collection of riffs, probably Mustaine's best. Some have stated that the previous album had a greater variety of riffs, but I'm uncertain. Even if it did, there are more great riffs on this than Killing. Compared to Rust In Peace, these riffs are of a very different nature. Those riffs were of a very technical variety. These riffs thrive off a frantic feel. On songs like the Conjuring, song that got me into the band, the riffing has this intense feel as though they could lose control at any moment. Usually the technical variety would do more for me, but I prefer the frantic on here. Most of these are written by Mustaine, but that's pretty much how Megadeth worked back then.\n\nNormally a one-man band like that would get on my nerves, but it is to Mustaine's eternal credit that he didn't demand the spotlight. He gathered talented musicians around him, and he gave them plenty of breathing room. The solos on here are quite good, and I can more easily distinguish between the two. Poland has an interesting style, jazz adapted to metal. It's common for a rhythm section to do that, but not a guitar. As far as I know, there's Iommi, Poland, and Skolnick. I enjoy various amounts by all these guys, and I will say that Poland's jazz-fusion is very interesting in its own right. Gar is also from a fusion background, but it's not as obvious here as it was on the debut. Don't mistake me, his performance on here is still pretty good, but it's a little simpler than what it was. Dave's bass is very audible on here. If you can't hear him, you're not listening. Aside from his classic intro, he has some very good parts on Devil's Island and Black Friday. In general, I'd actually argue that this is his best performance. He might have grown in technique later on, but this is his most enjoyable.\n\nThere is still some of the dirtiness found on the debut, but it works better here. The lyrics aren't of the political nature that he would become known for, but they're more serious than the debut. They possess an underlying sense of social discontent, and this is helped by the grimy production and atmosphere. This would be where the punk influence comes in, as much of this was par for the course in punk a mere few years prior. Mustaine's vocals as well likely have punk origins. I could also draw a parallel to Killers, as a punk-informed metal album, and much like that album there are several songs dealing with the streets. Taken as a whole, the vibe is a very aggressive, punky look at the world. \n\nMentioning influences, this album is as diverse as the previous reviewers have claimed. Some early Maiden is evident on Last Words, Mustaine's vocal delivery hearkens to Henry Rollins, AC/DC influence is detectable from place to place, aspects of the instrumentation retain its fusion origins, and there's some Priest and Sabbath tossed in for good measure. For most bands, this would be a horrific mishmash. On this album, they make it work quite well and consistently. Even the weak song on here, the blues cover, ends up being quite fun and worth hearing.\n\nThere is not a thrash album I enjoy more than this one, only one or two even come that close. As far as metal as a whole goes, this is still easily top five. I would honestly say that this is near mandatory to anyone who enjoys any form of metal. Even if punk or hard-rock are more to your liking, there is enough influence visible that the overall quality could push it over for you.\n",
        "\nProduction goes a long way in music, regardless of what people say to the contrary. To be honest, the music itself is only slightly superior to that of the debut. Most likely, the technical aspect is actually lower. Having said all of this, the combination of better production and songwriting is enough in the end to give it a twelve point advantage.\n\nThe best points of this album would start with the production. I think this is the first Megadeth album where the remaster isn't necessary. Most of what is worth hearing is fairly intelligible the first time around. The next would have to be the songwriting. This isn't brilliant, but the better songs on here are worthy of having been written by Mustaine. I have to say the song 502 has always appealed to me. Coming from a small time where people often act out of boredom, this registers with me on a personal level. I also enjoy the riffing on Lungs. Most metal instrumentals strike me as a waste of time, but this carries itself quite nicely. \n\nThe bass is very audible, but he doesn't seem to do as much of interest on this album, as on Peace Sells. The guitar work isn't bad, but it's a step below the previous album, and a little more than that below the succeeding album. Mustaine's rhythms are mostly good, but on songs like the cover and Mary Jane, it goes limp. The soloing is also somewhat below par. Poland and Friedman each brought talent and unique aspects of their talent to bear, while Jeff Young may as well not be there. The same can be said of Chuck, who lacks both Gar's jazzy technique and Nick's power. Set the World Afire is an example of a song that I think could have been a pretty good song with better all-around instrumentation. After a while, it just starts to drag. Friedman's playing, for example, would have sufficed to keep it from drooping so badly. Some people have attributed an angry feel to this album, but I'm unconvinced. Hook in Mouth, good song, is the only really aggressive song on here, and it's the very last one.\n\nA weak point of this album is really how much Mustaine predominates. I'm a person who doesn't enjoy Van Halen, and part of it is just how much one man drives it. Most music, to me, can't function this way. Ellefson isn't contributing as much as he later would, and the others added nothing. Yes, he had driven the previous album, but he still had quality musicians to feed off of. This feels like he drained himself to exhaustion. The cover was a poor idea on Mustaine's part, even if it was to honor a legend. Mary Jane also really goes nowhere. Good Morning turned into Black Friday, this just continued to suck for four minutes.\n\nI'd say I'm looking at Megadeth's fourth best album, yeah I do believe Countdown is better. Compared to the debut, it has a similar number of awful songs, but it has one extra good one. The production also isn't killing the weaker ones like it did on the debut. Similar to my debut suggestion, I'd advise taking the top four songs and just forgetting the rest.\n",
        "\nThis has some really good songs, but it also has some much weaker songs. The production is bad even on the remaster, and it adds to the general sloppy vibe. This is the first line-up for Megadeth, and though it made a masterpiece later, this is just mediocre as a full listen.\n\nI'll start with the positive. The first few songs are very good, and would have felt fine on their succeeding masterstroke. Supposedly, Mustaine's guitar rhythms were very different from what was normal at that time. I can't say for sure, but I will say that most of them are quite good and varied. The opening riff to Looking Down the Cross is amongst my favorites by them. The drumming is the last positive I will name. His jazzy style is very enjoyable for me, and I find the sloppy nature of the production only enhances his creativity.\n\nNext, the neutral. Mustaine employs his snarl here, but it's different than it would be later. He's younger, so his voice is higher pitched than it was even on the follow-up. As well, he has a drunken character to his voice. It's not bad, and it fits the the sloppy nature of the songs, but it's not really good either. He doesn't seem to use the different voices he became known for, as these are all relatively samey. His lyrics don't have the focus of some of his later works. This has no cynical outlook on society or government, and one of them's about a bunny, but most are ok. The solos aren't what they would later be, but they're alright. I can't easily tell who is soloing when, but it doesn't matter too much. While the bass isn't as audible or interesting as he would later be, he's still easier for me to hear than most bassists. \n\nNow, the negatives. For one, the production is abysmal. The original is almost as bad as Reek, which says quite a bit. Even the remaster is worse than any album they would do later. I'm rather impressed by how people could even tell if the riffing was ahead of it's time. The next problem is how quickly the album falls off. Nothing after track three is even above-average. The cover and The Mechanix are just godawful. I get why hardcore Megadeth fans will defend this song, but if wasn't for the Four Horseman, Mustaine himself probably wouldn't have bothered with this song. As I alluded to earlier, the lyrics are also pretty bad on a couple of songs, which combined with occasionally loud vocals, can make for an unpleasant listen. Toss in that the album is short to begin with, and this should have just been an EP.\n\nSomeone could complain that I'm not being fair considering the rating I gave to Metal Church. It's true that album has a big quality dip as well, but that was distinctly different. That had two metal classics to kick it off, and then it was followed by average to a little above songs. Nothing on there, save possibly the ballad, was bad. This has three good to very good songs, followed by five mostly below-average ones. Whatever could have happened to make these later songs passable didn't. What score it does get is due to those first three and some scattered riffs that are good on their own. I would recommend a thrash fan ripping the first three songs, and pretending that this was a short EP.\n",
        "\nI really fucking hate this album. Megadeth apparently decided after Endgame that they liked Disturbed and other mainstream metal mag-friendly acts better than actually creating good music. I\u2019m not one of those people addicted to speedy, balls out thrashing, but if you\u2019re going to sell out and write something as radio-friendly and pandering as Th1rt3en, the least you could do is not release it at all and keep it in your bedroom garbage can where it belongs.\n\nThis is a highly dubious album full of groovy riffs and catchy choruses with a definite angle pointed at the mainstream. There\u2019s nothing wrong with that in concept, except for the fact that Megadeth can\u2019t seem to pull it off well at all. The style here is notably more restrained and laid back than the aggressively tinged Endgame, with much more of a rock styling, and Dave\u2019s gravelly, strained vocal constipation behind the mic goes from \u2018distracting\u2019 as it is on most latter-day Megadeth albums to outright unlistenable pretty much all the time on this. When he tries to sing the catchy hooks on the midpaced tunes which make up most of this album, it literally sounds so bad it makes me want to turn it off. The balladic opening of \u201cMillennium of the Blind,\u201d where he sings A Capella save for a few misty-eyed acoustics, is absolute ear cancer. I seriously don\u2019t know who told Dave it would be a good idea to try something like this, but safe to say I will not be buying the inevitable \u201cDave Does Karaoke\u201d album when it comes out after that person does some more of their devil\u2019s work on his creative processes. I\u2019d rather listen to Kermit the Frog trying to sing \u201cBohemian Rhapsody\u201d over and over again, all day, than listen to even one more note of THIS song again.\n\nThe guitar work is mostly turgid groove riffs and foot-tapping rhythms that are inoffensive at best \u2013 while it\u2019s obvious the band is tight and has chops, the songwriting is strictly pedestrian and phoned-in. Every musical decision here feels ancillary to the album\u2019s main goal of just getting each song over with as fast as possible \u2013 the riff progressions are so generic they could be from any band and the songs are all structured in very similar, basic ways \u2013 always around the very trite, played out harmonized choruses. The choruses all pretty much sound the same, too, lending an extra degree of facelessness to an album that could already be a skinned victim of Leatherface out in the woods. By track two, you\u2019ll have heard everything the album has to offer \u2013 while \u201cPublic Enemy No. 1\u201d is a song not even worth dragging out of the underbelly of a sewer, it is at least better than the following musical excrement droppings simply by virtue of coming before them in the track listing. You know it\u2019s a bad album when that\u2019s the only differentiation between songs.\n\nThere are only a few \u201cbright\u201d spots here, and even then only in relation to the fact that the multitude of awful songs is SO unpleasant that even the simply acceptable moments sound better by comparison. \u201cFast Lane\u201d isn\u2019t a bad tune, mostly saved by way of its fairly killer guitar break near the end \u2013 but really calling it a good song is kind of damning this album with faint praise. Yeah, you\u2019re a 30-year-old band that can manage to write a dumb rock song about cars. Halle-fucking-lujah. Do you want an award for that? It\u2019s kind of like applauding a movie because the director remembered to turn the camera on. \u201cNever Dead\u201d manages to drag its ass off the floor long enough to show that the band still has a pulse at all. And the title track isn\u2019t too bad, though it goes on too long.\n\nThat\u2019s really about it. The rest of the shit on here ranges from forgettable like \u201cWrecker\u201d and the Guitar Hero-bait opener \u201cSudden Death\u201d to unlistenable dreck like the awful \u201cWhose Life (Is it Anyway?),\u201d the vomit-worthy \u201cWe the People\u201d and the hillbilly-rock enema that is \u201cDeadly Nightshade.\u201d All of these songs pretty much sound the same, as I\u2019ve said \u2013 groovy, puerile riffing, annoying mainstream-ish choruses \u2013 but I feel the need to point them out anyway just to drive the stake deeper into this album\u2019s black void where a heart should be.\n\nOf special note is the track \u201cGuns, Money and Drugs,\u201d which is a sort of thematic track about Mexican drug cartels, except it\u2019s got no real ambiance or atmosphere and nothing to distinguish it from the other turds on here. It just points out how utterly soulless this all is \u2013 they\u2019re just going through the motions. Songs about death, vaguely \u2018badass\u2019 topics, cars and \u2013 Dave\u2019s favorite \u2013 politics, are all touched on in the most rote and unexciting ways, with no imagination or real point of view. I guess you could say he has some direction with the political shit, but then again, I don\u2019t really need to hear a born-again Christian right wing nut job preaching to me when I listen to rock music. You know what you\u2019re getting into with a Megadeth album \u2013 though that just means anyone with sense needs to stay away.\n\nMostly this is just worthlessly commercially-minded, without a sincere bone in its body. If you\u2019re a fan at all of real metal, the smugly self-satisfied attitude this album exudes in spades will disgust you, as there is no real genuine emotion here \u2013 certainly none of the primal anger Megadeth used to have in the 80s. When a band is young and free-spirited, writing exuberantly stupid anthems to cars and drugs, it\u2019s cool. When guys in their 40s are writing those same songs, it\u2019s one of two things \u2013 either the band is desperately out of touch about their own age and going through a midlife crisis, or they\u2019re just phoning it in for a paycheck.\n\nI think this is a bit of both, actually.\n\nIt\u2019s just so obvious to me that everything on this album was made solely to sell records and move units. There\u2019s a big sense of pandering to this \u2013 it sounds like every decision the band makes here is just trying to check boxes to appeal to long haired burnout bums who throw up the horns every time a Lamb of God song or something off of God Hates Us All comes on the radio. The technically competent but soulless guitar riffing patterns, the slick radio-friendly choruses, the rockish tempos not aggressive or nuanced enough to appeal to thrash fans, but more than loud and raucous enough to land this album a place next to Nickelback and Disturbed on a modern rock fan\u2019s music shelf \u2013 it\u2019s focus-group rock without any real identity to it. Don\u2019t get me wrong, if you like this kind of shit, don\u2019t let me stop you \u2013 but albums like Th1rt3en are the opposite of artistry in music. It\u2019s plastic, manufactured metal with every little iota of spontaneity or mystique siphoned out like the genre was given a back-alley liposuction.\n",
        "\nWhen I heard Super Collider for the first time, I will admit that my expectations were a bit lower for the overall album, but that all changed after a few open-minded listens.\n\nSuper Collider is much more of a throwback to more hard rock geared Megadeth albums\n(Cryptic Writings is they main one that comes to mind), than more recent Megadeth offerings. The song opens up with a brief guitar solo which leads into the main verse of the song. The main verse, while nothing spectacular, flows very smoothly into a chorus, which is so catchy it has been stuck in my head for weeks after listening to this song. After the chorus comes a nice pulled back solo before going back to the repeated verse and chorus once more.\n\nThis brings me to my main problem with this song: the repetitiveness. Even though much of this track is catchy, the verse and chorus really don't do much for me the umpteenth time after the main guitar solo. \n\nNow I feel it is time to discuss the production of the track. The instruments all blend perfectly together: The guitars are super tight, and while very audible, do not overpower the other instruments( Chris Broderick has some tasty solos within this track we haven't heard for quite a while).The bass is very audible as well and has a very thick tone as it plays a very catchy lick throughout the entire song. The drums are crisp and clear, and while drover never pulls off anything spectacular, he gets the job done and gives the song a nice rhythm. Now it's time to discuss the elephant in the room: the vocals. The first few times listening to this track, they seemed a bit strained. However after a few listens, I don't even notice the mediocrity of the vocals. They simply get the job done.\n\nOverall, Super Collider is a great track which shows the strengths of the more commercial side of Megadeth, and while it has a few noticeable flaws, it is a welcome break from the constant need to write \"thrash\".\n",
        "\nI had the highest expectations for this album, first off David Ellefson had finally returned to the band and this was his first album back with the band since \"The World Needs A Hero\". Second, I thought Megadeth was out of creative juice until they pulled a treat like \"Endgame\" out, so i had high expectations that they were gonna get back on the right track. But even before they actually released the album i was already disappointed, seeing that when the band revealed he song names i had already heard a large amount of the songs in the first place.\n\nTo start off, the first song on the album \"Sudden Death\", had already appeared on Guitar Hero so i was somewhat familiar with song even though they did a great job rerecording it for the record. Second, the 7th track on the album \"New World Order\" had been a demo song floating around for a while which was on the remastering of \"Youthanasia\" as a bonus track, but then again the did another great rerecording of the song. Now 3rd, the song \"Black Swan\" which is the 9th track on the album had already appeared on the Japanese version of \"United Abominations\" which turned out good but then again it was nothing new. Now last is another demo song which also appeared on the remastering of \"Youthanasia\" and that is \"Millennium of the Blind\". However they really gave the song a makeover, moving the intro towards the end of the song and then adding now verses and its own chorus (where now Dave makes it yet another political song). So to sum things up, by the time i actually received the album there were only 6 songs i hadn't hear yet because of the songs i just mentioned and the fact that \"Public Enemy No. 1\" and \"Never Dead\" had already been revealed. But the good thing of this, all those songs were great, they were nothing less of thrash with some killer riffs to add to it. My personal favorites were \"Sudden Death\" and \"Never Dead\" because of the great soloing, killer production, and overall song writing.\n\nNow to talk about the 6 songs i didn't hear yet when i got the album. First off \"Whose Life (is it Anyways?)\" is an overall okay song, the lyrics are cheesy for Megadeth as well as the intro to the song as well. In fact most of these songs are cheesy for example the chorus to \"Guns, Drugs & Money\", it is such a simple, poorly written chorus and for me it ruins the whole song, the pre chorus however in this song is much better than the actually chorus itself! Other songs too like \"Wrecker\" just make me cringe listening to it, anytime Mustaine goes near a love song or talking about women i cringe. The whole song is a about how a woman or having a wife will wreck everything you own, the whole song is pointless. \"Deadly Nightshade\" is a pretty good overall song, the overall riff through the song is good, even though the song sounds more Mettalica based than Megadeth. \n\nNow the title track on this album was okay as well, the beginning of the song (especially right at the start with the acoustic) had me cringing from Dave's vocals, to the lyrics as well. But the song picks up and has some decent riffs that come out of it, so overall the song wasn't bad nor good. \"We the People\" was a good song overall, fun and catchy but didn't rock my socks off. The last song i haven't mentioned makes me sick thinking about it, i would of given this album a better review if this song wouldn't of soiled the album. And that song is of course \"Fast Lane\", a total abomination of a song, from the brain dead 12 year old lyrics, to the mediocre rushed song writing on all instruments in the band. The whole song just screams rushed, it is a horrible filler written last minute with one of the most disgusting choruses ever spawned. Just take this part of the song: \"Fast lane, like a jet plane Like a freight train, I\u2019m driving insane\", that whole snippet of the chorus shows the careless rhyme scheme that was written, absolute garbage.\n\nMy conclusion however is still more of a positive one. No, it didn't keep the momentum of \"Endgame\" going, and yes i heard a large amount of the songs before hand, i was still entertained by it and absolutely loved several songs on the album like \"Sudden Death\", \"Never Dead\" or \"Millennium of the Blind\". I wouldn't however say this is a solid album however because it does have its pot holes, but it does however have its good moments so ill leave the review at that.\n\n-Fozzyogoody\n",
        "\nDave Mustaine and co. may have become a joke, or even worse, as of late. Some may say fans such as myself are living off nostalgia and days gone by more so than a bright, musical future. If you say this, you wouldn't be wrong. Megadeth's best musical days are almost certainly in their rearview mirrror, and the pumped out dross that has become commonplace for them, (Super Collider, Risk, etc), is not surprising for a band 30 years into their career. But for the time, \"Rust In Peace\" is and will always be an absolute landmark metal album. Countless accolades have accosted this album in the 24 years since it was first released, as have a fair number of dejectors. As a stand alone thrash metal album, it's head and shoulders above most if not all of the thrash released at the turn of the decade. With the addition of virtuouso Marty Friedman, this album is absolutely one you must hear before you die.\n\n\nThe guitar work on this album is among the best in metal history, with so many classic riffs spread across the nine tracks. \"Holy Wars\", \"Tornado of Souls\", \"Hangar 18\", and \"Rust In Peace...Polaris\", are absolute benchmark thrash metal tracks, with their legacy attesting to that. Marty Friedman was in the band for nearly a decade, yet still, his best work with Megadeth is on this album. Mustaine's rhythm guitar is essential to the driving, searing feeling these riffs give off, as the near constant strike of the riff is unceasing. \n\n\nThe obvious political and social overtones are not lost on the listener, as five world leaders are sat behind some sort of alien testing device. Megadeth is at their best when writing songs that are snarkily denoting higher superiority, be it world leaders or contemporaries. The common theme of \"Rust In Peace\" is akin to that of \"Peace Sells\", clearly stating that the world is headed toward a nuclear tumble, and we would all rust in peace if the leaders of this planet didn't stop doing what they were. Dave Mustaine, now much more eccentric and controversial in his beliefs, was always heavily interested in politics and government, and at his prime this worked amazingly well to his advantage. Even as far as \"Endgame\", which is arguably their best album of the post-1994 era. The songs are catchy, nasty, and have a message. That's what makes a good song.\n\n\nIn summation, \"Rust In Peace\" is almost always mentioned as an absolute classic, almost ad nauseam. If subjectivity in listening is such a thing, my views on this album may be slightly more biased as it opened the floodgates of heavy metal for me. I remember purchasing the CD as a naive 16 year old, and realizing two tracks in this was by far one of the greatest things I had ever heard. If more people than me can have an experience like that from this very album, than my deduction that it's as classic and timeless as it is certainly stands.\n",
        "\nMegadeth, alongside many of the other big name thrash metal bands, began to move away from their signature sounds in the 90s to more accessible traditional rock and metal styles. Their songs slowed down, their guitars were downtuned, and the new direction created a division amongst critics and fans alike. Youthanasia was Megadeth's second album to display such a shift in direction, following Countdown to Extinction, which contained simplified song structures and slower songs. Youthanasia, therefore is the next stage in the hard rock-influenced direction the band was taking. The most surprising thing about this album, however, is how well this musical style is executed. Metallica, for instance, released two albums full of hard rock in 1996 and 1997 that each lasted nearly 80 minutes, and many listeners turned their backs on the band due to the drastic change in sound and a lack of \"metal\". Those albums had a considerable amount of excess. Youthanasia, on the other hand (which actually came first) had much less excess and mostly powerful, hard-hitting memorable music and retained a heavy metal style. No messing around with 6-10 minute songs with long-winded jamming to be found here. Just pure straight heavy music.\n\nI consider Youthanasia to be my favourite Megadeth album and harbour no shame in admitting it. The songs still pack as much of a punch as anything else the band had previously released, and there are several seriously crunching riffs to be cherished. The drumming is more simple than on Countdown, but it works very well with the rest of the music. Although I say the direction is hard-rock influenced, it still feels very much like a great heavy metal album. There are songs that still remind you of the band's 80's thrash output, such as \"The Killing Road\" and \"Victory\" (which is full of references to Megadeth's past songs), but certainly don't feel out of place with the rest of the album. \n\nLike all good hard rock, there are a lot of memorable melodic riffs on Youthanasia. The choruses, in particular, demonstrate Dave Mustaine's ear for a good melody. Highlights in this department include the choruses to \"Reckoning Day\" and \"Addicted to Chaos\". And then, of course, you have the beautiful \"A Tout Le Monde\", a surprisingly thoughtful song from a band that was infamous for their attitudes and heavy drug use, which concerns an individuals last words they wish to speak to their loved ones to serve as a worthy send-off (and may I say the original version found here is far superior to the 2007 re-recording with Christina Scabbia). Metal bands that are brutally heavy but still have a great ear for melody are usually the best bands. Megadeth fits into this category.\n\nDave Mustaine has always been rather outspoken on his political and religious views. The subject matter of this album is often serious, touching upon that territory and covering real life issues Mustaine has observed. The album cover and title track, in particular, were inspired by the decline of children's well being, as well as drugs and crime, things that Mustaine himself has dabbled in and is more than familiar with. \"Family Tree\" is also a good example, as it seems to be about incest. Its chorus is therefore particularly haunting, with Mustaine singing \"Let me show you, how I love you, it's our secret, you and me\". The music on much of the album, especially the second half, carries the atmosphere of a constant struggle.\n\nIt's a surprise to think that Dave Mustaine's desire for a no.1 album at least partially influenced the sound on Youthanasia, because, there seems to be little sacrifice in heaviness, particularly riff-wise, and even little sacrifice in the strength of the songs themselves, both musically and lyrically. The album is definitely a self-reflection as well as a reflection on world issues and addictions. The fact that I actually prefer this album to Countdown to Extinction is probably a testament to how good it is. These days, the album is probably seen as less of a mis-step than perhaps it was before. As of this writing, Megadeth plan to play the album live in its entirety, which should be a treat for anyone lucky enough to go to a show. Youthanasia is a must buy and is up there with Megadeth's best work.\n",
        "\nIf Megadeth ever had an album as bad as Metallica's \"Lulu,\" then this is it. \"Super Collider\" has got to be the lowest Megadeth has ever gone. Just when we thought \"Risk\" was a steaming pile of shit, this album is a truckload of it. Not only is the sound cheesy and bland but it also made me (I can't speak for everyone, only for myself) cringe. It literally sounds like a terrible alternative album that you would hear on the radio and a shitty dive bar somewhere.\n\nLet me break it down for those who haven't experienced listening to this album: you're definitely not missing out. While this album triumphs over Metallica's recent failed abortion, it's not much better. Mustaine's voice is dry and faded out, the lyrics are a hit or miss depending on the song and the music simply does not peak my interest enough to keep going. It's one of those albums where you get tired of listening after a few songs and then switch to something else. It sounds as if the band were playing what the producers wanted them to play instead of actually playing what the fans wanted (ie. \"Rust in Peace,\" \"Peace Sells...But Who's Buying?\" etc.). The creative edge isn't very impressive either, everything is very half baked and thrown together in a massive clutter. Needless to say, this album is disappointing by a long shot.\n\nI'm not going to entirely shit on this album though, there are some good things. Mustaine is a well-respected musician in the metal world, mainly for his amazing playing style and he really let that flow on this album. There's some solos that really made me have some hope for the album, sadly that was short-lived due to everything else such as the shitty execution of lyrics, riffs and creativity. They had so much potential with their previous releases, \"Endgame\" and \"Th1rte3n,\" that we were expecting something really good to come our way this year. Sadly, it's just one of those moments where even the legendary Megadeth couldn't deliver.\n\nLike I said earlier, you're not missing out on this album. It's literally nothing but a shitty dive bar soundtrack or one of those albums you listen to on a road trip. It just didn't make the cut and the band have a lot of thinking to do and should really give this album a look, hopefully they will make something new and improved in the years to come. It lacks in a whole lot of things, in fact everything. However, if you're a die hard Megadeth fan and want to buy this, regardless of it's rating, then more power to you. It's your money and you spend it the way you want it...however this album is just a waste of time, effort and money. This album is easily the worst of 2013.\n",
        "\nSuper Collider is not all that bad. It's an album that sees the band trying something a little different, and they should be praised for that. This album may have flaws here and there but some people are going way overboard with the negativity. People ask \"why couldn't they just write another Endgame or Thirteen?\" because, well, some bands just don't like writing the same album over and over again! And this includes Megadeth, and that should be appreciated, because, if they did write the same album it would be boring for them, and as a result, boring for us. We'd soon be picking up on the band's lack of passion.\n\nOne thing that plays a big part in the change of sound for me is the down tuned guitars. The reason for this is to support Dave Mustaine's ageing voice; the guy had been struggling to hit the high notes he could hit more easily before. But, as with all singers, voices deepen as they age, so it's no surprise, and it's no reason to criticise.\n\nLet's run through a few tracks, shall we? Kingmaker is the opening track and one of the most thrashing tracks on an album that generally deviates from thrash for the most part. So, as you may have guessed, it's one of the more pleasing tracks for those hardcore thrash purists ripping apart the rest of the album. However, it is a strong track and a good way to open the album. \"Super Collider\" the title track and the lead single, was more of a concern for fans with its slower tempo and melody. I will say I wasn't too sure what to think at first, but the song did end up growing on me. The major thing for me was Dave's voice, which I felt sounded too gritty for such a melodic song, but I'm used to it now.\n\nFast-forwarding quite a bit, Dance in the Rain, for the most part, is a dark, slow song, which eventually becomes faster and more upbeat, and guess who sings this part of the song? None other than David Draiman. His voice sounds great, but I would have preferred it to be a little louder in the mix. Beginning of Sorrow carries a sinister sound, and on the chorus, a sinister sounding Mustaine when he sings the song title! The final ORIGINAL song is \"Don't Turn Your Back...\" and my favourite part of the song is actually the memorable chorus. Again, it's melodic, but it works well. The album closes with a cover of Thin Lizzy's \"Cold Sweat\". it's a solid cover but I don't really listen to it much. It would have been nice for the album to end with another original. The band hasn't put a song cover on an album's base tracklist since 1988's \"So Far, So Good...So What?\"\n\nThe major experiments in sound can be found in the opening of a number of the songs. For example, the fiddle on \"The Blackest Crow\". The album has some rather impressive moments, others standard Megadeth moments and a few moments maybe a little below average. But I still stand by my view that it's nowhere near as bad as some people say. If you're a Megadeth fan it's certainly worth picking this up.\n",
        "\nMegadeth's Risk was a controversial album among the band's fans. Many disliked the album for being much more based in hard rock than in the thrash metal style for which they were known, causing the band to sound out of their element. In further experimentation from the band's normal genre, they released the Breadline EP. This EP features 4 songs from Risk (one radio edit and three remixes) and 2 previously released tracks (both remixes). While remix albums are not inherently bad, they are normally mediocre. This EP is no exception.\n\nThe first two tracks are variations on the song Breadline, which in and of itself is a dull song. It is obviously trying to pander to the alternative crowd, but fails by not having any original ideas. The remix only gives the song an electronic feel, adding nothing to an already unexciting track. The Insomnia remix by Rhys Fulbar of electronic group Delerium is okay, but the sounds thrown in to make the song sound 'Middle Eastern' can be annoying at times. It is also predictable, using many overused effects. The last remix from Risk, Crush 'Em, is garbage. The song is pretty bad to begin with. Making it even more electronic only brings it down more. Mustaine's vocals are annoying, and the effects used on his voice don't help. Midway through the track, the song stops so Mustaine can rant tunelessly about how tough he is. This section was utterly pointless, and sounds rather like something out of a nu metal song. \n\nThe older cuts that were remixed are incredibly different from one another. The first one is Symphony of Destruction, remixed by Nine Inch Nails mastermind Trent Reznor. This is the best remix. The original was a classic, and Reznor adds more menace to the track and gives it an industrial feel. However, the remix is close to ten minutes in length, leading it to be repetitive at times, and making it drag on longer than it should. The last remix is of the classic Holy Wars... The Punishment Due. It was remixed by Sascha Konietzko of the German industrial band KMFDM and is definitely the worst track on the EP. The stuttering beat makes the song lose its edge and the keyboards add nothing, as do the shouts after the chorus. Much like parts of the Symphony of Destruction remix, it gets repetitive after the first three minutes.\n\nAll in all, this EP is only for die-hard Megadeth fans. The main reason I gave this a 20 is because of Reznor's remix, which isn't even one of his best. I suggest picking up the Hidden Treasures EP instead. It gives you more rarities that are much better than the ones contained here.\n",
        "\nIt\u2019s no secret that Super Collider is already becoming one of the most controversial releases in the Megadeth discography. While the band has certainly pulled off more, since the 90s, but this album is coming out right after they spent a good ten years reclaiming their thrash metal reputation. But while this album will never be worse in the public eye than Risk, it does prove to be a pretty rocky listen.\n\nIt is obvious that this album is different when compared to the last few efforts before it, but it\u2019s hard to tell just how it is different. Unlike Risk or Cryptic Writings, there are no blatant sellouts or dance music experimentations. If anything, you could say that it is just a dumbed version of their signature melodic metal as the tempos are slower and the vocals return to a more prominent position.\n\nOf course, these changes do lead to a somewhat disjointed band dynamic. While some training and honest effort led to fairly enjoyable vocals during their last commercial period, Dave Mustaine\u2019s voice just sounds tired and almost bored in this day and age. Thankfully Chris Broderick gets some good leads in when he can and Shawn Drover\u2019s drumming has its moments, but the limited writing means that the talent is more competent than it is impressive. That\u2019s not even going into the banjo on \u201cThe Blackest Crow\u201d or the David Draiman influence, though those elements aren\u2019t as offensively prominent as one would think.\n\nSpeaking of which, the writing also feels like a mixed bag and seems to lack the hooks the band had gotten really good at putting together. \u201cBurn!\u201d and \u201cBuilt For War\u201d would\u2019ve been bigger highlights with smoother transitions, \u201cDance In The Rain\u201d and \u201cBeginning Of Sorrow\u201d have a few pacing issues, and the title track is the kind of hard rock song that makes one wonder why AC/DC couldn\u2019t have gotten to use the title first\u2026\n\nFortunately, there are still some good moments on here. The opening \u201cKingmaker\u201d and \u201cDon\u2019t Turn Your Back\u201d make for solid metal tracks as the former channels some Diamond Head influence and the latter features a particularly tight drum performance. The cover of Thin Lizzy\u2019s \u201cCold Sweat\u201d also makes for a decent closer and \u201cForget To Remember\u201d actually has a few hooks in there though it could\u2019ve been even better in the hands of a more melodic group.\n\nWhile Super Collider certainly isn\u2019t at the Lulu level of disaster, it is certainly the weakest Megadeth album since The World Needs A Hero. The best moments are when the band sticks to what they\u2019ve been doing since United Abominations and even some of the other good ideas may have been better with other bands performing them. Seriously, doesn\u2019t the title Super Collider sound like it should\u2019ve been for the best AC/DC album in twenty years?\n\nCurrent Highlights:\n\u201cKingmaker\u201d\n\u201cBuilt For War\u201d\n\u201cForget To Remember\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t Turn Your Back\u201d\n\u201cCold Sweat\u201d\n\nOriginally published at http://psychicshorts.blogspot.com\n",
        "\nin the past few years, we've seen Mustaine and co. rise from the mire of radio-friendly, popularity-oriented mindsets and actually put forth albums that are worthy on their own merit. Sure, it took some time and was a process all its own, but even the weakest track in \"Endgame\" puts the best \"Risk\" song to shame by a serious ways. And then...darkness loomed on the horizon. Focus seemed diverted and a touch unhinged. \"Th1rt3en\", while a solid album through and through, just didn't have all that panther piss in its veins as before. Didn't seem as angry and vengeful, but more bothered and irked. But that's OK, because they can bounce back, right? Well...then came the title track off this new album for sampling, and ooohhh BOY was it a flaccid kick to the nuts. Something was amiss, clearly.\n\nStill, this veteran 'DETHer soldiers on, hoping against hope that the rest of the album will redeem the first sampling...\n\nPutting the title track rather early on in the album could be seen as a good or bad thing; on the one hand, it gets its catchy weakness out of the way quickly after the slap to the face that is \"Kingmaker\" (not a bad way to start things...). But on the other hand, one could conclude that it would \"just go downhill from there\". And in this case, things start off in a mid-paced war march and seem to stay there for the most part. Much of the thrashy sensations of the past few albums appear to be forsaken for a more melodic, rocking atmosphere that could very well make some remember the drudging softness of \"Risk\" and \"The World Needs a Hero\" more than what we've come to love about MEGADETH. But that's all in the ears of the beholder. But for my money, I found it to be a rather above average affair that has its share of vices as well as virtues. The central feel of \"Super Collider\" is still more cohesive and legit than many other modern metal albums out there. Some of the melodic ends are actually pleasant, dramatic and occasionally raging, adding an extra amount of depth to what could have been a flat product; take into consideration the rather proggy nature of \"Built for War\" and the soulful sensations of \"Dance in the Rain\" and \"Beginning of Sorrow\". Guitars and bass still bite, solos are tasteful and drums still have that profound attacking potential, and more harmonics and twisting chord arrangements abound than ever before. And I can even forgive some of Dave's vocal stylings (more varied and experimental here than before); that's SOME, not all. The snarl is still as sharp as before and his cleans have a bit more heart to them, but when he shoots for a more \"intense\" approach it, more often than not, comes off as a little, well...silly. Like he's trying. I know he is. But if it doesn't work, it doesn't work. I'm just saying. However, while still having the appeal of a complete album through and through, things seem more like a collection of ideas than full-on compositions and arrangements, where much of the songwriting comes off as a bit unfocused and, dare I say, pedestrian, with the feeling of genuine anger and hate replaced with grumpiness and a mere shaking of the fist. Not so much uninspired, just rather just there for the sake of being there, still maintaining the simpler times of \"Th1rt3en\" with a few dashes of \"Cryptic Writings\" (albeit more metallic than the latter). Such a blas\u00e9 approach to this new album could make the more jaded folks out there question where or not Mustaine and Co. gave it their all with regard to the final product. Are they still angry at the world, like they've been for so long? Or are they just merely humbled more than a little bit due to getting older? That's up to them.\n\nAs it stands now, \"Super Collider\" has moments of placation that rock like nothing else, but the full-on end result isn\u2019t as completely cohesive as it could\u2019ve been. Maybe I\u2019m asking too much from my MEGADETH, but I found it rather lacking and in dire need of that kick to the balls we\u2019ve come to expect from them. Slightly recommended.\n",
        "\nThis album really is full of great ideas. In fact, I'm not so sure if the songs themselves are all that bad really, but it does feel underwhelming. I feel a big part of the problem is that every album starting with United Abominations has this annoying modern, sterile production that just chokes all of the balls out the metal moments of this album. I've seen much criticism that this album is more of a rock album than a metal album. I'm not so sure that's true as the riffing on most of the songs certainly is metal, however all organic life was squeezed out and replaced with a cold, almost computerized sound that it's just not a very satisfying album to listen to. I feel like this album was recorded on a reel of tin foil! I thought ditching Sneap would help, but Thirteen sounded just like Endgame and this is their worst sounding album yet (yes, So Far, So Good..., had terrible production, but terrible analog is much more welcoming than terrible digital.) I think Mustaine himself is to blame and he really needs to stay away from the mixing board and get on board with someone that can heavy it up for him.\n\nThe second biggest problem is Dave Mustaine just isn't putting any effort into his vocals anymore. He clearly doesn't have much of a voice left. Every live clip I've seen is very hit or miss and with every album since Endgame he just seems to be talking through it. This isn't to say Mustaine was ever a great vocalist, but like all \"non-traditional\" singers, he had a certain charisma to his vocals and that just isn't there anymore. Songs like Kingmaker Burn! and Built For War would totally benefit from a much more aggressive singer. In fact, these songs would fit in very well on a classic Megadeth release with a much younger Mustaine singing (and probably writing lyrics).\n\nOn this plus side, he seems to have toned down his polarizing political lectures, which allows me to want to listen to every single song. While I'm aware that his entire career since Peace Sells has been full of political lyrics, it certainly isn't the same. I think Dave realized with this release that it's making many fans former fans.\n\nEverything on this album represents a weaker, half-finished, and rushed version of many of their previous albums. Better than their previous album, but both this and Thirteen represent the worst stuff Megadeth has ever put out. Passionless metal produced by a man who clearly doesn't have it in him anymore. Take a break, Dave, you really need it.\n",
        "\nDependability has many faces, but it's easily identified based on an unmistakable pattern. It can be obviously said that a Slayer album will be fast regardless of how good or bad it is, that Anthrax will probably have a bright future playing covers and reliving a bygone past, that Metallica will not put out a decent album even if their life depends on it (the continual mob of brainless fans suggests this will never be the case anyway), and the list goes on. Megadeth is a bit less obvious insofar as patterns go, but if going by their record since the 1990s, it's a foregone conclusion that for every 2 or 3 solid albums they put out, there will be a mediocre one just around the bend. Thus the forgettable yet largely listenable \"Super Collider\" could be seen as a mathematical inevitability, though it probably shouldn't be that way given Dave Mustaine's proven track record during the 80s.\n\nAfter getting an ear full of extremely bland, derivative 80s cock rock meets AC/DC in this album's lead off single and title song, optimism is not really possible, though in retrospect going by that song alone was a tad bit deceptive. Rather than a complete turd burglar in the mold of \"Risk\", the actual feel of this album is more along the line of \"The World Needs A Hero\", albeit with an updated, clear and pure as the wind driven snow production that, unfortuantely, does little to mask the flaws in this little collection of largely non-thrash songs. Granted, there are a few riff monsters like \"Kingmaker\", \"Built For War\" and \"Off The Edge\" that could pass for some of the better material heard off of the previous album. Likewise, the groovy rocker \"Burn!\" has a fair share of lead guitar gymnastics that does a little bit to sate any ears hungry for a more animated sound out of this band.\n\nNevertheless, along for the ride with a respectful collection of passable mid-tempo thrash anthems is a host of bizarre, mostly rock oriented nonsense that would have been more at home as a b-side to \"Cryptic Writings\". While a lot of people dug the banjo schtick put forth by Zakk Wylde on his short-lived southern metal venture Power And Glory, on \"The Blackest Crowe\" it just falls flat and sounds ridiculous, almost like a poor man's \"In My Darkest Hour\" minus any of the good points apart from some lead guitar brilliance. \"Forget To Remember\" gets even worse and listens like a lifeless rock anthem out of the HIM playbook but with Dave's grating growl clashing with the rest of the arrangement. It literally gets to the point that for every decent song on here there is another that just doesn't make sense and should have been dropped from the idea pool before getting to full song status.\n\nIt's difficult to tell why it is that Dave suddenly gets possessed by this irrational urge to hop to different styles of music when it's pretty obvious that he doesn't have the voice for it and generally doesn't write very well outside of his metallic comfort zone. Lyrically things are also a bit sketchy at times, as Dave seems intent on mixing in some ficticious relationship problems with his usual niche of fringe politics and personal struggle. It gets a little bit abrasive in the former department on \"Dance In The Rain\", which is one of his usual half-ballad soap box routines about how screwed up America is, a no-brainer for anyone with a functional one, but also one that suffers from lengthy narrative section overkill. This isn't something that should be bought flat out at full price, but about half the songs on here might be worth downloading from Itunes, or gone for at $6 if in CD format. Hopefully this is just a passing rut and not a signal of Megadeth's eventual end, because this isn't a good note to end on.\n",
        "\nOne more Megadeth release, one more mass realization that it's not Rust In Peace 2...let the hilarity begin! Now, where do I start with this one?\n\nAs an admittedly huge Megadeth fan, I get excited for any new release by the band. We've already covered how I actually really dig their more mid-paced, melodic stuff, so there's no reason to rehash that here. Suffice to say that what I was expecting probably wasn't what some other people was expecting. And for the first time in a while, Dave figured out how to disappoint all of us at the same time!\n\nThe first song we all heard was Super Collider. Now, I'll admit, it does kinda grow on you somehow. It's not anything complicated, and as a pre-album single it's not as good as Public Enemy No. 1, but is still far better than the god-awful Head Crusher. Megadeth has been all over the map with picking pre-album singles, and after Head Crusher I wasn't going to let a mediocre song dull my hopes for the actual album. Full disclosure: the last album I probably really dig from start to finish also happens to be my favorite Megadeth CD: Youthanasia. Everything since then is full of stuff that I either like, or stuff that will probably rarely if ever get replayed after the first few listens. So when Super Collider turned out to be a relatively weak song with what sounds like Dave forcing his vocal performance, it didn't distract me.\n\nSkipping ahead a bit, the first thing I noticed about the CD was that the production appeared to be very, very well done. That isn't really surprising, given that Johnny K returned, and Th1rt3en had solid production as well. The problem is that great production can't hide the mediocrity of a lot of the music. That being said, let me throw this out there: how much better would Risk be if it had this tone and this production? Makes you think.\n\nBack to the music, the biggest issue with the album is that a lot of the music is, well, boring. The interesting thing is that there are a lot of things in here that work very, very well by themselves, but have the unfortunate luck to be surrounded by boring music. The album kicks off with a great example, Kingmaker. Nothing special in the riff or lyrics department, but the layered vocals in the chorus work really well. For that matter, Dave's vocals are actually pretty damn good as far as Mustaine performances go on the bulk of the album. So, we get Kingmaker and Super Collider to open the album, nothing much to see here. Then we get just plain ugly with Burn! Which again, has some nice layering to the chorus, but the problem is the lyrics are a massive WTF moment, at least in the chorus. It sounds like Dave's waxing about some arsonist fantasy, but the chorus is enough to make you never want to hear the song again.\n\nFortunately, the fourth track appears to crap all over the first three. Built For War may be some sort of Crush 'Em throwback, but what the hell, it works for me. Same problem as the first three tracks with pretty banal lyrics, but at least here the music is starting to pick up. About two minutes in we get a pretty amusing ooOOooOoOOOooo thing by Dave, which again, actually manages to work. Then we're at Off The Edge, which is where I think the lyrics are actually starting to get a bit more interesting. The song is still pretty simple, but this is one that has definitely grown on me. I will fully admit to trying to see if I can blow the windows out of my house when this one comes on.\n\nAnd then, we finally get to something bordering on epic. Dance in the Rain is one of the best songs Megadeth has done since Dave made the comeback with The System Has Failed. Plus, bonus points for the \"three letter groups listening in on you\" line in advance of Mr. Snowtarded's total ignorance of the concept of a freaking nondisclosure agreement. Whatever. This is the first time the album gets flat-out awesome. And you know what? David Draiman's vocals in the second half of the song, something I was skeptical about when I heard about it, fit in just fine as well. If there's a downside here, it's that the second half of the song could've been another minute or so longer.\n\nAnd then, BLAM! Back to mediocre music for the most part. Beginning of Sorrow, once again, has a nice layered chorus, and this time the music is pretty good, but the lyrics are a turn-off. After a few listens, The Blackest Crow is starting to grow on me, as is Forget to Remember, but neither of them are what I'd call standouts at this point. Don't Turn Your Back is just another filler track, moving on. At least the regular album closes on another high note, with their cover of Thin Lizzy's Cold Sweat. This song is hilarious next to Super Collider; both of them feature Dave reaching to, let's call them \"non-traditional\" vocal stylings for him. Super Collider? Fail. Cold Sweat? Uh, yeah, nailed it. Although am I the only one noticing the inclusion of the intro lead bit from Am I Evil? Was that in the original? Whatever. Great cover, and would've made a ridiculous B-side on the Train of Consequences single. \n\nNow, fanboy mode being in full effect, I had to get the bonus tracks version from Best Buy (yes, I am STILL buying CDs). All I Want is just awful. However, it's awful in a kinda funny way; it's like Mustaine decided to rewrite Mechanix! Not that it saves the song by any stretch, but what the hell. The real problem is that with crap like Don't Turn Your Back or Kingmaker showing up on the actual CD, another really damn good song got left off. A House Divided may be a bit like Dance in the Rain part 2, with the same basic political undertones, but it's really damn good. As good as Dance in the Rain is, this one is probably my favorite song on the whole CD. And clearly remaining in throwback mode, Dave threw what sounds like a few notes from No Remorse in there starting around 2:10. That little riff drove me nuts for a few days until I realized where the hell it came from. \n\nSo, what's the bottom line here? Good? Bad? Ugly? Well, some of all three, actually. It's not the worst CD I heard in June (and bought on the SAME DAY), but it's not as good as the one a week later that about blew me off my ass. The good stuff like Dance in the Rain and A House Divided is really, really good. Even the \"simpler\" but \"good\" stuff that I'm liking like Off The Edge is significantly replayable. The bad and the ugly are just too commonplace here, making this album a definite step backwards from the last few releases. That being said, there are still some positive takeaways. For one, Mustaine can still write badass political songs. If he decided to write an entirely political-themed album, I find no evidence that it wouldn't be ridiculously awesome. They can still write decent enough music, everyone is on their game musically, and even some of their weirder ideas like the entire intro of The Blackest Crow actually worked, and in most cases worked really, really well, at least from a conceptual standpoint. The underlying problem with the album, to me, is Dave's lyrics. Most of the time, if they're off the wall, weird, or whatever, they're usually at least interesting enough that they can co-exist with the music. Hell, I'm supposed to worship Rust In Peace, so go look back at Lucretia for a good example of what I mean. Maybe the problem is the all-over-the-place subject matter here just didn't lend itself to \"Megadethy-enough\" lyrics. \n\nAt the end of the day, if I'm going to be honest about it, this one is about a 60. True objectivity is not my job here so I'm probably inflating it a bit, but I'm perfectly fine with that given how good some of the songs are. And since the major issue with a lot of it is not the entire package but just the lyrical content in a lot of places, a 60 is probably actually right about right now that I think about it more. Which I probably should've done prior, but who cares. The good news? There are enough new ideas here, and enough bright spots, to suggest that another great album could be in their collective brains somewhere. But the lows, coupled with the lyrical issues, should temper any expectations for their next release.\n\nAll in all, an overall disappointing release, albeit one with a few standouts.\n",
        "\nSo this is the latest release from human enema Dave Mustaine, probably the least respectable person in rock this side of Geoff Tate. It\u2019s always a conundrum with Megadeth\u2019s works for me because some of his earlier stuff is good, like the obvious classics, but his voice is always horrible, and his lyrics are angry, paranoid tin-foil hat political yapping that mostly reminds me of a drunk, high college student at a shitty party. Not to mention his latest works have been spotty at best and complete ludicrous garbage at worst\u2026with that said, this is Super Collider; it sucks shit through a straw.\n\nLike the latest Firewind album this is very competent musically, and I even like it better \u2013 this has some pretty sweet riffs here and there. But really only every now and then. The production is squeaky clean and heavy as a brick, and every instrument has its place \u2013 a very modern sound, but a good production. \u201cKingmaker\u201d and \u201cBurn\u201d aren\u2019t really all that bad, and even though they\u2019re pretty basic sleaze rock/metal tracks, it\u2019s still listenable enough and even kind of enjoyable, in a retarded sort of way. But then you get the rest of the album\u2026\n\nThese songs are dull and brainless, with as little thought put into them as possible. It\u2019s really hard to describe how vapid and thoughtless \u201cOff the Edge\u201d or the title track is\u2026just forgettable rockametal to the nth degree, without any hook or fire to the proceedings. \u201cBuilt for War\u201d kicks off some steam but then just goes nowhere \u2013 what a waste of a pretty cool riff. The rest of the songs aren\u2019t just boring, they\u2019re flat out terrible. Lots of whining about how life sucks, which I\u2019m sure Dave is improving by singing about it in the manner of an angsty teenager, right? \u201cDance in the Rain\u201d talks about the trappings of 9-to-5 work life in America, and honestly I don\u2019t think the working man is proud to have Dave standing up for them. The song degenerates into a bunch of conspiracy theory garbage about devil-messiahs, the CIA and big business buying out politicians, how lovely; just when I was starting to have some faith in humanity again, this comes along. It\u2019s like Dave just has tourettes or something, only his tic is inserting god-awful political nonsense into his lyrics. Half the time it doesn\u2019t even make sense. One second it\u2019s \u201c9 to 5 jobs suck and trap you in cubicles,\u201d and then the next it\u2019s \u201cthe CIA and the devil team up to rob us of our freedom while Obama grows horns and sips chardonnay over the rotting corpses of children\u201d? What planet am I on?\n\nOh and this track also features that worthless sack of shit from Disturbed on guest vocals\u2026pretty loud, annoying and weak, just like his former band. \u201cBlackest Crow\u201d features a country western banjo in the opening and in the background, but the song is really, really dullard and features a weak-assed chorus\u2026disappointing to say the least. This experiment could have been interesting, but it ended up the most confused song on the whole album. The riff is a groovy mess and the banjo lick isn\u2019t melodic, catchy or interesting.\n\nThis album is not just unimpressive and boring \u2013 it\u2019s flat out unpleasant to listen to. Far from the youthful vigor of 80s thrash, these songs are just mean spirited and irritable. Just listen to the petty, finger-pointing diatribe of \u201cBeginning of Sorrow\u201d \u2013 yeah, I really want to hear Dave talk about abortion; that sounds like a fucking good time. Yes Dave, please, enlighten us on your views on abortion! We\u2019re all just waiting for your oh-so-exalted opinion! There\u2019s a bunch of snide crap about wards of the state and broken families and cycles of violence, and\u2026Dave, seriously. Yes, these issues are serious and need addressing, but \u2013 do I even have to say it? \u2013 Dave Mustaine, the human cyst, should NOT be talking about them! Jesus Christ on a cracker this is insipid. He has about as little tact with these lyrics as possible, and doesn't treat anything he's singing about with the dignity it deserves. Newsflash, douchebag: the answer to creating thought provoking lyrics ISN'T shitty wordplays and puns a fourth grader would think up! And it's certainly not raving and ranting like an insane person either. This is living proof that freedom of speech isn\u2019t always a good thing. Doesn\u2019t help that the song itself is musically worthless, fetid crap\u2026\n\n\u201cForget to Remember\u201d is another piece of trash, with some banal lyrics about senility or something, and it\u2019s just so pointlessly mean and banal. How is it fun to listen to this? It sure isn\u2019t intelligent or meaningful, we\u2019re far past that; but really I just don\u2019t see a point in listening to something so in your face that it feels like it\u2019s confronting you like some high school bully in the locker room. Music should be fun, and not just in the \u2018party\u2019 way \u2013 it should be something that you want to listen to because it fills you with power or shows you something you never thought about before, or just makes you happy in general. This album is lowbrow, petulant and just all around rotten. It\u2019s not fun because the whole attitude and aesthetic of it is completely awful, negative paranoia and pent-up rage, so what\u2019s to gain in listening to it? What\u2019s enjoyable about that?\n\nNothing, that\u2019s what.\n\nI know I'm harping a lot on the lyrics and the messages behind all this, but that's because it's INESCAPABLE. You can't listen to this without the lyrics pushing their ways into your brain like an intrusive tumor. The music, while not always unlistenable, is terrible; don't get me wrong, but really the lyrics, infantile as they are, just scream so loud, begging for even one iota of attention, to the point where the whole thing is just unbearable and unforgivable. I can't remember the last time I heard something this blatantly, grotesquely mean.\n\nSuper Collider is just a waste of all the resources that went into it. It\u2019s loud, it\u2019s irritating, it\u2019s just a piece of shit that gives metal a bad name with how immature it is. Do not buy this or support it at all\u2026just let it die.\n",
        "\nMegadeth's fourteenth album starts up pretty promising with Kingmaker, but when the title track with its crushing title, Super Collider, appears I expect a double barreled impact, but all I hear is some viscous and weary metal, on the contrary to the title that speaks of a particle accelerator based on high energy. This track immediately takes the edge off the album and from then on this release never really recovers from the damage done.\n\nI wasn't a big fan of the band's last release and now they climb one step further on the downward spiral staircase, away from greatness and reliability. Similar to Th1rt3en, Super Collider has a bunch of tracks that seem to lack a great amount of fantasy in the songs' melodies and they just don't address me. Still there are many great, heavy, and fantastic riffs and truly solid overall guitar playing all throughout, but with the absence of skilled, breathtaking, and awesome songwriting, there's no chance in hell fans of Megadeth will take this release into their hearts and souls. Some will try and also succeed, but that will be more diehard behavior than rational thinking.\n\nMost of the choruses feels forced and don't appeal to me. Let's just face the facts that most bands only have a couple of huge records in them and then they lose their youth's inspiration, their ideas, or just the knowledge of how to create awesome albums. What I want to hear is songs with a thrust that attack all the way through like Dance In The Rain and also perhaps Kingmaker and Don't Turn Your Back. Many of the other tracks have this certain drive occasionally, but they continuously also lose their momentum on and on. It would, however, be a great shame to accuse them for having created total crap, but I totally have to expect more from this veteran unit as well.\n\nOriginally written for www.metalcovenant.com\n",
        "\nAfter the double platinum success of 1992\u2019s Countdown to Extinction, it\u2019s fair to say Megadeth entered into lengthy periods of creative blight during the dying years of the \u201890s and most of the decade that followed. But the release of 2009\u2019s Endgame revealed a revitalized and focused Megadeth intent on showing the world why it was regarded as one of the four thrash metal pillars upon which the genre was built during the late \u201880s. It seemed as if Dave Mustaine had put all of the personal and professional drama behind him, and with original Megadeth bassist Dave Ellefson rejoining the band in 2010, and drummer Shawn Drover and guitarist Chris Broderick providing their expertise, Megadeth became truly relevant again. Musically, Endgame placed weight on the technicality and tenacity that made Peace Sells\u2026 But Who\u2019s Buying and Rust in Peace thrash metal masterpieces. Working in conjunction with this came the song-writing sheen that made Countdown to Extinction, for better or worse, a massive commercial hit. It was a sigh of relief for Megadeth fans the world over who had to trudge through the five albums since 1994\u2019s Youthanasia looking for hidden gems amongst the good, bad and mediocre.\n\nMegadeth took its foot off the gas when it came to following up Endgame, as 2011\u2019s Th1rt3en lacked the killer instinct and the band began reverting to bad habits. It sounded rushed, and the song-writing was limp in comparison, with some of the riffs and melodies leaning on old ideas and lacking that characteristic bite of Megadeth\u2019s classic material. And as Mustaine has been slowly disintegrating publically through ill-measured insults and radically opinionated sound-bites in the time since its release, the future of Megadeth once again looks frail. With less than two years having passed, we now have another new Megadeth album upon us. It\u2019s the band\u2019s second album in a row with producer Johnny K (Machine Head, Black Tide), Super Collider. The warning signs flew red the moment a new album was announced. Surely it was too soon to have strong, new material compiled? And when the first single off Super Collider, the title track, was released, this initial concern was confounded. The title track off Super Collider is a ghastly attempt at writing an arena rock song that even Bon Jovi would have thought twice about releasing as a B-side. Mustaine\u2019s vocals\u2014which have always been Megadeth\u2019s weakest link\u2014have been pushed to the front and the technical riff wizardry has been diluted to service his vocals; it\u2019s indicative of the band\u2019s approach to the album as a whole. It is Countdown to Extinction taken to its most nightmarish conclusions, and when Mustaine lets out a \u201cHuh!\u201d half way through \u201cSuper Collider\u201d, just before another nauseous spin through the song\u2019s toothless chorus, you know things are not as they should be.\n\n\u201cSuper Collider\u201d follows the opening salvo \u201cKingmaker\u201d, a song that is a false representation of what the rest of the album has in store, in that, it is actually a decent thrash metal song, even if it does unashamedly pillage Black Sabbath\u2019s \u201cChildren of the Grave\u201d during its verses. But from \u201cSuper Collider\u201d to the finale of \u201cCold Sweat\u201d\u2014a Thin Lizzy cover and the only other song besides \u201cKingmaker\u201d that has some balls to it (too bad those balls belong to Phil Lynott)\u2014the majority of the other tracks veer from cringe-worthy to make-it-stop-now. \u201cBurn!\u201d houses so many clich\u00e9d lines within its chugging sleaze metal, with its chorus, \u201cBurn, baby, burn \u2018cause it feels so good\u2026 Burn, baby, burn like I knew it would\u2026,\u201d riding high beside \u201cForget to Remember\u201d in the hideous stakes. \u201cBuilt for War\u201d is a pathetic attempt at groove metal, and sounds more Five Finger Death Punch than Pantera. And it\u2019s left to the last minute of \u201cDance in the Rain\u201d to give us a quick glimpse of the Megadeth we all know and love, but the rest of the song is so heavy on melodrama that it sits awkwardly. However, not as awkward as the dark Americana of \u201cThe Blackest Crow\u201d, a banjo-led song that has no place on a Megadeth record.\n\nSure, the riffs of \u201cDon\u2019t Turn Your Back\u2026\u201d do have some temerity, but after the tracks that fall before it, it\u2019s like being starved and presented with a can of spam\u2014you are going to wolf it down. The ironic thing about it all is that this album will probably sell extremely well, as it is aimed at the Neanderthal brain of a Nickelback fan. It sounds so contrived yet at the same time hastily assembled that claims of Mustaine suffering a middle-life crisis wouldn\u2019t be too hard to believe. Some men buy a shiny new car and a leather jacket, Mustaine has given us this abomination; a contender for the worst metal album of 2013, and worst Megadeth album of the band\u2019s near 30-year existence. With the thrash metal\u2019s \u201cBig 4\u201d in various stages of disarray, now was the time for Megadeth to stride to the front and don the crown again. Instead Mustaine sings, \u201cCrazy, I\u2019m going crazy. This world\u2019s gone crazy. I\u2019ve fallen off the edge,\u201d during \u201cOff the Edge\u201d, and with this sorry excuse of an album out there for all to hear, you have to agree with him for once.\n\n Originally posted on http://www.popmatters.com/ \n",
        "\nThis album sure isn\u2019t \u2018Rust In Peace,\u2019 but, then again, it sure wasn\u2019t intended to be. And I\u2019ll tell you why- because R.I.P. has already been written! I don\u2019t know why we have to insist that artists we love just keep making clones of their previous work. And yet, for whatever reason, every Megadeth album that gets released has to be evaluated on its similarity to Killing is My Business, Peace Sells, Rust In Peace, or Countdown to Extinction. Forget the musical quality of what\u2019s produced- just tell me if it sounds like one of those albums. And tell me if its thrash. And so Dave didn\u2019t set us up for disappointment: we set ourselves up by expecting him and the others to do what is literally impossible: to go back in time and re-create something that\u2019s already here. So here\u2019s a novel idea: why don\u2019t we actually look at Super Collider for what it is \u2013 not for what it isn\u2019t. So what is it?\n\nThe Germans have an expression for a song that sticks in your head long after you\u2019ve heard it \u2013 an \u2018earworm\u2019. This album is infested with ear worms. I\u2019m not joking. The thing was only released three days ago, and yet for three days now I have woken up in the morning with different songs from this disc playing in my head. Anyone whose love of Megadeth extends beyond this band\u2019s first four albums knows that one of the things you love about Megadeth is not only the ripping thrash they are capable of providing, but the many songs they have delivered over the years that have stuck in your head because of catchy melodies, the sweet guitar harmonies, etc . . . This is an album will do that for you if you let it.\n\nThis album is also one that delivers some amazing musicianship. Mustaine and Broderick sound amazing together, trading off leads, harmonizing, and shredding. How can you not love that?! The drumming is excellent, and Mr. Drover definitely delivers for us! And David Ellefson\u2019s bass work is very good, very solid, and very mature.\n\nThis album is diverse. We get melodic metal. Some people don\u2019t like that there are a couple songs here that could be categorized as hard rock (like the title track, which is the weakest song). There are some thrashy moments (Kingmaker, Dance in the Rain, and most definitely A House Divided, which is a bonus track. By the way one of my irritations with this album is that A House Divided is only a bonus track on the deluxe edition \u2013 I\u2019ve got no clue why this track was a bonus track. It\u2019s a great thrasher, and it would have silenced some of the people who have been making whiny and unjustified comparisons to Risk.) And it has the Blackest Crow \u2013 one of the first metals songs I\u2019ve heard that successfully incorporates banjo, fiddle, and mandolin. It\u2019s just a killer tune, and the atmosphere it creates is very effective. And even though this album is diverse, the songs work well together. It\u2019s cohesive.\n\nSo why are so many people disliking this album? I think there\u2019s a couple reasons. One is the aforementioned disappointment that this is not a straight ahead thrash metal album. That\u2019s what we all wanted. But we got something new. Even worse, we got a couple of hard rock tunes. Another reason is the lyrics. There are a couple of songs where the lyrics on the chorus run shallow (Super collider, Burn!, and Built for War are the offenders that immediately jump to mind.) These couple of songs give the impression, fair or not, that depth has been exchanged for radio accessibility. And some people are just bothered by Dave\u2019s worldview. I find it an absurd irony when a metal reviewer complains that he finds the music insulting, and yet that is a charge I have heard frequently leveled against this album. And to such people, I say this: Buddy, if you don\u2019t want to be insulted, don\u2019t listen to metal, or else come to grips with your bias against Christian conservatives.\n\nThis is a great album in its own right, delivering a lot of great quality tunes that many people have been overlooking because they just can\u2019t get over that this is not Rust In Peace.\n",
        "\nI think I'm at the point now where I hold absolutely no expectations for whatever Dave Mustaine thinks up next, because for nearly two decades now, it's never been a question of 'will this be mediocre or will it suck?' but rather 'just how mediocre, JUST HOW SUCK.' Sure, Endgame was a great time, but only because he saw fit to return to the record that blew the ceiling off Megadeth's career (Rust in Peace) rather than forge off into a compelling new direction. This guy is hands down one of the worst decision makers in the medium, which is a pity, since you have to admit that he has no issue morphing the band's sound to fit whatever whimsy he's got this year or next. In the proper hands, that can be a positive and potent trait for a musical franchise, but in Mustaine's it has become a piece of cheap putty that rarely takes the shape anyone in the audience would enjoy. Cryptic Writings, Risk, The World Needs a Hero, The System Has Failed, United Abominations, Th1rt3en, and now Exhibit G of the Megadeth Trainwreck: Super Collider, an effort which is so creatively misguided that I had to dial 911 for a pair of EMTs to come and jump start my brain again with electrodes. And so pathetic that it makes its superstitious predecessor almost triumphant by comparison!\n\nIt's a little bit late to write this off as a midlife crisis ('everybody gets one'). No, this is just outright weak. The Dave Ellefson bass lines that set up \"Kingmaker\" gave me a few seconds of hope that I was about to get my ass kicked, and then it all falls apart, with a track that is more or less a series of dull swaggering chugs that had me fearing a \"Sweating Bullets II\", busting out into a chorus that is essentially a rehash of \"Symphony of Destruction\" with the descending melodic chords sped up. \"Super Collider\" is a rock song with Pearl Jam bass guitars, angsty filtered vocals and the one bright spot being the first few seconds of the lead. \"Burn!\" is boring, effortless chug reduction with bluesy wah wah leads. I had complained on the prior album about just how insipid and uninspired a lot of Mustaine's riffing choices have become, but this takes it to a whole other level of miserable, with songs that couldn't have taken the guy more than five minutes to assemble. This is the same person we used to venerate as a guitar god...for fuck's sake, just listen to his playing on Rust in Peace. Listen to how the songs were crafted, the techniques employed and embedded into even the rhythm playing. Super Collider is more like a sequel to Youthanasia, only with that record the catchy choruses were legion enough to compensate for the simplified, slower pacing and rock structure of the songwriting. Not so much this time, where you'll almost never hear a surprise melody or vocal hook worth repeating.\n\nOne could definitely characterize Super Collider as a mix of Dave's hard rock influences (felt through a lot of the groovy picking progressions on tunes like the bridge of \"Dance in the Rain\" or \"Built for War\" (the latter having a slightly modern Metallica feel) with the 'bare minimum' of what makes a Megadeth metal track. They're not about to throw in the towel entirely, and remind us through the leads and occasionally a riff of the sleek and dextrous playing that built the band's following. But it's all for show...I never came away thinking it was integral for any particular song, and even when you've got a middling, inoffensive piece like \"Off the Edge\", Dave will go and cock it up with some generic layman lyrics that disintegrate any potential interest. A pity, because there are actually a handful of positive things I can say for the disc. The bass-playing, while not strong in its note choices, sounds voluminous and really helps round out the overall balance of instruments, so we know at least one of the members is 'performing', he merely needs better songs to work with. I would also laud the complete production of the record...it's modern, but fresh, in more ways than one an update to Youthanasia's concentrated layers of depth, rhythmic punch and brightness. Good guitar tones, lead effects, good vocal mix, and anything Shawn Drover applies a stick or foot to is clear as day, though he too is quite restricted by a lot of the predictable rock beats.\n\nI'm also not going to write off the record strictly on the whole 'guest vocalist' debacle, with David Draiman of Disturbed appearing deeper into \"Dance in the Rain\", because: A) Who gives a shit!? I might not like his mainstay band either, but the guy genuinely digs metal and Megadeth, and was happy to be a part of this; and B) because the explosion at the end of that song, with Dave and David shouting vocals in uniform, is set to the best pure Megadeth riff anywhere on this thing. If there were a dozen or even a half-dozen more instances of this throughout Super Collider, it would have been a more pleasurable experience. But therein lies the issue: a moment of intensity and passion like this one serves only to cripple and leaden the rest of the record. At best, you're going to get a semi-catchy piece like \"Beginning of Sorrow\", the strongest overall use of riffing and melody with the nice male/female backing choir chorus, and a structure that reminded me of what I enjoyed off the Countdown to Extinction/Youthanasia era. On the other end, you'll get \"The Blackest Crow\", where the idea is to dress up some very boring, basic crunch riffs with a fiddle intro and outro to create a 'country Megadeth'. Gosh, man, you are so eclectic and open minded that it tickles me! The cover of Thin Lizzy's \"Cold Sweat\" is passable, I suppose, but I just wish most of the originals were actually heavier than this...\n\nIn another, just world, records like Risk and Super Collider would have been branded as Dave Mustaine solo efforts, dicking around with mainstream rock and hard rock music, blues or whatever he felt like and not polluting the joy that was once Megadeth. Granted, I am not now or ever opposed to a band experimenting with its sound for any reason if the end result is good music, but Mustaine has yet to prove to me that he can pull it off with any lineup. You might 'outgrow' thrash and speed metal, sir, but you'll not surpass it with the likes of this unmemorable tripe. Super Collider is a bargain bin effort before you've even hit the cover tune, with often middling lyrics and even more unimaginative music that simply can't be ignored because he threw a cello here, or a fiddle there. It's also, unfortunately, the worst Megadeth record in 14 years, second only to Risk in serving as rock bottom for their entire career. The twist is that there are a good 5-7 minutes of ideas here that serve as a painful reminder to just what we're all missing out on when this man is not on his game. Vic turned his back on us the last time, and now he's nowhere to be found. Frowny face. I might not be holding my breath for another masterful record like Peace Sells... or Rust in Peace, but some part of me still believes in your musical ability, Mr. Mustaine. We don't need \"Holy War 2\" (you already did that), but for the love of whatever God or philosophy you're following this week, stop fucking around and KILL US WITH RIFFS.\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nUsually when I talk about Megadave, I typically talk about how they're Metallica Jr, how bewilderingly overrated Endgame is, how damn close to perfect Rust in Peace is, things of that sort. I have the same few sticking points that I seem to harp on whenever the band is brought up, it's a definite flaw that I certainly acknowledge. So what am I going to harp on today? Why, how clear it is that Dave Mustaine has lost his goddamn mind, of course.\n\nThe series of events leading up to this has been nothing short of a surreal, yet hysterically apt look into the mind of Dave Mustaine. We all know about how strong his political beliefs are and how staunchly libertarian he is, but that's not what makes him crazy. There are plenty of normally well adjusted people who believe in their political leanings so strongly that they're willing to say crazy shit to make a point. I mean, I don't doubt that Dave probably believes that Obama harnessed the power of the Weather Machine from Red Alert 2 to stage the recent tornadoes in Oklahoma, but that doesn't necessarily make him a bad guitarist or songwriter. No no no, shit like \"Super Collider\" makes him a bad songwriter. Yeah, the title track here was released about a month or so ago, and everybody who heard it promptly shit their pants in awe of how transcendentally crappy it was. A riffless mid-90s radio rock song with tired melodies and the worst vocal performance of Dave's entire career? Oh yeah, you bet your sweet little tushie this is going to be a comical trainwreck! I couldn't wait simply for the sheer schadenfreude. And before then, Dave announced that David Draiman, the hilariously wimpy frontman of Disturbed, was going to be featured and also help co-write a couple tracks. Fans lost their shit over this prospect. I'll admit Disturbed released two alright modern hard rock albums back with Believe and Ten Thousand Fists, but they're largely uninspiring and Draiman himself is a hilarious wussburger of a human being. The cover art was incredibly funny to me as well, it's one of the most well known stock photos of the Large Hadron Collider with just an added lens flare and a Megadeth logo slapped on to it. It's so preposterously lazy, they may as well have just released an album with that stock photo of the girl with the striped shirt and mega cleavage that everybody on the internet has seen twelve gorillion times already and named the album Boober Collider for all the effort this took.\n\nThe day finally came where the album was made available to those of us who are leeches upon the underbelly of the music business, and well... it's bad, but it's not hilarious like I was hoping. I made the choice to avoid Thirteen (pHU(|< 7|-|@ $7UP1D L337 $P34|< p0PP'/(0(|<) based on how little I've liked practically anything the band has done since 1994, but from what I've gathered, Super Collider isn't all that different. It plays like a collection of b-sides from the mid 90s for the most part, with boring hard rock songs and boring kinda-vaguely-thrashy songs that they've been shilling since The System has Failed. It's more just really boring and uninteresting as opposed to outright offensively bad. I mean, there are some decent things here; I think \"Kingmaker\" is cool hearkening back to the sound of Countdown to Extinction (which I have now dubbed \"speed rock\"), and \"Built for War\" goes along those same lines. And no matter how bitter I am about Broderick potentially damning Nevermore to jump ship for the sinking S.S. Megadeth, there's no denying that he and Mustaine play off each other extremely well, and the leadwork has been pretty consistently great ever since he joined the fold. But apart from the leadwork, there isn't really any consistent positive from beginning to end on Super Collider. It pretty solidly flip flops between bad and boring with a few bright spots here and there.\n\nTo get the positives out of the way first, the aforementioned appearance of David Draiman is actually probably the best moment of the album. Say what you will about his voice or the insane Alex Jonesian lyrics he's forced to sing (the word \"Al-CIA-da\" is seriously used (ya rly)), but at least he sounds youthful and energetic. Mustaine's already technically awful singing voice has been long shot, and so he just kind of grumbles and snarls his way through the entire album like a tired old man trying to still sound as vicious as he did when he was a smack addicted young adult. The music does occasionally ramp up the aggression, but the vocals just have no chance of matching up to the energy and pace when it does pick up. And as I've previously mentioned, the speed rock numbers like \"Kingmaker\", pieces of \"Don't Turn Your Back\" and the end of \"Dance in the Rain\" are pretty good (especially that last song, the double bass passages and Draiman's exuberant performance are the clear highlight of the album for me), and the more mid paced stuff can sometimes groove along pretty well at times. The horridly titled \"Burn!\" is a pretty good example of such, even if the song is utterly forgettable if not for the dumb chorus.\n\nBut really, that's really all the album has going for it. Consistently impressive guitar solos over the top of mostly boring speed rock and intended radio singles with the occasional bright spot and vaguely thrashy moment. Nobody really expects Megadeth to churn out dozens of classic songs and riffs like they used to, but I don't think we fans are asking too much to ask for a little bit more effort on their part. The title track is still worth all the hate it received upon release, with it's utterly boring progression, pointless lyrics, and hideous vocals. We know that Megadeth can pull off this style relatively well, Youthanasia was full of decent songs like this, and I maintain that \"Countdown to Extinction\" is one of the better kinda-ballads in the band's repertoire, but \"Super Collider\" here is an exercise in half hearted ideas being shat forth with no passion from their creator. The song just kind of stumbles around on a really bland vocal melody and a complete dearth of anything resembling a real riff. Granted, it's clearly not meant to be a riff based song, but when the vocals are so hilariously botched and the melodies so uninteresting, something like an interesting riff in the bridge or something would have been most welcome. \n\nAnd... good God this man's lyrics just need to be addressed. We all know they suck, we all know that his increasingly extreme political views have been seeping into his music for a while now, but they manage to be both funny and confusing on Super Collider. Take \"Beginning of Sorrow\" (which, to my dismay, is not actually a Suffocation cover) for example, which at first seems like a pretty straightforward take on the hot-button issue of abortion. But as the song goes on, the narrative just gets super fucking bizarre. A quick summation is this: \"Teenage girl meets 'Mr. Right', Mr. Right turns out to be a jackwagon and rapes her, she is given the choice to abort, chooses not to, spits out baby in an alleyway, kid grows up in shitty foster homes, grows up twisted and bitter, becomes rapist himself, the end\". So wait, what the fuck am I supposed to glean from that? Abortion should be legal because... otherwise there'd be more rapists in the world? Or... is it trying to make a statement about the fucked up state of foster care? Or... rape... is bad? I just don't get it. And then one song I keep mentioning as being one of the better ones, \"Dance in the Rain\", starts off with a goddamn \"God Alone\" dissonant banging while Dave rambles some spoken word crap about how da gubbermint has your car bugged and how they're just the worst thing ever and anarchy and antichrist and whatever I'm not The Sex Pistols I'm not very good at this get off my back! And then we have a personal favorite of mine, \"Don't Turn Your Back\". Favorite why? Because I'm almost sure this is yet another Chris Poland diss track. Motherfucker you wrote this already twenty five years ago. I'm not even kidding, the lyrics even directly reference getting his stuff stolen. Goddammit Dave, stop being such a booger.\n\nDespite being boring on the whole, there are some strange musical choices here as well. The aforementioned awkward spoken word intro of \"Dance in the Rain\" is a big one, along with the banjo rendition of the opening of \"My Last Words\" (srsly) in \"The Blackest Crow\". Most impressively though, is \"Forget to Remember\". Honestly, this one is actually probably my favorite because it just so perfectly encapsulates the ever dwindling coherence of our glorious leader here. First off, it seems like a fairly typical farewell song. Could be a breakup, could be a death, whatever, it's a sad song, that's the point. That is until we reach the bridge, where (and I'm so happy that what I'm about to describe is a real thing) we get a spoken word section where a groveling Dave Mustaine begs to some woman to just please let him talk to her while she tells him to piss off because she has no idea who he is. The female voice in this exchange is played by his fifteen year old daughter. And then there's one last verse about how vaccines are evil shoehorned into the end because why the fuck not? What is going on in this man's head? I implore you, make sense of this insanity. Albums like City or Obscura sound like the musical manifestation of insanity to you? Well you simply just haven't spent enough time with Super Collider. Between the not-bad-but-kinda-half-hearted speed rock and the really terrible radio half-ballads, the layers peel away to reveal a man who hasn't been in full control of his brain ever since he learned how to burn the bottom half of a spoon. And it's odd because he still manages to surround himself with great musicians, and Broderick here is no exception, and he still manages to shine through when given the opportunity.\n\nBut clearly, this is very much a \"Dave\" project, and the band really has been ever since day one. This used to work out fine when other guitarists were able to inject their style into the still great songs Dave was writing. But now that he's an old, decrepit, lip-flapping lunatic, somebody needs to pull the reins and sit the man down, shake him violently and just yell in his face \"NOBODY WANTS THREE RADIO ROCK SONGS ABOUT THE BARACKALYPSE. Goddammit man, we get it, you don't trust the government and personal freedom is being eradicated yak yak yak. Lots of people agree with you, but you are fucking awful at making this point eloquently. You're not a very good lyricist, you just kind of hamfist stupid scaremongering buzzwords into an awkward cadence and then run with it without editing your work at all. Nobody wants this shit. You know what they do want? Fast, violent, ripping music with lyrics that have fuck all to do with your increasingly pushy political views. Look back at 'This Day We Fight', that song was so goddamn good that most people seem to forget that the rest of Endgame sucks. Just... do that again. We know you can do it, you just did it flawlessly nary two albums ago. Why instead do you churn out crap like 'Off the Edge' and 'Forget to Remember'? Take your pills, man. Pick up the pace, let Shawn double bass and let Chris shred even more, maybe even give him an opportunity to start writing some riffs. The pieces are in place, but we have a raving madman at the helm who can't focus or make a good decision anymore. Get your head in the game, dammit.\"\n\nThat's all there really is to say about Super Collider. It's boring more than it is outright bad, but even with that being true, it still manages to make some bafflingly strange decisions. Is it worth checking out? Ehh, not really. \"Kingmaker\" is okay and the second half of \"Dance in the Rain\" is really good, but otherwise it's one of those things you shouldn't go out of your way for. Not the trainwreck we were all expecting (un)fortunately, but it's still boring and yet another pointless addition to the ever growing pile of pointless Megadeth albums since Youthanasia. The band's biggest problem is pretty solidly the band's own leader, and it's sad to say (especially since Rust in Peace is one of my all time favorites), but it's best to just ignore Megadeth at this point.\n\nPS - The Thin Lizzy cover is pretty solid too, though they don't do anything special with it. \n\n\nOriginally written (with an added visual aid!) for Lair of the Bastard\n",
        "\n'Super Collider' is a strange release. Since United Abominations, Megadeth have hyped their albums by releasing some of the better (or more interesting) tracks as singles. 'Head Crusher', 'Never Dead' and 'Public Enemy No. 1' weren't classics but did add to the hype for what would eventually be mediocre or unimpressive albums. 'Super Collider' doesn't even offer that much.\n\nFirst of all, it isn't thrash, having more in common with hard rock than heavy metal: it is mid tempo, simple and radio-ready. There isn't a riff to speak off, just some easy-going three or four chord patterns. The solos are disappointing and simply exist out of necessity, barely a showcase of either Broderick or Mustaine's talent, talent which feels like it is being wasted with releases like this. The next issue is that, of course, Mustaine's old and worn voice isn't particularly appropriate but not worth complaining about at this point, even if it sounds like the words are being squished out of him against his will.\n\nTo the track's credit, the drums sound great! Drover puts in an excellent shift, and I hope that he's given a similar workout on the rest of the album. The other positive is that the production is very good, especially in terms of the clarity of the bass and the drums. This kinda sounds like nit-picking but in the context of the upcoming album, I'm fairly content with it being as good as if not a little better than the last few releases.\n\nSo 'Super Collider' is neither super exciting and it isn't doing much colliding in the charts (eh... I tried), but it certainly isn't garbage. It's a serviceable hard rocker that most people should laugh off rather than get angry at it.\n",
        "\nThe Megadeth train has been running for the better part of 30 years now, and it has had its share of positive consequences (no pun intended). Unfortunately, there are times when the average thrash lover just wants to throw up his hands and say \"Dave? The Fuck is this?!\", and the title track of the upcoming \"Super Collider\" is one of those instances. Anyone familiar with this band's less than stellar 90s output will note that these guys were at their absolute worst when they were straying outside of the heavy metal realm, largely because Dave's riffs and guitar distortion sound really mechanical when played at slower tempos, and because his gruff-laden mutterings are not fit for the AC/DC scene. At best, what comes about is a schizophrenic album like \"Cryptic Writings\", but if this song is any indication of the future LP, this might be a potential repeat of \"Risk\".\n\nTo be fair, this song is not bereft of any aggression, but its punchy distorted character definitely clashes with the inherent 70s rock character of the principle riffs. Occasionally Dave will find himself reverting to old tricks with a quick 4 second pick up in motion, but largely this thing just dithers along at mid-tempo and refuses to really go anywhere. The vocal work struggles to be tuneful, and finds itself somewhere between Lemmy Kilmeister with a soar throat and a sickly frog trying to stay on pitch. The only real bright spot is the technical lead guitar work, which has a very similar flavor to the bluesy yet flashy work heard on \"Peace Sells\", but all the sweet frosting in the world won't save a cake that's been sitting stale for weeks. Call me crazy, but when I hear a title like \"Super Collider\", I expect something that is at least as frenetic and glorious as the quicker works on \"So Far, So Good, So What?\", as opposed to something that could almost pass for a Poison song with garbled vocals (didn't Mustaine mock Brett Michaels and company a few years back for their shallow music?).\n\nIt's a pretty bad sign when the title song of an upcoming album fails to measure up, and I am guardedly pessimistic about the musical prospects of the rest of the album. At best, this will prove to be another \"Th1rt3en\" that contains a number of throwaway songs and a respectable blend of old guard heavy metal and the occasional thrasher, but that might be hoping against hope. One thing is for certain, anyone who was not impressed with the complete genre-shift that occurred on \"Risk\" should steer clear of this song.\n",
        "\nCertain parallels shall forever be drawn between Megadeth and Metallica but it is only on the debut of the former that the two cross over. Killing Is My Business was an album that came about following Megadeth frontman Dave Mustaine's forced departure from Metallica. This is one release that you can not forget due to its balls to the wall attitude found throughout. Whereas Metallica were slightly more stream lined and always had a degree of melody to them, Killing Is My Business is a release that keeps its foot firmly on the accelerator and hand firmly to your throat.\n\nThe reasons for Mustaine's departure vary depending on who you are to ask but one thing is certain-his removal from Metallica was a blessing in disguise. Who knows if he had remained in that band what the out come would have been. Would there ever have been Master Of Puppets or Rust In Peace-two of the best known and most highly valued thrash metal releases? Both bands went on to release a good run of classic albums but of the two it was Megadeth who started out the best. Their debut is a slab of pure unadulterated speed metal unlike anything out there with intense guitar work and unrivaled fury behind the vocals. And all this starts off with... A piano line?\n\nLoved To Deth is a great way to begin an album of such colossal magnitude as Killing Is My Business with the titular words forever remaining embedded in your mind after you first hear Dave's tortured voice spew them out. After the brief piano introduction this dives straight into the fastest material Megadeth have ever recorded that still maintains a fair degree of technicality that they would expand upon following this album. When you look past the undeniably fuzzy production (it really is awful) this album is an absolute gem that delivers nothing but ass kicking songs. Rattlehead in particular sticks out as a song that is somewhat in line with the NWOBHM style of guitar work and the numerous lead licks and guitar solos that would later form the basis for a number such as the title track to Peace Sells.\n\nOne song that every Megadeth and Metallica fan will have conflicting opinions on is Mechanix. This track weaves a twisted web that speaks of having sex with a girl and uses various metaphors relating to cars and mechanic work. It is not the lyrics that stick out however, nor the riff work but in fact it is the story behind it. This was one of four songs that Dave Mustaine wrote whilst with Metallica that the band went on to use on their first studio album, Kill Em All, under the name of The Four Horsemen. In a drugged up rage Dave decided that he was going to strike back at his old band by re-recording this track with his new band Megadeth under its original name with the original lyrics. No matter which version you personally prefer there is no denying the impact that comes with hearing such a lightning fast collection of riffs and demented vocal performance from Dave.\n\nThe aforementioned problem with the production is a major set back for those first getting into this album, particularly if you are not well versed with foul production jobs already. Similar to many thrash debuts, this is a low budget release due to the fact the band spent much of the original allocated budget on drugs and booze so they were left with just a small chunk of what they were originally granted. This low cost also spread onto the album art work which was not in line with Dave's original visions for the art work but instead, quite frankly, sucks. The guitar work on here is fuzzy and the bass is scarcely audible whilst the drums carry a flat tone and the cymbals just destroy the mixing job completely. Dave's vocals are also mixed too loud so that everything that was already difficult to hear now becomes nigh on impossible to distinguish.\n\nThe vocal performance on here is a subject of much debate as with many albums by this band. Some love Dave's overly nasally voice and his characteristic snarl as they feel it perfectly embodies what he strives to achieve with the lyrical content-the snark, sarcastic, snide lyricism that he loves to utilize. On here however he really does not do a good job. Whilst on later releases he is not exactly the best singer of his generation he is at least listenable and suits the style of music a lot better with much lower tones to his voice and a considerable amount of force behind making himself sound as aggressive as he possibly can. On Killing Is My Business he feels weak and usually very whiny and whilst the anger is there it is not used nearly as well as on other Megadeth releases.\n\nThe guitar work on Killing Is My Business is its real selling point. It is fast and straight to the point with no strings attached-the riffs are as quick as one can imagine and twice as creative; the soloing flies by at the speed of light with numerous solos per song and the dual guitar assault works very well. The riffs to songs such as The Skull Beneath The Skin and Mechanix stick out as some of the best. The guitar work on here is almost always thundering along as fast as humanly possible so that the notes are very hard to make out; especially when the production is factored in. The drumming keeps a solid beat whilst never sticking out as being particularly creative but is still nice to hear and helps the music move along at a quick pace. Not a lot of comments can really be made on the bass given that it is completely inaudible, buried beneath a sandbag of riffs.\n\nThis is a solid debut from Megadeth that combines so many good riffs with a whole bucket of aggression that it is hard to over look this in discussions about the best thrash debut.\n",
        "\nAlright, here we go...Countdown to Extinction. For the uninitiated, this album receives a lot of criticism, particularly from diehard Megadeth fans for its foray into more mainstream appeal. It has often been cited as \"Megadeth's Black Album\". That statement isn't entirely accurate (nor do I see it as derogatory, having thoroughly enjoyed the Black Album personally). Youthanasia could be rightly compared to the Black Album, but this album still has traces of thrash, or at least thrash influences throughout. For the VERY uninitiated, this was also the followup to Megadeth's triumphant masterstroke Rust In Peace, and expectations were absolutely through the roof. If you try to compare Countdown to Extinction to Rust In Peace, you're gonna lose that battle every day of the week GUARANTEED. Therefore, I will try my best to review this as a standalone product (unless I feel a comparison is absolutely necessary). That's enough history lessons, though. Without further adieu, my review of Countdown to Extinction. \n\nThe absolute first thing that hit me with this album - and one of my big immediate problems with it - was the production. When I first got a taste of Countdown, I was listening to it on a pair of mediocre quality headphones, so I assumed it was just the headphones themselves. I decided I would give it a try in mono on my boombox, and sure enough it wasn't the headphones. This album has very poor production. The drums are too sharp, the vocals sound washed over, the solos are grating, and the contrast is very poor (bass guitar? What bass guitar?). If I had to make an honest recommendation, get the remaster. The production on the original is very unpleasant to listen to (I remember wincing several times the first time I heard Sweating Bullets). I know production isn't easy or cheap, but Rust In Peace had a lower budget and managed to sound great. \n\nSongwriting is actually a fair bit better than some of Megadeth's previous albums. The focus has been taken off of speed and more on writing and melody, and Countdown to Extinction benefits from it nicely. There are cheesy bits (the courtroom \"scene\" on Captive Honour is so out of place it almost feels comedic in spots), but songs like Symphony of Destruction and Architecture of Aggression have some great memorable lyrics. Dave Mustaine still has the old chip on his shoulder and he takes it out as much as ever on Countdown to Extinction. Once again, no one is safe. The only track of which I don't like his vocals on is Sweating Bullets. His snarling is very over-exaggerated and he really sounds like a cartoon character. \n\nThe atmosphere on Countdown to Extinction is very foreboding rather than straight-up vicious like on older albums such as So Far, So Good....So What? The slower riffs, tight drum fills, and carefully structured instrumentation really add to this feel. The old Mustaine sounded like he would bite your head off if you came too close, but this Mustaine sounds more like he's just biding his time, waiting for you to step out of line. \n\nThe themes on most of the songs are just \"new Megadeth, same as the old Megadeth\". Dave Mustaine doesn't like politicians, he doesn't like the rules, and most of all he doesn't like you. But what's this? On the album's title track, something entirely new comes to the table, an environmental message warning us of the consequences of hunting? This track actually won Megadeth an award from an ecological society for its dark prediction about the extinction of species. Needless to say, that is decidedly un-Megadeth. It's delivered with the usual dark lyrics and violent imagery, but overall is still very new for the band and I'll still take it any day over the far right wing drivel that permeates United Abominations or Endgame. \n\nBefore I wrap this up, I'll go over some personal highlights. The opener, Skin O' My Teeth, has a great Judas Priest-inspired feel. Despite the overdone vocals, Sweating Bullets actually has some very good lyrics, but in terms of tracks that you will walk away remembering, Architecture of Aggression is this album's highlight and centerpiece. The riffs are absolutely amazing, the drums tight as hell, and the lyrics are very cheesy and over the top, but in a rather cool way. Overall, I'd recommend this album to a person who was getting into Megadeth but wasn't a diehard thrash fan.\n",
        "\nAh, Peace Sells. When this came out, Megadeth was still a fledgling band. To see their career this strong at only their sophomore debut is an impressive feat indeed. Megadeth would go on to a more consistent, thrash sound for their next couple of albums, but here they work with a unique sound that dares to combine elements unheard of in thrash at the time. The blend of sounds and styles makes this an easy standout in the many-headed beast that is Megadeth's catalog. \n\nProduction on Peace Sells...But Who's Buying is phenomenal. Keep in mind, at this time Megadeth were still very much an underground band, which doesn't exactly pay the bills. However, this makes Peace Sells' production all the more impressive. Contrast is nice, no sounds are underplayed, the instrumental tones are crisp, and Mustaine's voice sounds as raw as you would want it to be on a classic 'Deth album. Congrats to Dave and Randy on their efforts. \n\nThe writing on Peace Sells...But Who's Buying is fantastic. Dave Mustaine tackles the issues head-on in the title cut and the songs that try to be \"spooky\" or \"demonic\" actually succeed in an uncommon stroke of luck for Megadeth. Mustaine's singing is just vicious; he sounds ready to bite your head off. Definitely one of his better vocal performances, if not his best. \n\nInstrumentation is lightning fast. Most of it is great and I have to give Chris Poland a shout out for his phenomenal solos, particularly on the title cut, Wake Up Dead, and Good Morning/Black Friday. Samuelson's drumming is fantastic and his fills are absolutely ridiculous. David Ellefson can rarely be heard, but when he gets his chance to shine, he REALLY shines. Mustaine's riffs are adequate, but lack the structure and finesse of Rust In Peace's many memorable cuts. Poland and the rhythm section, however, manage to pick up all of Mustaine's slack and then some. \n\nThis is probably Megadeth's most aggressive album (unless you count So Far, So Good...So What as legitimately aggressive and not just stupid) and puts a heavy emphasis on speed. There are lots of different influences here as I noted previously, and I'm going to acknowledge some more of them here. Mustaine's vocals clearly take some cues from the punk rock greats such as Sid Vicious or Henry Rollins. Songs like Bad Omen or Good Morning invoke a Sad Wings of Destiny-era Priest feel, particularly with their sinister, slow-burning opening sections. Unsurprisingly, there's a little Maiden influence noticeable here and there (The Conjuring, especially), but a metal album having Maiden influence goes without saying. \n\nAs far as highlights, the album maintains a very fast, thrashy feel, rarely slowing down except for the occasional intro and the swing tempo of their cover of I Ain't Superstitious (probably the album's low point). It's hard to pick highlights when most of the songs sound the same. That's not necessarily a bad thing in this case. Peace Sells is more \"consistent\" than repetitive. This isn't Megadeth's best, in my opinion, but it is great (an easy second) and the influences were incredibly groundbreaking at the time. If you're looking for essential thrash metal, definitely pick this one up and give it a few listens.\n",
        "\nSo Far So Good is something of an anomaly in the Megadeth discography. This album, unlike much of the rest of their albums, does not either flat out suck nor is it an instant classic. Instead, what we have here is an album sandwiched in between the two undisputed classics Peace Sells and Rust In Peace that got rather over looked when it was first released in 1988. This is a release that is also very mixed, with some fantastic tracks among some real stinkers.\n\nWhat this album definitely is, without any question whatsoever, is a Megadeth album. All the traits that defined the albums that came before and the album that would follow are there. The frantic lead work scattered throughout the album. The demented vocals that, despite being terrible and hilarious to listen to, somehow manage to fit the music. The technical riff work is there, the sarcastic lyrics, and even the final cover song to be featured on a main album (minus bonus tracks on later releases) in their cover of The Sex Pistols controversial song Anarchy In The U.K.\n\nKicking things off with the balls out instrumental Into The Lungs Of Hell, we are immediately treated to a Megadeth classic. This is an absolutely amazing instrumental that gives off a completely apocalyptic feel to it that very few instrumental-only songs can ever hope to accomplish. This leads right into Set The World Afire, a song many people seem to really enjoy, but i could never get into. From the atomic bomb dropping through to the end of the song, this is a straight thrash song, that only Megadeth could put out, but just comes off feeling extremely stale. It is apparent here that the ingenious writing present on Peace Sells was just missing from parts of this album, despite some killer drumming throughout this particular song. The first few guitar riffs are just stale and played too many times to the point they become boring, and the bass is as bland as can be. The vocals are nice, the riffs once the verse starts are nice enough, and the lyrics to this song are great, but overall it is one of the weaker songs early Megadeth put out.\n\nThe cover song, Anarchy in The U.K. is considerably better than the Sex Pistols version, but still not a great song. Mary Jane, however is one of the better songs on the album, with strong, crushing riffs to it, beautifully written lead work, and a fun feel to it that the rest of the first half of the album is devoid of. The guitars to this songs are perfectly written, being both catchy and heavy enough, with Dave's vocals being surprisingly good throughout this song. This was the perfect song to pick the album back up for the second half of the album.\n\n502 has some extremely fast riffing that brings back memories of Killing Is My Business, but this is merely the tip of the iceberg of the best moments of this album, as it feels somewhat like a filler song, that is just there to speed the album up again. Still a decent enough song, though, and definately worth a listen or two. The two songs that follow, In My Darkest Hour and Liar, are two absolutely incredible songs. The former is a song about Dave's fallen comrade Cliff Burton, often mistaken as a suicide promoting song, and is one of the most moving songs in music history. This is how a song should be written, equal parts heavy and emotional, despite the majority of it moving at a very slow pace. The lyrics to this song are just beyond description, being absolutely heart shattering, and conveying the thoughts of a broken man. This is the absolute definition of perfection.\n\nLiar is one of the more hated songs from this album, and i could never understand why. The lyrics are utterly hilarious, speaking of Megadeth's former lead guitar player, who allegedly stole Dave's guitars. The final verse of this song is essentially just one long rant, culminating with the immortal \"to your maker, off you go... your a liar, you fucking liar\". This song is one of the most balls to the walls, pissed off thrash songs ever recorded, with intense, fast riffing, crazy vocals, and great drumming. The hate for this song is something i honestly will never understand.\n\nHook In Mouth is half a great song, being very bland and dull for the first verse, but once it kicks in, it hits the listener with the impact of a freight train, bringing crushing riffs and one of the angriest vocal performances from Dave you will ever hear. This song is a song i never enjoy thoroughly, but always skip to when it kicks in, because that is the only segment of this song worth listening to. It is alright as a way to close the album, although this spot would better suit Liar.\n\nThis album is definitely a mixed bag of an album, with the first half of it being rather poor when stacked up against what came before and afterwards. Moments like the first half of Hook In Mouth, and the cover of Anarchy In The U.K. and the intro to Set The World Afire really do drag this album down to the abyss. However, the musicianship throughout much of the album is absolutely perfect, the lyrics are as sarcastic and angry as ever, and Dave is on top of his game, vocally, on this album. This is a solid enough release, and definitely does not deserve the hate it receives, but has a few disappointing moments that keep it away from the upper echelons of the Megadeth discography.\n",
        "\nOriginally published at http://suite101.com\n\nBefore we talk about Megadeth\u2019s thirteenth studio album, let\u2019s get one thing straight: this is not a comeback. Those who are keeping score will know that the band had their biggest return to form with 2009\u2019s Endgame, a release that just might be their most enjoyable since the early 90s. This album appears to have a different mindset than the last few though, unlike their friends in Metallica, the band doesn\u2019t seem to be in any sort of identity crisis. There have been some significant changes in the band\u2019s dynamic as longtime bassist David Ellefson has returned to the fold, no longer making Dave Mustaine the only original member, and Chris Broderick has become the first lead guitarist to stay on for more than one album since Marty Friedman left in \u201899. On the other hand, Johnny K, a man best known for his extensive work with Disturbed, was the one that ended up producing this album and even co-wrote a few songs on it\u2026\n\nWhile Endgame was mostly presented as a thrash metal affair with some hard rock influenced songs thrown in, this album appears to have an opposite effect going on. The band has been quick to compare this release to the classic Countdown To Extinction though a careful ear will also find references to past albums such as Youthanasia, Cryptic Writings, and United Abominations. But while the album\u2019s noticeable emphasis on choruses and accessible structures may lead some to wonder if Mustaine is trying too hard to reach the Billboard\u2019s number one spot again, there is still a lot of ground covered here in terms of style. The technical thrash still comes up on the Guitar Hero-friendly \u201cSudden Death,\u201d but the release also shows off a slew of more foreboding numbers, mid-tempo rockers, upbeat traditional metal on \u201cPublic Enemy No. 1,\u201d and some borderline punk on the rather angsty \u201cWhose Life (Is It Anyway?).\u201d\n\nThrough it all, the band manages to sound pretty good though there are some changes that have been made to accommodate the material at hand. With a few exceptions, the guitars seem to be a bit more restrained in terms of soloing and Mustaine\u2019s voice still has its trademark sneer though it also seems to be more melodic than usual. Fortunately there is still a good amount of grit so listeners shouldn\u2019t be too disappointed with how things are. However, one thing that is somewhat disappointing is the bass playing\u2019s stance in the mix. While Ellefson gives solid backing on tracks like \u201cNew World Order\u201d and even gets a brief moment to shine on \u201cDeadly Nightshade,\u201d it doesn\u2019t seem like he\u2019s as prominent as he used to be. This is thankfully more of a mixing issue than his performance, so one can hope for a remedy if the band is releasing a follow-up anytime soon\u2026\n\nWhile the songwriting itself isn\u2019t too atypical for Megadeth, what really makes this album weird is the number of older songs that were included just so the band could have thirteen songs on their thirteenth studio album. In addition to two songs previously used for video games and a single song available on the Japanese edition of United Abominations, \u201cNew World Order\u201d and \u201cMillennium Of The Blind\u201d both have compositional roots in the early 90s with their original demos being included on the 2004 Youthanasia remaster. Some listeners have complained about the excessive amount of recycling, but I don\u2019t think that it is necessarily a bad practice. Sure it\u2019s hard to justify the placement of a rather recent bonus track on here but it is great to see some of the older tracks come to light and show their full potential. Jon Oliva\u2019s newest band has been using old Savatage outtakes to fantastic effect and I\u2019ve personally wanted them to put out developed studio versions of \u201cNew World Order\u201d and \u201cMillennium Of The Blind\u201d for years\u2026\n\nAnd for what it\u2019s worth, these songs do manage to sound pretty good. \u201cNew World Order\u201d is a fun track with some rarely encountered gang vocals shouted out during the chorus, \u201cMillennium Of The Blind\u201d is stretched out and turned into a dark ballad, and \u201cBlack Swan\u201d is a rocking track that makes one wonder why the rather artificial remake of \u201cA Tout Le Monde\u201d couldn\u2019t have been the Japanese bonus track instead\u2026\n\nBut even the newer compositions have a few tropes that are quick to remind one of past moments. The galloping riff on \u201cPublic Enemy No. 1\u201d isn\u2019t too far off from the one found on \u201cTears In A Vial,\u201d \u201cDeadly Nightshade\u201d feels like a darker version of \u201cAlmost Honest,\u201d and the closing \u201c13\u201d is a somber retrospection in the vein of \u201cThis Was My Life\u201d or \u201cOf Mice And Men.\u201d With all this in mind, is the resurrection of old unfinished songs really such a crime?\n\nOverall, this release ends up more or less being a \u201ctypical\u201d modern Megadeth album. It\u2019s certainly not a low quality effort and has a lot of good songs for the sheer quantity that it is trying to push, but there\u2019s not too many moments that truly make it worthy of a classic status. It could make a nice accessible release for newer listeners but an album like Countdown To Extinction would be a better fulfillment for that kind of job. If you\u2019d like to hear modern Megadeth at their best, give Endgame a listen. If you\u2019d like to hear an amazing album released in 2011 by an old thrash band, feel free to see what their old pals in Anthrax are up to. But whatever you do, just make sure you don\u2019t spend too much time dwelling on this album\u2019s god-awful title\u2026\n\nCurrent Highlights:\n\u201cPublic Enemy No. 1\u201d\n\"Never Dead\"\n\u201cNew World Order\u201d\n\u201cMillennium Of The Blind\u201d\n\u201cDeadly Nightshade\u201d\n",
        "\nThis is one of those songs that caters to a specific instrument to sort of show off that musician's ability. In this case, we have Mustaine and Broderick tearing our faces off in one of the most shred-packed songs I've ever had the pleasure of encountering in my life.\n\nFirstly, let me address two interesting points of this song.\nA) It was composed for Guitar Hero, which kind of diminishes it because it will always be associated with a video game. I'm going to ignore this fact because at the end of the day, music is music. Besides, I didn't even know anything about this Guitar Hero business. I got \"Th1rt3en\" when it came out, popped this into my player, and was pleasurably greeted by this face-melter.\nB) It's the band's first release since the return of Dave Ellefson, the original bassist and a founding member of Megadeth. I didn't buy any of the records without him because I couldn't consider them Megadeth, so this is refreshing. Megadeth is back!\n\nNow, shall we?\n\nAnyone who listens to metal can tell you, it's a complex art. A single element can't make a song shine; the whole band has to be on point. In \"Sudden Death,\" while the main focus of the song is obviously the lead guitar, the rhythm section is driving hard, giving the song a great headbangable feel, although the rhythm guitar's chromatic scale riff can get a bit repetitive. The song structure is pretty simple; Intro, Verse, Chorus, Verse, Instrumental, Verse, Solo, Chorus. Basically, they took a relatively simple structure and ornamented it with tons of shining lead guitar. Now, being a Dream Theater guy myself, I love artsy, progressive, complicated metal; but there's also a place in the universe for this kind of metal, too. Simple, straight to the point, rock solid, fast, blazing hot, metal.\n\nAs for the lead guitar, there's nothing much more descriptive I can say than \"WOW.\" Broderick employs just about every technique of shredding known to man. He's sweeping, tapping, and flying all over the place, just breezing up and down octaves like it's nothing. And I'm not talking about cheap Slayer shredding, just fast randomized alternate picking; he plays guitar like a pianist, with a strong emphasis on arpeggios and the structure of the chords over which he's soloing (this is because he's trained as a classical guitarist). Not only does he burn through mind boggling amounts of notes per second, but he makes his solo rise and fall beautifully with the song. And if you're one of those who's all about \"style,\" he's got you covered. He bejewels his soloing with pick slides, plenty of bends, you name it; we're not just talking fast notes, here. I don't know which guitarist did each individual lead (both Mustaine and Broderick are credited with lead guitar, and there are tons of leads; however, I do know Broderick did the main solo), but the two-measure leads sprinkled into the verses and such do a great job interacting with the music around them. They don't conflict with the singing, as can happen when the back-and-forth guitar/vocal structure is used. Overall, this is one of the best shredding songs ever.\n\nThe production was obviously weighted towards the guitars. My only complaint with this song is that it lacked some on the low end; the drums and bass seemed a little left out. The moments when the lead guitar isn't going at it are a bit dull but driving nonetheless, and if at any point there's no lead, you don't have to wait long for it.\n\nOverall, this song was meant to be a shredfest and they achieved their goal. As stated, it's not a complicated song, and it doesn't need to be. There's no shame in a straightforward composition; it got the job done above and beyond expectations. If you're looking for complex, artsy prog, you're in the wrong place. If you're into the guitar, especially shredding, then this song is for you.\n\n\\m/\n",
        "\nWe are once again in an election year. Only 2012 couldn't be more removed from 1992 in regards to politics, music, and politics in music. Take Dave Mustaine, current conservative mouthpiece of non-factual hatred towards our sitting president, the same man who twenty-years earlier released this forty-seven minute piece of left-leaning post-thrash that eventually won him a humane award for its lyrical content. Seems almost comical in hindsight but there's no getting around how critical Countdown To Extinction is of everything Mustaine has since lovingly embraced, whether its politics, economics, the environment, or faith, old-school Mega-Dave and new-school Christian-Dave couldn't be more different. But all that is really beside the point: music is our business and the music is mostly okay.\n\nThings start falteringly with \"Skin O' My Teeth,\" a speedier, up-tempo number that's barely a patch on what Megadeth was doing previously. With a stale left-over flavor, \"Skin O' My Teeth\" would've been b-side material at best previously and here its opening an album. Following this though is a multi-song run of brilliance starting with \"Symphony Of Destruction.\" For some, this song is played out and that's understandable. It was everywhere at the time: commercial rock radio, underground radio, MTV, etc. Think about that for a second. Think about the simple yet frighteningly effective and memorable riffs from this song. Think about Dave's menacing snarl and the utter conviction he brings to these lyrics. This is heavy shit and back in the 90's, you actually had a chance to hear this music. Or better still, \"Sweating Bullets,\" another huge track that was everywhere. And again, big-time staccato machine-gun style riffing and double-bass towards the finish with Dave's weird-voices \"I'm crazy\" lyrics and odd vocal delivery make this one of the heaviest songs to find minor mainstream acceptance. \n\nMost metalheads push back against this brief (and utterly minimal) flirtation with mainstream rock culture but the omnivorous devourment of diverse musics in the 90's helped many people in rural areas like myself discover metal. I do understand how they would tremble before the nauseating slickness of \"Foreclosure Of A Dream.\" Now I think this song is great but if I analyze my reasoning it falters along nostalgic lines. The clean tone guitar picking, vapid chugs, and Dave's nasal whine hitting obscene heights all make this track a strong indicator of Megadeth's impending and terminal decline. A skid into mediocrity accelerated by a mundane title track and stultifyingly moronic \"This Was My Life,\" lifeless midtempo tracks aimed at amiability and radio rock aesthetics. I find \"High Speed Dirt\" comical as well. It's a cheesy tune to begin with and that little bluegrass/banjo interlude just sets me laughing. What a joke of a song. \n\nThings do pick up towards the finish as \"Psychotron\" rips a serrated riff and a monstrous headbanging groove with sharp leads and a perfectly goofy Deathlok theme. And \"Ashes In Your Mouth\" has a nice syncopated groove, choppy riffs, and brilliant fretwork with an infectious chorus. It's a strong note on which to close. There's also \"Architecture Of Aggression,\" easily the best song on the record. I mention it last because it really highlights the strength of Megadeth's songwriting while demonstrating their commitment to remain metal in the face of commercialization. From the opening gunfire and rising synths through the shredding RIP-ish guitar riffs and solos, hard pounding drum fills, and menacing chorus, this track makes clear that Megadeth still have the thrash fire in their bellies. Had they stuck to those guns a little harder and not chased Metallica so much, their rep might not have ended up so quickly in tatters.\n\nIn retrospect, Countdown To Extinction is Megadeth in transition. Unlike their peers in Metallica and Anthrax, they didn't completely abandon their roots with this record, choosing instead to graft solid metal structures onto a more hybridized arena rock format, stipulating a post-thrash sound not entirely mired in posturing grooves, alternative navel-gazing or strutting cock-rock cliche. And they did it on the backs of four of the best songs they've ever written in \"Symphony Of Destruction,\" \"Sweating Bullets,\" \"Psychotron\" and \"Architecture Of Aggression.\" However, the consistency is lacking. Follow-up Youthanasia is actually a better all-around record than this, though the highs here are so much higher.\n",
        "\nI had originally heard of Megadeth because of this album so I really can't talk shit about it too much (oh wait, yes I can). However, once I got my hands on some Peace Sells...But Who's Buying?, Last Rites, and So Far, So Good...So What? well, let's just say Countdown to Extinction got put on the backburner for some serious thrash/speed metal that Megadeth was famous for in the 80s. I do have to commend Megadeth on this effort though. Because believe me, they could have gone so much softer and more commercial than whats presented on this album for 1992. With Nirvana and those fuckheads Metallica coming out with Nevermind (actually a good album) and Black Album (a steaming pile of dog shit) respectively, thrash was basically killed off and became a dying race. Move over for death metal and grunge. You had your turn on the merry-go-round. It was a nightmare for thrashers everywhere who thought our genre would last into the 90s.\n\nEven though I think this album is still a high quality Megadeth album I've always had my qualms about it. It seemed losing the thrash tag and trying to lengthen their reign into the new decade was the thing to do for thrash bands but, that's not really what metal is about.....is it? Isn't metal loved in a die-hard way because their bands and fans refuse to give up their principles and answer to no higher power? You're not supposed to make compromises in a thrash metal band! Especially with your music! Why all of the sudden just because of a new genre of music rears its ugly head in the early 90s did metal bands try to emulate it and try to become something they're not? I mean back in the 80s there was New Wave/Synthpop, Post-Punk, Michael Jackson, Bruce Springsteen and plenty of other popular genres of music but I will bet you not ONE of the thrash metal bands back then just suddenly jumped up and said \"Holy Shit! Bruce Springsteen just released Born in the USA and everyone loves it! We gotta sound like that now to be successful!\" \n\nI guess where I'm going with this is Countdown to Extinction marks the point in Megadeth's career where the vital areas were shown. At least, to me, it showed not even Megadeth were safe from the commercial, everyone-copy-whatever-Metallica-or-Nirvana-does-or-you-won't-be-a-success fad in the 90s that plagued and claimed so many other thash bands in its wake (thank god we have death metal and black metal). The songs are extremely catchy and well-written but I would say only half or maybe even less than half can be considered thrash metal songs. The sound is produced well, but for all you thrashers out there that are looking for a Black Friday or Five Magics level of insanity in the songs and raw production, stay away. As for musicianship the guitars and vocals by Dave are the best on the album even if the guitar work has been dumbed down since Rust in Peace. Mustaine can still write riffs that's for sure. Nick Menza's drumwork has also been dumbed down since RIP but has moments his moments in songs like Psychotron and Ashes in Your Mouth. Otherwise I get kinda disappointed in the drumming because it's mainly a 4/4 kick snare kick snare beat most of the time with unenthusiastic fills. The Rust in Peace drumming shits all over this. The bass is also uninspiring although the tone suits the music. Gone are Dave Ellefson's creative fills like in Peace Sells or Killing is My Business.\n\nTo start off, Menza begins with a short drum fill and Dave opens up with the riff to Skin O' My Teeth. This is one of the faster, upbeat songs on the album and has a wide intervallic solo from Friedman. Simple riff yet so very effective. One fo the stronger tracks and a perfect opener. Symphony of Destruction is very plodding and the verse riff sounds like they came up with it at the last minute. The bridge and chorus is cool though with the descending arpeggios. I've played this one over so many times and heard it too much. Architecture of Aggression is one of my favorite tracks on the CTE. The riffs are played with calculated accuracy and Dave is no longer straining himself in the vocal department as he would occasionally on Rust in Peace. Throughout the whole album Dave adopts a lower singing style approach without losing the edge or grit in his delivery, something I wish he would do today since his voice sounds like Spongebob nowadays. Anyways, Architecture is the song on this album I find gets stuck in my head the most. There's time changes, thoughtful lyrics, riffs, as always, and two realy solid solos by Marty. A highlight for sure. Foreclosure of a Dream is also very catchy and alternates between clean verses and hard driving choruses. Once again, Dave delivers vocally on this song perfectly, putting plenty of feeling into the performance. The clean guitars and harmonized leads are great too. I'm not too fond of the meaning of the song but I can let that slide. It just goes to show that political messages, liberal or conservative, should never be more important than the music being played. \n\nSweating Bullets. What can I say. Genius song about schizophrenia and losing your sanity. Best lyrics on the damn album. Some people say they can't stand Dave's vocals on this one but I think they're funny as hell and delightfully evil. Listen to the solo and the riffs after it. So damn heavy. This one never gets old no matter how many times I play it. \"..........Mankind has gotta know.....his limitations.\" This Was My Life is just ok. Really simple, unimpressive solo by Mustaine. Just a few notes on the E string and thats it. Phantom Lord clean part alert! Countdown to Extinction is just ok too. It tries to be Foreclosure of a Dream but falls short. It tries to be bombastic or dynamic but in the end is too held back for its own good. High Speed Dirt has very good riffs but is too happy. Psychotron is a mid paced chugger with numerous extended solos by Marty. Highly recommended. Captive Honour, along with AoA, are my two favorite songs on here. A melodic, minor intro comes in then is followed by a hilarious skit/spoken word thing in between with a judge, jury, the victim, and a black guy. \"Boy your soul better belong to Jesus.....MMHHHMMMMM....cause your ass belongs to me HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA\" Snaking, weaving riffs followed by some EPIC solos by Dave and Marty round this one out. Pure hilarity and monster riffs/solos make this one for me. For some reason on this song, the tone is much harsher and just adds to the music. Finally we end with Ashes in Your Mouth which sounds like an outtake from Rust in Peace. If the whole album sounded like this song it would probably get a 90-95%. This is perhaps the only true thrash song on the album. The riffs are played at breakneck speed and goes from a heavy shred rhythm to a melodic Maiden-esque progression towards the end. A final cadenza by Nick and the album's done. \n\nThis I think is the last Megadeth album that I can listen to all the way and not skip a track. The majority of the songs are strong but are nowhere near what they could have been if Megadeth would have stuck to their roots instead of becoming plaid-clad-warriors. As time would go on, my interest waned with Megadeth's future releases. Youthanasia is basically Countdown Part II but even more commercial. Yuck. I have the biggest love-hate relationship with this album because the songs and delivery are there and they mean well but you cannot deny this is where Megadeth stopped saying to themselves: How can we top our last album? How can we become something better than what we accomplished a year or two ago? \n\nIf I may add one more thing: Now you can agree or disagree with me, I personally don't care but I think Marty Friedman was responsible for the \"demise\" of the classic Megadeth. I've seen interviews, listened to the music, and did my homework. Go ahead look up the video on Headbangers Ball that shows Countdown being produced and Rikki Rachtman interviews the guys. Marty says he had no input, save for the solos, on RIP. On Countdown he said he had way more input. RED FLAG ALERT. This is the guy who was playing in 3rd rate glam/hair bands in the mid 80s (save for Cacophony) and although he had chops, he is not metal by any means. I'm not trying to sound like an elitist here but why do you think Iron Maiden kicked out Dennis Stratton after the first album? The guy hated the more harder edged songs and preferred softer rock AOR stuff. NOT COOL. Why do you think they kicked Glen Matlock out of the Sex Pistols? Cause he raved about the Beatles way too damn much. WHY DO YOU THINK GEORGE LYNCH TRIED OUT FOR OZZY TWICE AND DIDN'T GET THE GIG? Because George Lynch can't write a metal lick to save his life. I love George Lynch's playing, but he's not metal at all. He was in Dokken for fuck's sake. Can you imagine Lynch trying to come up with songs that could hold a candle to Diary of a Madman? Yeah right. And I'm Mary Queen of Scots. He simply is NOT METAL. My single biggest reservation about this album and Megadeth after Rust in Peace is Marty Friedman. The music speaks for itself. As soon as he got a little leeway to give his share, he softened the band with his \"rock\" riffs and sub-par contributions. The guy can play the shit out of a guitar, but apparently Megadeth \"wasn't aggressive enough for him.\" And this is the guy who played on Risk, Cryptic Writings, Youthanasia, and CTE, the softest albums of Megadeth's career because of him. Go shove Peace Sells...But Who's Buying up your ass you pretentious poser and learn what aggressive really means.\n\nWell, I put my two cents in. Recommended Megadeth album but suffers from slow/commercial/non-thrash offerings and dumbed down musicianship. 73% is being EXTREMELY generous on this one.\nAs Dr. Evil says: \"You're quasi-evil. You're semi-evil. You're the margarine of evil. You're the diet Coke of evil.\" This is the Diet Coke of Megadeth's career. The beginning of the end.\n",
        "\nRevenge- (n.): to exact punishment or expiation for a wrong on behalf of, especially in a resentful or vindictive spirit. \n\nSo put yourself in Dave Mustaine's shoes for just a moment in 1983. \n\nYou're just about to record your debut album which is sure to have an intense following and will be remembered throughout the history of metal as one of the seminal offerings in the beginning of the thrash movement. Your chops are better than anyone else's in the band and you've written half the album's songs and nearly all the solos. Your riffs are completely unheard of for the time period in terms of speed and precision and you have been known to steal the spotlight on and off the stage. Next thing you know, you wake up, your bandmates say you're out of the band, basically tell you to fuck off, and leave you to travel 2600 miles back home on a Greyhound bus (Yes, I did the math if you're wondering). Not much later, you find out the album is released with your songs AND SOLOS on it and they're being copied by some dude named Kirk Hammett and your so-called bandmates. \n\nThis must have been the single biggest kick to the nuts Dave had ever received at this point in his life and there wasn't much he could do about it, except become something greater than he was before. High on revenge and taking no prisoners Dave formed Megadeth and struck back with a searing vengeance.\n\nThe demo starts off with Bach's Toccata and Fugue in D Minor played on the piano by Mustaine (Haha this is literally the only part of the demo that won't crush your skull in) along with Junior on bass then completely fucking erupts into your face with the riff from Loved to Death. You like the KIMB version of Loved to Death? Well, this one is played at about twice the speed and has the concussive power of a nuclear bomb. The distortion on Dave's guitar is on complete overhaul and is sure to melt even the most veteran metalhead's skull. Believe it or not, for a demo, you can hear every instrument and vocal pretty damn good....maybe because everything is pushed up so damn high! The beginning screams and vocals reek of pure hatred and contempt in Loved to Death and the attitude on here is undeniably bloodthirsty and savage. The breakdown towards the end is evil as hell with the tortured screams and Dave laughing like Satan himself. That verse riff that almost sounds offbeat is even more manic and complex on this track due to the speed it's played at too. It doesn't take an idiot to realize that just a couple three minutes into listening to this demo, it's already surpassed the energy level of everything in its day, not just Kill 'Em All. \n\nNow the Mechanix. Dave scrapes the guitar 8 times to set the beat and off it fucking goes. This version of the Mechanix is played inhumanly fast. Compare this speed to Wehrmacht's Shark Attack album or Dark Angel's The Burning of Sodom. Yes. It's that fucking fast. It is the definition of supersonic. You think Dave plays fast on Holy Wars? Five Magics? Rattlehead? You don't know shit. This is at least, AT LEAST, 280 beats per minute. Dave is just as unforgiving on Mechanix as Loved to Death. The breakdowns in the middle of the song with the E and F chords just slice away. The riffing will turn heads and lay waste to all who oppose it. The solo in this song is bar none the best on the demo. It does not let up...and why should it? You've already signed your death warrant after the intro to Loved to Death didn't you? Insanely fast chromatic and pentatonic runs end in an explosive finale and Dave screams one last roar. I cannot stress enough the sheer terror and relentless assault this track holds. It is very overwhelming and will kick your ass over and over again.\n\nSkull Beneath the Skin is noticeably different from the first two tracks because of the sound. The sound on this actually feels like a garage setting and the sound is kinda flat. That's not to say it lets up in the least bit. The vocals are a tad whiny but Dave is all over the fretboard on this one. The solo fills are well thought out and this version is many more times menacing than the KIMB version. \n\nOn a side note: Although I would never doubt metal-archives I have heard of many different line ups on this demo. I've heard Rausch-Mustaine-Ellefson (I believe this one), Mustaine-Poland-Ellefson-Rausch (the one Metal-archives says), and Mustaine-Ellefson-Samuelson. I found this confusing because I always thought Samuelson was in the band first then Chris came along once Gar gave Mustaine a tip about him. Who knows.\n\nLast Rites is an amazing look at the anger, ferocity, and uncontrollable lust for revenge Dave radiated back in 1984. Running through thrash releases in my head, I cannot think of one that is faster and more ferocious than this one for the year, 1984. Haunting the Chapel and the Overkill EPs come close but falls short of the pure energy and viciousness of it. Every solo on this demo is beyond anything anyone back then was playing and proves that Dave was only a shadow of his true potential in Metallica. The riffing is ingenious, complex, manic, and unrelenting. Did I mention it was fast? ......Fuck. You have to listen to it to believe it. The cover art is killer too. Last Rites showed that Dave had the means to take on the world and, I think, proves he is the architect of thrash metal. If Metallica ever listened to this back in the day they probably shit their pants realizing they released the thrash metal equivalent to Pandora's box.\n\nI only docked points for the sound on Skull Beneath the Skin. Besides that, this demo is the rawest most over the top Megadeth release ever. It hits hard from beginnning to end and has never disappointed me. Dave surely got his revenge and it showed from the very beginning how much he craved for it.\n\nLIVE FOR METAL........DIE FOR ]\\/[EGADET]-[\n",
        "\nAnother compilation of hits from Megadeth. This time around the songs were chosen by the Megadeth forum members. But isn't it weird enough, that many a best-scoring song doesn't appear here? Why? Hey, money talks, if you didn't know! It says that \"the track list for this collection is largely the result of a poll...\" Yeah, largely, which is still true, because the singles scored well anyways.\n\nI enjoy most of the songs here, even the 'Risk' (1999) one, 'Prince of Darkness'. But the problem is, that there are so many overplayed songs, which you hear in concerts or on a radio. Or then not, as these are 2004 remixes! Those remixes of all Megadeth albums from 1980's and -90's are something I don't want to hear. 'Kill the King' is a nice surprise at least, because it's more rare a song. If I'd make my own Megadeth \"best of\" CD, some of these songs would appear on it, but nowhere near every single one.\n\nWhy I bought this, then? I bought this because of the bonus DVD. I bet many Megadeth fans did, and will. I got this album as new for under 7 Euros, so it felt like a bargain. At least sort of. The DVD's main attraction is, as one would think, live at Fillmore Auditorium, Denver, Colorado 27th December 1999. However, only seven songs are available here, but probably because their studio versions can be found on the CD. Lame... The band sound incredibly bored, as there's no energy flowing at all. This was one of the last gigs for guitarist Marty Friedman, so Mr. Mustaine acted as usual to thank his band mate for all the years and mixed Friedman's guitar very, very quiet. Only Marty's solos and some other bits are really audible. LAME! Thank you, Dave Mustaine, for this totally unnecessary live abomination. It's not even of bootleg quality. The video clip for 'Kill the King' is the best thing here. It's \"nice\", that it appears here and not on 'Arsenal of Megadeth' with other video clips (minus 'Crush 'Em'). Simply too \"buy 'em all\" mentality from the record label and the band. Well, so is the video, because it is just a collage with cuts from older video clips...\n\nThis is NOTHING BUT AN AWFUL CASH IN, so a huge \"fuck off\" to Capitol Records!!! I wanted to write this as a warning! Only for true Megadeth completists, this one.\n\n(originally written for ArchaicMetallurgy.com in 2010)\n",
        "\nDoing great live albums is something very difficult and most of the times, requires more than just great performing and a lively crowd singing the songs. It needs charisma, needs to be felt outside the CD. Needs to take the listener to that place, feeling it.\n\nI always tend to think that real metal bands are made on the stage. Playing. Performing. Soloing. Drumming. Beating. Shouting. No more and no less. Studio phenomenons are for pop listeners. Metal is live, so be it.\n\nWhen Deep Purple created \"Made in Japan\", it was like they were saying: \"This is it, guys, learn from us. Black Sabbath created metal riffing and sound, we created metal performance and live dynamics\". From that day on, the cited legendary record remains an inspiration for every metal performer who wants to do it right. And let me say, with the possibility of being wrong, that this album, by Megadeth, almost made me feel like that first time when I've heard Made in Japan. An uproarious and charismatic mix of banging guitars, drums and basses banging and beating heads off. There is nothing more.\n\nThe opening, simply, rashes blood to every head and prepares the circulation flux of the body for the motion. Recreating Rust in Peace in a live performance requires no less. So, from the beginning until the end, from Holy Wars to the Reprise, we find the deeper roots of power planted by Megadeth, to me, the finest thrash band of America.\n\nHoly Wars, the Punishment Due kicks off the album and, let's say, that's a powerful one. Clean and pure, Megadeth sounds like a perfected machine, a machine that gained accuracy and finesse during all these years until today. Finally, Mustaine has found a suitable line-up for doing his thing. Nowadays, we can really talk again about \"Megadeth\" as a band and not just the solo project of that nice red-haired guy. Almost automatically, Hangar 18 leads us to one of the finest moments of the record. Power rages on, keeps growing, built with a thick, dense atmosphere created by the beat lines, the powerful drumming and the pumping bass. Like a powerful streak of continued and raw music, Take no Prisoners, Five Magics, Poison Was the Cure and Lucretia, nice fillers in the original \"Rust in Peace\" album, here sound like magnus opus of the band. Specially Lucretia, an underrated piece with nice tempo and bright singing.\n\nDot and apart, the finest moment comes with Tornado of Souls. The guitar riffing mixed with a thunderous singing and an unique rythmic pattern drawed by that nice society bass-drumming gives us the high point of the first part of the show. Like the tip of an iceberg, Dawn Patrol and Rust in Peace are brilliant closers of the finest album ever made by Megadeth.\n\nThen, dropping the hits like a deluge of thunder, non stop highway in the middle of a deflagration, is priceless. For the sweet taste of many lovers of the band formed by Mustaine, Ellefson, Broderick and Drover, a rollercoaster of classic, maybe in their best shape ever in a live performance, punches us into the stomach and leaves us filled with rampage power and emotion. The second part of the show is made with Megadeth's classic hits and here we figure out how evolved has become the society of the band. Thy have proven nowhere else but in a live performance (is there other way to?) what they really are. I don't need to detail how bright and powerful sounds the second part of the show in the album. A handful of classics and that's it. The only bad critics I can make here is the kinda unpolished and non-cared sound we get. Maybe a sound mix problem? We can't tell. But we can feel how great this performance was, and this record justly belongs to that ancient linage Made in Japan started, almost 40 years ago.\n",
        "\nThe Mustaine train has been rolling on a steady uptrend since the collapse of musical credibility that was \u201cRisk\u201d, producing a string of albums that have been increasingly more consistent and ultimately, more political. While Megadeth has always been a socially aware institution with its roots firmly in the mentality of the punk scene, the politics of the lyrics have been on a fairly steady evolution in response to the goings on of the time. The peak of this upward movement towards former glory seems to have peaked with the release of \u201cEndgame\u201d, as the latest incarnation of the band sees a return of longtime band mate Dave Ellefson, but also a few steps back in the musical department.\n\n\u201cTh1rt3en\u201d saw the usual string of promotional singles before the main course was unleashed upon the masses, and it was in these appetizers that somewhat deceptive picture of how this album would turn out was established. The lead off song \u201cSudden Death\u201d was the first single, and it presents this album at its most aggressive, which turns out to be a somewhat modern sounding half-thrash song with a slight hint of pre-thrash heavy metal that somewhat resembles a faster song on a 90s Overkill release. The song is heavily sugared up with solos to the point of being pretentious, which was a staple of \u201cUnited Abominations\u201d and seems to have been one of the dominant influences on the shape of this overall album. This somewhat overblown song was followed up with \u201cNever Dead\u201d which ventures the closest to the thrashing glory of \u201cEndgame\u201d with a thudding mixture of riffs and angry growls, and a more radio friendly yet still rocking mid-tempo rocker in \u201cPublic Enemy No. 1\u201d.\n\nSadly enough, these 3 promotional songs prove to be almost the full extent of this album\u2019s glory moments. Coming in behind them is a mishmash of earlier influences, essentially retracing much of Mustaine\u2019s various songwriting eras from 1992 to 2007, and what sounds like a systematic of anything resembling his greater moments from earlier or on the last album. The best parts come in with a couple of asides into Dave\u2019s politics in \u201cNew World Order\u201d and \u201cWe The People\u201d, which hearken back to the \u201cYouthanasia\u201d days the most with a slower feel and a much more formulaic structure that borderlines on radio rock. The most intense moments of these songs are generally found during the lead breaks, as catchiness is the implicit goal of these songs, and in this respect they are a success.\n\nThe bulk of the remaining contents on this album generally go for the 90s Megadeth sound, sometimes resembling \u201cCountdown To Extinction\u201d, at others going for the non-thrash metal yet still reasonably good album that followed it. There\u2019s a handful of songs here that are pretty catchy, particularly \u201cMillennium Of The Blind\u201d which brings in the ballad element a bit yet manages to remain fairly heavy and aggressive, and even brings in a bit of a sing along factor. With the exception of the closing flop of a title song \u201c13\u201d, which reminds of the more limp-wristed balladry heard on select songs of \u201cThe World Needs A Hero\u201d, nothing on here comes off as being overtly awful, but it definitely wants for more energy, especially compared to the last couple of albums.\n\nAs best as can be articulated; this album should have been released between \u201cThe System Has Failed\u201d and \u201cUnited Abominations\u201d. It is possible to present a better album while using a past template as a guide for molding together songs, as was proven on the last album, but here it just doesn\u2019t quite hit the mark and gets bogged down in too many similar sounding ideas. This approach to songwriting works when the tempo is faster and the songs tend to be either shorter or done in a more artful fashion, but neither of those things really materializes on here. This is not an essential purchase for those outside the Megadeth club, and core fans are encouraged to seek this album second hand or maybe just cherry pick the mp3s of the better songs.\n",
        "\nI'll start off by saying that there are some bands that sound good throughout their entire career. Sure, they might release a shitty album here and there, but they always sound great whether playing their legendary or shitty material. Megadeth, however, is a different case. The many years of feuding and trying to be better than Metallica has hampered Dave's creative process. How else could you make Endgame and then follow up with a shittier version 2 years later? That's got to be the reason because what else could have caused this?\n\nI'll start of with the vocals because they are my biggest issue with the album. To put it lightly, they are bad. I had to cringe my teeth while listening because hearing those forced vocals that Dave spits out is a torture. Now I know that Dave hasn't gotten any younger and his voice deteriorated, but I will go as far as to say that even Hetfield sounded better on Death Magnetic. The lyrics aren't that clever either and relying on repetition (Public Enemy No. 1) does not always work.\n\nThe riffs themselves sound recycled. There is not a lot of distinction between them, and even the songs themselves lack it, too. Not only that but they also bore the hell out of me. This modern Megadeth sound irks me the most. However I will admit that there are some cool parts such as in \"Deadly Nightshade\" and occasionally good solos here and there.\n\nTo sum it up, this is like Endgame except even worse. So Megadeth diehards and fanboys alike rejoice for yet another thrash release by the once great Megadeth. As for me, I am grateful that through the power of the internet I was able to hear this album without spending my hard-earned money on it, and so should you.\n",
        "\nThe first time I listened to\"Endgame\", I felt it was a reunion of Mustaine with the old fashioned style that made him so great and unique in the 80's, that same style that brought us \"Peace Sells... But Who's Buying?\", \"So Far... So Good... So What?\" (so underrated), and \"Rust in Peace\". However, with \"13\" (I'm not gonna explain how childish the actual name spells), it's like Dave took a middle point between \"Youthanasia\" and \"Countdown to Extinction\" without the mid-paced rhythm of the first and the reminiscent youthful anger of the last one. You might think that this is a good thing, but let me tell you: it isn't. This is not a good record, and in my humble opinion it's a step down from their previous effort.\n\nIt doesn't start off badly as the first two tracks give attitude to the album. \"Sudden Death\" and \"Public Enemy No. 1\" are very motivational, you might say. They're fast, evil, and start off the record in a good way. Like I said in a previous review, \"Sudden Death\" is one of the best releases from Megadeth in years. The on and on changing between Mustaine and Broderick in the solo department kinda reminds me of \"Hangar 18\" with the technical and skillful performance. After these two, you get a few fillers that really don't bring anything new to the table. This, in particular, is one of the things that bothers me more about this release: is full of non-sense, juvenile tracks all around. Not only has about three songs that were already presented in prior records, but some of the new ones are plain boring. \n\nThen, \"Never Dead\" comes and gives another kick to the album with a mysterious and sober intro that turns into a riff-fest with fast drumming to go along. The lyrics, again like in \"Sudden Death\", take a detour in the political rebel way that Mustaine always tends to use and gives more emphasis on the darkness and evil, using analogies of the zombies and the torments of the undead. From there, is a downstream of slow catchy tunes, with a couple of good riffs. If this was another band, I wouldn't care. But, people, this is fucking Megadeth! You can't expect three or four good songs on a whole record with these guys. \n\nSomething that really highlights \"Th1rt3en\" (I had to spell it, otherwise it would be confused with the track...FUCK!) is the production. The bass and drums are thick and it's heavy with crisp guitars piercing your ears with the (I have to accept it) amazing solos that Broderick and Mustaine bring us. As has become a costume in the new century releases from Megadeth, the aspect done in the post-recording is done properly. Sometimes, you wonder how \"Killing is my Business...\" would sound like with a production like this.\n\nLike I said at the beginning of this review, I enjoyed the sound on \"Endgame\" and this is clearly a watered down effort in comparison. To be honest, it's a mediocre effort from these giants. And this is from a man that has a Deth' title song as an username. I really hope that Dave takes back everything that was done right in \"Endgame\", make an improvement, and dump every radio friendly ideas that has been carrying along for several years. I'm not expecting (like so many) \"Rust in Peace 2\" or something like that, but Dave is old enough and has come a long way, to write something better.\n\nP.S: Mustaine has been posting lately little teaser videos about the 14th production, and it feels just like the teaser videos that he released prior to this. Please, Dave, prove me wrong!\n",
        "\nOne the most glaring problems with metal\u2019s nostalgia fetish is that bands\u2019 latest releases are constantly being judged in terms of their legacies/past glories, rather than the actual content of the new offering being evaluated. This is especially true of the genre\u2019s titans, most of whom were blessed/cursed with releasing perfect or damn near perfect albums early on in their careers. Such is the case with Megadeth, who are shouldered with the considerable burden of having released not one but two genre-defining thrash albums in the form of Peace Sells\u2026 But Who\u2019s Buying? and Rust in Peace.\n\nThis is part of a larger problem. Metal doesn\u2019t take kindly to its heroes growing up. Average joe\u2019s like you and me are allowed to change through the years, but our favorite musicians aren\u2019t. I\u2019m not the same person I was twenty years ago, but for some reason Dave Mustaine is expected to remain the same fucked up, angry young man that wrote \u201cHoly Wars\u2026 The Punishment Due\u201d and \u201cTake No Prisoners\u201d. Um, guys, I hate to be the one to break it to you, but MegaDave is fifty years old, sober, and down with the G-O-D (the latter much to my chagrin). I realize that metal is positively filled with sufferers of \u201cPeter Pan Syndrome\u201d and some metal veterans have admirably held on to their original fire (see Sabbat\u2019s Gezol and Vader\u2019s Piotr Wiwczarek), yet I can\u2019t help but look at things from my own perspective; I\u2019m 32 years old this month, I\u2019m happily married and have a good job\u2026 acting like the pissed off teenager who wants to \u201cfuck on the floor and break shit\u201d (to borrow a phrase from Henry Rollins) seems a tad silly. Does this make me a \u201csellout\u201d or \u201cnot metal\u201d? I think metal is in your heart and your soul, not in juvenile, over-the-top antics, or trying to re-write an album you wrote two decades ago, and I think scene godfathers like Mustaine would agree with me. Just because you\u2019ve grown up and are content in life doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019ve lost your passion. Expecting Mustaine (or any other artist for that matter) to be in the same place musically and artistically at fifty as he was in his twenties is just flat out ridiculous. Human beings do not exist in stasis.\n\nWhich brings us to Th1rt3en (henceforth referred to as Thirteen because I\u2019m far too lazy to keep spelling it that way), Megadeth\u2019s thirteenth album (duh) and the first to feature long lost bassist David Ellefson since 2001\u2032s The World Needs a Hero. On paper, the hodgepodge nature of the album (two songs written for video games, three that have already appeared as demo/bonus tracks for older Megadeth releases + a handful of brand new songs) seems like a recipe for disaster or a sign of lacking inspiration, but Megadeth manages to rustle up a cohesive album that largely sounds to these ears like a cross between Youthanasia and Cryptic Writings (okay, I know I just griped at length about people making these types of comparisons earlier, but I guess it\u2019s inevitable\u2026 shit). Some of you will immediately dismiss the album based on that comparison alone, but as someone who grew up with and also happens to dig that era of Megadeth, I\u2019m all for Mustaine and Co. not taking the obvious route of attempting to create Rust in Peace 2.0.\n\nOf course, with thirteen tracks and almost an hour run-time, Thirteen isn\u2019t without a few clunkers. \u201dGuns, Drugs and Money\u201d \u201cFast Lane\u201d and \u201cWrecker\u201d are the obvious filler songs that should\u2019ve remained unfinished in the studio, but even these lesser tracks aren\u2019t completely unlistenable. On the other hand, there are numerous songs that exhibit Megadeth\u2019s patented blend of precision, aggression and technical wizardry to the fullest, such as \u201cBlack Swan\u201d \u201cDeadly Nightshade\u201d \u201cNever Dead\u201d and \u201cSudden Death\u201d. Mustaine and Chris Broderick (ex Jag Panzer, Nevermore) deliver some serious guitar pyrotechnics, with Broderick cementing himself as the best six-string foil for Mustaine since Marty Friedman. Some of these songs might have been around since the nineties, but Megadeth inject them with plenty of energy and modernity, making you wonder why they waited until now to include them on a proper album.\n\nOf course, it doesn\u2019t hurt that Thirteen is ridiculously catchy front-to-back, probably the most infectious batch of songs Mustaine has put together since the aforementioned Cryptic Writings (damn, I did it again). I\u2019m a sucker for catchy choruses, and make no mistake that this album is rife with them, from the political call to arms that is \u201cWe The People\u201d to the nightmarish \u201cDeadly Nightshade\u201d. Megadeth have always been expert craftsmen, but it really feels like this time out they put extra emphasis on creating memorable hooks. I\u2019ll put it this way, I can\u2019t remember any of the choruses off the top of my head from United Abominations or Endgame, but numerous refrains from Thirteen are already well upon their way to committing themselves to the inner workings of the skull beneath my skin for all eternity.\n\nIn addition to being brimming with multiple guitargasms and catchier-than-herpes choruses, Thirteen sounds great. There had been some concern regarding Megadeth\u2019s choice of nu metal guru Johnny K to produce, but fear not rattleheads, Thirteen still sounds like a Megadeth album. While K\u2019s production scheme might not be quite as crisp and biting as Andy Sneap\u2019s (producer on United Abominations and Endgame), there\u2019s still plenty of crunch and bottom end, which serves Megadeth well whether they\u2019re channelling Black Sabbath on \u201cMillenium of the Blind\u201d, getting thrashtastic on \u201cSudden Death\u201d and all points in-between.\n\nMegadeth have put out a killer album with Thirteen. Fans expecting a rehash of the band\u2019s past will be extremely disappointed, but those willing to throw their absurd expectations out the window and listen to the album on its own terms will find much to enjoy. Thirteen is not a perfect album, but it is a damn good album; another impressive addition to Megadeth\u2019s discography that serves to further solidify the band\u2019s position as the most consistent, musical and technically sound member of thrash\u2019s Big 4.\n\nOriginally written for http://thatshowkidsdie.com\n",
        "\nI\u2019m not superstitious either, but in this case number thirteen really means BAD LUCK for Dave, the other Dave, and the lads. AND the fans! This album is really disappointing, though I\u2019m not exactly the greatest Megadeth fan out there. I can name several thrash metal bands I vastly prefer to listen to, but I consider Rust in Peace one of the greatest albums ever and an absolute favorite, easily among my top ten metal albums. Besides classic Megadeth albums, I have also fairly enjoyed the band\u2019s 21st Century output, especially their previous album, Endgame, which I found to be interesting and engaging, with varied songs ranging from speedy numbers to moodier and catchy but still heavy tunes. I was hoping for at least a continuation of that quality with TH1RTH3N, maybe even an improvement, as Endgame was good but far from perfect. Instead, MegaDave has produced a really lackluster album, a resounding step back, back to their mid-late 90\u2019s mediocre material.\n\nThe main problem here, are the riffs. That\u2019s almost the only thing wrong with this album, but it\u2019s more than enough. At this stage of their career, you can\u2019t (or shouldn\u2019t) expect a band like Megadeth to have production issues or bad musicianship, and of course none of that is found here. However, sub-par riffage and mediocre songwriting are constant threats to any band, novice or veteran alike. And this album features really boring and uninspiring riffs found in most of its thirteen compositions. Moreover, most songs are totally forgettable and just plain boring. There\u2019s not much to hold one\u2019s attention on, though the album starts in a deceiving way with its strongest songs, \u201cSudden Death\u201d and \u201cPublic Enemy No. 1\u201d. Not excellent, legendary stuff, but altogether quite enjoyable and memorable. The first one is a faster, lead-filled tune, that harkens back to their 80\u2019s classic stuff, and the second one is more akin to their heavy/thrash hybrid style of the 90\u2019s, catchy and radio-friendly yet worthy of attention. \n\nAnd that\u2019s about it folks. The rest of the songs, are totally disposable exercises in amazing (from a technical point of view) soloing and a few catchy vocal lines the ones only MegaDave con utter. Like I hinted before, musicianship here is rock-solid. But there\u2019s not much cohesion keeping it rolling. Those sweet solos and choruses are mixed with insipid rhythms and mediocre song structures. Lyrics are best left unmentioned please. Not even mighty David Ellefson shines here like he should. And is not that the songs sound the same, they don\u2019t, and are rather diverse, from mildly fast thrashers like \u201cNever Dead\u201d, \u201cFast Lane\u201d and \u201cWrecker\u201d, to heavy groovy tracks such as \u201cWe the People\u201d, \u201cGuns, Drugs & Money\u201d (the mariachi ending was a nice touch though) or \u201cDeadly Nightshade\u201d, to the most obnoxious of the bunch, the ballads \u201cMillennium of the Blind\u201d and \u201c13\u201d itself. Bad luck to us all. \n\nTruth be told, there\u2019s only another song I could consider a highlight of sorts, and that would be \u201cBlack Swan\u201d, a limping warrior amidst crippled soldiers. Deep inside the album, it grabs your attention right as it starts with a nice lead intervention, waking you from the somniferous effect induced by the rest of the tracks. Its greatest asset, are the memorable vocal lines, but it also boasts decent riffs. Ironically, the only thing keeping it away from stellar status is that it lacks a strong solo, unlike other, less-compelling songs of the album, and instead we have a few-second inoffensive fret-board attack. However that\u2019s not the case, sadly. Again, bad luck to us all.\n\nDeth\u2019s thirteenth (so sick of that number by now) album ends up inoffensive and bland. In comparison, the so-so but overall better Worship Music by Anthrax sounds like a modern Peace Sells\u2026But Who\u2019s Buying?. To leave things clear, I wasn\u2019t expecting or craving for a Rust in Peace part II, that would be entirely na\u00efve. But neither did I expect something as bad and tasteless as Cryptic Writings. This record is not entirely worthless, but I wouldn\u2019t recommend it even to rabid Megadeth fans, although I\u2019m afraid that won\u2019t stop them from lauding this album. And again, bad luck to us all.\n",
        "\nI love when a new Megadeth CD is released. It's not even because I'm a huge fan of the band. It's because the reviews are always so polarized. The negative ones are often hilarious in their use of verbiage to explain why nobody should like the CD, particularly Megadeth fans. The same stock arguments always appear: it's not another Rust in Peace, and it's not fast enough. Gah. You'd think that by now people would 1) realize that Megadeth, after all the credit they gave Endgame, is pretty damn good with styles other than balls-out thrash, and 2) stop buying shit they are apparently predestined not to like. I mean, the amount of dumbassery involved with buying a CD you're not going to like just to review it and then copy-and-paste the review to a bunch of websites (apart from this Holy Shrine of Awesomeness, of course) is worthy of a philosophy Master's thesis. There has to be some seriously inflated self-worth involved; that, or some sort of immunity to how Congress is continuously managing to not fix the economy. Either point clearly bears investigation.\n\nFortunately for me, I subscribe to the Schwarzenegger school of thought, which states \"If it bleeds, we can kill it.\" This is commonly interpreted as per the performing arts as \"If it rocks, we can mosh to it.\" Besides, I already know that I have a hugely inflated opinion of myself, so I'm perfectly fine spending my time writing music reviews because, clearly, people need to know the shit that's inside my head. Seriously. OK, there was supposed to be a review in here somewhere...\n\nOh yeah, Megadeth. New CD and crap. \n\nPersonally, I had mixed hopes for Th1rt3en. Th1rt3en. I have to think twice when typing so it doesn't come out as Thirteen. In fact, let's start there with Th1rt3en. And thirteen, actually (that one wasn't a typo). Me, I got why Mustaine chose Th1rt3en for the title. It's a significant number in Megadeth. It's their thirteenth studio album, he started playing guitar at thirteen, and so on. Oh and holy crap I just realized that there are actually thirteen songs. Th1rt3en! It's a title, give the guy a break. And when you think about it, it's a pretty insightful title, even. Plenty of releases have WTF titles, yet awesome music. It's like nobody has seen a pre-Heartwork Carcass CD, which is almost blasphemous in its own right. Besides, Mustaine earned the permanent right to use whatever collection of letters and/or numbers to title his CDs when he came up with...Capitol Punishment!\n\nBack to my mixed hopes for the CD. See, as an admittedly huge Megadeth fan, I used to buy singles, EPs, and imports back when they actually meant something, as in they had b-sides you couldn't get otherwise. I wanted all the songs, dammit. Hell, I even bought four copies of Cryptic Writings, so I could have the normal release, the black covered release, the two-disc Japanese release with Live Trax II, and the Japanese release with One Thing. As a result, my bank card emits a weird noise I can only assume is a cry for help when a new Megadeth release comes along. It's OK dude, they're doing BS live cuts of stuff we already have at this point, relax. What this all means is that when the track listing came out, I did a double-take. New World Order? Millenium of the Blind? Black Swan? Hold on a minute here, I've already got those, Dave. Has the economy also launched a blitzkrieg on your bank statement? I can relate. There was Sudden Death-already released, Public Enemy No. 1-already played to death on my Zune as the first single release, and Whose Life (Is It Anyways?)-played slightly less as he second single release. So I was really only thinking I'd get seven brand-new songs. So with a chunk of the CD already old news, I was a bit skeptical as to the effort they'd go to get the rest of it out. It seemed to me like they were just going through the motions to get away from Roadrunner. There's also the fact that I really enjoyed Endgame, and was hoping for something spectacular as a follow-up, particularly with Ellefson back on the bass.\n\nOK, mostly, it turns out that I wasn't disappointed. Let's get the easy stuff out of the way first: the production. This might be the best-produced Megadeth CD yet. Everything is crystal clear, the mix is solid, and even played through crappy earbuds you can hear each instrument playing its part. A lot of times the bass guitar gets lost behind the wall of distortion provided by the guitarists, or the drums get mixed too far to the front confusing everything. This certainly isn't the case here. My only gripe is that you can hear EVERYTHING. Let me explain. Listen to, say, the first verse in We The People. Johhny K must not know just what Pro Tools can accomplish. Every time Mustaine sings a line, there's the obligatory fraction of a second where you hear him inhale. Because the production is just that clear, it's so obvious that it's almost a distraction. Dude, K, you couldn't have Pro Tool'ed out those second fractions? Admittedly, however, that is a really small gripe to have, and one that isn't obvious in every track, either.\n\nGreat, so it sounds awesome. But does it have awesome sounds? Short answer: yes. Now for the long answer. Th1rt3en plays like a sequel to Youthanasia. It's built more on mid-paced songs, vocal melodies, and relatively benign structures. Yeah, that means it still isn't Rust in Peace II, but so what. There are some speedier, thrashier bits, but for the most part the album seems to rely on what has rapidly become Megadeth's real strength nowadays, especially after Endgame: kick-ass, mid-tempo awesomeness.\n\nIt all starts with Public Enemy No. 1 (the mid-tempo stuff, not the album). A few triplets in the verse riff provide the perception that things are moving along a bit faster than they really are, but that just helps to set the beat. The chorus is pretty damn catchy and definitely a foot tapper. Oh, and no, that's not quite Hangar 18 you hear, either. That specific chord progression comes out of something with Mustaine's name on it, but that you won't find on a Megadeth release. Clearly, not enough people remember The Call of Ktulu. Oh well, LuLu does that, I guess. Moving forward a bit, we arrive at the best song on the CD, and probably my favorite Megadeth song since the aforementioned Youthanasia album: We The People. Seriously, Mustaine needs to just set his mind to writing a purely politically-themed album. The chorus to this one is flat-out insane. Hell, the whole song is insane. The worst thing I can say about it is that it's over too soon! Guns, Drugs, & Money follows We The People, and the ascending verse riff is a nice buildup leading into the well-executed vocal layers found in the chorus. Wrecker...ok, this is where we have to remember that Dave does have a sense of humor. Sure, it's a silly as hell song. But it's hilarious! This is probably my favorite \"pay less attention, because we're not serious\" moment since Bullprick. Deadly Nightshade, stuck back towards the end of the CD, may feature the best vocal performance by Mustaine on the entire CD. You can tell he was really getting into the chorus, and once again the layered vocals are a huge plus here.\n\nFor those looking for something with a bit more speed, we interestingly need to delve into the video game stuff. Sudden Death gets a little bit of a pass, seeing as how it was written for Guitar Hero. The reworked version found here is still basically a box of leads packaged into a song, but hey, who else can manage to fit the word lithospheres into a metal song? Never Dead, written for another video game, has a pretty balls-out verse riff complemented by a simpler chorus accentuating Mustaine's vocal delivery. At the end of the day, though, you get the impression that the speedy stuff just isn't where they're at these days. Hence why the thrashier tunes weren't specifically written for the album.\n\nOh, with all of this video game talk, I find it obligatory to mention that the lack of Megadeth's version of the theme song in Duke Nukem Forever was a criminal omission. Moving on.\n\nWhat about the three reworked older tunes? Pretty solid efforts, actually. The re-recorded New World Order retains all of the attitude and riff work of the original, with the major change coming right at the end of the track. I loved the original two versions, and this one is just as good. Fits in well as a complement to We The People as well, now that I think about it. Oh, and sorry guys, this is probably the only way to get the words Marty and Friedman into the liner notes these days. Minor win? Black Swan sounds more like a remix than a \"finished\" version. Actually it seems like it followed the same formula as The Active Mix of Breadline: take a song that started out pretty simply, and throw a meatier riff from the inner workings of the song at the front to change things up. Then stick some lead bits on top of it, and move on. It's not a bad track, I just prefer the original arrangement. Millenium of the Blind also isn't bad, it just didn't do much for me either. I'm not sure what I really expected here, but I'm relatively sure this wasn't it. Most of that stems from the fact that it's trying to be two songs, the new stuff and then the old lyrics stuck in there at the end.\n\nThat pretty much leaves the song 13. This is where things get a bit weird. The song itself is very much badass. When Mustaine writes about his life and his experiences with Megadeth, like Liar or Of Mice And Men, the results are pretty much guaranteed to be gold. But then you wonder why this one got stuck at the end of the CD (yes I can count, it's the thirteenth track, shut up and listen for a minute). We get a band whose latest album has a bunch of already released or re-hashed songs. And then we get this line: \"I just don't think I can give any more\". And just about then, we notice the liner notes for the CD (see, it pays to still buy real CDs), and see Vic in a coffin, and funeral imagery all over the place. Remember The Funeral Album by Sentenced? Looking at the total package you can see how this just might be the end of the road; if not done intentionally (Gigantour 2012 is on the books, after all, and he says he's feeling reloaded after neck surgery) then at least you get the impression that Mustaine might at least be open to the possibility that the future is no longer guaranteed. Or, I could be reading way too much into this crap. But one should remember that they are now without a label, and anything can happen.\n\nDespite all of the highs, the album as a whole isn't quite the obliterating follow-up to Endgame that I'd hoped for. Fast Lane is another hilarious song, but doesn't quite work. The lyrics, the riffs, the vocal work...nothing stands out as \"wrong\", but it just seems like this track was crying out to be done at a much higher tempo. C'mon, it's Fast Lane! How is this not about 50 bpm faster, at least? Then, there's the guitar solos. This is the first time that the lead work just hasn't really stuck in my head. The soloing by both Mustaine and Broderick is technically precise (Mustaine), suitably but not overly embellished (Broderick), and executed well (both of 'em), but it just doesn't seem to be overly inspired. Well, maybe inspired isn't quite the word I'm looking for. Sue me, I'm not a thesaurus. Suffice to say that the lead work is not a detraction, but it's not really a high point, either. Maybe this is a side effect of the abbreviated recording process. They've clearly still \"got it\", as evidenced by Endgame, but for some reason this time they just don't blow your socks off.\n\nSo what's the score here? It has to be pretty damn high, right, with all of the sonic badassery? Not so fast. To start with, Dave's breath sounds are getting a point deducted. Then I'm knocking ten points off for putting a bunch of stuff better suited for a Hidden Treasures II type compilation (or the next greatest hits album, which at the rate they turn those out these days has to be coming) onto the CD. Yeah, the songs were good to great, but at the end of the day they deprived us of three more all-new tracks on the album. Finally, ten points off for the fact that I just didn't feel the lead work this time around. That leaves us with 79 out of 100. This is probably one of those cases where the score doesn't really indicate how much I like the album, either. And in my case, at least, I also hope it doesn't mark the end of the road for one of my favorite metal bands of all time. Me, I actually like this album as a whole better than Endgame, and yet I gave that one an 85. But it is what it is. \n\nBesides, if this crap was an exact science, some jackoff with the RIAA would've patented it by now and shut down all of these sites, right?\n",
        "\nSince Dave Mustaine regrouped his baby in Megadeth in 2004, they have released a steady string of albums which has been seen as a return to form for the band since the majestic days of the 80s and early 90s. Their last output, \u201cEndgame\u201d, saw the band go back to their speedier side, but also strong songwriting which made it a great effort. \u201cTh1rt3en\u201d has a tough act to follow, but luckily it stands up to the groups name.\n\n\u201cTh1rt3een\u201d sounds mostly like a cross between \u201cCountdown to Extinction\u201d and \u201cYouthanasia.\u201d There are more hard-pounding guitars surrounded by dark melodies that resonated in those releases. It is no coincidence either seeing as two tracks from those sessions made it on this album in \u201cNew World Order\u201d and \u201cMillennium of the Blind.\u201d Both of these songs could be found on the \u201cYouthanasia\u201d remastered edition as extra tracks. Hearing these songs receiving their proper release is a great to hear, especially \u201cNew World Order\u201d with its awesome lead guitar part before the chorus and the thrashing ending at the end, but I actually like the demoed version of this song better. A grittier, raw sound fit this song perfectly, but the clean version on here takes away from the destructive nature of this song. \u201cMillenium of the Blind\u201d has been built to a full song and the chorus songs like zombies marching towards slowly. I\u2019m not sure if that is a good thing, so I\u2019ll leave it at that.\n\nThe production on here is too clean, too polished. Everything sounds too neat. There is nothing that resembles the chaos of \u201cThis Day We Fight!\u201d or \u201cBurnt Ice\u201d from the past two Megadeth albums. \u201cTh1rt3en\u201d could benefit more from a more dangerous, more chaotic sound.\n\nWith that being said, Mustaine delivers his signature snarl in the fashion everyone knows and love and hearing him rage about the injustices of the world, and the joys of driving fast never becomes old. It is wonderful to hear Dave Ellefson back in the fold because he just makes Megadeth be Megadeth again. His signature bass sound always held the backbone of the older releases. Tracks like \u201cPublic Enemy No. 1\u201d and \u201cWrecker\u201d relish in his grooves.\n\nBy far the best songs on here are \u201cNever Dead\u201d and \u201cPublic Enemy No. 1\u201d. The brooding intro followed by the snarling riff are awesome. The verse passages and the chorus flow brilliantly and it has stuck in my head since listening. \u201cPublic Enemy No.1\u201d resembles something from \u201cCountdown\u201d and has a great driving riff and Mustaine is great in the delivery of the vocals. Other standouts include \u201cGuns, Drugs, and Money\u201d which makes the listener imagine being in a Mexican action movie. The theme and rhythms of the song match perfectly. The other highlight is the closer \u201c13\u201d which is mostly a short biographical account of Mustaine\u2019s life. The moody, mid-paced riff sticks through and is strong closer to this superstitious album. Another plug to \u201cWhose Life (Is it Anyways?)\u201d has a chorus that will stick in your head for days and the rocking, fast paced guitars meld with the fueled charged grievances towards people for not accepting who someone is or think they what\u2019s best for someone.\n\nIn the end though, the songwriting is just not as memorable as \u201cEndgame\u201d. That album was going to be hard to beat, but still it is what it is. \u201cSudden Death\u201d was taken from the Guitar Hero video game last year with blazing leads and solos, but it seems that the verse structures were just an afterthought and is a poor opener to the album. \u201cWe the People\u201d is a politically charged rant with a flat chorus, but I suppose it is to resemble a political speech given by some candidate. However, we the people say this song is no good. \n\nAs a huge Megadeth fan, I am both pleased and somewhat disappointed with this album. I feel like the band has been stuck in neutral since \u201cUnited Abominations.\u201d While the band has hit a groove with solid metal tunes, I don\u2019t feel that necessity to go back and listen to it like \u201cEndgame\u201d or the interesting and creative songwriting of \u201cThe System Has Failed.\u201d I would like to see the band progress more in the future instead of relying on the past to illustrate its future. Overall, any Megadeth fan should like this and tracks like \u201cNever Dead\u201d and \u201cPublic Enemy No. 1\u201d show the band still has the chops to be awesome. If the songs were stronger and the pacing was steadier then it would be a standout, but in the end, we have an above average, but not quite great Megadeth record.\n\nOriginally written for nicksmetal.blogspot.com\n",
        "\nOriginally posted on my reviews-blog at heavymetalspotlight.blogspot.com\n\nMegadeth were, without a doubt, the first metal band I was into. Maybe they're not always in my top-ten bands of the moment anymore, but they'll always have a special place in my heart, as I'm sure anyone can empathise. \"Th1rt3en\" marks the bands... well... thirteenth studio album, and seems to, in places, take a softer approach to the band's sound, with a more \"Countdown to Extinction\" and \"Youthanasia\" style approach.\n\nOne thing which is immediately apparent, so immediate that you're well aware of it before actually listening the album at all, is that a certain proportion of the songs on the record have been recycled. I'll leave you to look at the tracklists yourselves, but I'll state that some of the re-workings are more welcome than others. \"Sudden Death\" seems a bit pointless - sounding almost identical to the version released as a single only about a year before, and despite being one of my favourite B-sides, \"Black Swan\" isn't done much justice, it's majestic intro exchanged for a chaotic and much less beautiful sounding affair. That said, \"New World Order\" is tolerable, although I still much prefer the demo version, where the riff isn't spoiled by lead-work. The new material on the album, accounting for nine of the thirteen tracks, certainly has a much less thrashy edge than \"Endgame\" or even \"United Abominations\" did, and goes down a more simplistic road, reminiscent of Megadeth's middle-era, especially, as far as I can hear, \"Cryptic Writings\", which is regarded as quite tame, but not, thankfully, as much as \"Risk\".\n\nWhile many of the new songs are quite enjoyable, for instance, \"Public Enemy #1\" is immensely catchy and well put together, quite a lot of the material seems very filler-like. A lot of the songs, like \"Guns, Drugs and Money\" have almost no distinguishing features whatsoever, seemingly a miasma of forgettable guitar, with little apparent structure. Th1rt3en feels less like an album, and more like a collection of songs which just so happened to exist at the time, which, at least, brings in some pleasant windfalls, such as \"Never Dead\", which is possibly the one genuinely thrashy song on the album which hasn't been released in some shape-or-form already. As much as I really rather want to like this album, I can't help but feel that it comes nowhere near the fantastic peak re-claimed by \"Endgame\". The production seems a bit off, too - I like crunchy guitar, but they seem a little too crunchy on this album - quite often robbing the song of the sharp edge which Megadeth use to excellent effect. The vocals sound a little bit drowned out, too, but all in all, it's adequate.\n\nIt's a step down, but it's not a bad album of it's own right. Sadly comparison to other work by the band is inevitable, and I can safely say that it's not a continuation of the peak of excellence that \"United Abominations\" and \"Endgame\" built. It's not overtly disappointing, but it's a bit of a comedown from even it's most recent predecessors.\n",
        "\nIt's been one hell of a ride for/with this reborn Megadeth entity. This is said with a healthy amount of loyal worship on my end, but I've also held them accountable to more than a few bouts of questionable antics, both musical and personal, that have transpired over the years. Now granted, I know that Mr. Mustaine in this day and age isn't the same Mr. Mustaine from over 20 years ago (to which he's rather unfairly criticized for nowadays by a few \"elitist\" fools out there), but WHO here in this world is still the same idiot today they were in the past? But it shouldn't matter, really\u2026what matters is the overall output, the reason why you checked the fucker out in the first place, and, even today, I feel that Megadeth's music is still relevant, if not MORE relevant than before, as they continue to make us wake up dead with increasingly killer post-millennial material.\n\nSo let's see how this new album stands in its own right...\n\nGoing in, I had that sinking feeling that whatever would come next would have a hard time trying to outdo the devastating \"Endgame\", which itself was quite the hard act to follow, and for that I cannot fault \"Th1rt3en\" in any hang-ups it possesses due to such high expectations. Instead, what we get here is a solid affair in its own right, if a touch underwhelming with its lack of overt violence and rage. Still, its strengths seem to lie in the band's songwriting area, where potent riffs and surprisingly dark melodies replace the more brutal musical ends, and it looks like we have one of the more complex-sounding modern Megadeth releases in a while, the result of a long time of tightened chops and clenched fists. There's no real sensation of just phoning it in like a few of their contemporaries have done lately, and the thick guitar riffs, fluidly-fast solos/leads, lyrical odes of corruption and darkness, punishing machine gun drums and Dave's agitated snarls (the last one still at all time highs), and the sheer monstrousness of songs like \"Sudden Death\", \"Millennium of the Blind\" and \"Wrecker\" get the juices flowing as best as they can.\n\nStill, for as great as it is in the end, I'm afraid I'll have to admit that there were moments that I wasn't really absorbed into the album as I\u2019'd been in the past few years. It could be a number of things, but it seems that the biggest sin is that some of the topics are starting to get a little tired and long in the tooth (\"We the People\", \"Sex, Drugs and Money\", \"Fast Lane\"), and even Mr. Mustaine himself doesn't sound as passionate about them as he used to be. Granted, he's still Dave, and he's still pissed, but after it starts with a strong opening, the album becomes like a roller-coaster, where it deflates a bit as it bores on through, only to end up coming back to life before being buried once more. As I've stated before, the sensation of pure unadulterated venom is in more scant quantities this time around, and the fist to the face is now just a mere hard shove, which could leave a few listeners a bit languid and listless. It's a shame that a band I'd held a flag so high for so many, MANY years couldn't leave me spellbound as they'd done in the past, but this really isn't anything to hold against them.\n\nAt the end of the day, \"Th1rt3en\" is a pretty good foray into modern heavy metal angst, something that is what it is in spite of itself. Chances are I'll still gives this little doozy the time of day time and again, but probably not as much as some of their other, stronger albums. Nevertheless, this is good for what ails you in this day and age. Trust me.\n\nOriginally written for The Offering\nwww.offeringwebzine.com\n",
        "\nOh, my God. I get it. I GET IT guys! The number '13' is in the title Thirteen. How ingenious is that? In hindsight, I'm astonished that Dave Mustaine and Megadeth have made it this far. With all the drug problems, the emotional discord, the lineup shifting, and the conspiracy theories, I'm amazed that Dave hasn't simply dropped out of civilization and started a commune somewhere. Curiously enough, his last full-length outing Endgame was rather good, a return to the songwriting aesthetics of the 1986-1990 era, but as anything this band will likely every produce post-Rust in Peace, it met with a very mixed reaction. The lyrics were admittedly a mixed bag of stupidity and acceptable camp, but at least when I was listening through it I experienced nostalgia for exactly what I liked about Megadeth in the first place: the snide, anti-authoritarian attitude and the blazing, killer riffs and leads. Endgame was in my opinion their best release since Youthanasia 15 years earlier.\n\nAnd a reference to Youthanasia is no accident, since three of the Th1rt3en tracks were originally included on the remastered version of that album. Here they have been reworked, and yet the very presence of tunes penned in the early 90s shows that Mustaine seems committed to this mid-life crisis of wanting to return to the band's earlier rocket to popularity. Granted, none of this triad is all that great, and I can see why they weren't included with either Countdown to Extinction or Youthanasia, as their choruses are pretty meek and frankly they almost entirely lack for the compelling riffs so important to the Megadeth sound. \"Millenium of the Blind\" is a boring, forward rolling ballad which opens in cleans and graduates to dull crunching patterns; \"Black Swan\" has some nice leads for a mid-paced rocker, but it's never very catchy; and \"New World Order\", while better than the other two, is not even at the level of something like \"99 Ways to Die\" from the Beavis & Butthead soundtrack...\n\nSo that leaves us with the newer crop of 10 songs to leave an impact, and those few times it does succeed do indeed rest on the shoulders of cuts like \"Never Dead\", which builds from a moody string intro through bland chugging and into a pretty killer hook. The verses are exceedingly simple, just a speed metal muted anchor with groovy fills, but Mustaine's vocals really work on this tune and it's the one I've gone back to revisit more than any other here. \"Guns, Drugs & Money\" also relies a lot on stock grooves and a few mediocre chugs, but at least I felt that the song built a steady, compelling momentum and offered enough bluesy wailing leads to flesh out its Mexican cartel encroachment subject matter. A few of the later tunes like \"Wrecker\" and \"Deadly Nightshade\" were also decent, but again the riffs offer a very simple architecture that seeks to excel on its production and vocal/guitar balance rather than the steps of innovation the band were once taking on their 80s efforts.\n\nAs for the rest of this, I can't say that it feels very well ordered or written. Songs like \"Public Enemy No. 1\" and \"Sudden Death\" seek nothing more than to capitalize on the fan's nostalgia for \"Hangar 18\" or \"In My Darkest Hour\", and you'll feel that comparison through their chord progressions. Both of those are right up front in the track list. \"Whose Life (Is It Anyways?)\" feels too rock & roll, almost like an escapee from the pathetic Risk or Cryptic Writing sessions, and it's worthless outside of the bits of shredding. \"Fast Lane\" sticks with a simple low end thrash groove like a \"Symphony of Destruction\", but nothing interesting ever happens. \"13\" and \"We the People\" straddle between decent hooks and dull melodic escalations, slower paced tunes that strive for a money shot but leave the listener in a softcore labyrinth.\n\nI will say that Dave's voice sounds quite good throughout the album. Clearly with the right level of production his snarling and melodic sensibilities are intact, and he's all over this thing. The leads are in general well written if not exactly memorable, and feel snug as a bug as a contrast to the simplified composition of many tracks. The bass is punchy and thick, yet I never feel like Ellefson ever pulls off anything interesting, and the drums are pretty much rock standard, no more complex or impressive than what you heard on Youthanasia or Cryptic Writings. All of this is mixed quite cleanly, but I almost feel as if it's 'too' clean, targeted for major radio exposure but not suiting the band as much as a grimier finish might. If Mustaine is so serious about getting back to the roots, I think it would be more compelling if he gave it a dirty sheen like the first two albums. Th1rt3en is loud and clear, but comes off too poppy, sparkly and polished.\n\nUltimately, this is one of those 'meh' Megadeth recordings with 1-2 songs you might add to a highlight reel, but no degree of consistency. Like The World Needs a Hero, or The System Has Failed. Catchy choruses are few and far between, and the riffs always seem played out and derivative, even in \"Never Dead\" which I tend to enjoy. The lyrics are half-on, half-off, but even where they're better scripted, they seem derivative of subjects the Dave has already explored previously, numerous times (\"Fast Lane\" feels like another \"502\" or \"1,320\" for example). It's not a terrible listen, but neither is it pushing the boundaries of what can be done within the medium like the band's past opuses Peace Sells... or Rust in Peace. It's more of a flat tire than an engine breakdown, but nonetheless is unlikely to standout to Megadeth fans past the next few exit signs.\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nMegadeth has been making the rounds with a vengeance since 2007. Amongst the many creations that have ensued has been a consistent adherence to the band\u2019s late 80s to early 90s period where thrash metal was sort of stuck between its all fast and furious all the time Bay Area excesses of the mid-80s and the somewhat slower and milder desire for maturity and progression in the 90s. The overall sound could be likened to wounds inflicted upon the genre at the hands of Grunge being cauterized with a crunchy and furious riff set and an utterly unapologetic to the point of self-indulgent return to the fine art of 80s lead guitar shredding.\n\n\u201cSudden Death\u201d is somewhat of an odd song out in the midst of all this, not so much because it is a divergence from the established formula, but because all the elements in play are exaggerated to the point of becoming overbearing. While this is definitely a thrash song of a somewhat mid-tempo character, this thing is just flooded with over-the-top lead guitar breaks that seem to be channeling \u201cHanger 18\u201d, but with a bit less cohesiveness and structure. The epic, military like intro gets a bit bogged down in lead guitar showmanship, but eventually a driving edge emerges in a somewhat restrained yet animated riff set that is fairly repetitive.\n\nDave\u2019s vocals and the non-lead oriented elements of this song are on point, yet they all seem to be playing towards the solo sections, as if they were written after the solos were composed to fill in the gaps. The production is a bit off, having a definite aggressive edge yet coming up a little weak on the needed percussive punch that occurs on a song like this. Essentially the rhythm guitars and the bass are just a little too quiet, and it shows when the solos kick in. In fact, most of the weakness of this song can be chalked up to a slightly off mixing job that hopefully will be addressed on the upcoming album.\n\nIn short, this song is definitely gears towards being a climactic opener to what should be another fine album, but it also seems to have been constructed with equal attention towards one-upping Dragonforce on Guitar Hero. While I can\u2019t fault Dave for wanting to sprinkle a little extra sugar on the cereal, this is almost along the lines of sprinkling a tablespoon of it onto a mid-sized bowl of Frosted Flakes. The first couple of bites might be tasty, but after a while it starts to make your teeth hurt. But then again, too much is preferable to too little, something that Metallica should have figured out more than a decade ago.\n",
        "\nThe title says it all, indeed, but just because dangerous Dave was warning us of his impending midlife crisis, doesn't make this a whole lot easier to ingest. On the other hand, Risk is all TOO easy to ingest, if you're some sort of anomalous disco-funk-rock-pop addict who fancies Mustaine's sneering rasp, puerile lyrics and just a feather dusting of metallic excess. We get it, Dave. You wanted to branch out. Expand yourself. Breach a new audience. Win some karma. Touch the baby Jesus of your soul. Well, I have it on Good Authority that the son of God actually hated this album, and had to binge Under the Sign of the Black Mark for weeks just to rid himself of its stain. But perhaps the biggest crime of this career low, is that there are a small handful of catchy moments scattered throughout the album which might have actually functioned from a pure pop or rock perspective had they not been driven to the winds by Mustaine's scatterbrained songwriting. As if he hired Diane Warren or some other pop author and then fired her half way through...\n\nAs with their esteemed Californian contemporaries Metallica and Slayer, or really almost any of the late 80s thrash titans, Megadeth was due for a reality check once their genre was no longer one of the biggest arena packers out there. Honestly, I'm surprised they managed to stave off sucking for quite so long. Aside from the embarrassment that was \"Sweating Bullets\", their Countdown to Extinction was pretty good, not to mention Youthanasia, which despite the slow, producer encouraged pace was loaded with worthwhile tunes. It wasn't until Cryptic Writings (1997) that they really fell off the horse, but even that paperweight of mediocrity glimmers when compared to this exercise in awful soul searching. If we were to count them, there might be all of two acceptable metal rhythms on Risk: the central Zeppelin groove in the opener \"Insomnia\", or the slow-stepping progressive doom leanings hinted at in \"The Doctor is Calling\". Otherwise, the 'heaviness' of this album serves as nothing more than window dressing for Mustaine and his troupe.\n\nThe lead guitars are sustainable enough (we wouldn't want Friedman and Mustaine losing their endorsements), and any dismay I might have towards the pop sterility of the production is precluded by the sheer insanity of the composition. Or rather, the lack of insanity. Just the first track alone (\"Insomnia\") cycles through techno rock, 'eclectic' strings, bluesy metal grooves, harmonic pop vocals and the hands-down most generic pattern of notes in the history of guitar music (starts at about 1:00 in the song). And this is probably one of the best pieces on the album! We are then subjected to the hilariously awful lyrics of \"Prince of Darkness\", with its trudging awful groove metal subtext that makes Black Label Society sound talented by comparison. Or worse, MUCH worse...the album's 'single', \"Crush 'Em\", which is preambled by a lame self affirmation of a crowd roaring (\"Enter the Arena\") while Dave shouts out CRUSH EM and the drums and bluesy, mean guitars prepare us for the worst. This is a fucking DISCO song with muted guitars that leap into predictable NWOBHM styled rhythms while some of the worst lyrics in Megadeth's career are spat out over the hissed 'gang' vocals...\n\nI don't know about you, but by the time that song was over, I had already decided that I would be returning the CD to the record store later that day. And yet, an inner masochistic sensibility drove me forward into the cheap radio rock of \"Breadline\" and \"I'll Be There\", which feel like they might as well be Def Leppard outtakes, or \"Wanderlust\" which seems like it's an attempt to create a Megadeth edition of \"Paradise City\". The only song I really didn't hate on the latter half of the album was \"The Doctor is Calling\", which aside from a few dumb lyrical effects had a simple and effective momentum that felt like a mix of Alice Cooper and Queensryche. But truthfully, the remainder of this record is so barren of quality that you might start seeing tumbleweeds roll on by as you listen...\n\nThankfully this narcissistic knucklehead would come to his senses for the following effort The World Needs a Hero. It's not good, not even close to good, but it somewhat put the reigns on this experiment in banal cross-dressing and soul searching. 'Open-mindedness'. Believe me, I've got no problem whatsoever with a little experimentation, or even a LOT of experimentation, if the results produce a quality piece of music I can enjoy for years to come. Risk is simply nothing of the sort. The songs stink, the lyrics are often awkward and none of the external to metal components are novel, unique or adventurous, unless you consider a stroll through the sounds of the Billboard Top 40 to be 'adventurous'. Risk is safe, silly and incredibly sad: for all the wrong reasons.\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nLet's get something straight here. I haven't enjoyed Megadeth's last three albums (and I don't own 'The World Needs A Hero'). Which is funny because I would normally consider myself a pretty big fan of the band, but the last three albums have been such over hyped ear disease that I literally gave up all hope, especially after seeing how terrible they are live these days (2011 Big Four show in UK).\n\n'Public Enemy No. 1' is a breath of fresh air. It combines the styles of both 'Countdown to Exctinction' ('Skin O My Teeth', 'High Speed Dirt') and 'Cryptic Writings' ('She Wolf', 'The Disintegrators'), only the solos still aren't quite the same, and Dave's voice isn't as great. On the last two albums, Mustaine has gotten by just croaking horribly instead of actually trying a vocal melody, and I have hated him for it. Thankfully, with 'Public...' he finally sings a proper tune, albeit in a lower octave than I'd like. But it's a step forward. He sounds insanely weak live, but this studio performance is absolutely fine!\n\nUnfortunately, part of the enjoyment of the song rides on the fact that the verses are quite similar to the intro of 'Hangar 18', the verses of 'Tears In A Vial'. That's the reason some of their newest stuff sounds like old Megadeth. Not because he's actually writing something good, but because he's ripping off his own riffs all the time. But I can't complain, because for once he's quite successful doing it on 'Public Enemy No. 1'. The only other small complaint is the obvious attempt at trying to copy Marty Friedman's soloing style in the middle solo, albeit in a rather tame fashion. But it's better than Broderick and Mustaine's usual faceless guitar wankery.\n\n'Sudden Death' was a bit too generic thrash for me, a little bit too similar to things off 'Endgame'. But this track is making me look forward to the stupidly titled 'TH1RT3EN'. My only worry now is the track list. It includes two songs, 'Millennium of the Blind' and 'New World Order', which were the titles of slightly pedestrian demo tracks from Megadeth's last truly brilliant album 'Youthanasia', so I'm guessing Mustaine has committed the sin of being a total cheap ass and rerecorded them, no doubt to get people to rave about the 'old sound' being back. Yes. 17 years ago, Megadeth sounded like Megadeth did... 17 years ago. Why put effort in to writing something truly exciting when you can just rerecord your old music and pass it off as new? Anyway. All things considered, 'Public Enemy No. 1' is a great little track, and in my eyes a sign that Megadeth can do some good in the music world once again.\n",
        "\nNormally, I still happen to like releases by famous metal bands that have been heavily bashed by fans, journalists and critics. Those albums break with the past of the band and try out something fresh and new. The bands try to evolve and move on. While traditional fans may have problems with this new courage and innovation, I usually honour this as I listen to various styles of music. I liked the dark atmosphere of the underrated \"Jugulator\" by Judas Priest, the slow, progressive and hypnotizing flow of \"Virtual XI\" by Iron Maiden or the rock experiments on \"Load\" and \"ReLoad\" by Metallica. That's why somebody suggested me to check out the black sheep in Megadeth's discography. But I can't find much appealing on \"Risk\". This release is clearly worse than the other ones I have mentioned. This album is just horribly pointless even though there are a few experimental aspects I like about it.\n\nYou first happen to see the horrible and boring cover and booklet artwork of this record that gives you a negative impression right from the start. When you put the disc in, you immediately hear the weak production of the record. The re-mastered version is slightly better but it doesn't change the weak song writing. There is not one single sharp riff or one truly emotional guitar solo on here. The bass guitar is rarely audible but does actually an accurate job when you hear it in the horrible potpourri of \"Prince Of Darkness\" and the rather chilling progressive \"Ecstasy\" that is one of the few exceptions which I happen to like. It's probably my favourite song on here. The drum patterns are boring and exchangeable on the record as if the drummer had parts of his legs and arms broken. Just try out the weird progressive experiment \"Wanderlust\" that makes me want to run away. The vocals are completely bored and lack of power, inspiration and emotion. The lyrics are quite random, too. There really isn't much positive to find.\n\nMusically, this record is a mixture of rock and roll music, groove metal and pop music. It's a record filled with missed experiments. \"Breadline\" and \"Seven\" sound like lost tracks from Metallica's \"Load\" covered by Bryan Adams. \"The Doctor Is Calling\" sounds like a glam rock track with some progressive elements played in slow motion. The industrial \u201cmallcore\u201d experiment on the danceable \"Crush'em\" and the ridiculous interlude \"Enter The Arena\" with some funky riffs has one of the worst choruses ever heard and the vocals are once again completely bored and pseudo-cool. The worst example might though be \"Prince Of Darkness\" which present us six minutes of weird underwater fart poetry without any structure. I don't have a clue why this song was chosen by fans to be on a greatest hits compilation of the band. Maybe they wanted to illustrate the worst song from the band's worst album.\n\nThere are still a couple of tracks that justify to not give an even lower rating on here. Let's underline that those tracks are somewhere between acceptable and good but the album has not a single outstanding moment or musical highlight whatsoever. But one can say that at least one half of the record is musically acceptable. \"Insomnia\" has a few good ideas such as interesting violin samples and an unusual chorus that I like. \"The Doctor Is Calling\" sounds like a glam rock track with some progressive elements played in slow motion but has an appealing atmosphere and a couple of good ideas. I would cite this as one of the mostly well done experiments on the record. \"I'll be there\" is a soft rock song with surprisingly emotional lyrics by the tough guy. The middle part reminds me of disco ballads from the seventies and eighties in the key of \"Frankie Goes To Hollywood\". \"Ecstasy\" sounds relaxing and progressive and is a well done experiment. The vocals are once more mediocre but the rest is quite enjoyable. The two \"Time\" tracks have some interesting acoustic passages and almost meditatively hypnotizing background vocals as well as well done guitar solo in the second part. As you can see there is still a lot of potential and creativity in some parts of the album.\n\nBut a few appealing courageous sounds are simply not enough to carry this pointless record as at least half of the experiments failed. The album ultimately fails especially because there is no true conviction and passion behind those intentions. Mustaine sounds like a bored egomaniac that wants to copy the latest Metallica efforts to make some money. I have heard albums that were still far worse than this inside and outside the metal scene even though this record is the weakest one I have heard in quite a while now. I will still give this album a try from time to time for tracks such as \"The Doctor Is Calling\", \"Ecstasy\" or \"Time\". But I honestly only recommend this record to die hard Megadeth fans and open-minded people that care about experimental rock music rather than thrash metal.\n",
        "\nIt's simple, \"Sudden Death\" has to be the best face-kicking single from Megadeth since \"Hangar 18\" and \"Holy Wars\". Yes, I know...it comes from a video game, and the whole purpose of the game itself is to break your fingers into a thousand pieces, but you have to give them credit for a solidly well-balanced track. You get solo after solo in a frantic swirling of riffs along with an apocalyptic vibe going on. The bass is quite audible and helps the gloomy, kinda tragic environment. In addition, the drums have their portion on the rhythm as they tend to give some variation to the song.\n\nTalking about the instruments made me realize that there's actually solid work in this aspect. While there's a lot of soloing going on (let's face it, the whole song is about it), you can hear the other members of the band pretty neat and crisply. It is as good as you can get. It seems the lesson was learned and now the guys from Megadeth are giving a huge importance to the production and mixing on the records. \n\nBut what's a good single without a good portion of thoughtful, meaningful lyrics, along with a mean razor-like voice, right? You get to see a more mature songwriting here, another lesson learned and practiced in \"Endgame\". I love political and social lyrics, but this kind of writing chills my nerves, and it's damn refreshing to see a Megadeth track talking about other things than internal demons, past conflicts, conspiracy theories, etc. As well, the voice sounds pretty sharp, more in a vibe of \"Peace Sells..\" era, angrier and direct to the skull. \n\nThe only flaw I could find in the track is the kinda monotonous riff from the second guitar all along. Well, I think there's a better way to make shine the marvelous soloing through the piece. Either way, it gets sort of boring hearing the same chords again and again and again. \n\nIf you're a hardcore fan of Megadeth like me, get the single and keep your fingers crossed for something like this on the next album coming up. If you're not a core fan, get it anyway. It's a hell of a track, damn it!\n",
        "\nOriginally published in \"The Wormwood Chronicles.\"\n\nWhew boy, where do I start with this? Um, ok I guess for those of you serious headbangers that haven't at least been giving Megadeth the time of day since about '95 or so...Megadeth has been putting out some crap for about the past 7 or 8 years leading up to this release . \"Cryptic Writings,\" although blessed with tunes like \"She-Wolf,\" was tainted by country superstar picker Dan Huff being tapped as the record's producer. There's a lot of crap on there. Even songs like \"Disintegrators,\" which was an all-out thrash attempt, was lacking in balls. That album's follow-up, \"Risk,\" was more of the worst, spewing out vain attempts at radio-friendliness and mellowed-out heaviness (what a concept!) that to be honest, just didn't sit well in my gullet. Finally, even though my buddies tended to love it, I thought that \"World Needs A Hero\" was a bland and boring attempt of Dave saying \"Sorry everyone, I fucked up on the last two.\"\n\nNow, fast forward to 2004. Dave Mustaine is back in action after sidelining Megadeth due to an arm injury that prevented him from playing guitar. Dave Ellefson is no longer in the band, and Mustaine seems content to use session musicians (among them former Deth head Chris Poland on lead guitar) on this new disc. As far as the songs go, they are still suffering from a bit of blandness that goes along with Dave thinking that he is radio-friendly...but...the majority of these songs could kick the ass of most of the \"World Needs a Hero\" material. I mean, the opening track, \"Blackmail the Universe\" is stellar, perfect for any old school Megadeth fan, as is third track \"Kick the Chair.\" First single \"Die Dead Enough\" is what happens when Dave tries to be catchy and does it right. Simply put, the track is pure Megadeth through and through as well as being so infectious that I still would crank the local rock radio station when it came on, even though I'd been hearing it for months and months.\n\nAfter that, it's fairly hit or miss, with Mustaine and co. rolling out every trick they got and trying desperately to make a great album out of this. I don't think they succeeded in making it a great album, but I do think it's a \"better than average\" album. In other words, I feel that this album is a step in the right direction and I am looking forward to hearing more. My worst gripe though, is that there really needs to be some thought put into the idea of a new guitar tone...the sound of the axes is just too damn soft. They need something chunkier and more brutal than what they currently are using. Dave used to be the heaviest fucking guitarist on the planet, and that throne belongs to him, but he needs to prove that he belongs there. He's been gone too long.\n",
        "\nHaving decided to travel to Warsaw, Poland, to be at the inaugural \u2018Big 4\u2019 event I was eagerly anticipating the release of this boxset, not least because as a vertically challenged individual I was able to see very little from my position 300 yards back at Bemowo Airport on that historic day in mid-2010.\n\nThis release, the deluxe boxset which includes CD and DVD recordings of all four bands, would enable me to watch the show in Sofia in sharp detail which I had no hope of when in a crowd of near 100,000 in Warsaw.\n\nAnd it doesn\u2019t disappoint. The item itself is nicely put together, although I would have been happy to pay \u00a320 ($31) for the CDs and DVDs without the poster, guitar pick, photos, booklet etc for which I ended up paying \u00a345 ($70). Sturdy, well made and a good piece of metal memorabilia.\n\nBut what about the performances? Well first up is Anthrax, the band which, arguably, held onto their spot in the Big 4 by the skin of their teeth throughout the mid-80s. Some would argue for Exodus, though on the strength of five great albums from 1985 to 1990 I would have chosen Kreator but then a European band would never make the Big 4!\n\nAnthrax\u2019s rough and ready debut, Fistful Of Metal lead on to two great albums \u2013 the ground breaking Spreading The Disease, and the hyperspeed/mosh orgy of Among The Living. These were the albums that Anthrax secured their place in the Big 4 with. Of course, they released two more well respected, if not particularly well received, albums after these. So this leads to a fundamental question \u2013 why, in a set of ten songs, do Anthrax choose to play two covers - Joe Jackson\u2019s \u2018Got The Time\u2019 and Trust\u2019s \u2018Antisocial\u2019? Plus a shortened cover of \u2018Heaven and Hell\u2019 by the band of the same name?\n\nWhile Anthrax are fun to watch onstage and put in a good performance musically and physically (including Joey Belladonna\u2019s strained vocals) to play two full covers in a ten song set is unforgiveable when tracks like \u2018Among The Living\u2019 and \u2018Gung Ho\u2019 were overlooked. Add to this the addition of \u2018Only\u2019, a song from an era of Anthrax that most grunge fans will enjoy and most thrash fans cringe at, and \u2018Medusa\u2019, one of the weakest, most commercial tracks from Spreading... and you have the makings of a poor set.\n\nAnthrax\u2019s enthusiasm cannot be questioned here, but their set list raises big questions for me as to whether they really understood the significance of this occasion.\n\nNext up \u2013 Megadeth. Put simply, on this performance and that in Poland, Megadeth are THE band to see at the moment. Very, very well produced sound, maybe the best sound I have ever heard on a live recording. Incredible musicianship. Mustaine and Broderick are tight as fuck on guitar duty; Newly, and rightfully, reinstated Dave Ellefson is excellent on bass guitar with his tight picked rhythms nicely high in the mix. Shawn Drover\u2019s drumming is flawless, and while you won\u2019t hear Nick Menza\u2019s powerhouse beats or Gar Samuelson\u2019s (RIP) syncopated jazz-influenced flamboyancy, what you do get is a totally heavy bass-drum driven barrage.\n\nThe set is just what was needed after Anthrax\u2019s weak start \u2013 opener \u2018Holy Wars...\u2019 giving way to \u2018Hangar 18\u2019, followed by \u2018Peace Sells...\u2019. After that comes nine more great songs, including a rousing rendition of \u2018A Tout le Monde\u2019. Absolutely fucking brilliant performance from a great band.\n\nSo how do you follow that? One word. Slayer.\n\nShould Slayer have played after Megadeth? It\u2019s arguable. On album performance over the last 27 years, yes. On their respective performances on the night, no, Megadeth ruled. But Slayer is Slayer. What you see is what you get. If, like me, Slayer is your favourite band ever and you have seen Slayer play on any number of occasions (last count maybe 15 times) then you know what you\u2019re in for, and this was no different. Pure fucking heads down aggression from start to finish.\n\nSlayer regularly mix their set up show by show and this one, sadly, contained nothing from Show No Mercy or Hell Awaits. However, \u2018War Ensemble\u2019, \u2018Hate Worldwide\u2019, \u2018Chemical Warfare\u2019 and the obligatory \u2018Raining Blood\u2019 will surely have given many of the newbie Metallica kids a headache.\n\nAs always, Hanneman and King are solid but raw and somewhat sloppy. The sound and mix are unforgiving on this recording for the guitar duo. Tom\u2019s vocals are good but still show signs of inexorable decline. On a couple of occasions he misses lyrics having invited the crowd to sing them. James Hetfield can do this in an arena this size, Tom can\u2019t, the response isn\u2019t loud enough. If you\u2019re watching the DVD it is apparent why there\u2019s no vocals but if you\u2019re listening to the CD then it sounds a little lame.\n\nThe stand out performance with Slayer is Dave Lombardo. He is superb, an absolute wall of unrelenting aggression played from the heart and with absolute conviction. For a 45 year old man this is utterly awesome.\n\nSo with Slayer bowing out with a brutal \u2018Raining Blood\u2019 the crowd eagerly awaits the main event \u2013 Metallica.\n\nOk, Metallica shows have been reviewed a million times, and by far more accomplished writers than me, so I am not going to give the typical critique, but I will give some observations.\n\nFirstly the set. Really good mix of old and new. They kick off with the all-time classic \u2018Creeping Death\u2019 which is followed by \u2018For Whom The Bell Tolls\u2019. After these come tracks from every Metallica album except Load and St Anger.\n\nAnd Metallica kick ass. As usual. They put on a great show with great crowd interaction, great visuals, great songs, just... great. But for me there\u2019s one thing which means I cannot listen to this show \u2013 Lars Ulrich.\n\nFrom the very start with \u2018Creeping Death\u2019 Lars lets the side down. Ulrich hasn\u2019t used a ride cymbal for over 20 years. He has a 5-piece drum kit. He simply cannot provide the percussion which a band of Metallica\u2019s standard and stature needs. His drumming makes a mockery of it all. That may sound harsh, but as a drummer I know what is required and he cannot provide it.\n\nHis drumming on \u2018Creeping Death\u2019 is horrible. He can\u2019t play tom rolls \u2013 he doesn\u2019t have the toms. His playing is too fast, too frantic. Metallica sound so lightweight, even on their heavier tracks, that I have to switch off. I will stick to recordings I have from the early- and mid-80s. This is Metallica \u2018lite\u2019, and while I think they do put on a great show, they are in danger of becoming an exhibition band.\n\nListen to Megadeth and Shawn Drover, and Slayer and Dave Lombardo, then listen to Lars Ulrich. Sorry Lars but....\n\nSo, the Big 4 Sofia boxset \u2013 a superb memento of a great event. Megadeth win this one hands down. In fact hands anywhere. They rule this show and they ruled the tour. If you can get your hands on this limited edition version then do, it is well worth it. \n\nIf not then seek out the DVD only version \u2013 you can still annoy your neighbours, just turn your TV the fuck up.\n\n(Originally reviewed for www.braingell.com)\n",
        "\nThrough the years i have grown very fond of many bands, over many different genres. Especially in the thrash metal genre, and over the years I have heard many amazing albums, but this is easily the greatest. Ive never heard another album as musical and lyrically powerful as this one. It is in every sense of the word, a classic. Perfection from front to back. Essential to every metal lovers collection. There is no low on this album, every song is just as good as the last. Continuously pushing forward to the next amazing riff, the next perfect solo. Rust In Peace can only be described as a masterpiece.\n\nThe album kicks off with bang with the Megadeth classic, Holy Wars... The Punishment Due. Lyrically, and musically a perfect piece of art. Vocally, Mustaine has never been perfect. But his vocals fit, and that is what matters. He has one of the more recognizable voices in metal, and that is for sure. The song starts with a blazing fast riff that forces you to start banging your head. The song in a way reminds me of Angel Of Death by Slayer. In the way it has a very distinct beginning, middle, and end, going from fast, to slow, to finishing strong. The next song is another classic, Hanger 18. Who could forget the end where Mustaine and Friedman are trading off solos. Then comes the anti-war classic, Take No Prisoners. The album then takes a somewhat unexpected turn with Five Magics. Being the most progressive track on the album, it does not dissapoint. With its slow climbing build to its strategically fast solo at the end, it is amazing. Poison Was The Cure is another song with a bass intro. Lasting nearly a third of the song, Then moving into one of the fastest, most technical riffs I have ever heard. The main riff makes the solo almost feel lacking. Lucretia is the sixth song on this album and some would think that at this point the album would let up, but Mustaine and his crew of metal giants will not let that happen. It begins with a laugh and has a somewhat strange opening riff. It is definitely a wierd song. But it's wierd in a good way. The solo is one of the best on the album. Once Lucretia is done rocking your brain, Tornado Of Souls kicks in. In my opinion the strongest track on the album. The emotion filled lyrics to the techinal guitars, this song is perfect. It possessess the greatest solo of all time. This song is so beautifully put together. Dave would never again top this song. No one will. After the emotion filled Tornado Of Souls comes Dawn Patrol. A slow creeping intro that leads up to the title track, Rust In Peace. Nick Menza opens this song with a badass drum solo and from then on this song kicks your ass. This being one of Mustaines earliest songs it does not feel out of time at all. It feels more relevant now then it would have earlier in his carreer. This song is the only way this album could have been ended. It has such an intense feeling to it. Every line he spews out fills you with a further sense of dread. A good dose of hopelessness to end it off with. The album starts intense and it ends intense. The thrash cycle is complete.\n\nThis album is definitely not a straightforward thrash album. the songs often contain elements of a more melodic or progressive style. Which gives this album a style all its own. The musicianship is tight, the lyrics are personal, and the sense of amazement never ends. This album is at times scary, sad, beautiful, and angry. Every song feels different, but it all belongs. It took me too long to realize the greatness of this album. And i hope this review helps you to realize how awesome it really is. For people who have heard it, it is an almost life changing experience. And for those who have not, it is a classic waiting to be heard.\n",
        "\nDave Mustaine\u2019s militia had sprung up many surprises in the early to mid 90s, a trend that just carried on till the end of the 20th century. Rust in Peace was their finest hour where they really got their act together to release one of the finest thrash metal albums of all time. The follow up Countdown to Extinction was where they got more mainstream recognition helped heavily by the massive radio play and extensive MTV exposure by virtue of their videos. Youthanasia on the other hand was where they bridged the gap between thrash and power metal to release a very steady album. \n\nAt the same time they were writing tracks for many movies back then that have become of cult status now. Finding those soundtracks could be quite a trouble and purchasing them for a few good songs worsens all the effort. Megadeth rescued the whole world from all the unnecessary digging by creating a compilation of all those otherwise unreleased tracks, simply known as \u201cHidden Treasures\u201d and I must admit that I\u2019m thoroughly grateful to them.\n\nWhat really sparked my interest in this compilation was the fact that the catchy song called \u201cGo to Hell\u201d from the second installment of the \u201cBill and Ted\u201d series was present on it. The lineup is the same since Rust in Peace and all the musicians seem to be in fine form. Mustaine also sounds better and seems to utilize his limited singing abilities to the fullest without going off key at any point. It\u2019s hard to call this a total thrash metal album as it\u2019s not as full blooded as the band used to be, but having said there are many pure thrash riffs to be found here and there. The production to me sounds very similar to \u201cCountdown to Extinction\u201d, so yeah there are no complaints there.\n\nThe track selection is fairly good and most of the songs are very well written indeed. There are loads of catchy riffs and well timed solos spread throughout the compilation courtesy of Mustaine and Friedman, whereas the bass and drum fills by Ellefson and Menza respectively are done in a very tasteful manner. The Alice Cooper cover is not bad at all and is probably one of the better covers I\u2019ve ever heard. \u201cBreak Point\u201d has some really interesting riffs but the mid section slowdown for those spoken verses was not required really. As for \u201cGo To Hell\u201d, I simply can\u2019t get enough of this song no matter how hard I try. \n\nThe best song to me has to be \u201c99 Ways To Die\u201d that is pure thrash metal bringing to mind their R.I.P days while the weakest link is the weirdly average \u201cAngry Again\u201d on the godly OST of that ironically retarded Arnie flick. The other interesting composition is the groovily eerie \u201cDiadems\u201d that contains some beautifully haunting clean guitars and good hooks making it another strong track. The other two covers are decent, nothing great about them.\n\nThe only problem with this compilation is the length of it. It lasts for as little as under 30 minutes. Now for a random metal head who tries to saves up all the dimes to purchase an album, it might be a difficult choice for him to pick this up at a record store. As for a Megadeth completist or someone who likes good heavy metal, this would make a fine hear and as much as the title says its better to uncover these treasures before its too late or god forbid, the release goes out of print. Cash grabber or not, its none of my concern, the music is good!!!!\n",
        "\nMuch has been said down the years about the scales that metal, and in particular thrash, rose to but there has been little in the name of collective footage to actually bring to life this fact for all to see. Until now. \"The Big Four: Live From Sofia, Bulgaria\" does exactly what it says on the tin and it does it so well I can hereby classify it as an essential purchase for anyone who a) likes any combination of Metallica, Slayer, Megadeth or Anthrax, b) is curious to see why these bands got so popular and c) like to have quality metal DVDs to stick on at a party. Clocking it at around 6 hours in total the Big Four play more bonafide classics in one performance than is likely to ever be caught on such a release and with a great 45 minute behind-the-scenes documentary capturing the thoughts of the band members on this celebratory occasion last summer it is not lacking in punches to entice the parting of you and your money.\n\nBill-openers for surely the first time in some years, Anthrax plough through the classics their early albums possess in number - \"Caught In A Mosh\", \"I Am The Law\", \"Madhouse\" and \"Antisocial\" among others - with decent, if fairly under-stated, gusto. If you would ask me Testament better deserve to have Anthrax's place in this hallowed club on both past and recent merits, a theory which holds water when looking at the current standards of the bands. Setting a precedence for which Megadeth and Slayer were soon to follow, the vocals of Joey Belladonna lack much of the prowess his 80's wailing held while the quality of Anthrax's 'recent' (8 years and counting now since a studio release) output is upheld by the appearance of just two songs post-1988 included in their 'best of' set (and one, \"Got The Time\" is a cover). To say Anthrax have been treading water for sometime would serve as a major understatement. However as an opening act their stage performance has been honed incalculably over the years to set the mood adequately for the bigger and better acts that were hot on their heels on a balmy summer\u2019s evening in Bulgaria.\n\nAfter years of public and no doubt private squabbles to see Dave Mustaine sharing a stage with his erstwhile Metallica colleagues must register as a very good day in the history of metal. Unfortunately the weather gods decided otherwise as Megadeth's set in Sofia was somewhat tempered the thunderstorm which blew almost from the moment they hit to the stage to leaving it an hour later. As the strongest candidate for best musician across the four bands Mustaine needs no introduction and his honour is held in the timeless quality of those five songs: \"Holy Wars\", \"Hangar 18\", \"Sweating Bullets\", \"Symphony Of Destruction\" and \"Peace Sells\". Utterly superb. With Dave Ellefson now back as a full-time member and rock solid accompaniment from Chris Broderick and Shawn Drover this is as strong a line-up seen in Megadeth for some years and is recognised in the quality reproduction of all 12 songs played. Whether due to sound problems or general decline with age Mustaine's vocals unfortunately feel weak at times across the set while the rain does it's best to dampen the spirited throngs before them but more is required to hold back a band like Megadeth, whose recent resurgence cannot have gone unnoticed by many.\n\nEasily the act who stuck closest to their guns through the 90's wilderness years Slayer remain, and forever will do, a religion to many of their devoted fans; a religion however that is beginning to look as flaky as some of those absconded in these legends lyrical past. With Tom Araya's vocals lacking all the menace of their classic period and a back injury preventing headbanging or any serious movement from him, Jeff Hanneman apparently adhering to the American cheeseburger diet and his and Kerry King's soloing sounding amateur when in competition with Mustaine, Broderick and Hammett, Slayer have, to these jaded ears, lost so much of what defined their untouchable brilliance of the 80s as to be heavily reliant on the continued brilliance of Dave Lombardo behind the kit. No doubt first-time listeners will continue to be blown away by the destructive power of \"Angel Of Death\", \"Reign In Blood\" et al as I was 10 years ago but having seen it all live many a time from a leaner, fitter Slayer it's hard to subscribe to the devotion many others seem intent on showing. Without having had to stand all day however to catch the multiple classics that a Slayer show is rammed full of their current status is better served as home viewing for this particular set of veterans show why they were only the second biggest band to emerge from the thrash scene\u2026\n\nHowever there can only be one winner in this contest and whom that is can leave no doubt. Metallica are, with good reason if \"The Big Four\" is anything to go by, one of the biggest live draws in all of music today and such a set as played here explains why - even before considering the 'Big Four Jam' cover of Diamond Head's classic \"Am I Evil?\". Spreading their setlist right across their classic first five albums with a small handful from 2008's return to form \"Death Magnetic\" highlights emerge from all songs, notably in my personal favourite \"One\" with its accompanying firework and pryo explosions setting the tone for that grimmest of lyrical subjects. Utilising every inch of the stage to it's full potential messrs. Hetfield, Ulrich, Hammett and Trujillo give their typical studious best through classic after classic until the Big Four big event happens: a multi-band jam of \"Am I Evil?\" that resonates through the ages \u2013 cult NWoBHM classic transported to a modern-day stadium anthem, with passion throughout. Needless to say the crowd reaction is enthralling and if any further confirmation was needed, a glorious celebration of the power, and history, of these four bands and with it, heavy metal. A celebratory peak of a great genre as it now reaches into its fourth decade of existence: a true story of gritty perseverance getting it\u2019s just deserves.\n\nOriginally written for www.Rockfreaks.net\n",
        "\nMegadeth have always been an odd band for me, and more than a bit of a mixed bag. This was the first album I heard by them, from samples on iTunes, and I'll fully admit this right from the bat: When I first listened to those samples, I thought they were a joke band. \n\nBlasphemy? Perhaps, but only to absurdly obsessive elitists. Or, to be more precise (and fairer), I don't really believe in blasphemy; Metal has no sacred cows. Well, it does, but I couldn't care less, and so to me, they don't exist. A feeling that Megadeth's music, their lyrics, and their vocalist are all a big joke is no more an insult than the overstated (and ridiculously obvious) observations of some metalheads that Metallica have meant nothing since the Black Album. As if, and that's the irony - a lot of those people are simply jealous and angry of Metallica's stunning success in becoming full blown rock stars. Sure they'll deny it, but if you look deep enough, it's there.\n\nAnyway, the point I am trying to make is that whether I believed Megadeth's music was a joke or not at the time was purely arbitrary. Anthrax was often jokey, did that make early classics like Among the Living and Spreading the Disease lame? No. Of course, Megadeth's music isn't a joke, and never has been; putting aside Peace Sells's value as a sacred cow (whether or not to be slaughtered), I fully admit to simply having been ignorant when I first heard the album. Wake Up Dead was, to me, very odd, yet not jokey - just odd. The Conjuring sounded a little like a silly attempt at being evil that, in comparison to Slayer, just didn't work. (I still hold this opinion to this day - more on that later) And the title track? Yeah, that one was an oddball. It was this song, with its not all that heavy riffs and its seemingly jokey vibe, that made me think of Megadeth as a joke band for a while. That was, until I realised the lyrics, despite being sarcastic and snarky, were meant to be taken seriously - I had thought of them as a joke because I'd never heard anything like that in metal before. Previously, it was all either depressing doom metal, brutal thrash, vicious death metal, evil and often raw black metal, or classic metal that I thought of at the time as hard rock (that's for another time). Megadeth were thrash, and they were faster than Metallica, but they weren't brutal like Slayer. They were...well, different.\n\nSome point later, I listened to Rust In Peace, and this...well, again, it was odd. Holy Wars worked for me, but the rest of the album didn't. Again, I had trouble connecting with Megadeth.\n\nFinally, I went back to this album, and this time listened to the songs properly.\n\nMy opinion changed entirely.\n\nPut basically, no matter what you may think of him as a vocalist, Dave Mustaine is, in my opinion as well as that of many others, a somewhat twisted, yet definite genius of a man. In fact, a twisted genius may be the best way to describe him, on this album especially, which is crammed full of crazy yet workable ideas that all come together as one to form a classic thrash album. Yet, this isn't typical thrash at all...nothing on the album is. It's all unusual, very unique, in that way that simply stands out, and like so many others places Megadeth amongst the top metal acts of all time as much because of that uniqueness as anything else, if not more. \n\nWake Up Dead exemplifies this in so many ways. The drum and bass only intro that explodes into...well, odd riffage, with Dave's very odd and, here, very low vocals. Almost like he's whispering, or talking drunkenly. Then this crazy solo kicks in, all the while tempo changes galore have already begun...and we haven't even reached the first memorable riff yet. That's just coming up. As the solo fades out, a new riff begins, eventually shifting into that crushing thrash riff that makes use of Mustaine's unique \"Spider Chord\" style of guitar playing. It repeats four times, then the ending is altered with more Spider Chords...then comes another tempo change, into something even faster, with another crazy solo played over some riffs that sound like they're in the pentatonic scale, except so fast that it's hard to be absolutely sure. Then the song speeds up even more into truly crushing, windmill worthy speeds, with yet more new riffs, now played atonally! Then a somewhat memorable riff kicks in again under Dave's now more prevalent and obvious vocals...and we see that the song is about being found out by your girlfriend after cheating on her. A joke? Not really, as the song's structure indicates. It's odd, frenetic, even disturbing more than funny. \n\nSuddenly it all stops. Then a crushing drumbeat signals the arrival of a new riff - an angry, vicious, slower riff. A few moments later one of the album's greatest solos begins. This is a real killer, a dark harmonic minor scaled solo with a somewhat middle-eastern vibe, but whose real purpose is to sound tense, angry, aggressive, even deathly. The speed and ability of Dave as a guitar player is really pushed to the forefront here. As the solo fades, cries of \"WAKE UP DEEEEAAAD!\" ring out over the continuing riffage. Finally, after this repeats a couple of times, the song ends with a final, almost forlorn \"Wake up dead!\". \n\nAnd all of that, ladies and gentlemen, happened in less than four minutes.\n\nThat's Mustaine for ya. Crazy, fucked up on drugs, booze, and chicks, but oh so clever in his own warped manner.\n\nThe rest of the album is a similarly bizarre, sometimes schizophrenic affair, with a mixture of slower, sometimes more \"normal\" songs, mixed with some insanely fast numbers. \"The Conjuring\" has an intro that tries too hard to be sinister and, in comparison to Slayer, simply doesn't work (this keeping in mind that Hell Awaits was released a year before this album, too). However, once it speeds up, this song is a great thrasher, again with tempo changes, crushing riffs, and crazy solos galore.\nThe title track is absurdly simple, far simpler than almost anything Metallica was doing at the same time, yet it works. Unlike Metallica, Dave didn't have this hypocritical view of being above MTV. He used it, and it worked. Ironically, he was still less popular than Metallica was even before they released the Black Album. In another silly irony, Metallica changed their tune entirely when they released a music video for \"One\", then just decided \"fuck it\" and released the Black Album. I don't hold anything against them for doing that, and in many ways it may simply have been a natural progression. But if they had been less overly anti MTV and anti-commercial from the start, they would probably have got a lot less criticism when they changed, since they wouldn't have been hypocrites.\n\nAnyway, moving on. The point I was trying to make was that Dave didn't care about whether being on MTV made him a sellout or not - he just did it. And yes, Peace Sells is a fairly accessible song by thrash standards. Still, it works, and his snarky, sarcastic delivery is part of that charm. Without it, the song just wouldn't be the same. Once I got used to it, I grew to quite enjoy the song. Not as much as many of the others on the album, but it's still great in its own way. Whether it's a metal classic or not is indisputable, but to me, it's never been more than very good. The lyrics are the best part, both in that they are about being a metalhead (to a point) and just as a general \"fuck the system, I'll do as I please\" song in favour of individual choice, which is very much a metal thing.\n\n\"Devil's Island\" is a very straightforward thrasher, probably more straightforward than any other song on the album in fact. It starts off slow and crushing, has a tiny bass interlude, then becomes a speedy crusher. It's a decent song, yet not much more. For this reason, I have to place it as amongst my least favourite songs on this album (along with the Willie Dixon cover). It's not bad, just very ordinary, which by Megadeth standards is a bit of a bummer.\n\nNow we come to one of this album's true masterpieces. Good Mourning...Black Friday is one of the heaviest, darkest, most aggressive, ugly, nasty, vicious, and fucked up thrash songs not in the category of brutal thrash that you'll find anywhere. By Megadeth standards this is pure evil. Sure it's not that nasty compared to Slayer, Kreator, Sodom, Destruction, Dark Angel, Sepultura, etc, but those all come under the umbrella of brutal thrash, which Megadeth does not. As such, this song is extremely dark and a really vicious thrasher, probably one of the most extreme songs Dave ever wrote.\n\nIt begins ever so slowly, calmly, yet in a sinister way, with a doomy, gloomy vibe suited to a song about a crazed serial killer. The solo here is phenomenal; filled with emotion, bluesy, and dark as fuck, and it just plain works. Continuing over the clean, creepy intro riffs, the song then explodes into heaviness around the 1 minute mark, with the clean guitars overtaken by the distorted ones. The solo then disappears, to be replaced by more clean riffs, except by this point, they are building up and up, tension mounting, reaching a deeper and deeper level, while Dave's vocals appear, now properly after his brief \"Good Mourning\" exclamation earlier. \"Hey, I don't feel so good...something's not right...something's coming over me...what the fuck is this...?\" Boom! That pick slide, and the guitars explode along with Dave! \"WHHHOOOOOOAAAAAA!\" DUN, DUN, DUN, DUN DUN - DUN DUN DUN, DUN, DUNNNNN...it goes on and on. \n\nThen it changes. Very abruptly. Screaming riffage kicks in, along with a new solo, before it all stops again. Then a new riff begins. Some of the most crushing speeds yet heard on the album now can be heard in earnest, along with a crazed performance by Dave. The song stays this way until the end, a maelstrom of madness suited to a twisted, killer looney. Something's not right, indeed.\n\n\"Bad Omen\" is another very dark number, but rather more 'normal' when compared to its predecessor. After a sinister intro, it gets heavy, with some odd sounding pick slides that work very well. Afterwards it's just a straightforward thrasher, but a hell of a lot better overall than \"Devil's Island\".\n\nNow the cover. I'm sorry, but covers of this nature have never really appealed to me, and I'm rather grateful that this stopped following So Far, So Good, So What. I mean, a blues cover on a thrash album? Yes, I know that without blues there would be no rock, thus no hard rock, thus no metal, and thus no thrash...but still, this just doesn't really work. It comes across as very light and silly.\n\nThankfully, one cannot say the same about the very last song here, which is a masterwork in almost every way. \"My Last Words\" opens with a somewhat sinister clean guitar intro, before the distortion kicks in, but without drums, so no actual heaviness...yet. Then the song gets very bluesy, but heavy and fast as fuck. Very much like speed metal here, as much as thrash if not more, but that doesn't matter - Megadeth's unique character has always made them standout, usually in a good way, and this is no exception. Well, the riffs are a little repetitive, I'll admit. I wish it wasn't just the same two riffs repeated ad nauseam for over two minutes. In fact, this is a rather annoying point that could have easily been averted - Dave has more than enough writing ability to have come up with a new riff. Unfortunately he doesn't, not until about 3.10 into the song, at which point everything changes. A vicious (I've really overused that word on this review) speed metal riff kicks in, and the song gets really FUCKING FAST. Seriously. This cross into something almost insane is what makes the song so special. The solo is also phenomenal here, with tons of melody, a few arpeggios, and a great vibe. Finally, the song closes with the same riffs and Dave screaming: \"You! Come on! Next victim! Your...turn to DIE!\". The only silly part is that the song is about Russian Roulette, which is a game usually played by choice. Nevertheless, what a closer.\n\nSo yeah. This album is a masterpiece in almost every way, with a couple of weaker moments. You've got killer songs (pardon the pun) like Wake Up Dead, Good Mourning, and My Last Words. You've got great songs in The Conjuring and Bad Omen. You've got a good song in the title track. And you've got an average song in Devil's Island, plus a barely average cover of Willie Dixon's \"I Ain't Superstitious\". \n\nI've added this up to around 90. The album is great, hugely influential, and some parts of it are masterful. Suffice it to say, looking past the weaker elements that are still here, if you are a fan of thrash, or any metal at all, this is an album you cannot do without. Sure it's got some bad spots, and some rough edges here and there (remember, Megadeth at this point were still a fairly young band - Mustaine's genius aside, they were youthful and in some ways even inexperienced - something that would change drastically by Rust in Peace), but that's part of the charm. That wild abandon, sheer madness in places worthy only of a heavy metal musician. At the end of the day, Peace Sells, for all its flaws, is a winner.\n",
        "\nEndgame was a successful album for Megadeth, and the best thing they have done since the mid 90s. This makes this song even more disappointing. The worst thing about this song is the repetitive rhythm guitar.  It plays the same dull, simplistic half-thrash riff throughout 90% of the song. The guitar leads are all over the place but lack the intensity the band possessed with Rust in Peace; even Endgame was a better example of intensity. They aren\u2019t bad, just Megadeth are capable of so much better. Dave\u2019s vocals are in similar fashion to how they have been lately with his nasally singing voice but lack the aggression and passion he displayed on Endgame.\n\nSo all of this makes for a very boring heavy metal/hard rock song. This is just a song written for a videogame and probably towards an audience that is not very acquainted with heavy metal. It\u2019s a shame Megadeth took a step back after the promising Endgame. Let\u2019s hope this is not a sign of things to come.\n",
        "\nWell well well! What do we have here? Suddenly, Megadeth decided to create a new song for Guitar Hero: Warriors Of Rock huh? We all know that Endgame was a very successfull album, and that it was considered Rust In Peace 2. This song could've actually been on Endgame! In fact, I added it as track 12 to my Endgame album just to get the feeling that it was an Endgame track. At least I can tell you all one thing. If this song had been on Endgame, it would've been the best damn song on there!\n\nI didn't think Mustaine would be able to write such great songs anymore. However, it seems I was VERY wrong. This song is a guitar-attacking song indeed! I guess Mustaine knew what he was doing when he was gonna write this for the new Guitar Hero game.\n\nThe song starts off with a really cool intro that is kind of unusual for Megadeth songs. The intro lasts for a while, as solos keep coming and coming. After this is over, the verse kicks in with it's \"strumming the sixth string!!!\" riff. Mustaine starts singing, as more solos kick in every second. This madness goes on until the chorus arrives, which you can hear is a lot more modern Megadeth-ish. The chorus is ended with Dave yelling, \"Your sudden death from above\" as a little solo goes on in the back. Then we're back to another verse of pure guitar pain, immediately followed by a nice solo. Damn this song has many solos!\n\nThe rest of the song is actually a LONG solo, which has to be the best solo I've heard this year. And that's pretty much it. This song is awesome! What more can I say? I would go as far as to say that it is one of the best songs Megadeth has ever made. So if you thought Deth was dead, then you'd better watch out, for your sudden deth from above may come before you know it!\n",
        "\n20 years ago, the world heard \"Rust in Peace\" explode into their ears. This was and is still hailed as Megadeth's best album to date and now it's time to take a trip back in time.\n\nThis album, recorded and filmed live, is at the legendary Hollywood Palladium not far from where Megadeth formed in 1983, take it home with a entire set of the whole \"Rust in Peace\" album for the fans.\n\nNot only is this the entire \"Rust in Peace\" album recorded live, but it is total order, but that's just the beginning. With the rabid crowd, Megadeth takes stage and the carnage begins. What takes place is a complete thrash monstrosity with \"Holy Wars...The Punishment Due, and the fury lives.\n\nWe get to hear it, ALL of it. The entire Rust album from start to fucking finish. Nothing left out. Every word, every note, every riff after maniacal riff. Newcomer Chris Broderick shows incredible technical prowess and nails every riff and every blistering solo with complete ease. Shawn Drover is a monster drummer and hits it all and never shows any fatigue. Dave Ellefson's bass has tremendous power, and of course, Dave Mustaine has not lost anything as he still has the excellent vocals and shows awesome range and still can destroy the guitar at nearly 50 years old.\n\nThis is one good fucking reason to listen to this and even some added bonuses of a few Mega favorites like \"Peace Sells\" and \"In My Darkest Hour\". With Megadeth back to the metal, \"Trust\" sounds much more favorable, and so does \"She Wolf\". \n\nThis is exactly how Rust in Peace should be heard. With much better production and an incredible crowd, this is going to be the live album to beat, easily the best live recording I have heard and better than the studio version hands down.\n",
        "\nAh, Megadeth\u2026one of metal\u2019s favorite whipping boys. With the specter of Metallica looming over ever since their formation, it seemed as though poor Mr. Mustaine and company just couldn\u2019t do anything right as the years passed and his former band shot into the stratosphere like so many Jennifer Hudsons to come, and just as unnecessarily. And before I continue, I must admit to having quite the pro-Megadeth slant on my end, though with a discerning, open mind; after all, it was they who got me into heavy metal in the first place, perverting my ears with their twisted, neo-classical, \u201cmy fingers are faster than your fingers\u201d brand of music that, essentially, didn\u2019t exist until they came around. However, I still take to their material with a discerning, open mind, knowing that their track history is less than perfect (can\u2019t say the likes of \u201cCountdown to Extinction\u201d and \u201cRisk\u201d were complete, solid works that should have the \u2018Deth brand upon them), and I\u2019ve been able to take in their born again, post-\u201cThe World Needs a Hero\u201d ascension with as open ears as possible, loving every second of it.\n\nWhich brings us to their latest, \u201cEndgame\u201d\u2026\n\nThe way things stand, it seems Megadeth have been on one hell of an upwards journey since Dave got hurt, fixed his arm, went to rehab and came back even more pissed off than before. \u201cThe System Has Failed\u201d was a multi-track boots to the nuts, and \u201cUnited Abominations\u201d was a subtle, grassroots movement meant to dethrone the evil\u2019s prince\u2019s iron fists\u2026but we\u2019d hadn\u2019t heard ANYTHING yet. \u201cEndgame\u201d, in my absolutely humble opinion, has to be one of Megadeth\u2019s strongest works to date, where that fine combination of United\u2019s thickness and melody with System\u2019s unabashed fury shoves you face-first into the realm of conspiracy theories and anti-government rhetoric that\u2019s as anarchistic as they come. This works more naturally and rage-inducing with these guys versus the \u201cthey took mah rahts!\u201d ramblings of, say, Jon Schaffer during his Sons of Liberty period, which makes this listen all the more awe-striking. This is some truly ambitious, venomous material, as at this point in his life Dave seems to have nothing to prove, doesn\u2019t care who he angers anymore, and lets his guitar and patented snarl do all the talking\u2026and talk they do. As before, the riffs are spot-on and monstrous, the leads and solos are blindingly tasteful, the drum work tight and chaotic, the vocals as spiteful and raging as before, and the overall musical approach throw more ideas at you in single songs than others of their ilk can in complete albums. It\u2019s refreshing to know that, even after all these years, Megadeth still have plenty to say and aren\u2019t relegated to grasping at straws subject-matter-wise (though I think a few may still be turned off by the consistent politico-leaning), and even those that divert from the usual lyrical protocols fit the scheme of things just as well. It\u2019s all wondrous on the speedier tracks of \u201cThis Day We Fight!\u201d, \u201c1,320\u201d and \u201cHead Crusher\u201d, especially in the way they augment the slower and more melodious likes of \u201c44 Minutes\u201d, \u201cThe Hardest Part of Letting Go\u2026Sealed with a Kiss\u201d, and \u201cBodies\u201d (NOT that Drowning Pool song, thank God\u2026), going hand in hand to shatter those oh-so-evil preconceived notions of what metal is supposed to be post-millennium. As I may have said before, leave it to the veterans to kick these dumb kids right onto their asses.\n\nIn the end, Megadeth once again kick ass and takes names the way only they can do. In a time when we need good, real, face-melting metal, \u201cEndgame\u201d truly is the cold, refreshing oasis in a creative wasteland. Consider this a call to arms.\n",
        "\nTo all those people who have to argue whether this is \"metal enough\" to be listened to or those who ignore everything this band put out after \"Rust in Peace\", let's just call it hard rock, and move on shall we?. The 90's wasn't an arms race, Dave Mustaine wasn't an angry guy in his twenties anymore. This is just natural progression for the band, no matter how you put it. The guitar strings are tuned down half a step, with more focus on the lyrics and choruses than before. They left behind almost all their thrash metal influences on 'Countdown to Extinction', which isn't to say that there are no memorable riffs or solos on this record. Unlike the surprisingly mediocre and forgettable 'Load' by Metallica, Megadeth do everything right and put out a solid record. Ignore this only if you're a fool.\n\nMustaine's vocals have always been a 'touchy' subject. How much you enjoy them depends mostly on your tastes. Lyrically, the album is a reflection of Dave's views on war, life and other sensitive issues. Everything sounds good enough on the re-mastered version and you need not go out and search for the originals. The riffing is far more simpler than anything else they've ever did. The songs are slower, more melodic, which makes it easier to digest for beginners. The hooky riffs are enough to keep the mainstream rock fans interested. \"Reckoning day\" and \"Train of consequences\" begin the album with some monster riffs that would still make any classic Megadeth fan happy. \n\nThis is the same Megadeth of old, only now in a more accessible and radio-friendly package. \"A tout le monde\" is the first proper hard rock ballad written by Dave, which is way better than the version found on 'United Abominations', which was an abomination itself. The lyrics are crafted in a simple but touching manner. Because unlike bands like Def Leppard, who decided to abandon their balls altogether and make sugary pop rock ballads for mainstream consumption, \"A tout le monde\" was made with integrity still left intact. \"Elysian fields\" and the 4 tracks after it, including the title track are firmly in hard rock territory. Mustaine's song writing is at it's most mature. Nick Menza is the best drummer this band ever had. The drums are mixed brilliantly to complement the thick riffs and snarling vocals over them. Ellefson's bass is ever present and lays a solid foundation for the guitars, although he isn't given too much solo time. Mustaine even finds time to experiment and dabble with mythology and greek history on songs such as \"Elysian fields\" and \"Blood of heroes\". The other tracks fit nicely into the album and plod along without being boring or repulsive. At 50 minutes long, It feels just right. \n\nThis is NOT a second class Megadeth album by any means. This is as good as any they've ever released. Their best record in the past two decades and to this day they haven't topped it yet. This is a band who shaped their sound with changing times but still produced an album of integrity and genuine quality. It is a worthy successor to 'Rust in Peace' or 'Countdown to Extinction'. The remastered version has a few bonus tracks including a demo of \"New world order\", which is very rare. The band would further simplify their sound and fall prey to monotony on their next few albums but 'Youthanasia' is a solid 90's hard rock album and one of the best albums of 1994.\n",
        "\nWell here we have it, Megadeth makes a major change right here in their playing style. The songs start to slow down, the band made their thrust to the mainstream and the 90's change the face of metal forever. Though there were still some fast sections in and out of this one, it feels as if the Megadeth were on the change for a different approach for good while still running under the thrash genre tag. The thing was, thrash basically died as soon as the nineties reared it's ugly head with a few exceptions from other bands who wanted to keep the spirit alive. All the other major thrash line ups made changes as well, and what was once about speed, technical skill and creativity was altered. \n\nNo, I am not saying that this is a bad album, but the changes are evident. First, let's start off with the most appealing tracks so that the best can be separated from the rest. Ashes in Your Mouth is located at the very end of the record. It has a good blend of speed and warns us about the futility and uselessness of armed conflict motivated by vengeance. The bass line combined with the main riff in this one as well as the solo performed at the end gives Ashes in Your Mouth a stable position at the top. \n\nAnother two that belong up there are Symphony of Destruction and Psychotron. The first of the two is on par with Hangar 18 in terms of fame. The notable buildup in the playing style and the final approach to the solo with the marching bass line and stable drum beat make it good. Psychotron repeats the Peace Sells song make up with the fill solos played immediately after the lyrics have their turn up front. This one was based off of comic books again like in Killing is My Business. \n\nI think some other quality playing can be found in This Was My Life, Foreclosure of a Dream, and Sweating Bullets. Architecture of Aggression another war piece, has the machine gun drumming and what sounds like what some troops out of Vietnam would experience. Captive Honor has the unique feel to it like actual puts you in prisoner clothes and sends you to the hole. The solo at 2:30 is one of persona favorites along with the fact that someone's manpussy was sold. High Speed Dirt and Skin Of My Teeth don't do it for me as much as the other titles. I honestly thought that Countdown to Extinction was about HUMAN extinction and not about species of animals disappearing....is Dave making a run for Greenpeace now? But I do enjoy the silence from the guitars and the bass keeps going in the intro. \n\nForeclosure of a Dream has some good melody playing all throughout it, while Sweating Bullets established the stop and start standard with the guitars and psychotic lyrics that makes it feel like someone is suffering from Multiple Personality Disorder. I also like the solo in This Was My Life. \n\nThese songs are at the point now to where Megadeth begins to fit in this mold that has the solos played toward the later half, a verse-chorus-verse composition and shorter play time with less beats per minute. Do I see a mainstream out pour with this one? Why yes of course! Even though the band had placed themselves in the ranks of metal history when \"Rust in Peace Sells\" (as I like t call it to combine their greatest achievements) came out the effort to get some radio airplay was spearheaded by this album. But like I mentioned, it was no disappointment the songs were still catchy and the riffs were still attractive to enthusiastic followers. The solos retained their style and tempo while the lyrics still spelled out to us listeners an impending doom. But this was not the same band anymore, something had been traded in. Meagadeth was walking a different path for now on and if no one had accepted that, they only had until the next few albums to see....\n",
        "\nDave Mustaine having just had four of his songs stolen from him and every guitar solo he\u2019d ever written played by a guitarist that isn\u2019t half creative or talented as himself, he\u2019s pissed off. So what does he do? He finds a bassist and two incredibly talented jazz fusion musicians and writes a genuinely angry and pissed off thrash metal album that is faster, better, and more complex than anything his previous band had done. The newly recruited jazz musicians are Chris Poland and Gar Samuelson, whose different style of playing brought an entirely different feel to this thrash metal album. Although Dave actually plays most of the solos on this album Chris\u2019 style seemed to have rubbed off on him in his song writing. The songs he wrote on this album are more technical than anything previously played by a thrash metal band, some even describe them as sounding jazzy. Not only is Megadeth\u2019s Killing is my Business one of the best thrash debuts, it is also one of the best thrash metal records.\n\nNot only is Dave pissed off about Metallica, he\u2019s also pissed that he can\u2019t get this girl named Diana Aragon. So he writes what he considers a love song. The first song on the album Last Rites/Loved to Death is about a guy who falls in love with a girl but the girl doesn\u2019t love him so he kills her and no one can have her. Dave\u2019s a pretty romantic guy. Dave has explained the guitar part of the song as expressing the sexual frustration of being denied who he wanted. It is one of the few thrash metal songs I can say has real emotion in it.\n\nThe title track is a kinda silly song written about the comic book The Punisher. A hit man is hired to assassinate someone and when he is done also kills his employer who was marked for assassination also. The songs riffs and drumming are incredible and it is one of the few songs on this album to feature a Chris Poland solo, which is incredible also. Some people say Dave\u2019s voice sounds like a wounded duck but on songs like this one no one\u2019s voice could have done better.\n\nThe next two songs Skull Beneath The Skin and Rattlehead are about Vic Rattlehead, Megadeth\u2019s mascot. Rattlehead is the other song on the album that features a Chris Poland solo. Chris Poland plays the guitar licks between each verse. When Chris was younger he suffered from a finger injury that severed one of his tendons on his left hand. This injury allowed Chris to play notes physically impossible to reach by other players on this song.\n\nPeople always associate Megadeth with politically and serious lyrics,, but most of the songs on this album are actually pretty silly. Chosen Ones was written by Dave Mustaine about the Killer Rabbit from Monty Python\u2019s In Search Of The Holy Grail movie. The guitar riffing is jerky and shows some punk influence. Dave Ellefson plays a bass solo near the end of the song one of the only times he really stands out of this album.\n\nLooking Down The Cross puts the album back into a serious mood. In this song Dave puts himself in Jesus\u2019 shoes. The song starts out sad sounding and builds up to a very angry sounding end. This is one of the best songs on the album although they are all good. \n\nSadly the next song can\u2019t quite stand up to Looking down The Cross, Dave being the kind of guy he is, wasn\u2019t gonna let Metallica take his song from him. So he recorded Mechanix, which has the same riffs and solos as Four Horseman, without the added slowed tempo part of Four Horseman. Dave sings his original lyrics about his job at a gas station and fantasizing about all the rich pretty girls that would come by. Dave wanted to prove that his new band was better and faster than Metallica so he decided to play this song way too fast. The entire song sounds sloppy like they did it all in one take. The drums even go off beat for a little bit. Megadeth didn\u2019t seem to put the time they put into other songs into this song. If played more neatly it would be a great track but the way it is it is one of the weakest on the album.\n\nMechanix is not the weakest track on the album, These Boots is. These Boots is a cover song and it doesn\u2019t fit in with the album at all. It is a truly bad song and without it the album would have nearly no flaws, but sadly it was included and the album has a hole in its almost perfect track list. \n\nThe songs on the album are all nearly flawless but the production is lacking. Dave was given 8000 dollars to record an album and he wasted half of it on booze and dope so he had very little money left for recording time. They had to record this album fast and that makes the production sloppy. On the original recording you can barely hear Gar\u2019s bass drum. If you are looking to get this album I recommend the remastered version. Other than that, it is a great album to own if you like thrash metal, it has only three flaws, the sloppiness of Mechanix, the terrible filler song These Boots, and the production quality on the original release.\n",
        "\nRust in Peace by Megadeth is an album that should be known by most fans of the Thrash metal genre even if they haven't personally heard it. Megadeth have never been anywhere near as heavy as the heaviest bands in the thrash metal genre but they simply don't need to be. The music in this album is expressed in a unique way that you will never confuse it with any other thrash metal album. It is an album with incredibly technical playing in all instrumental components and is not only Megadeth's magnum opus but it is one of a few magnum opus's in the speed/thrash metal genre.\n\nIf melodic thrash metal was a recognized genre then this would be a clear definition of it as the production values are crystal clear and power metal influences are evident in most of the solos. By the first few seconds of the opening track \"Holy Wars... The Punishment Due\" which I still can't believe it's a single, it will assault you with an array of speedy riffs that are unrelenting and this sets the standard for a majority of the album. Not everything is the speed metal that you will be quickly conditioned to, the opener drastically changes into a slower, heavier song via an acoustic bridge segment and you should be prepared for this throughout the course of the album as the songs shift from flat out thrash e.g. \"Take No Prisoners\" to more progressive based structures e.g. \"Five Magics\"\n\nDave Mustaine's vocals are adequate considering he also contributes to the guitar playing but they're a fair bit away from the most desirable vocals I have heard. They have a very snarly and gritty feel to them that suit a live situation very well but are a bit off at times and can cause you to misinterpret some of the lyrics if you're not careful. The lyrics are very intelligent and range widely in subject matter, I mean even the singles aren't in the slightest bit slouches, \"Hangar 18\" covers the topic of ufo conspiracy, something that through all my metal discoveries have never heard any other song do.\n\nThe riffs and guitar solos are simply unbelievable at times. Don't be surprised if a solo catches you off guard and lasts several minutes. Marty Friedman is an incredibly talented guitarist, unfortunately this is the only Megadeth album that he has performed on that the true tapped potential of Marty seeps through. Unlike many metal albums the bass guitar playing of David Ellefson is very audible and serves as the perfect supplement to the lead and rhythm guitar parts. Nick Menza's drum parts won't astonish anyone here but there are many competent fills and patterns to be found.\n\nWith the only real drawbacks of this album being some vocal parts and the unneeded song \"Dawn Patrol\" that is quite absurd but luckily it's the second last song and the haste it absorbs is limited. Rust In Peace is in my top 5 thrash metal albums of all time and I am quite sure it will be a worthy asset to any thrash fan that can appreciate the more technical, melodic and progressive side to the thrash metal genre. I count it as Megadeth's most balanced effort, an effort by them that nothing of the same caliber has been done by them before the release of this album. Megadeth's recent efforts have also been quite good to say the least, but I doubt anything they do in the future will match this, I can only hope.\n",
        "\nEvery time a new Megadeth release is in the works, everyone jumps to offer their opinion on how it should be the next Rust in Peace. Well, this time around Dave didn't listen, just like the last few times, but it turns out that he made a good call. A damn good call. Endgame stands out as the band's best release since Youthanasia, and fits right in with their mid-90's Countdown to Extinction/Youthanasia sound. It\u2019s diverse, it has some really angry lyrics in places, and the production is very well done, making it an enjoyable listen. I\u2019ve got nothing against the other guys who\u2019ve tried to replace Marty Friedman, but adding Chris Broderick on lead guitar has really stepped up the soloing this time around as well. If we\u2019re lucky, he\u2019ll stick around for a while.\n\nI knew this was going to be good when Dialectic Chaos started up and a wicked-yet-simple ascending lead bit started playing a few seconds into the song. Megadeth hasn't done a really solid instrumental for a few years, and this one is great. The lead tradeoffs between Mustaine and Broderick put the listener on notice that this time, they mean it. Most of the tracks are very solid, and stand up well as part of Megadeth's diverse catalog. 44 Minutes is a nice, mid-paced, melodic metal song, something that Megadeth does exceptionally well. In fact, Megadeth doesn't get nearly enough credit for writing this kind of music as far as I'm concerned, thanks in no small part to the \"all we want is Rust in Peace 2\" sheeple, many of which have infiltrated various media outlets tasked with offering critical reviews of Mustain and Company's latest releases. Bodies, the track I was initially the most interested to hear as it was a leftover from United Abominations, chugs along nicely, with a verse riff that really complements Dave's singing. The layered vocals in the chorus are also done rather well, understated and not over-obvious, if that makes sense. Endgame is a typical Mustaine-penned political statement. The line about waking up in a FEMA box is completely hilarious, and once the track gets going it really moves. OK, the lyrical content may seem to be a bit too tinfoil-hat for some people, but what the hell, if you want something better, write it your damn self. Or better yet, go out and do a little research to find out just what it is Mustaine is singing about, and you might learn something. Megadeth has the power to foster education! Take that, PMRC! The album closes on a high note with The Right to Go Insane, which to me sounds conceptually like a \"more metal\" version of Breadline. Again, we've got some great layered vocal lines in the chorus, catchy lyrics, and some very solid riffing. My favorite track on the CD by far is How the Story Ends. It has a grinding intro riff, a verse riff reminiscent of Holy Wars, and a chorus that ranks up there with anything Mustaine has written in the past. It's the kind of chorus that will stick in your head for days: relatively simple, yet at the same time very well composed. Beyond the music, the real attractive part of this song is the hilarious way that you can interpret the lyrical content. Ok, bear with me for a minute, but every time I hear this song all I can think of is Sherman's March to the Sea during the Civil War. Yeah, that\u2019s not what Mustaine meant for the song to be about, but I find the ability to interpret it in my own way makes it that much more amusing. Especially when you consider that from that standpoint, \"The Story\" could be Gone With the Wind. I know, I've lost it, but come on, that's just hilarious. Think about it for a few minutes and you'll see where I'm coming from.\n\nThere are a few low points to the album, the most obvious being Headcrusher. Interestingly, this track, the album's first single, has been relatively well-received by the fans, and even garnered Megadeth a Grammy nomination. It has blazing fast riffs and blistering solos reminiscent of the Rust in Peace glory days...but the song just doesn't really do anything special for me. It seems like it was written to satiate the aforementioned sheeple without directing the overall musical course of the album. When the listener realizes just how well done the overall album is, that turns out to be a good thing. The rest of the tracks on Endgame are pretty standard Megadeth fare; they'll appeal to some fans more than others, but for the most part they're not too shabby. They're certainly more aggressive than Megadeth's past few albums, and they do manage to show off Mustaine and Broderick\u2019s chops pretty well. The only problem is that for me, a lifelong Megadeth fan who constantly spends money on all the imports, singles, bootlegs, and whatnot that I can find, they just don\u2019t seem to hold my interest very long.\n\nOverall, the album is definitely a solid release. If it does anything, it proves that yeah, Dave can still play stupid-fast thrash, but it also proves that Megadeth's strength is the mid-paced, groovy metal song. They just might do that better than anyone else out there at the moment. And if you haven't been paying attention, or have been hanging around too many of those irritating sheeple, they've been doing it just as well ever since Countdown to Extinction. This album really seems to bring that aspect of Megadeth's music to the forefront more than any other recent release. That\u2019s also why this isn\u2019t really a true \u201creturn to form\u201d for the band, but in this case, it turns out that they really didn\u2019t need to do that in order to put out a solid album. I mean, seriously. Come on. Rust in Peace 2? Why? How the hell can you top that album anyway? Give me solid, original Megadeth music over a rehash of something that's already been done any day of the week. That's precisely what Endgame delivers, and precisely why it deserves to be mentioned as perhaps the band's strongest release in recent years.\n",
        "\nWell apparently lars ulrich was the excuse in making the album, He asked his former best friend dave to 'start taking some risks'. Dave mustaine and his pop metal friend marty friedman set out to just that. A disco album for the ages, One that has been played out in nightclubs since 1999. \n\nDave somehow felt that the song 'Prince of darkness' had to be in a 'best of megadeth' CD. Thankfully, This song was not a tribute to the real prince of darkness, Ozzy osbourne. This song has some of the most painful mustaine vocals ever, and has some of the simplest one chord chugga-chugga guitar riffs. Marty friedman was very eager to tap into the nu metal and pop market but you can't blame the guy. Everybody has different tastes and he somehow felt that his work on 'Rust in peace' or any other megadeth album wasn't aggressive enough. \n\nThe worst song ever done by a megadeth is 'breadline', Which sounds like a megadeth cover of a bryan adams song or something. Dave mustaine as usual does his trademark talk-singing which can work/not work depending on the situation. He wrote songs like this on 'Cryptic writings' but they had a degree of honesty and conviction in them. This totally feels like an experiment gone wrong. Most of the songs on this album don't even pass as hard rock songs, They're electronic/dance music at best. I've seen glam-metal songs which are a million times lot less cheesier than this one.\n\n'Crush em' is a bearable song and features a very poppy if slightly enjoyable chorus. \"Crush....crush.....crush em.....Crush em!\". The music video for this still rings in my mind, Megadeth succeeded in making complete fools of themselves. Not to mention the tie-in with the ridiculous movie that was 'Universal soldier'. Next comes my absolute favorite song on this album, \"Insomnia\", Boy his vocals are so high in the mix, He screams like a frustrated woman. This is where megadeth failed to capitalize. They should've made a different music video for this particular track, Featuring Dave, Marty and the others doing some break dancing around a camp-fire. There is a pure disco-beat section complete with electronic drum beats and a simple over-processed one chord riffs like the ones you find in many nu metal albums.\n\nMegadeth were never meant to be like this, They're better off doing what they do best or atleast doing what they did on 'Youthanasia' or the commercially successful 'Countdown to extinction'. There are 3 remixes on this album for all you dancers and freestyle hip hop guys out there, Dave mustaine personally added three electronic mixes of songs such as 'Insomnia' which are guaranteed to set the dance floor on fire. Then there are songs such as 'Wanderlust' which sound like something done by jon bon jovi in recent years. 'Wanderlust' isn't the worst song on this album but that isn't saying much. As for the drumming, What drumming?. Sepultura's 'roots' album is better than this by a country mile. Atleast max cavalera admitted to be influenced by bands like korn and deftones.\n\nIf you're a thrash metal fan, Skip this. If you're a hard rock fan, I wouldn't recommend this one, Try 'Youthanasia' by the same band. If you're a fan of addictive over-processed electronic beats such as the ones found on your favorite micheal jackson cd mixed with some of the most ridiculous guitar riffs ever done, Not to mention the woman-like over-processed vocals of dave mustaine. Get this. You will love it.\n",
        "\nFor almost two decades, people have been longing for Dave Mustaine to find and fire his silver bullet and end the curse of the long string of weak to 'just okay' albums that have stained the 'Deth legacy. To be fair, Countdown to Extinction had its moments (if you ignore the abominable \"Sweating Bullets\") and Youthanasia was a great album (though different for Megadeth). But after that...a void. Over the course of the past few records, Mustaine and his ever-shifting lineup have been writing more in the vein of their masterpiece Rust in Peace, and this 12th album Endgame is the closest to pulling it off.\n\nThe key is, of course, the guitar work. And Endgame is brimming with lightning riffs and mountains of shred. The musicianship on this album is evidence that Dave's fingers have not rusted in peace, and that he continues to make good choices in who performs alongside him. Shawn Drover and James Lomenzo return from the last run, with newcomer Chris Broderick (Jag Panzer, etc) taking over Glen Drover's guitar spot. Mustaine's vocals feel 'meh' as they often do, though they retain their mocking sneer. Lyrically, the album covers the usual mix of politics, murder, mayhem and racing. There are a few points (as is the tradition for Mustaine) where they are timed in places where they feel corny, but after reading through all the lyrics: they are hardly poetic, but not terrible.\n\nBut yeah, back to the guitars. On most songs here, they are simply explosive. \"This Day We Fight!\" feels like an outtake from Rust In Peace remixed for 2009, building a dynamic thrash groove that is faster than fuck. The 'racer' \"1-320\" is also anchored by some seriously badass riffing, another of the tunes I've been revisiting. \"Bite the Hand\" is another killer fast paced track. For slower fare, in the vein of \"Symphony of Destruction\" we have the rocking \"Bodies\" and the great \"How the Story Ends\". I also dug the hooks in \"The Right to Go Insane\".\n\nHowever you feel about Mustaine and 'Deth's turbulent history, Endgame is good, and the myriad of quality riffs here only grow on you with repeated listens. The mix is superb, I don't think the guitars have ever sounded better on a Megadeth album. This is a thrash/speed metal album through and through, the days of experimental suck of the mid to late 90s are long since over and Mustaine has reconciled himself to do what he does best. Like the latest Metallica, this is finally something to be excited about. The riffs and vocal hooks could be a little catchier, but this is worth the money for any Megadeth fan.\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nFor Risk, the title can\u2019t get anymore fitting unless it was a paragraph blatantly explaining the story behind the title and the risks involved. Megadeth\u2019s poppiest songs since Youthanasia appear here, but those were damn good while this one is half and half. It\u2019s not as bad as people make it out to be if you really dig catchy, groovy rock songs, but if you\u2019re expecting any of the early material (or the latest, for that matter), then you best stay away from this one. For the record, this is a hard rock album (expecting heavy metal isn't unfounded, though). I can appreciate some of these songs because they\u2019re catchy, have a groovy rhythm, or contain some great atmosphere and melodies. Marty Friedman\u2019s input I couldn\u2019t give two more shits about, but Dave and David are the ones making it work for the songs that don't bomb. I've always especially loved the bass in Megadeth \u2013 so clear, blubbery, booming, and delectable. Ellefson nails the lower end better than the drum bass, which itself is chalky and backed by a polished kit. The production on the album is top-notch, but not digital or very loud; Dave\u2019s vocals are at the very front while everything else clamors right behind him.\n\nThe album goes up and down in terms of quality all the damn time. Dave\u2019s vocals aren\u2019t even that big of an issue for me \u2013 those nasally, high, not-nearly-speaking lines (which he does a lot of) have a charm that goes along with the album\u2019s meandering tone. To me, I can sing along with them and am easily susceptible to their shit-eating appeal \u2013 it\u2019s a guilty pleasure that I can\u2019t help but latch onto. Odd how I can stand Dave\u2019s attempt to be melodic here while almost everything he does on United Abominations makes me want to puke in a cat\u2019s litter box. As far as I\u2019m concerned, even the songs with an ounce of melody in them like \u201cThe Doctor Is Calling\u201d and the last three tracks are all horrible incarnations that should have remained locked away in Dave\u2019s born-again drug-waste of a mind. The formula is incredibly simplistic, as are the riffs in most of the songs. There\u2019s hardly any risk-taking aside from dumbing the songs down and making them poppier, but that\u2019s probably what Lars of Metallica was getting at anyway when he used that word on Dave.\n\nEven the songs that fall in-between like \u201cInsomnia,\u201d \u201cBreadline,\u201d and \u201cEnter The Arena / Crush \u2018Em\u201d all contain annoying moments that make me cringe in my seat. The album is so polished and every instrument sounds wonderful in tonality and quality, but sometimes Dave gets carried away with singing in a way that his voice really can\u2019t reach. Other moments just sound pompous and pretty stupid in a tough-guy way (\u201cCrush \u2018Em\u201d is all over that), but they spoil the song itself rather than the whole album. The riffs for these middle-road songs and the shittier ones are both effortless and memorable, which helps in the long run. Their power makes them ring well, but often you\u2019ll feel like this album heads into country / hard rock territory rather than becoming nu-metal or some alternative metal bullshit.\n\nThe songs that really keep this one in my library are \u201cPrince Of Darkness,\u201d the \u201cWanderlust\u201d / \u201cEcstasy\u201d duo, and my favorite track on the album, \u201cI\u2019ll Be There.\u201d I\u2019ve never really considered Dave\u2019s vocals to be very good at all, but he really shines on these tracks. \u201cPrince Of Darkness\u201d builds up into a twisted, dark song with an infectious rhythm and a very likable chorus that kills almost everything else on the album. It hits you so early, making you think this album won\u2019t be all that bad. Compared to \u201cI\u2019ll Be There,\u201d \u201cPrince Of Darkness\u201d is nothing \u2013 this track, for all Dave\u2019s vocals are worth \u2013 is the shining moment of Risk and Mustaine knows it. The tone for this song couldn\u2019t get anymore depressing and haunting \u2013 he had a particular audience in mind when writing it, and you can hear him pouring his heart out into it. No matter what I could think of them, I find my getting into the song more than any other during this era of Megadeth \u2013 the chorus, the slick leads, and that bouncy drum beat that could cater to just about every dance club in the world. It pisses me off that such a beautiful song is stuck on such a mediocre album, especially with that two-minute outro that has me wailing with Dave. Hell, I\u2019d call it the best song of that era hands down \u2013 Megadeth\u2019s best song from 1996-2002. So catchy, fun, and heartbreaking \u2013 going above and beyond anything this album can offer. \n\nThat song can\u2019t save this entire album, but god damn it stands out. Hard to believe that the skill of Mustaine and Friedman, two more than capable guitarists, had to be wasted on such simple songwriting and dry riffs overall, though. The mood is there (compared to the unexciting Cryptic Writings) and the groove gets you in that mood, but you can\u2019t buy me over with a few good songs and a whole bunch of dead ones. Whether you give into this album\u2019s negative hype or not, there are some songs on here that aren\u2019t all that bad. Go for Megadeth\u2019s other albums, sure, but if there are any risks you should take, it might as well be this one.\n",
        "\nWell, well, well...here we go again.\n\nThis record is a combination of Dave Mustaine and his legendary insecurity (why he would listen to Lars I don't know) combined with Marty and his need to explore \"pop\" music. The mythology behind it's creation is a pointless discussion though as the end result was neither good nor earth-shattering to anyone but the ever paranoid metal through that seems to believe that every band bored with it's concept is out to get them.\n\n\"Risk\" is a risk in terms of Megadeth changing it's sound, but the end product sounds more like an exploration of classic rock (\"Breadline\" sounds like a throwaway track from the mid-1970's Alice Cooper band) with moment to moment electronic touches and prog-rock goofiness that goes nowhere fast. In comparison to Metallica's much debated \"Load\", this seems like a goofy jam session by a band with no clue what it is attempting to create, busting out classic rock and frat rock tracks that sound like they were rehearsing in a garage in some remote location over a few cheap domestics.\n\n\"Insomnia\" provides a few interesting sonic bursts, but the rest of the record comes across with a lazy vibe that neither \"rocks\" nor \"rolls\" with it's classic-rock hints. Songs like \"Ecstasy\" (not much above your typical college-radio hit) or \"Crush'em\" (horrible pop-wash) would fail to engage a mainstream audience and would gain a reaction of bored eye-rolling that couldn't even bring the metal community to debate it like the aformentioned sister release \"Load\". Megadeth simply changed, produced a record that will most likely be forgotten instead of being seen a sign of change... I purchased the record for $2.99 in a bin, and this speaks volumes about the records impact.\n\nAfter this non-event of a record, Dave proclaims a grand return to metal (unlike Metallica - nobody cared enough about this record to \"leave\" the throng or \"hate\" them) and went on to release fast, but generally secondary records - a trend that remains to this day.\n\nOh well.\n\n(Also to note - the lowest point on this release is Mustaine letting out a Hetfield styled \"yeah, yeah\" on the song \"Princes of Darkness\" which makes a horrible song even worse for wear.)\n",
        "\nAs a long time Megadeth fan, I find this release fairly unexciting because it\u2019s obviously nothing new. I've heard everything before and I'm sure you have too. I own most of the albums, Back To The Start, and The Arsenal Of Megadeth. Other fans of Megadeth will most likely agree with me and be bored and probably feel conned out of their money, considering the X number of compilations and Best of\u2019s already out there. This release is the same old Megadeth, just in different order, in a different package. But I'm not here to review this for its content relevance; I'm here to review this for what it is. An anthology. A good anthology should contain the major songs from a bands entire catalogue. Which is covered here relatively well with the omission of some newer stuff. Unlike Back to the Start, which was the first album I bought that got me into Megadeth; this is a two disk collection. It spans from 85\u2019s Killing is my Business to 01\u2019s The world Needs a Hero, respectively, with some live tracks thrown into the mix. \n\nThe coverage of Megadeth\u2019s career goes as follows: 3 from Killing is my Business, 3 from Peace Sells, 4 from So Far, So Good, So What?, 4 from Rust in Peace, 6 from Countdown to Extinction (including Demos), 3 from Youthanasia, 3 from Hidden Treasures, 2 from Trust, 2 from Risk, 1 from The World Needs a Hero, and some very good live tracks as well. \n\nThis anthology is pretty solid as far anthologies go. However, I did not like the fact that The System has Failed was not included for it has some excellent tracks. The inclusion of 4 tracks from So Far, So Good, So What? I thought was a bit much because although it is a very good album, it is (in my opinion) not as important as Peace Sells or Rust in Peace, and I don\u2019t think Anarchy in the U.K. should have been included. I also thought that countdown to extinction was heavily represented and more should have been from the thrash era Megadeth. Although I'm not surprised at this considering the popularity of 90\u2019s mainstream Megadeth and Dave\u2019s goal for success. Overall though, this is a competent anthology and a decent illustration of the history of Megadeth. Especially the live tracks, which are my favourites.\n\nCovering the history of Megadeth in one release is almost pointless to fans of the band because there are already so many releases available. To fans that already have all of the albums and I would advise not buying this because it contains nothing you haven\u2019t all ready heard before (and paid good money for). I do however, recommend this for youngsters who have never heard Megadeth before and are interested in them to buy this because it covers all the Key songs throughout the history of this legendary band. On the plus side, it\u2019s relatively cheap. I bought it at Wall-Mart for $15!\n",
        "\nI will be honest with you from the very beginning. I do not like this album! I do not like it because it\u2019s simply not heavy metal. It has nothing to do with Megadeth since I have always been a fan of them, even when things were not that good e.g. So Far So Good\u2026 For most of the times I admired Mustaine\u2019s attitude and his songwriting. I liked the bands performing and I had great confidence in their skills and abilities. When they turned away from thrash metal, I remained faithful and I kept buying their CDs and supporting them when people I knew claimed that they had been sold-out. But this, well this is something else!\n\nWithout any sense of dignity, this ex-metal band, delivers a pointless, strengthless, uninspired album that consists of many, too many, commercial, \u201cradio-friendly\u201d compositions, aiming to non-metal listeners. There is a significant absence of nerve, tension and speed. The majority of the songs are so dull and boring that at times I feel like shooting myself in the head! I never thought I\u2019d find jazz and Rn\u2019B traces in an album of the once thrash/speed metal masters of the kind. The unrepeatable thrashy guitar breaks are no more and the multiple riff changes are gone for good. The guitars are plain pop and the rhythm section is extremely weak. I do not who is to blame for this release, the band, Mustaine alone, the record label, but he surely must be shot to death!\n\nWhat you get in Cryptic Writings is twelve songs divided into three categories. The first one consists of six, yes six, abominations. Almost Honest and Have Cool, Will Travel are two perfect examples. They have no structure, no basic riffs, no energy, no nothing. Totally, utterly, completely horrible, they belong to the gutter. The few breaks that come out of nowhere can\u2019t save them.\n\nThe second category that submits into mediocrity is made of two tracks. The opener Trust is kind of okay though miles away from the spirit of \u2018Deth. It\u2019s mid-tempo with a decent riff but still\u2026 The other one that stands just above the shit-hole is Sin which is merely a filler but maybe you will be able to listen to it from the beginning to the end.\n\nThe only reason that keeps me from throwing away the CD are the songs that belong to the first category, that of heavy metal songs. The Disintegrators and She Wolf are the two well-hidden metal diamonds, behind the wall of shit. They are fast, strong and steady, featuring excellent guitar work, hard drums and a metal feeling in them reminding of the good, old days. The remaining two tracks, Vortex and F.F.F. are pretty damn good with once more nice riffing and they stand out quite well.\n\nIf this is supposed to be the natural development and evolution from where Youthanasia left off, then I prefer to be called a primitive savage while I\u2019ll be listening to all the great stuff they did in the past.\n",
        "\nThe late 1980\u2019s were thrash heaven. Ground was being broken everywhere; landmark and genre-defining classics were falling out of the sky. Metallica and Slayer were gods, Dark Angel was brutalizing ears and Kreator were pumping out twisted riffs that made your neck ache and your brain explode. It was raining thrash classics and Megadeth\u2019s So Far, So Good, So What! was no exception.\n\nKicking off with the instrumental intro \u2018Into the Lungs of Hell\u2019, So Far, So Good, So What! immediately grabs you by the face and lets you know that Megadeth means business. Once it finishes, you hear the dropping of a nuclear bomb before being kicked in the face by the first riff of the mighty \u2018Set the World Afire\u2019. This album is packed with not just Megadeth classics but thrash classics. Even the weaker tracks on this record (and that\u2019s arguable) like \u2018Mary Jane\u2019 and \u2018502\u2019 will make you bang your head and feel the hairs on the back of your neck stand up as metal pumps through your veins. The most famous song from the album, \u2018In My Darkest Hour\u2019, is Megadeth\u2019s answer to Metallica\u2019s \u2018Welcome Home (Sanitarium)\u2019. It\u2019s not as good as that song, but it\u2019s really close. A beautiful mid-paced tune that explodes into hyper drive as Mustaine sings \u201cPlease God, send me on my way!\u201d The closer\u2014and a personal favorite\u2014\u2018Hook in Mouth\u2019 is a fist-pumping thrash bash with a main riff that is a perfect example of why thrash metal is so awesome. If you aren\u2019t screaming \u201cYOU SAY YOU\u2019VE GOT THE ANSWERS WELL WHO ASKED YOU ANYWAY!?\u201d and grinning at the signature Mustaine snarl, then I don\u2019t know what to tell you. You might be slipping into a coma and going to a dimension where metal doesn\u2019t want you. The only thing that prevents this album from getting a perfect rating from me is the cover of \u2018Anarchy in the U.K.\u2019. It\u2019s not that it\u2019s a terrible cover or anything, but it really should have been included as a bonus track or maybe a b-side to a single as it feels out of place on the record.\n\nOne of the biggest appeals of this record for me is that which seems to drive some people away from it: the production. In the 1990\u2019s Megadeth would go on to more crisp, clean and polished productions. But not on this record. Fuck no. This production is dark, dirty, gritty and fits the music perfectly. The production, combined with the attitude of this record and where Mustaine was in his life at this point, makes it the darkest, angriest, most drug-laced and in my opinion best album that Megadeth ever made. Peace Sells\u2026But Who\u2019s Buying? had a gritty production job itself, but not like this. This record makes you think of nights on streets where you really wouldn\u2019t want to be. It also makes helps to make this record the monster that it is.\n\nIf you\u2019re a newbie to the metal world and are curious about Megadeth, you\u2019re safe in picking up any of the first four albums but this would be my first recommendation. That\u2019s right. I\u2019ll take this over the overrated Rust in Peace any day. Now, don\u2019t think for a second that I don\u2019t think that album\u2019s awesome, but the production was cleaner and the riffs weren\u2019t as mean. The riffs on So Far, So Good, So What! are fucking mean. I myself have been listening to this album for over 15 years and I\u2019ll never get tired of it. It\u2019s an absolute classic in every sense of the word and deserves way more respect than it\u2019s gotten over the years. You, as a metal fan, are doing yourself a disservice by not having heard it. If you are someone who dismissed it long ago, you\u2019re missing out. Big time.\n",
        "\nOnce upon a time there was a speed/thrash metal band called Megadeth. They came out of nowhere but as the years went by they turned into a great band that released two metal masterpieces driving their fans delirious. But all good things finally come to an end. In their place, another band with the same name was born. And this album ends the era of Megadeth as we knew them. The thrash metal hymns belong to the past, replaced by more classic heavy metal compositions. Songs, somewhat more commercial make up this album probably aiming for a wider audience. No, I am not saying that Youthanasia is a bad album, on the contrary it is pretty good and solid. It is just not Megadeth. But for the familiar vocals, it would have been difficult for me to recognize them.\n\nMany had foreseen this change from their previous release Countdown to Extinction. All the elements that had become the bands trademark have reduced dramatically. The guitar riffs, though still heavy, are much slower and the pounding, thrashing drums more technical and calm. The vocals are well improved and this is really good. You can almost say that he sings this time. The rhythm section is quite strong and the solos very inspired and interesting. Then why do I fell so disappointed? I admit that when I first heard Youthanasia I was very excited but with time all this excitement faded away. And that\u2019s because of the quality of the compositions. Even though the band is in a very good shape, the songs are not that great and breathtaking. Even now that I\u2019m listening to the album I feel kind of bored.\n\nThere are some very nice moments in here like the opener Reckoning Day which really is a good song, with a bit fast and catchy riff and hard drumming. Friedman still delivers excellently, playing some truly melodic guitar themes. Okay, it\u2019s not Rust in Peace, it\u2019s not Skin \u2018O My Teeth but still it\u2019s very good. Train Of Consequences begins with sharp guitars and has a very strong, steady pace all the way. The use of harmonica may sound kind of strange but I think it fits quite well in here.\n\nThe other two good songs of the album are Blood Of Heroes and The Killing Road. They feature some heavy, fast at times riffs and a general heavy feeling, hard to experience in most of the album\u2019s playing time. They are not very speedy but they possess something of the old Megadeth in them. They clearly stand out compared to the mediocrity of other compositions that are few but truly boring. I\u2019m referring to Elysian Fields, Family Tree and Black Curtains. Completely dull and meaningless these ones take out points from the album and are just plain fillers. Ignore them!\n\nThere are also some slow, dark atmospheric tracks like Addicted to Chaos and I Thought I Knew it All, that have some pretty melodies and make a nice package but that\u2019s all. The closing song, Victory and the self-titled one are decent compositions, above the average yet not in the spirit of earlier Megadeth.\n\nIn my humble opinion, I believe that Youthanasia does not stand up to the expectations of the fans. Not mine anyway. Megadeth found a safe path to tread on and this is what they chose to follow. I don\u2019t blame them for that. This release is not horrible but it is miles away from the brilliant albums they gave us in the past.\n",
        "\nBefore I started writing this review I thought it would be wise to listen to Rust In Peace since I hadn\u2019t listened to it for some time. It was a huge mistake! When the CD ended, I needed a few minutes to catch my breath and pull myself together and realize what exactly hit me! Until I finally figured it out. It was the shock waves that came from the nuclear explosion caused by Megadeth! Now that I recovered my senses I feel ready to begin.\n\nIn 1990 a new era had risen for the American speed/thrash metallers. This time the light of hope was delivered by the duo Friedman/Menza whose contribution to the creation of Rust In Peace was enormous. Dave Mustaine, almost drug-free, almost sober, almost humane to his partners but mostly to himself, completely unfolds his talent, a talent that we were barely allowed to discover in the past. With the skillful and experienced guitarist Marty Friedman by his side, he feels freer and gets more space since he doesn\u2019t have to compose all the guitar parts by himself or do solos all the time. On the other hand he offers some intensely political lyrics, extremely penetrating and often very personal like in Poison Was the Cure that\u2019s about his drug addiction and whose lyrics are shocking.\n\nIn general everything is almost perfect with this album and the only arguable thing is the vocals. Either you will love them or you will hate them. I tend towards the first. Go Dave! The production has been done by Mustaine and Dave Clink and is crystal clear providing the field for the instruments to sound very heavy.\n\nThe top moments of the album are\u2026 what the hell am I saying? Every song is a diamond and it\u2019s impossible to leave one out. The metal massacre begins from the very first riff of Holy Wars\u2026The Punishment Due. The fantastic intro based on the guitars and pounding drums create a war atmosphere and Megadeth take heads and break necks as you can\u2019t stop headbanging to the thrash rhythms of the song. Nick Menza is tremendously performing behind the drum kit when he lets his galloping horse rhythms but also when he decides to hold the reins. The inspired breaks will not leave you bored not for a second. This one is a blaster!\n\nTake No Prisoners is a war song with all its sense. From the machine-gun guitar playing to the freaking war lyrics of \u201cgoing to war, give \u2018em hell, D-Day, next stop Normandie\u201d the track explodes and obliterates everything. Friedman delivers excellent riffs and solos and is proved to be the best choice for the band.\n\nHangar 18 is not as speedy as the foretold ones but surely is one of the most interesting as it deals with a subject we all are intrigued; alien existence and the secrets hidden from us by the governments of the world. And if you have seen the video of the song, it becomes more and more exciting.\n\nPoison Was The Cure is a very personal track, self-explanatory of the shit-hole Mustaine had fallen into some time before. The guitars thrash all the way and the three minutes it lasts pass with great delight. It is a typical Megadeth thrash song which leaves you breathless and shattered. Dawn Patrol is a small bass and drums theme that clears the path for the closing track, the masterpiece called Rust In Peace\u2026Polaris. Menza enters with a technical drum intro and the heavy guitars follow to spread their nuclear energy upon us. Megadeth\u2019s nuclear submarine has just surfaced and launches its deadly missiles on the metal world.\n\nThe rest of the songs have nothing to envy from the previous killers. All of them are bombastic in their own way filling up the space in the best possible way. Looking for fillers? You won\u2019t find one in here! Nine superb songs, including Dawn Patrol, equally good and inspired leave no doubt that Megadeth are at their best and Rust In Peace is an album essential for every metal fan that respects himself.\n",
        "\nTwo years after the release of Rust In Peace and just when the dust from their nuclear holocaust had began to settle down, Megadeth unleashed their fifth hit on humanity, titled just as properly, Countdown To Extinction. That self-centered bastard called Mustaine has almost totally expelled his self destructing tendencies that marched along with his genius, or even better, he fitted them in his music. He is following a procedure of cleansing and with the help of his teammates he creates another heavy metal masterpiece. He is being in peace with himself and has finally realized who he is and what he can offer.\n\nIt was a matter of time for Friedman and Menza to fully adjust themselves to the band and its needs and now they contribute to the song writing and the lyrics. Even the low-profile Dave Ellefson composed his own parts for the bass. If this not a sign of improvement then I don\u2019t know what is. The chemistry of the album is based not on drugs and dope but on the friendly climate and bonding between the musicians. The music is very heavy, somewhat denying the speed chapter but investing on classic, traditional metal. The main ingredients of this album are inspiration, melody, technique and feeling. Most of the lyrics give out bitterness but at times they reflect optimism and hope. Once again Megadeth deal with a variety of themes like war, drugs, politics and even nature.\n\nIn terms of music, the basic elements of Megadeth are found here. From the weird singing of Mustaine, the firm bass guitar, the dynamic drums to the superb, typical riffs, this is a pure Megadeth album with less speed but with balls of metal. Friedman is once again in great shape and delivers tremendous guitar playing. His riffs are exciting and strong, his solos inspired and melodic without losing their metal feeling. Menza\u2019s skillful drumming gives the appropriate push to the songs and Ellefson offers the best with his steady, firm bass lines. All these fit perfectly with the familiar vocals creating an insane atmosphere.\n\nMy favorite from the album is Architecture of Aggression, a mid-tempo song that has a simple riff, heavy enough to blow your head away. The hard drums and the beautiful breaks place it atop of the song list. Another fantastic track is Foreclosure of A Dream. It starts with a calm, acoustic intro but has many changes in pace that feature heavy electric guitars and some angry vocals. The lyrics are referring to the U.S. political system and how it helps the poor get even poorer! Mustaine has no problem in stabbing the knife deep in the heart of the government.\n\nThis Was My Life is a self-sarcastic song by Mustaine. His life had taken the wrong turn some years ago and with it he expresses his anger about his former state. It\u2019s another half-speed track but very heavy indeed. Captive Honour has a very catchy riff and fine lines. Also notice the lyrics where the guard says: \u201cBoy, your soul better belong to Jesus, \u2018cause your ass belongs to me\u201d. Isn\u2019t that nice or what?\n\nThe self-titled song is though a bit mediocre since it doesn\u2019t give out much energy. It is a mature song and well-composed but it sounds like it was meant to hit the radio charts. I do not blame them of a sellout, no way. I am only saying how it sounds. The song that basically reminds of the Rust In Peace era is the opener Skin O\u2019 My Teeth. It is very fast and heavy, technical and melodic at the same time. It would certainly fit in a compilation of Megadeth best songs. On the other hand, the only filler in the album is Sweating Bullets, a song that has nothing interesting to offer, mediocre and boring and one that I personally despise.\n\nOkay, let\u2019s sum-up. With RIP, Megadeth reached the top of their creativity. It was a mortgage to complete perfection. Countdown To Extinction did not surpass its predecessor, maybe even not Peace Sells\u2026 However, it is a great album and a countdown not to extinction but to the birth of a new life and creation for the band since it marked the end of their speed/thrash days and the turn to more straight metal forms. If you don\u2019t have it, I suggest you obtain it and enjoy 45 minutes of well played heavy metal.\n",
        "\nThe years around 1988 were definitely a truly bad period for Megadeth. It was a time of intense uncertainty and instability. Dave Mustaine was subjected to his mistress of white death, surrendered to the grasp of his spiritual wreckage. He seemed to asphyxiate in the arms of his genius so sinful and reckless. To say it in simple words, he was up to his neck into drug use. Therefore, it\u2019s not strange that the main element of this album seems to be confusion. Everything they managed to create so far is on the verge of collapsing.\n\nPoland and Samuelson are out of the band and newcomers Young and Behler have taken their place. It was an unlucky move especially now that the band had began to look so steady and firm. At some parts these two new members seem to be completely out of space and are inferior to their predecessors. Mustaine, no matter how much heroin he has used or how much alcohol he has consumed, he still seems as the penis that masturbates. There are though difficulties, in making the sperm find the target. He has some ideas but they are so dry and colorless. As a result, the songs are clearly minor to those of Peace Sells\u2026 balancing between good intention and undoable realization.\n\nAll these might sound like poetic but they only state that things are really bad. Megadeth have not sold their ideals and beliefs. They don\u2019t claim that they never were a heavy metal band neither do they play pop music to climb the charts, no. So Far, So Good\u2026 is by all means a metal album. It has got heavy guitars and drums and some fast tempos familiar of their style. Bun nothing really sticks to your mind. From all the solos of the album there is not even one that got me with my pants down. There is an obvious lack of inspiration and you may believe that they did this album only because they had to. Let\u2019s put a riff here, a chorus there and a simple solo just to get the work done and go home. Even Dave Ellefson who has always been a serious musician has been drifted by the tide.\n\nThere are a few songs that I like very much such as Set The World Afire or Hook in Mouth which are classic Megadeth compositions. They have sharp guitars and catchy riffs and some nice breaks that make them quite interesting and pleasant to hear. They possess this certain feeling and attitude I\u2019m looking for in a Megadeth song and they manage to stand above average. No, in fact they are pretty damn good. But that\u2019s not enough to save the day when they are surrounded by mediocre, dull compositions like 502, Liar or the awful, unacceptable for the band, Mary Jane crap. Yes, I said it before, they are heavy songs that come from a metal band but how can you compare them with the killers they delivered in the previous release and not be disappointed? Well, I was anyway! As for Anarchy In The U.K., the cover they chose this time, I don\u2019t disagree totally since they took a punk song and passed it through a metal filter, turning it for the better.\n\nMaybe I am being kind of strict with this album but it is Megadeth we are talking about, not a common heavy metal band that could get a credit for trying to do something good. When you listen to a Megadeth release you expect metal blasters, dynamic songs that blast you away and not fillers with some good stuff here and there. I\u2019m sorry to say it but this is not what I would suggest for you to buy unless you are a die-hard fan of them and everything they do look like masterpieces to you. Mustaine and co. fell many steps behind with this atrocity.\n",
        "\nEverybody knows the story of Dave Mustaine in Metallica, his departing, the quarrels etc. though there are some secrets and unexplained reasons in my opinion. When he formed his own band, Megadeth, things were a bit difficult for them since many thought he was to blame for what had happened and that he was a nasty character. But that didn\u2019t stop him. Shortly after, Megadeth debut was released with the inspired title Killing is my Business\u2026and Business is Good! The skull on the cover appeared in later albums as well.\n\nTheir first attempt possessed all the elements of a thrash metal album: rage, speed and irritating mood. It contains eight primitive compositions dedicated to the blood-thirsty god of speed/thrash who at that time had many demands. The quality of the music was quite good considering the facts but was not supported by the awful, lousy production. I could say that Killing\u2026 continues from where Kill \u2018Em All left off. It is rough, speed metal, full of nervous riffs and solos and Mustaine\u2019s weird vocals. The truth is that he chose to sing only because he had to. So, we should not have many expectations from this album. Let\u2019s just settle to the fact that it serves the art of headbanging very well and lets out a great amount of energy.\n\nThe opening song, Last Rites/Loved to Death begins with a strange piano intro but speeds up with fast riffs and a mood to kick you in the ass. None of the musicians is a virtuoso but who needs technique, we are not talking progressive here but mad-thrashing metal. Surely this one is a song that stands out. As for Mustaine\u2019s vocals, you\u2019ll either love them or hate them! It would have been better if they had just waited a little longer to find a proper singer to fit the songs.\n\nThe self-titled one is also very good, exposing once again their will to kill through their music and not feed your head with melodies and complicated stuff. The fast guitars, smashing simple drumming and angry singing are found in each and every song of this album. The speedy tempos leave you no time to breathe and grab you from the neck. Still, as said before, the songs asphyxiate due to the poor production and that\u2019s too bad for compositions like Rattlehead that could have been so much better. There is also Mechanix, a song based on the structure of The Four Horsemen, but with a blacker mood and feeling. However the cover of Nancy Sinatra\u2019s These Boots is a very bad choice and very bad played as well.\n\nSumming-up, Megadeth do a pretty decent work, killing every sense of melody and harmony in their music. Killing\u2026 is not a bad album at all but it lacks something. Maybe they needed to have paid more attention during the song-writing until some new ideas had come up. Another disadvantage is that many people make the mistake to compare it with Mettalica\u2019s debut which is very unjust for Megadeth who only want to play good music for their future fans. The controversy that started from the very beginning mostly harmed them. Still the future looks good and that was proved a year later. Their fans surely possess their debut. The rest should definitely check it out if you like noisy metal.\n",
        "\nThere is no real way for me to say this without looking like a crazed fanboy so I think I'll just go out and say it: this is the best Megadeth album since 1992's \"Countdown to Extinction\" and probably the most consistent since 1997's \"Cryptic Writings.\" The album manages to successfully combine a more consistent level of songwriting with a touch of technical intensity that has been absent from the band for decades. It also showcases the talents of Jag Panzer/Nevermore guitarist Chris Broderick, who joined the band after the sudden departure of Glen Drover.\n\nTo start things off, this album manages to trim a great deal of the fat that appeared on the band's previous releases this millennium. There are very few spoken segments taking up space in songs, any interludes and remakes of the past are completely absent, and would-be fillers like \"Bite the Hand\" are strengthened by some energetic riffs and solos. Of course the songs still cover a lot of ground and include a number of thrashers, mid-tempo anthems, and an epic ballad in \"The Hardest Part of Letting Go/Sealed With a Kiss.\"\n\nThe band has also chosen to focus less on political themes in comparison to \"United Abominations,\" preferring to cram it all in the conspiracy ramblings of the seven minute title track. Other topics included on the album include ancient warfare (\"This Day We Fight!,\" \"How the Story Ends\"), economic struggles (\"Bite the Hand,\" \"The Right to Go Insane\"), racing (\"1,320\"), and another one of Dave Mustaine's messed up love stories (\"The Hardest Part of Letting Go/Sealed With a Kiss\").\n\nLike \"Rust In Peace\" before it, this album also seems to be all about the guitar playing. With the initiation of Broderick, the riffs have become even more aggressive and there are an endless number of solos dominate every song. While it is somewhat comparable to the solo overload that appeared on \"Death Magnetic,\" it rarely detracts from the songs themselves and does a good job of showing off the guitarists' talent. The bass also manages to stick on songs such as \"The Right to Go Insane\" and the vocals are nicely executed in Mustaine's songs.\n\nUnfortunately, the strongest Megadeth album in the millennium is also one of the band's most derivative with nearly every song on here echoing a more legendary song of yesteryear. The one-two punch of \"Dialectic Chaos\" and \"This Day We Fight!\" is a dead ringer for the old \"Into the Lungs of Hell\"/\"Set the World Afire\" combo, the chorus of \"44 Minutes\" brings to mind the \"United Abominations\" title track, \"1320\" sounds like a cross between \"Rattlehead\" and \"High Speed Dirt,\" \"Headcrusher\" has a few shades of \"Kick the Chair,\" and I like to decribe \"The Right to Go Insane\" as being the little brother of \"Architecture of Aggression.\" Even, THPOLG/SWAK, the album's most unique track, ends up sounding like a more epic version of \"Promises...\"\n\nIn spite of the backtracking, I find this to be a very strong album that fits in well with Megadeth's classic era and could very well be one of the strongest albums of 2009.\n\nPros:\n1) Energetic songs with very little bullshit\n2) Excellent guitar riffs and solos\n3) A good variety\n\nCons:\n1) The lyrics are still a little corny on occasion\n2) Some heavily derivative songs\n3) A few songs could use a little more structure\n\nMy Current Favorites:\n\"44 Minutes,\" \"1320,\" \"Bodies,\" \"The Hardest Part of Letting Go/Sealed With a Kiss,\" and \"The Right to Go Insane\"\n",
        "\nI made 2 obvious mistakes at the end of my review for \u2018United abominations\u2019. The first was the naivety of assuming a bit of new stability in the Megadeth line-up, which was dashed pretty quickly by Glen Drover\u2019s departure. The 2nd was the rating I gave it. While I stand by the notion that, a flat vocal performance and the butchering of \u2018A tout le monde\u2019 aside, there wasn\u2019t a genuinely bad song on there, the fact that I have barely revisited the CD since then tells its own story. It was a safe, moderated and ultimately flavourless release that offered very little beyond proficient musicianship. \n\nAfter 2 years of that CD sinking in, expectations were low for \u2018Endgame\u2019, which made it all the more surprising just how strong a release it actually is. First and foremost, it\u2019s great to hear a Megadeth CD with some honest to God speed/thrash metal on it for the first time in however many years. Though not a full-on thrash CD, the presence of a handful of undiluted thrash metal tunes is undeniable and a very welcome surprise. Dave Mustaine also seems to have gotten a bit of fire back in his belly, and the old snarl sounds better than it has in some time. To go along with this, \u2018Endgame\u2019 is also the first Megadeth CD in a long while to possess a near endless supply of blazing, OTT guitar solos. \n\nExcellent a guitarist though he was, Drover\u2019s decision to step down has actually been a bit of a blessing. For whatever reason, it seems to have taken the arrival of Chris Broderick for Mustaine to realise that half the charm of Megadeth in the old days was the promise of lashings of blistering lead guitar. Since Marty Friedman\u2019s departure, even when returning to a more metallic style, both the amount of solos and the ferocity of those that were actually played had been reduced and tamed somewhat \u2013 with 3 excellent players in Al Pitrelli, Chris Poland and finally Drover coming and going in the interim there can\u2019t have been any real reason for this beyond the boss not really feeling up for it. \n\nThe opening pair of songs almost had my jaw hanging on the first listen \u2013 \u201cDialectic chaos\u201d is the first instrumental to open a Megadeth CD in 21 years and a clearer statement of intent could not have been provided by the giant solo battle Mustaine and Broderick engage in over the galloping riffs. With no pause for breath, \u201cThis day we fight!\u201d takes over and proves to be the purest, heaviest speed/thrash song Mustaine has written in many years. By the time it has finished no less than 14 guitar solos have been played in less than 6 breathtaking minutes, and it would take a spectacular fall from grace for \u2018Endgame\u2019 not to end up a roaring success after such a furious opening. \n\nThe other good news is that, the songs that aren\u2019t thrash are mostly all very good as well. My heart sunk a little on first listen to \u201c44 minutes\u201d (soundbites on a Megadeth CD are enough to send shivers down my spine) as the thrashing intensity of the first 2 songs was cast away already, but a few listens reveal an excellent melodic metal song with a solo from Broderick that appears with neck-snapping suddenness. \u201c1320\u2019\u201d immediately gets things up to top speed again with a riff the likes of which hasn\u2019t been heard from the band since \u2018So far, so good... so what!'. In fact, I\u2019m convinced the title and lyrics (a nicely unserious affair about car racing) come from the similarity the opening riff bears to that of \u201c502\u201d. \n\nAnother of the non-thrash songs that had me worried on the first go but went on to more than prove itself is the Broderick co-authored half-acoustic half-ballad \u201cThe hardest part of letting go... sealed with a kiss\u201d. The soft acoustic opening passages are soon intensified by an unanticipated symphonic keyboard arrangement that leads to a heavier mid-section, revealing the lyrics to be a good deal less sappy than they initially seemed. Drummer Shawn Drover also puts in a tasty display on the \u201cSealed with a kiss\u201d section of the song, his rolling fills adding extra texture and proving what a fine acquisition he has turned out to be. \n\nJust like \u201c44 minutes\u201d, it is followed by an old-school thrashing beast in the form of the short, sharp \u201cHead crusher\u201d, more proof of Drover\u2019s all-round usefulness as a great deal of the song comes from his pen. Placing a song like his so far into the tracklist is indicative of the pacing of the CD, which is very well handled; the fast and heavy songs are usually saved for the moments when a little injection of pace is needed. \n\nThe CD maybe peters out a little on the last couple of songs, but a couple of very small missteps aside it is a model of consistency, and unlike its predecessor the lesser songs are at the very least quite diverting. \u201cBite the hand that feeds\u201d jumps between a successful fast riff and slower one I\u2019m still not 100% sure about, but on the whole sits quite well despite the rather trite political lyrics. Mustaine thankfully keeps his whacked-out opinions on the way of the world a little more to himself this time around, but almost threatens to derail the title track with his gibbering. The song begins with Talky Dave making his only unwelcome appearance on the CD, ruining a rather doomy opening section, but is saved from being another soapbox rant when he gets back to actually singing and all things considered is another good addition. \n\nThe great songs are enough to lift the ones that flounder a little, but even these lesser songs are an improvement in nearly every way over those on the predecessor. At the conclusion to my previous \u2018deth review, I called \u2018United abominations\u2019 their best CD since \u2018Youthanasia\u2019, but this was a bit of a back-handed compliment. The same is definitely true of \u2018Endgame\u2019 (which may even be the best since \u2018Countdown to extinction\u2019), but this time it is a praise actually earned for itself rather than achieved by default. Surprise of the year without doubt, Mustaine and his cohorts have shown us all there is life in the old dog yet. It\u2019s not a classic, but at this stage in their career it is a stunning turnaround. \n\n(Originally written for http://www.metalcdratings.com/)\n",
        "\nMegadeth are a conundrum for me. On one hand, they are a perfectly acceptable outfit, not too pretentious sounding and definitely not trying to be anything they aren\u2019t, but on the other hand, I just don\u2019t enjoy them as much as all that. I can listen to Dave Mustaine and his traveling circus of rotating band members any time and enjoy it well enough, but the question of why people think this band is so great continues to elude me. Why? Well, let\u2019s take a look at their latest metallic venture entitled Endgame to find out.\n\nSo Dave is back after a few years with a new band, most notably in the inclusion of much-ballyhooed ex-Jag Panzer guitarist Chris Broderick. I guess that got some common sense into Dave\u2019s head, because here there is a marked decline in the spoken-word political diatribes that often plagued United Abominations. Yes, imagine that, most of the vocal parts on an album actually being singing; what an innovative concept. The band pulls their weight well enough, with no-one putting on a particularly spellbinding performance except for maybe Broderick, who has been given elongated lead guitar sections just to show him off \u2013 but it\u2019s actually kind of forgivable, as it is pretty entertaining in combination with Mustaine\u2019s biting riffs and reedy vocal ramblings. No surprises anywhere, but everything is done well enough. Solid is the right word to use here.\n\nThe songs are all in the decent to good range, with the best ones being the opening volley of \u201cDialectic Chaos\u201d and \u201cThis Day We Fight,\u201d the chugging, snarling, smoldering mass of steel that is the title track and the strangely balladic \u201cThe Hardest Part of Letting Go\u2026Sealed with a Kiss.\u201d Even the mediocre songs like \u201cBodies\u201d and \u201cHow the Story Ends\u201d still have enough leads and riffs to not become worthy of skipping, so it\u2019s all good. One thing I do like about this album is that Dave just focused on writing kickass songs, with no gimmickry and only a smidgen of politically fueled nonsense this time around. The songs only have one modus operandi, and that is kicking your ass.\n\nBut again, I just don\u2019t think this album, or Megadeth in general, are anything really amazing. They just don\u2019t have any real identity, and that\u2019s much more important than most people give them credit for. Every once in a while you hear a song like \u201c44 Minutes,\u201d with its chunky rhythms and attitude-filled chorus, and think Hey, that sounds like Megadeth, but most of the time, Dave\u2019s constant attitude changes and band changes render Megadeth void of any kind of signature flavor, if that makes sense. The band is TOO metamorphic; they have been even since the early days. Dave writes cool riffs, but the feel is different from album to album, in a gap that is too wide for them to hide behind the \u2018variety\u2019 failsafe.\n\nA good band doesn\u2019t just write good songs, but they write good songs while establishing an identity that will be expounded upon and revisited in future albums \u2013 yeah, you get some bands that change style and get a new identity, but that\u2019s still different and more respectable than what Dave Mustaine has dug himself into. Megadeth just doesn\u2019t have any kind of real style to them, and as a result, whenever I hear one of their songs without already knowing who it is, I go, what band is this again? That goes double for Endgame. This is a good album, but realistically it\u2019s more like \u2018Generic Metal Album Number X\u2019 than an album by a storied and popular band making a comeback. Check it out if you want solid Heavy Metal.\n\nOriginally written for http://www.metalcrypt.com\n",
        "\nFinally, after riding the excessive hype-train that the 2 albums before it did, Megadeth's new album is here and ready to be either praised by the fanboys as yet another \"return to form\", or be ridiculed by all those raving \"haters\" as the same old crap being put out since all their other post-\u201cRisk\u201d material. While I'm not exactly the type of guy who claims that Dave and co. can do no wrong, I actually am much more towards the former part of that equation. It's not perfect by any means, but this is a VERY good offering and a great release that will satisfy long time fans and most anybody else with a taste in good metal.\n\nThere are 2 major things to discuss right off the bat with this album. First off, there's actually quite a lot of what many people would call thrash on this record. And, even more importantly, when there isn't any real thrashing going on, it's still a completely metal release from start to finish. No questionable moments of sissy musicianship, no hard rock-in-metal-clothing type of stuff, just a really good metal album. With everything from \u201cThe World Needs a Hero\u201d through \u201cUnited Abominations\u201d, there was a lot of stuff on those albums that really wasn't quality music. And it was a shame, because that stuff really held down the material that could've actually gone somewhere with the ideas each of them had. \n\nThere were/are a lot of comparisons that were/are being made about this album with the rest of Megadeth's quality releases from years back. I saw a lot of \u201cRust in Peace\u201d similarities on this, with the most striking resemblance of that one being the solos being thrown in all over the place. There are a good amount of songs that feature multiple sections and dueling leads from Mustaine and Broderick, who is actually a phenomenal guitar player. Song wise, \u201cEndgame\u201d is pretty much the most similar to SFSGSW honestly, only because it's not the relentless shred-fests that the other 3 initial albums were.\n\nAnyway, concerning the thrash parts of this one, there is some really good stuff to be heard here. \u201c1,320\u201d, despite having some slightly pedestrian sections sandwiched into it, is some really good thrash, with a riff that really reminds me of some stuff on their debut, just much slower. The opener combo of \u201cDialectic Chaos\u201d and \u201cThis Day We Fight!\u201d is another really thrashy mix of songs and may just be the best simply because of its sheer long length compared to the other thrash. These are really reminiscent of \u201cInto the Lungs of Hell\u201d and \u201cSet the World Afire\u201d from SFSGSW, which is probably why I think of that album in tandem with this one. \u201cBite the Hand\u201d speeds up into a pretty damn solid speedy metal, as does the title track, which is a stand-out thrash epic in structure. And of course, there's \u201cHead Crusher\u201d, which still really blows me away after being the first song I heard off this as a single. This is such a ridiculous song for the year it was released in and I have to hail it as being the best track along with the aforementioned \u201cThis Day We Fight!\u201d combo. Yeah, it has a spoken narrative passage (during that VICIOUS thrash break), but I really didn't have to much of a problem with those as a lot of other people did. When used sparingly and in the right situations, they can really enhance some songs, which is actually what happens with this one. \n\nThe rest of the album, while not being bad by any means whatsoever, is a slight step below the crushing onslaught of songs already noted. With the exception of a few, they all seem to have a little too much commercial draw to them, pretty much intended for the listener outside of the die-hard metal fans. The only one I may not actually like is \u201c44 Minutes\u201d, as it's just a bit more saturated with casual listening vibes than the others, although \u201cThe Right to Go Insane\u201d was a big disappointment, because I thought that the album would have ended much better on \u201cHow The Story Ends\u201d, and it's position right after that makes it feel like filler to me. Again, not bad, just not really what I want to hear out of the rest of this album. Also, another big issue on the album is the production, which kind of detracts from the overall listening. It's really good modern production, and that seems to be the biggest flaw with it. The guitars have a tinge of that really annoying sound that most metalcore releases of today tend to have, and that personally makes me sick. I actually couldn't really get into it my first listen because of that, it makes the more mid-paced songs sound mediocre and uninteresting to a certain degree (similar to the how the songs of same type sounded on the previous ones).\n\nAs for the lineup, you won't hear anything new out of Drover or LoMenzo, they're really just the competent musicians to really make Megadeth an actual band instead of just the Dave Mustaine Band. But, as stated before, Broderick is disgusting, and he can really fucking shred. He's a lot more like Marty than Poland, as they both have a really clean yet frantic type of soloing that sounds inhuman. You'll hear a lot the RIP comparisons within this guy's soloing. And according to just about everybody else who has heard this album, Dave\u2019s voice has improved a lot. I only mention this because I actually thought that his vocals were a highlight of the good Megadeth albums, yet most people tend to agree that he couldn\u2019t sing remotely well. All those weird accents and voice changes he puts into certain songs make me compare him a lot to many other \u201cbad\u201d vocalists who were more of a symbolic presence rather than a boatload of talent (Paul Baloff, Sean Killian anyone?).\n\nWithout a doubt in my mind, I can recommend this purchase to someone who, frankly, just wants to hear more quality metal. Even ignoring the fact it came out a week ago, this is still surprisingly awesome stuff to come out of Megadeth in a while. Hell, I didn't even have that much of a problem with UA, but there were QUITE a few crippling flaws with that one that were pretty much all fixed on this one. Anyone that had faith in Megadeth to release something worth your money after \u201cYouthanasia\u201d (or even RIP for those hard asses), your prayers have been answered.\n",
        "\nI\u2019ve gone back and forth over the years concerning whether Megadeth or Slayer was the member of the so-called Big 4 who fell the softest after the close of the 80s, but lately it seems as though Mustaine and company have come out shinning far better than the rest. The only really enemy that he\u2019s had has been the amazingly unrealistic expectations of many in Megadeth\u2019s core fan base, but that hasn\u2019t dissuaded them from writing solid thrashing heavy metal with a few occasional slip ups lately. Although perhaps the rapid lineup variations that ensued after Dave Ellefson have given off an air of inconsistency, the overall sound of the band has remained relatively constant in the past few years.\n\nThings really started to look up with the release of \u201cUnited Abominations\u201d, which saw the exciting lead guitar duels and riff happy melodic songwriting that had largely been abandoned come back with a vengeance. Nonetheless, those who were looking for a return to form in concert with \u201cRust In Peace\u201d were definitely not satisfied, as what resulted was a mixture of late 80s and early to mid 90s Megadeth, done very well I might add. However, if these relentless old school thrash maniacs wanted something akin to this band\u2019s glory days, they need have only waited an additional 2 years for this mean pile of heaviness to hit the shelves.\n\n\u201cEndgame\u201d is, from start to finish, a skull crushing iron boot to the head of what passes for aggression in many quarters today. It doesn\u2019t seek to emulate the progressive tendencies of \u201cRust In Peace\u201d, the all speed, all the time mayhem of \u201cKilling Is My Business\u201d, or the classic pure thrash masterpiece \u201cPeace Sells\u201d, but ventures dangerously close to the underrated power/thrash majesty of \u201cSo Far, So Good, So What?\u201d. What this consists of is a good deal less studio gimmicks and a good deal more fist pounding, guitar oriented metal. From beginning to end it\u2019s catchy, it\u2019s mean, and it cuts right to the chase.\n\nProbably the only thing that really makes this unique from Megadeth\u2019s 80s albums, as the production is a pretty close emulation of their original sound, is the level of quality and emphasis put on the guitar solos. This becomes more than evident right at the start of the album on \u201cDialectic Chaos\u201d, which showcases Dave and newly recruited former Jag Panzer wizard Chris Broderick battling each other in a manner that would rival the most insane lead moments on \u201cHanger 18\u201d and \u201cHoly Wars\u201d. A good analogy could be made to the Tipton and Downing dueling leads on \u201cPainkiller\u201d, loaded with rapid speed licks, but overtop a much more chaotic arrangement.\n\nMuch like this band\u2019s unsung 1988 hero of an album, there is a regulated sense of pacing that keeps this from being a 100% thrash album, at least by the standards set by \u201cDarkness Descends\u201d, \u201cEternal Nightmare\u201d and a host of other albums from the later 80s where speed was as much a factor as riffing. \u201c44 Minutes\u201d and \u201cHow The Story Ends\u201d listen closer to a slightly heavier version of Accept with a couple of thrash riffs littered here and there. \u201cBodies\u201d reverts to the slow paced fanfare of \u201cSymphony Of Destruction\u201d, but with a little more to the song than 3 riffs. \n\nApart from the aforementioned songs, a slightly slower version of the pummeling heaviness of thrash metal in \u201cThe Right To Go Insane\u201d and a gloomy epic ballad that reminds a tiny bit of Nuclear Assault\u2019s \u201cBrain Damage\u201d, but with a bit more melody and atmosphere, the rest of this album is a pretty solid wrecking ball of punchy, hard edged thrash metal the way that any fan of the 80s version of the style can appreciate it. Between the unfettered chaos of \u201cThis Day We Fight\u201d, the classic speed metal glory of \u201c1,320\u201d, and the middle ground between the two in \u201cHead Crusher\u201d, if the words \u201cMegadeth just brought home the goods\u201d don\u2019t echo in your ears with each thudding power chord, nothing will please you.\n\nPhrases like \u201cessential purchase\u201d often get thrown around, but in this case I\u2019d say it safely avoids being a mere selling point for a band that was a force in the metal world years ago. This is definitely the best thing that the band has done since 1990, and rivals their earlier works. There\u2019s no soft rock influences, no goofy songs of love gone wrong, just good angst ridden metal with the political subjects and storylines to match. Get it for the solos, get it for a superior vocal performance out of Mustaine, get it for the ingeniously epic riff fest of a title track. Just remember the key point of picking this up as soon as humanly possible, even if it means selling yourself on the street for nickels and dimes at a time.\n\nOriginally submitted to (www.metal-observer.com) on September 25, 2009.\n",
        "\nMegadeth has been a band that seems to be slipping further and further into the abyss over the years. With average albums and Dave Mustaine getting older and older, nobody thought Megadeth could get out of the well before it completely flooded. This is defiantly a step in a positive direction\n\n\u201cEndgame\u201d begins with the instrumental \u201cDialectic Chaos\u201d which is actually a very good start. \u201cThis Day We Fight\u201d is a fast, chaotic song with a nice solo. Similar to the past two opening songs on previous Megadeth albums. Mediocre writing plagues this album, and \u201c44 Minutes\u201d is a good example of that. Many of the lines just seem cheesy and forced. The song itself isn\u2019t too bad if you can\u2019t get passed the writing. Some tracks do get past this problem. \u201cHeadcrusher\u201d I must admit kicks some serious ass. Everything about this piece is what Dave promised. It\u2019s the best song on the album.\n\nDave Mustaine\u2019s vocals have gotten much better over the years. His performance here is quite good and consistent, as well as his guitar playing. Chris Broderick has lived up to the expectations and he does a fantastic job. The solo\u2019s are unique in there own way and he brings back something Megadeth have been missing for a long time. Shawn Dover does his job here on drums, nothing really surprising, and the bass playing is what you\u2019d expect it to be from James LoMenzo.\n\n\u201cBite the Hand That Feeds,\u201d \u201cBodies,\u201d \u201cEndgame,\u201d and \u201cThe Hardest Part of Letting Go\u2026 Sealed With A Kiss,\u201d are all just too boring and mundane to really enjoy. There not entirely dreadful, but just bland. While this album does have some bright spots, the same old problems still remain here. Very spotty writing, the aura of filler, and the same old song repackaged. If you hated \u201cUnited Abominations\u201d and almost gave up on Megadeth, this will change your mind. It has more speed, which is what the die-hards wanted, and talent. However I was left with the question \u201cThat\u2019s it? That\u2019s what I\u2019ve been waiting for?\u201d Give it a shot, you might have a different opinion. Not the best Megadeth album, but a step in the right direction.\n",
        "\nI had given up all hope on Megadeth after the rather bland The System has Failed and the atrocity of United Abominations. United Abominations showed that Megadeth still had some potential with the first couple of tracks but I did not think that they would manage to build off of it. When I first heard about Endgame I didn\u2019t pay attention till someone linked me Head Crusher. This was a fantastic song but I remained very skeptical as I expected this to be a one off. I was assured though that the rest of the album was good so I decided to check it out. And I am glad I did, as this is the best thing Megadeth has released since Countdown to Extinction.\n\nThe album opens up with some fairly solid guitar shredding. Is Dave trying to prove something here? I\u2019m sure he probably is and it is nice that there is something to motivate him to write a quality album once again. The album then progresses to include a variety of tracks. The thrashier tracks sound like they could have fit on Countdown to Extinction and others are more mid-paced and have a nice groove going. However, there are no throwaway tracks to my surprise as Dave has included so many on albums for years. Even the ballad, The Hardest Part of Letting Go is relatively solid, though it does take a little bit to get going.\n\nGuitar solos are all over the place and this is one of the things that made Rust in Peace so special for me. Megadeth haven\u2019t done this on any of their albums in a long while so it is really refreshing to hear. And you know what? Dave can still play some pretty mean solos. The solos are pretty much standard Megadeth fashion being melodic, and drawn out while sometimes picking up the intensity. The riffs are not bad either with more thrash riffs in Endgame than they have recorded in total since Countdown to Extinction.\n\nDave\u2019s voice has watered down a bit over the years though nothing like Hetfield. His voice still includes some of the venom, though this only really shines on a few tracks and most of the time he just sings in his standard melodic fashion though somewhat improved over the last few albums.\n\nUnfortunately Head Crusher is really the only track that blows me away. This is in the same style to Tornado of Souls and Hangar 18, and almost reaches them in quality. This Day We Fight!, is a pretty intense thrasher as well. However, none of the others can match these in intensity. The others certainly have their moments, especially Endgame and 1320 but are still enjoyable as they are so catchy and not overly watered down like the tracks on United Abominations and The System has Failed.\n\nIf you are expecting a Rust in Peace 2 then you should look elsewhere as this is not it, but this is still a very solid album that any thrasher or fan of heavy metal can be proud to have in their collection. I have regained my faith in Megadeth. Lets hope it stays for a long while.\n\nStandout tracks: Head Crusher, This Day We Fight, 1320, Endgame\n",
        "\nWith such a fantastic release as Endgame, where does one begin to comment? I made the a priori decision to avoid all references to past Megadeth works with this review, the rationale being that I'm sure many comparisons could be made, but such comparisons may potentially 'cheapen' the praise that Endgame surely deserves. I did, however, decide to make one comparison between Endgame and Death Magnetic. While the latter caused me to think that \"Metallica might still have the goods\", the former has forced me to conclude that \"Mustaine/Megadeth still has/have the goods\". The uncertainty is missing in the case of Megadeth, all thanks to Endgame. That is all I want to say on this matter, and I hope that both bands inspire eachother to compete for awesome metal dominance.\n\nWith the inter-band politics swept under the rug, let's move onto the music itself. Dave's cynical snarl is back, which perfectly suits the socio-political themes present throughout Endgame's playing time. Lyrically, this is quite a political album, without being preachy or dogmatic. My only criticism on the vocals is the lack of higher range singing. Dave mostly sticks to the low/mid register, but it kind of suits the ominous themes and narrative form of the lyrics on Endgame. Overall the vocals deliver sufficiently, but a little more melodic variety would have been appreciated, in my humble opinion.\n\nThe riffage just owns on Endgame. There is no ambiguity about whether Endgame is a metal record or not. After all that MegaDave has been through in his life (i.e. drug/alcohol abuse, arm injury, etc.), and being only 6 years younger than my father, he is still nonetheless a very sharp player and composer by anyone's standards. Have a listen to Head Crusher and tell me that it doesn't literally crush heads. Dave has written/arranged an aggressive, yet tastefully melodic maelstrom of ostinati that overall, would not look alien next to certain genre-destroying metal masterpieces of the mid to late 80's. Furthermore, lead shredder Chris Broderick proves his mettle on Endgame, he has a very fluid style of playing and I would say he is up there with Friedman in terms of technical prowess. Different feel between the two players mind you, but equal proficiency. Still, I have to say that I miss David Ellefson. The bass is audible enough on Endgame, but something special is missing that Junior possessed. \n\nAs for drums, well, Drover is excellent and I have nothing bad at all to say about his performance on Endgame. I think that this praise is at least partially due to the production of the album. The drums are crisp and just high and compressed enough in the mix to make you want to break furniture and destroy tap fixtures. Performance-wise, I sincerely hope that Dave holds onto Drover permanantly, as I feel that he is key to the evolving 'brutal' sound of Megadeth. \n\nAll in all, and without referencing past Megadeth albums (certainly it was hard to abstain from this, believe me), Endgame is a killer album that I am sure will become known as a classic in time. Skeptics, give it a chance, you will be impressed.\n\nHighlights:\n\nHead Crusher\nEndgame\n1,320'\nThis Day We Fight!\n44 minutes\n",
        "\nMegadeth, aka Dave Mustaine, has always had a huge ego and carried big grudges against several bands, most notably his old band Metallica. It seems that the one thing that can fire Dave up to put out an ass kicking metal album is Metallica putting out a \u201cgood\u201d album. With Death Magnetic getting tons of praise you knew that Dave would put every effort into bettering them, and with Endgame he pretty much did that. \n\nOpening with an instrumental you get the feeling that Dave is ready to show off on this one and he puts on a clinic at several points on this album. While the album has some tracks that are more typical of later era Megadeth, mid paced tunes with a decent groove and crunching riffs, the highlights are the raging thrashers. When This Day We Fight kicks in you know Dave isn\u2019t fucking around. Supposedly based on viewing the Return of The King movie, this song is about fighting and dying and the music fits perfectly. Great solos by Dave and Broderick fit right in with the fast thrash riffage and his signature vocal delivery. \n\nMegadeth works best when there are solos left and right, and this album is filled with that. No point in waiting for the typical solo section near the end of the song when you can rip those fuckers off at every point possible. 1320 is another fine example opening up with a total Megadeth riff, fast and melodic yet heavy as hell. With lyrics about drag racing the music better keep up and it does. As the song closes out Dave and Chris go on a solo rampage that defies you to not head bang. \n\nHead Crusher is the first single and a hell of a choice for that I think. Opening with screaming solos before settling into the main groove this is just what the title says, a head crusher. Fast guitars, fast drums, and a simple but effective chorus. Death from the head crusher indeed. This song convinced me to buy my first 'deth album since Countdown to Extinction and I'm glad I did. \n\nIt\u2019s not all good though, songs like 44 Minutes drag and with the lyrics not flowing very well the song feels a bit disjointed at times. There is a lot of mid paced material here, which Dave does well for the most part, but after the fast thrash of early mentioned songs they can feel like energy sappers at times. But at no point is this album anything less than total metal. No hard rock here, nothing but Dave looking to crush all opposition. \n\nThe production is pretty good, not totally compressed to hell and the bass is right there in the mix where you can hear it but it doesn\u2019t dominate and the drums have some punch just like they should. Perfect no, but compared to the shit hyper compressed production so many albums get today I\u2019ll take it. \n\nLyrically the album isn\u2019t a big departure from early albums, songs about violence, war, the government, shoot outs, etc. It\u2019s good though, and fits the feel of the songs and his unique voice very well for the most part. The title track seems to have been lyrically influenced by the Endgame documentary by Alex Jones, a noted conspiracy theorist. \n\nIs this album going to reinvent thrash metal or take Megadeth to new heights? No. But it is a rock solid album from the king of thrash riffage that will surely delight long time fans and anyone who enjoys good metal. \n\nHighlights\nThis Day We Fight, 1320, Head Crusher, How The Story Ends, Bite The Hand\n",
        "\nJust about everyone knows that Megadeth's been using Metallica's faces to mop the floor for about 20 years now and Endgame is just another case in point. My expectations weren't too high for this album. I mean, I liked both The System Has Failed and United Abominations, but they were half good, half filler. The filler on United Abominations was better than the filler on The System Has Failed...but filler is filler. So I was expecting some good songs and a lot of filler like the last 3 albums. Those expectations have definitely been exceeded. There are only two songs on here I would consider calling filler, and they're at the bottom of the list below.\n\nAfter three straight days of listening to this album intensely--which by the way is something that has not happened between myself and a Megadeth album since Youthanasia came out when I was 14--I am very pleased. Yeah, it's waaaaay better than Death Magnetic and it smokes anything Megadeth have put out since at least Youthanasia. I have a lot of fond memories attached to that record, so I'm not sure if Endgame is better than it or Countdown To Extinction. Time will tell on that one. But I can say this: it's definitely got more balls than both of them combined and is easily their heaviest record since Rust In Peace.\n\nThere's elements from a lot of previous Megadeth albums. The slower, lumbering songs I'd liken more to stuff from Countdown To Extinction with a bit of So Far, So Good, So What! in the mix. The blazers definitely have a bit of So Far, So Good, So What! in them as well, as well as what we've heard on the faster tracks of The System Has Failed (think Kick The Chair) and United Abominations (think Sleepwalker and Washington Is Next!). What this album seems to have that the last several haven't is flow and consistency. Yeah, the guys let off the gas pedal and then slam it right back on, but I don't really find myself being bored with certain songs--everything gels very well. There also isn't a stupid A Tout Le Monde remake to fuck this record up either and make you look at your stereo and ask \"Why, Dave? Why would you do this?\". \n\nThe riffs are here (see This Day We Fight!, Headcrusher and Bodies), the solos are here (see Dialectic Chaos and well...everywhere else), the catchy vocal melodies are here (see The Right To Go Insane and How The Story Ends). Lyrically, this album is far from a masterpiece but Mustaine's never exactly been a brilliant poet and hasn't had the need to be in a band such as this. Despite lyrical shortcomings, you'll find yourself digging them the more you listen to it, just like you did with so many Megadeth albums years ago. It's about fuckin' time.\n\n\nHighlights:\n\nThis Day We Fight!\nHeadcrusher\nHow The Story Ends\nThe Right To Go Insane\nBodies\n\nStill friggin' rad:\n\n1,320\nDialectic Chaos\n44 Minutes\nEndgame\n\nGood, but the weakest of the album:\n\nBite The Hand\nThe Hardest Part Of Letting Go...Sealed With A Kiss\n\nI think this is the record that Mustaine has been trying to make since the turn of the century. This is an album where I have finally been able to sit down and enjoy the shit out of it, bang my head and just get lost in it instead of thinking \"Well this is a step in the right direction, I hope the next one is better\".\n\nAnd yeah, poor Metallica. You guys finally put out a decent album for the first time in 20 years and Megadeth drives over it with a tank the next year. Life's a bitch.\n",
        "\nWhen I first heard that Megadeth were planning to record a new album, I felt really excited. Dave Mustaine and his companions never failed to impress me and have worthfully earned the no.1 position in my favourite bands' list. When I listened to \"Head Crusher\", the first single of the album, I was sure that their new album will be heavy as hell. After listening to \"1,320\", the second single, my expectations were very high. These expectations were finally met when I heard the album at its entirety.\n\n\"Endgame\", the follow-up to \"United Abominations\", is probably the best album the band has released since the 90's and shows the thrash direction the band has returned to, over the last years. It's also the first album to feature Megadeth's new guitarist, Chris Broderick, who is responsible for the most of the groundbreaking solo work here. His addition to Megadeth seems to have had a very good effect to the band and he proves that he is worthy of this position.\n\nMusically, the band tries almost everything, from acoustic pieces to thrash riffs and super-fast solos, which is what they have always been doing so far. Throughout the album you can find many great riffs and guitar solos that totally steal the show, some of the best choruses the band has ever written, nice melodies, solid and well executed drumming, as well as a very good vocal work by Mustaine. Moreover, the great production gives the songs even more kick. As for the lyrics, Mustaine touches some social/political subjects as always (\"44 Minutes\", \"Bite The Hand That Feeds\", \"Endgame\", \"The Right To Go Insane\"), explores some battle themes (\"This Day We Fight!\", \"How The Story Ends\") and even sings about funny cars (\"1,320\"), relationships (\"Bodies Left Behind', \"The Hardest Part Of Letting Go... Sealed With A Kiss\") and a medieval torture device (\"Head Crusher\").\n\nThe album starts off with an instrumental, \"Dialectic Chaos\" (resembling \"Into The Lungs Of Hell\" from \"So Far, So Good... So What!), which really gets you into the album. It continues with \"This Day We Fight!\", an angry and fast song, that defines the overall sound of the album. Next is \"44 Minutes\", one of \"Endgame's\" melodic highlights, which contains the album's most memorable chorus. \"1,320\" brings a more \"old school\" feeling to the album, while songs like \"Bite The Hand That Feeds\" and \"Bodies Left Behind\" makes you sure that you are listening to a real 'deth record! \"Endgame\", the title track, which starts off with a somewhat \"anxious\" intro, lets you know that Mr. Mustaine isn't kidding... \"The Hardest Part Of Letting Go... Sealed With A Kiss\" shows a more melodic approach, while \"Head Crusher\" delivers more vicious riffing and a catchy chorus. The album goes on with \"How The Story Ends\", another powerful song and finally closes with \"The Right To Go Insane\" which besides being a very good song (with another nice chorus as well), is also a great closing track for a great album.\n\nTo sum up, \"Endgame\" is another great album by the real thrash metal pioneers. It shows that Megadeth still has a lot to offer to the heavy scene after all these years and that they still kick ass as of 2009! If you're a Megadeth fan it's a must-have; for those that aren't fans of the band (yet...), it's still worth listening.\n",
        "\nWell, if it isn't MegaDave and his gang again. What do they have for us this time? We'll find that out pretty soon.\n\nThis was a very big surprise for me, and hopefully for many other metalheads out there. What comes to mind if you hear the word Thrash? Wouldn't you think about the 80's? Wouldn't you start thinking about the good old days when Megadeth, Metallica, Slayer and Anthrax were great? Well, you don't really have to anymore, at least not for Megadeth. Because this album is totally fucking amazing!\n\nThe album opens with the deadly track \"Dialetic Chaos\", which is a monster! It's full of incredible riffs and solos. It's been a long time since I have heard such good guitar playing. Seriousley, this is impressive. I mean, Megadeth have always been good when it comes to guitar playing, but this is a surprise. Chris Broderick plays almost as good as Marty Friedman. He's really fast and technical at the same time, which makes a very good guitar player. That you can already hear, as you fill your ears with Dialetic Chaos! Then, the album goes right into the next track \"This Day We Fight!\" In my opinion, this is the best song on the album. If I were to say that Dave is once again thrashing like the good old days when Peace Sells was a new album, you wouldn't believe it. Not even I would believe it at first, but when I heard this song, I realized that it is possible.\n\nThe whole album is good. There's not a single shitty song on the whole record! This makes the album a very special one, and it is. It is actually the best thing they've done since Youthanasia! But when Dave said that he thought it was the best record he had written in his whole career, I just had to disagree. It is almost on the same level as the old stuff they made, but not that good. But let's not focus on what is best of then and now. The 80's will forever be the 80's. Bands can still make good music. Metallica has also showed that they are capable of making some kind of thrash still. I must say that Death Magnetic was a good album, but I didn't like the production so much though. But this isn't a Death Magnetic review. This is an Endgame review! And if anybody was wondering, then I can assure you that it kicks Metallica's ass straight to hell!\n\nSo, are you guys wondering how Dave's voice is doing? Well then. He does a great job on vocals! He has actually got some of his snarling back. I felt that on UA, he was a little more relaxed. However, this time he has went all out when it comes to vocals. He does an absolutely great job! Not only does he have to concentrate on his vocals, but on the guitar as well. He and Chris are doing some pretty sick riffs and solos together. It's a satisfaction for my ears. I love all the solos and riffs on this CD. They have that dark atmosphere over them, which only Deth knows how to create. Same for the drumming. Shawn really lived up to my expectations. We don't need Nick Menza when we got this guy. Nick is better off in Memorain. And then, it is the bass. James isn't quite as skilled as Ellefson was, in my opinion. I mean, he's goot and all, but Ellefson was better. The bass isn't that important for me though. As long as it is there, it's OK with me.\n\nIf you want me to describe the music very short and simple, then I would say it is melodic thrash metal. Melodic thrash with anger. That is what this album is all about. Dave has really made a point with Endgame. He shows many different sides of himself. From the angry one in \"This Day We Fight\" to the sad one in \"The Hardest Part Of Letting Go\". The point of this album must be, \"Even though we're old, we can still fuckin' thrash!\" So if you are a metalhead, then you're ordered to buy this one. I bought it yesterday, and I will never regret it!\n\nHighlights:\nThis Day We Fight\nEndgame\nHead Crusher\nThe Hardest Part Of Letting Go... Sealed With A Kiss\n\nThis is the end of the road. This is the end of the line. This is the end of your life. This is the Endgame!!\n",
        "\nYes another one. As much as I love Megadeth, this has to stop. Dave must really be pressed for cash or something. Not only has he re-released and remastered the entire back catalog, which were horrible next to the originals, he dumps another \"Greatest Hits\" album on us. So far, we have \"Capitol Punishment\", \"Back to the Start\", and the \"Warchest\". Three is already too many for any band to have, but apparently Dave doesn't think so. As such, we now have \"Set the World Afire\", a two disc greatest hits compilation that includes songs from the beginning up to Ellefson's departure. This is a positive for me as, even though I enjoy the new Megadeth albums, after Ellefson left it was really just a Dave Mustaine solo project under the Megadeth name. The other positive thing about this release is that \"Killing is my Business\" was not shafted, although only two tracks were included. \"Killing is my Business\" is my third favorite Megadeth album, behind \"Peace Sells\" and \"Rust in Peace\" respectively, and I'm very pleased with the album's inclusion. The last positive comment it is possible to make are the live bits from 1992. This should be enough to excite any serious Megadeth fan, as anything featuring the Mustaine/Friedman/Ellefson/Menza lineup live are few and far between. It also somehow manages to be the best Megadeth compilation so far, outside the \"Warchest.\" \n\nAs much as I would like to keep the positive comments rolling, it is here that I can go no further. What you have read above is not enough to keep me from giving a bad review. First off, all the songs are the remixed and remastered versions. If you are a big enough Megadeth fan, you should know why this is a problem. Dave practically ruined these classics when he remixed the albums, but including them on a \"Greatest Hits\" compilation is going a little too far. This is the second compilation of the 2004 remixes, and by now it is pretty apparent Dave is forcing us to accept these mixes as the standard. The problem is that anyone new to the band will probably start here and assume this is how these tracks are supposed to sound. The only thing I know to compare this to is George Lucas and Star Wars. There was nothing wrong with the original movies, but Lucas insisted they were not good enough and edited the hell out of them. The basic elements remained, but something was seriously wrong. The fans of the originals were horrified and newcomers didn't know any better, not realizing how much was destroyed. The same goes for these remixed tracks. The basic elements of the originals are there, but enough was changed to make them not sit quite right with longtime fans. \n\nAnother complaint I have with this offering is the track selection themselves. The bulk of the material here, is heavily focused on 90's Megadeth. Obviously this would be the case, as this is a \"hits\" album after-all, but still I find myself quite disappointed. Only nine tracks of the thirty-five are from the pre-\"Rust in Peace\" albums, and only four tracks are from \"Rust in Peace\". Not only this, but three of the included songs are fucking demos. Seriously, demos do not belong on an album such as this. Hell, they don't really belong anywhere, as most people listen to them once and never listen to them again afterwards. Why put demos when you could just include the actual studio album recordings. One thing I'm just confused about is fact \"Crush 'em\" was omitted. I'm not complaining because I don't like \"Risk\" anyway, but you would think the song would be featured on such an album. Even though this collection spans 2 discs, It offers nothing new. Sure you get what you expect, maybe a little less, but nothing more. It scrapes by with the bare minimum and is pretty expensive as well. I can't see why anyone would want to spend 30 bucks on this. You could just as easily buy 3 used studio albums for that price. \"Anthology: Set the World Afire\" should have been titled \"Half-Assed Attempt: Dave Takes a Piss on the Fans\". This whole collection and the way it is put together, apart from it being the fourth compilation, was just an obvious attempt at making Mr. Mustaine a quick buck. You don't even get what you pay for in the long run. Remember when I said this was the best compilation? Well that wasn't really saying much because the other ones were so shitty they somehow make this one seem acceptable. \n\nIn conclusion, Megadeth fans should really stay away from this album. If you are a long time follower of the band, I suggest you burn your own \"Greatest Hits\" CD for yourself since you probably own the original discs. You will save money and you will be much more pleased with the result. As for people wanting to get into Megadeth, I suggest tracking down the original albums, as they are far better and well worth the money. I feel as though I am being a bit generous with the rating; however, I give this a 50 for the live bits, the inclusion of \"Killing is my Business\" tracks, and the fact this is the best Megadeth compilation thus far, even though that doesn't mean much.\n",
        "\nWith nearly thirty years worth of material to their name, I think this may be the most overlooked Megadeth album in the group's long-running history. It is not as actively hated as \"Risk,\" but its borderline thrash leanings have officially been rendered obsolete by the more recent additions to the Megadeth discography. On the other hand, it is fairly significant for being the only album to feature Savatage guitarist Al Pitrelli and the last album to feature drummer Jim DeGrasso and longtime bassist Dave Ellefson.\n\nMusically, you could describe this album as sounding like a more modern cross between \u201cCryptic Writings\u201d and \u201cCountdown To Extinction.\u201d The guitar playing is definitely \u201cmetal\u201d but rarely reaches true levels of technicality or intensity, the songs are fairly accessible but don\u2019t have any signs of blatant commercialism or memorable hooks that command your attention, and the production\u2019s somewhat bland coating makes it sound like no other Megadeth album to date. On the other hand, Dave Mustaine manages to put on a pretty good vocal performance in spite of the material he has come up with and even carries songs like \u201cDisconnect\u201d and \u201c1000 Times Goodbye\u201d with his solid singing voice. The bass presence is also quite strong and really stands out on tracks like \u201cDisconnect\u201d and \u201cRecipe For Hate.\u201d There are also a few moments that attempt a darker direction, but they\u2019re relatively few and far between\u2026\n\nWhile the title track seems to promise a return to more political themes, most of this album\u2019s lyrics seem to deal with more introspective ideas. \u201cBurning Bridges\u201d and \u201cLosing My Senses\u201d seem to deal with regret in one\u2019s life, \u201cRecipe For Hate/Warhorse\u201d and \u201cWhen\u201d focus more of anger, and I always like to think of \u201cDread And The Fugitive Mind\u201d as being an Agnostic anthem of sorts. Other topics covered on the album include relationships (\u201c1000 Times Goodbye,\u201d \u201cPromises\u201d), modern society (\u201cDisconnect,\u201d \u201cMoto Psycho\u201d), and a return to an old fan favorite (\u201cReturn To Hangar\u201d). While there are a few goofy lines that come up, there are an equal number of filler songs that are actually made interesting by some intriguing lines\u2026\n\nLike so many other thrash veterans attempting to reclaim their places in the Pantheon, this album\u2019s biggest flaw is a lingering feeling of desperation. A number of songs sound like mere imitations in their attempts to pay homage and a few manage to go into borderline plagiarism. \u201cReturn To Hangar\u201d doesn\u2019t quite reach the standards of the original tune and the structure of \u201cDread And The Fugitive Mind\u201d is eerily similar to that of \u201cSweating Bullets.\u201d Hell, they even manage to channel Diamond Head in the \u201cSucking My Love\u201d inspired bass solo of \u201cDisconnect\u201d and the entire song structure of the infamous \u201cWhen\u201d\u2026\n\nAnd I\u2019ve really got to ask why no one thought it\u2019d be a good idea to put \u201cKill the King\u201d on here. I know that fact has nothing to do with this album itself, but that song is one of the best that Megadeth has ever recorded and doesn\u2019t deserve its association with the horribly lacking \u201cCapitol Punishment\u201d compilation\u2026\n\nI think Mustaine himself put it best when he described this album in hindsight as a step in the right direction rather than an all-out return to form. It has plenty of decent songs, but there\u2019s little worth noting for anyone that isn\u2019t a fanboy/completist. It\u2019s certainly not in the same realm of disappointment as \u201cSt. Anger,\u201d that\u2019s for sure\u2026\n\nPros:\n1) Fairly accessible songs\n2) Great vocals and bass playing\n3) Often intriguing lyrics\n\nCons:\n1) Somewhat desperate songwriting\n2) The riffs often lack the signature Megadeth intensity and technicality\n3) Bland production\n\nMy Current Favorites:\n\u201cDisconnect,\u201d \u201cMoto Psycho,\u201d \u201c1000 Times Goodbye,\u201d \u201cDread And The Fugitive Mind,\u201d and \u201cWhen\u201d\n",
        "\nIf any band is going to revitalize the old-school thrash scene, it\u2019s going to be Megadeth. With their latest song they continue to prove themselves a powerful force. \u201cHeadcrusher\u201d is as firmly rooted in the classic style of the eighties as Slayer\u2019s new material is derivative. There isn\u2019t a Big Four anymore \u2013 consider Megadeth the top of the pack.\n\nMegadeth, unlike the other three associated bands, did not suffer under the weight of groove, grunge, and mallcore. Their mid-era albums dipped in quality, yes, but for entirely different reasons. They never sold out, and as such they did not need a comeback. Rather, \u201cHeadcrusher\u201d is simply a continuation of the early and recent Megadeth albums, albeit with more thrash introduced to the usual heavy metal formula they have employed since Countdown to Extinction.\n\nThe potential for a great album is apparent straight out of the gate with the fantastic lead that opens up the song. Somehow it evokes visions of nuclear warfare and imminent disaster, but that probably is a result of the use of the incredible Rust in Peace production. Said production perfectly enhances each and every instrument, while giving the guitars a crystal clear yet still bludgeoning quality perfect for the song at hand. Meanwhile, the drums and bass thunder at blindingly whiplash-inducing speeds. And that\u2019s a quality sorely missing from other old thrash bands\u2019 new material \u2013 the speed, unadulterated and unrestrained.\n\nMustaine\u2019s voice has aged much better than a lot of other vocalists from his era. Those who have never liked his singing won\u2019t be swayed by his performance here, but others who either believe it works with the music or just plain like his style will be impressed. He\u2019s still as potent as he was twenty years ago, likely because he isn\u2019t like Araya and as such doesn\u2019t scream his lungs out.\n\nAll of the riffs scream \u201cRust in Peace\u201d to a degree that an unaware listener might mistake it as a track off that album. The chorus riff is particularly infectious, almost as much as the opening lead, and is made even more so by the lyrics. Speaking of the lyrics, they\u2019re some of the best Megadeth have come up with in a long while, actually entertaining and imaginative while spewing their tale of violence, unlike recent Slayer works that use death and violence in a completely generic and uninteresting way.\n\nIt\u2019s still too early to tell if Megadeth can keep this up, what with only one new song available, but if \u201cHeadcrusher\u201d is any indication, chances are looking good. Sorry, Metallica and Slayer, but I think I\u2019ll be sticking with Megadeth for the foreseeable future.\n",
        "\nMegadeth\u2019s fifth full-length effort starts off well. A crisp yet gritty production backs a cool old-school riff and a pissed-off Mustaine. Yet something soon becomes apparent \u2013 Megadeth can\u2019t keep it up. Most of the album sans a couple of songs either sucks or is painfully average. Such cuts as \u201cSymphony of Destruction\u201d and the title track lack the trademark Megadeth sound \u2013 this is by no means Rust in Peace II, or even KIMB II. It\u2019s an entirely new entity, and not a good one, either.\n\nNot to mention the album contains one of the most overrated \u201cthrash metal\u201d songs ever, up there with \u201cOne\u201d by the neutered Metallica. A stop-start riff starts things off badly for \u201cSymphony of Destruction,\u201d followed by a predictable verse-chorus-verse structure\u2026 oh, and what\u2019s this? A solo after the second, extended chorus? How predictable. It\u2019s very boring and totally unworthy of its praise. I once heard someone say that \u201cMegadeth\u2019s only two good songs are \u2018Hangar 18\u2019 and \u2018Symphony of Destruction.\u2019\u201d I\u2019ll let that sink in for a minute.\n\nOther tracks including \u201cArchitecture of Aggression\u201d and \u201cForeclosure of a Dream\u201d run together so much that some parts are nearly interchangeable. Originality and variety within the album is a rare thing, and this makes it difficult to listen to without getting bored. Throughout, Dave Mustaine really exposes the somewhat poor quality of his voice, which really doesn\u2019t fit with the music any longer. He tends to use similar melodies for the duration of the album, making it even harder to tell certain songs apart. Megadeth employ samples, including bland gunfire and news programs, none of which are of any real use at all. Meanwhile, the spoken verses of \u201cSweating Bullets\u201d are annoying beyond belief.\n\nRiffs tend to consist of pre-metalcore chugging and some stop-start patterns, interspersed with some improperly used and weak-sounding acoustic guitars. None are the least bit imaginative, and most could fit into any of the eleven songs and nothing would really change between them. The bass no longer maims like it did in earlier works, such as \u201cTake No Prisoners.\u201d It has become equivalent in importance to a typical AC/DC album. Drums are uniformly boring as well. Lyrics are now inane and devoid of power, unlike older songs like \u201cRust in Peace \u2026 Polaris.\u201d Mustaine sounds like a little kid who hates George H.W. Bush just because his parents do.\n\nHowever, there are some good qualities to the album, such as the previously stated \u201cSkin of My Teeth,\u201d and some catchiness in some parts, like the chorus to \u201cHigh Speed Dirt,\u201d the coolest title on Countdown to Extinction. In actuality, though, these parts are overshadowed by the average to downright insipid majority of the album.\n\nMustaine must have been trying to achieve the monstrous success of the Black Album, something that doesn\u2019t seem to make much sense considering his hateful stance towards Metallica. Unfortunately, Megadeth\u2019s fifth album constitutes an end to the breakneck thrash of old, again just like Metallica. Let\u2019s hope the upcoming album at least manages to be better than the era beginning with Countdown to Extinction.\n",
        "\nEven though this release didn't come out until 1995 and technically isn't a Megadeth album, the songs that are present on this compilation showcase what may have been the peak of Megadeth's career both critically and commercially. Not only did guitarist Marty Friedman and drummer Nick Menza prove to be a great fit after the release of \"Rust In Peace,\" the band itself manage to successfully weather the time's grunge takeover and remained in high demand on all sorts of movie soundtracks and tribute albums. This compilation showcases the interesting results of their outside-album endeavors...\n\nIn my opinion, the exclusive original songs are what really make this compilation worth hunting down. While most of these songs would still sound somewhat out of place on \"Rust in Peace\" or \"Countdown to Extinction,\" they are excellently written and even show a bit of the evolution that had taken place between those two efforts. \"Breakpoint\" is an excellent thrasher that was no doubt an influence on future songs like \"Kick the Chair,\" \"Go to Hell\" and \"Diadems\" are both darker numbers with menacing lyrics, and \"99 Ways to Die\" is an upbeat track with a memorable hook during the chorus that hints at the \"Youthanasia\" album on occasion. My favorite song on the collection is none other than \"Angry Again;\" it is one of the greatest Megadeth songs ever written and features a bouncy main riff and an infectious chorus.\n\nOn the other hand, the cover songs are where this collection shows its weakest points. That is not to say that these songs are poorly performed, they just sound rather elementary when compared to the successful originals on here. Their cover of Alice Cooper's \"No More Mr. Nice Guy\" is rather sloppy in execution but is made amusing by Dave Mustane's probably drunken banter, a somewhat forced guitar chug and strange vocals (compared to Ozzy's original performance) make their cover of \"Paranoid\" rather average (though Mustaine's yelling at Menza at the end is pretty funny), and their cover of the Sex Pistols' \"Problems\" is ultimately forgettable due to a slight lack of attitude. On the bright side, the latter song kicks the crap out of their version of \"Anarchy in the UK...\"\n\nUltimately, this is an interesting compilation with essential originals and some decent cover songs. Track it down if you can find it. I'll be adding \"Angry Again\" to the list of songs that I want to cover sometime in my life...\n\nPros:\n1) Excellently written original songs\n2) Takes a look at the evolution between \"Rust In Peace\" and \"Countdown to Extinction\"\n3) Humorous moments do make the covers enjoyable\n\nCons:\n1) The covers' execution is somewhat elementary\n2) The originals' lyrics can sound a little generic here and there\n\nMy Current Favorites:\n\"Breakpoint,\" \"Go to Hell,\" \"Angry Again,\" \"99 Ways to Die,\" and \"Diadems\"\n",
        "\nDon't let the title of this review deceive you, this is actually a fucking beast of a song. It's just not the type of track that would have fit on \u201cRust in Peace\u201d and I don't really get why people are thinking that this song is a preview of some \u201cRust in Peace II.\u201d \n\nThere's only one valid criticism of this song (the vocals don't count because this is really Mustaine's BEST vocal performance yet! Even better than UA..). It's generic. Yes, it's fucking generic. The riffs, the drums, the basslines, even the vocal patterns. If I could sum up this song in one word it'd be 'generic.' But seriously, who gives a shit? When was the last time Megadeth wrote a truly generic thrash song? Hell, did they EVER write a generic thrash metal song in their career? No. Megadeth's brand of thrash was always different from their peers, Mustaine had a better sense of groove and melody than most thrash metal guitarists and it shined through in their music. Another thing which defined Megadeth in their thrash heyday was the almost unpredictable nature of their music. The sudden changes, the seemingly random placement of the guitar solos, the strange timing of the vocals (especially in Killing Is My Business). This, ladies and gentlemen, is Megadeth's first and only (so far) generic thrash song and that, my friends, is the reason this song kicks so much ass. Head Crusher does not try to be anything but straight-up thrash fucking metal. It does not try to be overly flashy like Megadeth's last album or try to appeal to different sets of fans like the album before that one. And last but not least, Head Crusher does not try to emulate the 80's Megadeth AT ALL.\n\nI guess comparisons can be made. With KIMB because of the aggression displayed in this song, and SFSGSW (to an extent) because of the nature of the riffs. But like I said before, this track is a different thing altogether. But the generic-ness of this track would have never equaled awesomeness if it weren't for some other factors.\n\n1.) The production. The few bad things about the production on UA have been filtered out and the pro's about it have been made even better. The guitar tone is absolutely crushing, with every chug coming across as a fucking rock being pushed into your ears, in the good way. The drums, while being somewhat slow in the first half of the song, have an incredible punch to them and it isn't any more apparent than it is during the colossal thrash break in the second half of the song. C.R.U.S.H.I.N.G.\n\n2.) The vocals. Mustaine once again makes excellent use of his not-so-wide vocal range, going into the lowest range he possibly can. His voice starts to croak a bit as he snarls out the most awesome lyrics he has written in over 20 years and the only word that can possibly describe the effect it has is 'sadistic.' Mustaine sounds like a mad tyrant here, topping his vocal performance on UA and beats \u201cSleepwalker\u201d to a pulp. The vocals are made even more better by the lyrics, which as I just said, are perhaps one of the best lyrics to feature in a Megadeth song. If only Mustaine did vocals like these on Black Friday (not saying that the vox on Black Friday sucked, but god-damn...)\n\n3.) The artwork. Enough said.\n\n4.) Like some other people have stated, this song is perfect for a live atmosphere. Everything from the infectious chorus to the mosh inducing thrash break, this song has the potential to be a Megadeth classic and one of their best live songs.\n\nDEATH BY THE HEADCRUSHER!!!\n",
        "\nThe only thing this song has going for it is that it's a fast song, which isn't saying much because really, most thrash metal songs are fast. \n\nI suppose I'll start with the riffs. Very unextraordinary. Really, any thrash metal guitarist with the slightest bit of talent could write this song. There is absolutely nothing inspiring about it. Straightforward, simplistic, unoriginal. It seems like Dave just thinks if he plays fast, he doesn't have to put any thought into the actual music (which is something that has plagued his songwriting ever since he claimed a return to thrash metal). Most of the song is just Dave tremolo picking the E string and some power chords thrown in. That's it, seriously. It's like he's not even trying. \n\nAnother person who isn't trying is Drover, the drumming on this song is just completely stale and boring. Same thing over and over again. No complexity, very few fills, just playing along with the song not trying to stand out. The bass is no better, basically just playing along with the song, staying in the background adding absolutely nothing to the music. \n\nEach instrument should add something to any piece of music, and unfortunately, yet again, Megadeth is a one man show, Dave Mustaine, and he doesn't want anyone taking the focus off of him and his singing. This is just a really bad song. Boring and unoriginal.\n",
        "\nIn the 90\u2019s Megadeth were in a constant downward spiral in musicianship. Now Cryptic Writings being the last stop before that god awful abomination known as Risk one would expect Cryptic Writings to be fairly mediocre. Personally I find it to be an amusing endeavor, but ultimately it leaves you with a sour taste.\n\nNow this album may not be fast, hell with 3 out of 12 actually are remotely speedy, but it has some decent riffage. But many of these you can hear some of their influences in them, one of which is stolen right from under the nose of Pink Floyd. If you listen to \u201cI\u2019ll Get Even\u201d the intro sounds fairly similar to the intro of Pink Floyd\u2019s Speak to me/Breathe. But what this album really lacks other that speed is heaviness. It all sounds light and very thin which is very problematic until it reaches Vortex where the sound finally thickens. Now Dave and Marty have some exceptional solos on this release as well but most of them are pretty dumbed down, now honestly I wasn\u2019t expecting another \u201cPeace Sells\u201d in terms of guitar work, but c\u2019mon they can do waaaaay better than this. The rhythm section is like the guitar work, catchy and pretty dumbed down. The bass and percussion is pretty strong on this album, but not strong enough to ruin anything or overbear anything else.\n\nNow in terms of Dave\u2019s vocal performance, it\u2019s his average studio voice, but it\u2019s a little more clean than the snarl we came to love in the 80\u2019s, but it damn sure sounds better than what he does live, that\u2019s for sure!\n\nBut one thing I must admit that several of the tracks are quite catchy, mainly because of the big choruses in some of the songs. This formula of weak verse/booming chorus is good but for only so long, and that\u2019s part of the reason this album is so damn boring. The lyrics are fairly dull too, but mainly because the producer Mr. Bud Pager deemed some too explicit to make this a hit [I have the reissue version with some of the aborted tracks included, and several are better than the released counterparts]. Speaking on the reissue I strongly recommend getting that version, the bonus tracks really bring up the experience, especially \u201cBullprick\u201d and it\u2019s odd lyrics of construction tool-based violence.\n\nNow to put this in a nutshell: Cryptic Writings is pretty bad, and one of the lower ends of the \u2018Deth catalogue, but it\u2019s not as bad as the next album I must say. You should definitely avoid this if you\u2019re a fan of their older works, but if you want a simple radio-friendly album, well, you\u2019ll be in heaven-65%.\n",
        "\nFirst off, this is a pretty good song, but I have a few problems with it.\n\nThe way the song starts off doesn't sit well with me at all. It just rushes into this part of the song that feels like it belongs halfway a song. Maybe it'll feel better listening to it as part of the album, as I don't believe the song starts off the album, but as a single the beginning wasn't very good.\n\nThe drums seriously lack any kind of creativity, it's just some double bass thoughout the song and it's exactly what you'd expect from a thrash metal band, I suppose. I mean, I guess it's not really a crime that the drums are so tasteless, but still, they could've done something different here.\n\nI do like the promotion and that they released the single for free on their site, though tons of bands do that today I'm not really sure it's really worth noting, or enough to really rise it's score.\n\nI will say that it's better than what most bands put out that have been together for roughly 25 years. It's better than what Slayer, Metallica, and Anthrax have put out as of late, to compare it to the other \"Big 4\" of thrash metal. It's a good song, but pretty average. Don't come in expecting the greatest thing ever, and if this is setting the tone for the album, then I'll most likely be interested in getting my hands on it.\n",
        "\nI was very excited to hear that Roadrunner was going to release a good quality version of this song, and to make things better it was free! Honestly who can turn down free metal? I recall them doing the same thing back in 2007 for the song, Washington is Next!, but unlike the previous, they released this to iTunes so you could actually save it to your mp3 player instead of having to be on a computer. \n\nNow on to the song itself. Lyrically, it is probably one of the more brutal songs Megadeth has done. The title, Head Crusher, just about leaves nothing to the imagination. Just check out the artwork they have for it, pretty much says it all. It's not Black Friday's killing spree brutality, but the image that gets conjured into your head of a skull being squished until your brains pour our your ears, damn. I'm not doctor, but I would wager that's got to fucking hurt! \n\nNow on to the reason we all love Megadeth, the music! This song starts out with a blast of classic Mustaine lead work, and from there we got some nice fast riff work. Not the technical type from songs such as Poison was the Cure, but more primitive open E chug thrash approach with power chords in between. The riff itself actually sounds a bit like Trapped Under Ice from Dave's old band. After two verses and choruses comes a nice breakdown followed by a pretty good mosh part. The outro solo by Chris Broderick I would guess, though not as memorable as the intro solo, is still good, and has some smoking rhythm work behind it. The drums maintain a very aggressive feel throughout, which is very important as the shitty drums just about killed Kick the Chair from The System Has Failed. James LoMenzo keeps it tight on the low end, but as a die hard old fan, I would just love to have Dave Ellefson back, for nostalgia. \n\nThis is a good way to start out the new album, and the free download is some nice promotion for once by Roadrunner, hopefully they don't screw this up again by changing the first single. Nobody want's to hear Megadeth do a duet, like last time. Expectations are high for Endgame, I much doubt Megadeth will disappoint. And this is FREE right now, so what have you got to loose?\n",
        "\nGiven that 2004\u2019s \"The System Has Failed\" was originally intended to be a solo album by guitarist/vocalist Dave Mustaine, it could be argued that this release is the first real Megadeth album since \"The World Needs a Hero\" was released in 2001. It is the first album to feature drummer Shawn Drover and bassist James Lomenzo and it\u2019s the only album to feature guitarist Glen Drover. It may also be the angriest album that the band has released since \"Countdown to Extinction\" and is easily the band\u2019s most political to date.\n\nMusically, the album combines the intensity of \"Rust in Peace\" with the accessible nature of \"CTE\" and \"Cryptic Writings.\" The songs themselves range from violent thrashers (\"Sleepwalker,\" \"Washington is Next!\"), mid-tempo crushers (\"Play For Blood,\" \"You\u2019re Dead\"), and a few songs that really come out of nowhere (\"Amerikhastan\"). The new line-up also manages to come together strongly in comparison to the band\u2019s better known teams. Every song is packed with strong guitar riffs, solid rhythms, and vocals that range from sarcastic to desperate.\n\nThe guys in Megadeth are certainly no strangers to politics but this album may possess some of the band\u2019s most intense lyrics to date. Frustrations with the American government can be found within the words of \"Washington is Next!,\" \"Amerikhastan\" seems to poke fun at the War on Terror, and the title track provides several angry rants aimed towards the United Nations. For the most part, they\u2019re pretty well thought out but many lines sound somewhat awkward in their delivery (\u201cHey, Jihad Joe? Guess what? We're coming to get you!\u201d). A few other themes present in the album\u2019s lyrics include revenge (\"Sleepwalker,\" \"You\u2019re Dead\"), drug abuse (\"Burnt Ice\"), war and its after effects (\"Gears Of War,\" \"Blessed are the Dead\"), and a few more personal affairs along the way (\"Never Walk Alone... A Call to Arms,\" \"A Tout le Monde\").\n\nUltimately, the album\u2019s main flaw seems to be that some songs feel rather recycled or just don\u2019t seem to connect with one another at times. \"Never Walk Alone\" features an opening riff that sounds like it was taken straight from \"Vortex,\" the guitar/bass trade-offs on \"Blessed are the Dead\" sound eerily similar to those found on AC/DC\u2019s \"Next to the Moon,\" and \"Burnt Ice\" seems to replicate the twin guitar trade-offs on \"Hangar 18\" with a lesser degree of success (Not to mention a possible reference to Sabbath's \"Sweet Leaf\" with the coughs in the beginning...). Not to mention a few songs such as \"Amerikhastan\" and \"You\u2019re Dead\" seem to be hastily constructed when compared to their more successful counterparts.\n\nI\u2019m also divided when it comes to the re-recording to \"A Tout le Monde.\" As a fan of the original song on \"Youthanasia,\" I can safely say that this version is pretty decent and the guest vocals by Lacuna Coil singer Cristina Scabbia are beautifully done. However, it seems to be rather processed in comparison to the original and feels like an unnecessary addition that could\u2019ve been filled in by their cover of Led Zeppelin\u2019s \"Out on the Tiles\" or \"Black Swan.\" I just think that it would\u2019ve been better as some kind of bonus track rather than one of the album\u2019s actual songs. Kinda like what Metal Church with their recent re-recording of \"Watch the Children Pray\" the year before...\n\nThere are a few inconsistent songs but this is still worth checking out for Megadeth die-hards.\n\nPros:\n1) The new line-up sounds great together\n2) Great song variety\n3) The lyrics have their intriguing moments\n\nCons:\n1) Some songs are either unoriginal or feel hastily constructed\n2) The lyrics can be somewhat goofy at times\n3) Was the \"A Tout le Monde\" remake really that necessary?\n\nMy Current Favorites:\n\"Sleepwalker,\" \"Washington is Next!,\" \"United Abominations,\" \"Gears of War,\" and \"Blessed Are the Dead\"\n",
        "\nThis EP includes 6 full live songs. Or actually it is 7, since Peace Sells is a hidden track. But more about that later. The thing is, we don't have that much early Megadeth live stuff. We have the concert from 1990 on Warchest, which is one of the best concerts ever! Megadeth is my favourite band, and my favourite live band. No one plays live like they do!\n\nOn this EP, there aren't tat many very old classics. You've got Peace Sells and Tornado Of Souls, which are both done great! Those are the only very old songs, but that doesn't really matter. Even though Megadeth changed, I still love their music. And the other songs like Reckoning Day, A Tout Le Monde, She-Wolf and Use The Man are also performed brilliant. I don't understand how they do it.\n\nThe guitars are perfect! What else could you expect. Marty Friedman and Dave Mustaine combined is a guitar machine! They can play whatever the hell they want, and that is a fact! Mustaine doesn't only do a great job with the guitar, he also sings like a master. He is the best singer that I know. Much better than Hetfield or any other vocalist like that. Drums are of course played great! When you have Nick Menza behind the drum set, nothing can go wrong. It sounds really heavy at least, and that's the point.\n\nSo if you want some great Megadeth live, then get your hands on this EP! It was hard for me to get it, but I managed to get it in the end, and I was very satisfied. I know that you'll be exactly the same when you hear it. So get it now, and bang your head till you bleed!!\n",
        "\nMany fans see this 1994 effort as the kickoff to a long-lasting downward spiral for Megadeth. It's true that there are maybe only two or three thrash riffs to be found on the whole record, but hell, it doesn't matter as Mustaine managed to embrace a completely new sound for his beast and made it work for the most part. \n\nIt seems as if he had opened a box full of 80s heavy metal riffs and fused them together in a way only Dave could. Sure, the amount of riffs decreased and the speed of earlier times is never matched again, but a lack of ideas is something Mustaine simply cannot be accused of. \n\nOne of the best examples for this new sound is the great (and heavy) opener \"Reckoning Day\" with its gallopping main riff and truly amazing vocals by Dave (never forget, it's Mustaine I'm talking about, so for god's sake don't expect any greatness in TECHNICAL terms, but passion oozing from every word of his lyrics). The only thing I'm missing here is a great solo, as there are only a few rather simple leads present.\n\nProbably the most well-known song of this album (besides \"A Tout Le Monde\") is \"Train of Consequences\" with its very original trademark riff, sounding like a train chugging along on its railroad tracks. Ah, and we can finally hear a great and memorable solo by Marty Friedman! Another honorable mention is again the very passionate vocal performance by Dave, who really seems to tear his vocal chords apart in the song's chorus.\n\nSome more highlights are \"Addicted to Chaos\" (a track with a melancholic, almost depressing atmosphere), the epic \"Blood of Heroes\" which shows Mustaine in great shape, the \u00fcber-catchy and bass-heavy \"Family Tree\" (which also has the best riffs on the whole record) and the concluding \"Victory\"; probably the only song that wouldn't have been very out of place on an 80s \u00b4Deth record. It also features some awesome lyrics, paying homage to the band's classics (even the guitar solo sounds like a summary of different classic Friedman solos).\n\nThe only painfully negative thing here is the lack of convincing lead work. Megadeth have always been a band that wasn't about the riffs only, as their blistering and flashy soloing has always been a very important factor in the band's sound - Mustaine and Friedman were a force to be reckoned with; yet there are no ear-shattering moments like the godly solos in \"Holy Wars\"/\"Tornado of Souls\" or even \"Ashes in Your Mouth\" to be found here and that is simply a shame. A solo here, a lead there, but nothing to write home about and nothing that really manages to ram a hook in your mouth...or memory. Sometimes it feels as if Dave & Marty held themselves back...\n\nEither way, you surely can't got wrong with any of the tracks here, as the overall quality level of the songs displayed here is high, making this one of the most consistent releases of the band.\n\nI recommend this to any metalhead who'd love to hear an 80s record with a little more balls and darker lyrical subjects than usual. If you liked \"Countdown to Exctinction\", I see no reason for you not to like this even more convincing and stronger record; a little surprising, considering the great downfall that would follow this LP. \n\nPS: Try to get a version with the \"Crown of Worms\" bonus track, it's worth it!\n",
        "\nStarting things over at square one rarely results in a masterpiece being put together, and that is precisely what went on when this album was thrown together and released to the public. Mustaine had essentially lost his longest running axe partner and half of his rhythm section, not to mention that it had been going on 7 years since he\u2019d put together an album that was 100% metal, let alone thrash metal. In keeping with all of this, one shouldn\u2019t approach \u201cThe World Needs A Hero\u201d with high expectations. But even when canceling out the unrealistic hope of a return to \u201cRust In Peace\u201d, especially considering that Marty Friedman is out of the picture, this album does leave a bit to be desired.\n\nFirst to get the obvious out of the way, this is basically a metal album, though there is some retention of rock oriented influences as heard on \u201cCryptic Writings\u201d. These tend to occur during the extended intros of certain songs, and in some isolated cases they take over the song entirely. Otherwise, what unfolds to the ears is something largely comparable to \u201cYouthanasia\u201d, though lacking a lot of the impressive hooks and often trying to merge some older thrash elements into the mix. What results is an album that is just a tiny bit heavier than your average heavy metal album, and definitely a good bit more technical in the riff department.\n\nThere are many positive examples of songs that settle into a fairly older vain of Megadeth, albeit ones that hearken to the early to mid-90s rather than the 80s. Songs such as the catchy and minimalist \u201cMoto Psycho\u201d, the mid-paced yet intricate \u201cDisconnect\u201d, and the heavier and riff happy \u201cBurning Bridges\u201d. These songs all carry elements of stronger moments heard on \u201cCountdown To Extinction\u201d and on the various non-album songs that floated around before and after \u201cYouthanasia\u201d. \u201cBurning Bridges\u201d actually turns into a speed/thrash song during the guitar solo, definitely reminiscent of \u201cFear His Name\u201d off of Overkill\u2019s \u201cTaking Over\u201d.\n\nUnfortunately, there are also a fair share of flawed songs and also a few genuine throwaways. The title track \u201cThe World Needs A Hero\u201d and \u201c1000 Times Goodbye\u201d both contain a fair share of solid riff work, but both are loaded with Mustaine\u2019s odd narrative ramblings, which are actually the most overblown fits of sheer corniness he\u2019s ever come up with. At times it almost sounds as if he came up with the verses of these songs via pure stream of consciousness. \u201cRecipe For Hate...Warhorse\u201d brings back memories of \u201cDawn Patrol\u201d, as it spends more than 2 minutes riding a bass line and contains similarly rambling verses before it actually gets going. Once it does, it breaks out into a series of highly effective riffs and lead breaks, making you wonder why they just didn\u2019t kick things in at around the 1 minute mark.\n\nThere\u2019s really only one section where this album truly breaks out into owning what it does and throwing out the true strength of this band, and that is the two song set of \u201cSilent Scorn\u201d and \u201cReturn To The Hangar\u201d. While this is meant to be the sequel/conclusion of the famed \u201cHangar 18\u201d story from \u201cRust In Peace\u201d, musically this sounds closer to what was heard on \u201cSo Far, So Good, So What?\u201d. The first song is a part acoustic ballad, part military march that listens like an army funeral. What follows in the second song is the only thing on here that qualifies as thrash, albeit a shorter and darker version of the late 80s sound of Megadeth. The ending riff where the solo interchange comes in sounds like it was inspired by \u201cDarkness Descends\u201d, and cooks better than anything heard on \u201cCountdown To Extinction\u201d or \u201cYouthanasia\u201d. Why Dave can\u2019t write a whole album like this anymore is absolutely beyond me.\n\nThough this has its moments, it is still a step behind \u201cCryptic Writings\u201d as an overall listen. If you are one of these old school fans of Megadeth who liked the albums before Dave would speak entire verses of words as if he were on a pulpit, be prepared to be annoyed by about 1/3 of what is on here. This is definitely something that falls into bargain hunting territory, preferably at $6 or less. As much as it pains me to say it, there are cases where an album can be Metal yet simultaneously not very good.\n\nOriginally submitted to (www.metal-observer.com) on March 31, 2009.\n",
        "\nAs someone who\u2019s been a Megadeth fan for the better part of 15 years, I\u2019ve long been wary of the dubious nature of many of this band\u2019s compilation releases. This one is, by far, the most dubious of the lot, essentially functioning as an ironically titled get out of jail free card for a band that spent 14 years with the same record label. That\u2019s really the only purpose that this thing severed, aside from being a promotional release for \u201cThe World Needs A Hero\u201d, the band\u2019s return to the metal world after a couple of years in a modern rock hiatus, and perhaps as a place for the homeless opening track \u201cKill The King\u201d, at least until 2005 when the better compilation \u201cBack To The Start\u201d came out.\n\nThe important thing to note is that this is a promotional compilation guising as a best of, because you don\u2019t have a best of compilation when you start off with two new songs and essentially throw in a miniscule collection of radio hits in backwards chronological order without any accounting for pacing or stylistic contrast. For those who have already heard Megadeth\u2019s entire discography, the abrupt change in feel that occurs between \u201cTrust\u201d and \u201cA Tout Le Monde\u201d is a surreal reminder of the band\u2019s confusion during the mid 90s, let alone the massive jolt that occurs between \u201cSymphony Of Destruction\u201d and \u201cHangar 18\u201d. All things considered, if you know most of these songs, or even if you don\u2019t, listening to this straight through is not advised.\n\nNaturally many of the songs on here are obligatory classics, while much of the rest is solid, but having an entire album set up without any thought of what it would sound like when played through defeats the purpose of a compilation. Granted, in this age of ripped playlists, CD compilations are obsolete minus as a dumping place for unreleased rarities, which is what they\u2019ve become. But considering this came out a good 9 years ago, before buying individual songs online became truly widespread, there\u2019s no excuse for this. Throwing together a bunch of songs that happened to be audience and radio favorites happens, but at least format it in a way so that it doesn\u2019t sound like it\u2019s on random play.\n\nAnd as if the bad track ordering wasn\u2019t enough, before the whole thing withers away and dies we are treated to a trippy medley of Megadeth classics, put together to form a random, jagged collage of sound that I don\u2019t care to listen to again. Random art might be a fancy for some, but anyone who thought that \u201cRisk\u201d had too much quirky sound effects and production gimmicks; this makes that entire album sound like Danzig\u2019s debut. But for all of you who love old Megadeth but scrambled your brains a bit too much head banging to \u201cPeace Sells\u201d, which would probably explain why you might have bought this at full price when it came out, this translates into \u201cthis is pointless, don\u2019t spend money on it\u201d.\n\nThat\u2019s basically the best advice I can give for anyone toying with buying this for the sake of having a good listening experience. Maybe if you can find it for under $2 at a flee market bargain shop the way I did it might be worth it for \u201cKill The King\u201d, which is a pretty solid song in the slower \u201cYouthanasia\u201d style. This now has a bright future of picking up dust while sitting in on my shelf between my heavily dust covered copy of \u201cRisk\u201d and my moderately dusty copy of \u201cThe World Needs A Hero\u201d, a fitting fate for a compilation that was probably put together over a weekend yet might have made Capitol Records more money than \u201cRisk\u201d did.\n\nOriginally submitted to (www.metal-observer.com) on March 26, 2009.\n",
        "\n...And business is good.\n\nThe original plan was to review Megadeth\u2019s albums in chronological order, but I simply had to get this one out of my system. The common misconception about Risk is that even Dave himself hates it, but anyone who knows anything would know that this is false. And I quote from the liner notes of the remastered version of the album: \u201cI still contend this was a great record, but it was not what Megadeth fans expected hear.\u201d\n\nAs true as that statement was, this album certainly has it\u2019s handful of diehard fans, one of them being me. \u201cAh, but he also likes Poison and thinks Pantera were better as a glam band, what does he know?!\u201d Granted, but if you only liked Megadeth for their heavier thrash sound then chances are you gave up on the band long ago anyway so you might as well just stop reading this, now. Go, grab Rust in Peace and thrash your heart out. Now, do it now.\n\nOf course, it\u2019s ludicrous to state that the only reason so many people looked down upon Risk was because they were narrow minded thrashoholics, but there\u2019s no denying that there would have been a lot of people who were like that. After the half arsed snooze fest that was Cryptic Writings and the first line up change in years, I found that the mixed bag that was Risk to be a refreshing change of direction.\n\nAnd it really is a mixed bag; there\u2019s a bit of metal here and there, bits of hard rock, electronic, prog, stadium rock, alternative...Even a little bit of country!\n\nThings kick off with \u201cInsomnia\u201d, which is probably the most aggressive song on the album...Not that that\u2019s saying much. The song has electronica style electric drums in parts, but the riff sounds like it could have come from Countdown to Extinction. The chorus is really catchy as well.\n\nIn fact, pretty much all of the songs on here have very catchy chorus, something Megadeth have been doing on all their albums since 1992. Catchiness is the basis for any pop album, melodic hooks and nothing else. Happily, Risk has more substance than that. \u201cPrince of Darkness\u201d is a great lower paced song with a sinister spoken intro, and again, a highly catchy chorus. \n\nMany people have criticized Risk by calling it a sell-out album, but I\u2019d be quick to disagree. The varying styles on this album are simply too inconsistent to make it an album of radio hits, unlike the Metallica albums of the time. This is much better than Load, and as far as I\u2019m concerned better than anything Metallica have done since 1984.\n\n\u201cCrush \u2018em\u201d is awesome. Light, atmospheric intro that builds up to the huge, anthemic chorus. Killer stadium rock. Simple, silly, but great fun and highly memorable. The fact that a song like this is then followed by a song like \u201cBreadline\u201d clearly demonstrates the inconsistency of styles I mentioned before. Instead of being a huge stadium anthem, this is a light melodic rocker with a strong country vibe to it. It\u2019s a very good song, but it\u2019s hard to imagine that it was released by a band called Megadeth, a band whose back catalogue includes songs called \u201cLoved to Deth\u201d and \u201cWale up Dead\u201d.\n\nThe same goes for everything on here really. \u201cThe Doctor is Calling\u201d is a bit boring (but still fairly enjoyable), but then we get to the awesome \u201cI\u2019ll Be There\u201d, a sentimental ballad like song that can rival \u201cA Tout le Monde\u201d in terms of beauty. In fact, I actually prefer this to the Youthinasia classic. It also has one of my all-time favourite lyrical quotes; \u201cWe stopped dreaming, and started believing\u201d.\n\nThis is followed by the songs \u201cWanderlust\u201d and \u201cEcstasy\u201d, both late 90s style alternative rockers, with the former having a very light post-grunge(!) sound to it. Closing the album is the two piece song \u201cTime\u201d. The first piece is an atmospheric acoustic affair, which works well as an introduction to the second part, which is great hard rock/heavy metal. A great end to the album.\n\nThis is, unless, you have the remaster. This means you have the three bonus tracks, which are different mixes of the songs \u201cInsomnia\u201d, \u201cBreadline\u201d and \u201cCrush \u2018Em\u201d. They aren\u2019t anything special really. The first one is an enjoyable listen, but dear God, the \u201cJock Mix\u201d version of \u201cCrush \u2018Em\u201d is shocking! The whole appeal of the song is that it\u2019s anthemic, this mix totally destroys that and make it sounds like a horrible techno song or something...But it's not fair to take away points for bonus tracks.\n\nAnyway, bonus tracks aside, a good album. If you don\u2019t like hard rock or alternative rock, avoid. If you only like heavy metal, avoid. If you thought Megadeth have been going downhill since Countdown, definitely avoid. Otherwise, give it a listen, it\u2019s worth the Risk (pun 110% intended).\n",
        "\nThis collection is great! It has got everything you could wish for. It has 3 cd's with their greatest hits, including some demos, live tracks and other stuff. There are so many songs on this that you'll have more than enough to listen to. Not only are there songs that we've heard before. There are also some songs we haven't heard. A cover of kiss' \"Strange Ways,\" the song \"Crown Of Worms\" which is an unreleased song, and \"One Thing\" which also is a rare track. It is amazing that we've got all this shit right in one complation!\n\nIncluding all these powerful tracks, there is also the fourth disc, which is a concert from London in 1990. Here, Dave Mustaine does an absolutely amazing job with his vocals and of course guitar. It is in my opinion the best Megadeth concert ever! It is much better than Metallica's Live Shit Binde & Purge, which also is good but not as good as this one! Dave's vocals are truly unbeatable!\n\nApart from this, there is also uncluded a DVD of Megadeth live in 1992. This one is also great! I just love Dave's performance here too! So there really is much to listen to in this complation. The greatest hits cd's not only have the original songs we've heard before, but demo's and live tracks. I know I've mentioned this before, but it is important that all you out there know this, so that you know it is worth getting!\n\nSo overall, this is a true MUST HAVE for all Megafans out there. Well, it is a MUST HAVE for any thrasher that is out there. Get this complation or DIE!!\n",
        "\nIf there is one thing that could sum up this troubled and hopefully soon to be forgotten album in Megadeth\u2019s otherwise mostly consistent history, it would be woefully misunderstood, which is what it still is to this day. Usually such a sentiment would imply that the album is underrated, but in this particular case the issue is that its detractors hate it for the wrong reasons, while those who defend it can\u2019t really seem to fully articulate why other than it being under the Megadeth moniker. \u201cRisk\u201d is not a metal album, that much is obvious, but neither is it a hard rock album by any stretch of the imagination.\n\nThe term hard rock itself denotes a style of playing that is hard edged, aggressive and mostly guitar oriented. The only respect of this album that really falls into the first of these 3 criterion is Dave Mustaine\u2019s vocals, which are also the strongest thing going on here as well. There is guitar work on here, there are even some impressive solos churned out by Marty Friedman, but there is so much other non-rock stuff going on here that a more appropriate Rock label would be something along the lines of an offshoot of progressive rock with a heavy amount of dance music and blues additives. \n\nSure, you might be able to dance to some stuff that John \u201cCougar\u201d Mellencamp and Eric Clapton have put out, but nothing in their repertoire could be qualified as dance music, nor have they ever relied on this absurd amount of odd studio gimmicks employed on here. Right smack at the beginning of \u201cInsomnia\u201d you\u2019re almost wondering if this is an outtake from the \u201cMortal Kombat\u201d movie soundtrack. Throw on top of this an occasional electronic drum beat section and a really synthetic sounding guitar tone and you\u2019ve got the makings of something heard at a rave party, aka the leading cause of bad PCP trips today.\n\nThere are rock riffs on here, and even a couple of songs that could be classified as hard rock, but to label this album anything other than completely confused would be a mistake. Parts of it could be described as really goofy, such as the near 2 minute rant Dave goes on at the beginning of \u201cPrice Of Darkness\u201d, an otherwise boring groovy alternative rock song with a guitar sound that is processed sounding enough to make Rammstein blush. There\u2019s also a bastardized U2 meets Bon Jovi snoozer in \u201cI\u2019ll Be There\u201d, but very little that expresses the hardness associated with the label put on this by its defenders.\n\nNaturally there are a scant few songs that come off as inoffensive to someone looking for a rock album. The albums AOR hit single of a song \u201cBreadline\u201d takes all of the non-metal elements of \u201cCryptic Writings\u201d and compresses them into one catchy, lounge music package. It\u2019s basically a rehash of \u201cAlmost Honest\u201d without any iota of attitude, perfect for those rock radio junkies who want their music hypnotic and under 5 minutes long. \u201cWanderlust\u201d is something of a semi-classic Rock oriented song, mixing a smattering of Aerosmith influences with a big helping of blues trappings and a chorus that sounds a little like that hit song \u201cCumbersome\u201d from a couple years before this came out.\n\nThe ironic thing is that when taken as a whole, this doesn\u2019t come off as a complete commercial effort when taken as a whole, but something more along the lines of a compromise between Mustaine wanting to one up Metallica at their own commercial game and Marty Friedman wanting to experiment. For all of his amazing chops and ingenious songwriting, Friedman is not a thrash metal player at heart. He\u2019s more in line with the progressive rock crowd, as a simple sampling of his solo material will reveal. Combine this with Mustaine being unable to get the Lars Urlich monkey off his back while \u201cThe Black Album\u201d , then later \u201cLoad\u201d and \u201cReload\u201d proceed to burn up the charts, the evolution of Megadeth\u2019s sound since after \u201cRust In Peace\u201d becomes the logical conclusion.\n\nThis album is recommended to no one, rock fan or metal fan alike. Absent the almighty guitar riff in all of its blazing glory, there is no metal to be heard, nor any rock to roll to. Pile on top of this a few extremely lame techno remixes of three already bad songs on my 2004 reissue copy; the pointless ante is upped well beyond the point of good taste. If you want to pick it up because you\u2019re a core Megadeth fan like me, be my guest, but do yourself a favor and just hold onto it as a CD shelf adorner and occasional beer coaster. I\u2019ll give Dave and company credit for putting out a worst album that is a cut above the musical abortion otherwise known as \u201cSt. Anger\u201d, but that\u2019s not really saying a whole lot.\n\nOriginally submitted to (www.metal-observer.com) on March 11, 2009.\n",
        "\nThis single includes two versions of the song \"Hangar 18.\" The first one is a radio edited version, which is very much shorter than the original. If you don't want to listen to all the amazing guitar solos, then the radio edited version is the one for you. However, the best one is definitely the original, because those solos are godamn unbeatable! They are the best solos that I've ever heard!\n\nYou've also got two amazing live tracks. The first one is from the album \"Peace Sells\" and the song is the second one on the album \"The Conjuring.\" Here, the band prooves that they are one of the best live bands that are possible to find! The second live track is \"Hook In Mouth\" from their \"So Far, So Good... So What!\" album. An amazing live track as well.\n\nSo if you want some great Megadeth stuff, then get this single. Of course, you should rather get the full album \"Rust In Peace,\" but the reason you should probably get this single is because of the live tracks. We don't have that much live stuff from Megadeth in the early years, so it is important that we take all we can get! So get this single for the live tracks!!\n",
        "\nWell, nobody can say this is a thrash metal highlight with a straight face, but it sure is a great heavy metal album. I don't think many people are surprised with this direction that Megadeth took, I mean, Countdown is not too different. This was probably one of the first Megadeth albums I REALLY got into. I remember each song getting 100+ plays the first week I got the album. OK, so it is definitely slower than Megadeth's previous releases, and it is not very technical, but it is extremely catchy, I mean just look at the cover. The album has more hooks than Rattlehead's mouth, that's for sure.\n\nSo the most obvious differences are probably the drums, and the speed of the album. Menza's drumming simplified, and got slower. There are no more of those light-speed riffs present in songs like \"Poison was the Cure\". The solos are also more simplified. Hell, I think even Dave's voice changed a bit for this album. The songs have also become quite melodic with the addition of some melodic interludes that exist in \"Victory\", \"Addicted to Chaos\", and many other tracks on the songs.\n\nThe high point of the album is definitely the chorus and though much slower, the the riffs still do have something to offer. The riffs on \"Train of Consequences\", and \"The Killing Road\" are among some of my favorites. The majority of the tracks are all decent. They all have the signature Megadeth riffs, and maintain a degree of crunch in them. I don't think anybody can disagree when I say that the riffs are catchy. They stick in your head, and it's quite easy to recognize them within the first 5 seconds of each song. Whether it be the pick scratching intro of \"Train of Consequences\", or the opening of \"A Tout le Monde\". Ellefson's bass line has also been given more dominance. There are more Peace Sells-esque bass intros, and the bass lines are louder, and heavier. A very obvious example of the bass dominance would be \"Family Tree\".\n\nHowever, this album has some major shortcomings. The solos... well they have been simplified and slowed down to the point that most of them would have been considered riffs on the first 4 Megadeth albums. Bad! Bad! The overall speed of the album is sacrificed for the catchy tunes. The songs lack the ear splitting madness of the first 4 Megadeth albums, and the songs can't really deliver the speed induced high or the punch of the previous songs. \n\nThough most of the speed is lost, you can hear echoes of the Megadeth of the 80s in the songs like \"Victory\", and \"Reckoning Day\". Quite literally when it comes to \"Victory\". The songs do preserve some of the speed and aggression of the previous albums, and \"Victory\" has those catchy lyrics. \n\nThe best songs of this album are probably \"Victory\", \"Train of Consequences\", and \"Family Tree\". They all have their own catchy parts. Victory preserves the Megadeth essence, Train of Consequences has those catchy riffs, and Family Tree probably has the catchiest chorus of all Megadeth songs. \n\nOverall, I'd say by heavy metal standards, this is near the top, but for Megadeth standards, it is a fairly strong release. The thrash elements have fallen back, and have been replaced with catchy choruses. I think some die hard thrash fans can enjoy this album too. I would recommend this album to anybody that likes heavy metal, and thrash metal, or just to anybody who likes metal in general.\n",
        "\nAh, this is good. After having to sail Megadeth through a shitstorm over the Risk album and the (in my opinion worse) follow-up The World Needs a Hero, Mustaine showed with The System Has Failed that 'Deth can still perform. \"System...\" had a couple of good tracks but Washington Is Next! far overshadows anything from that album.\n\nI have to admit that when I bought United Abominations I didn't know Megadeth very well, since then I have put the album away, gotten to know the bands past releases and then lately I suddenly remembered that I had their newest album lying around. I gave it a spin, and thought that it was so-so, until I hear this.\n\nLet me say right off that this is the best track on \"Abominations\". It has every element that made tracks like 'Skin o' My Teeth' so great, starting with a simple but very great intro riff (some of which does, however, sound strangely familiar to Iron Maidens 'Wasted Years'), the verses also have a couple of standard riffs, nothing serious but still delivered in a raw and unforgiving way. And speaking of raw and unforgiving, the lyrics certainly hold nothing back as Mustaine spews out his rage of the society of today. Lines like \"How can there be any logic / in biological war? / we all know this is wrong / but the new world order's beating down the door\" may sound very simple, but they're certained delivered in a way that leads no room for doubt as to the seriousness. And Megadeth is SERIOUS.\n\nI can listen to this song again and again - and a song like that deserves a high score.\n",
        "\nMegadeth\u2019s best shot at getting on top of the thrash heap was with this album; Metallica and Slayer had peaked four or so years ago (Anthrax never being any competition to these three), thrash was probably at it\u2019s commercial apex- or at least pretty close to it- it was the perfect time to strike. It wasn\u2019t a bad attempt, but various head-scratching ideas in this album stop it from being the definitive statement that Megadeth probably hoped it would be.\n\nLet\u2019s not waste any time and go to the most obvious point here: Megadeth absolutely suck(ed?) at mid paced riffs. It\u2019s no coincidence that the best tracks and moments here are when restraint is abandoned and Mustaine and co. construct strange and beautiful towers of fast paced thrashing ecstasy. Perhaps it\u2019s just because Mustaine\u2019s vocals are more audible (never a good thing) when things get slower and more melodic, maybe it was a poor attempt at copying Metallica\u2019s AJFA when Megadeth were always better at being faster and more violent. Who knows? Regardless, they\u2019re pretty much consistently terrible and there\u2019s a lot of them. Holy Wars is good enough proof; the opening is pretty much the best thing ever, but come the \"know it all scholar\" bit things start going down hill quickly, and we\u2019re treated to a few awful momentum-sapping minutes of Mustaine doing some truly horrible wailing while a bunch of really meandering riffs crap on your thrash boner. Perhaps it\u2019s because at this point Megadeth still weren\u2019t any good at making hooks, I dunno. Attempts at slower choruses and catchy mid paced riffs just consistently fail; Hangar 18\u2019s vocal lines and riffs aren\u2019t really any good until the solo section comes along, likewise Five Magics is pretty much anti-catchy for a time. Lucretia being the most mid tempo of all of them, and also the most awful; before some redemption is found in the solo the riffs are average and vocals ruthlessly terrible, Mustaine doing his best wailing cat/ozzy tribute. It\u2019s a really terrible song that\u2019s possibly even worse then the horrible interlude that\u2019s Dawn Patrol.\n\nAnyway, a lot of this record is pretty excellent; Take no Prisoners has some fairly awful gang vocals (Urinate them! Masturbate them!) but otherwise is pure thrashing orgasm; fast, super choppy riffs with a rather strange structure to the song that keeps you guessing throughout- not a verse/chorus and more a long build where everything gets increasingly choppy, chaotic and awesome. Continuing this \"choppy and fast is where it\u2019s at\" theme, Poison was The Cure is quality; slow bass intro (pretty sure DooM ripped this off?) gives way to massive hammer on riff times before Friedman goes crazy. He\u2019s in rare form on this album; shredding up a total storm- consistently fast and pretty technical but always fairly melodic and purposeful. I\u2019d say that based on my \"extensive\" (haha) knowledge of thrash this has the best lead guitars of any thrash album. People are always pretty keen on the solo in Tornado of Souls- fair enough, it\u2019s pretty cool; but I\u2019d reckon Poison was the Cure is his best moment here, it\u2019s relatively short and not quite as epic as the aforementioned Tornado, but it\u2019s pretty much a totally perfect solo without a note out of place; lead guitar perfection in the 32 or however many bars it goes for. It\u2019s an ideal mix of speed and compositional skillz throughout the album; I wish this dude could\u2019ve played on every single thrash album.\n\nFor 80% or however much of the album, the instrumental work is either faultless or pretty damn close to it. Rhythm section\u2019s tight, Mustaine\u2019s guitar contributions (when playing fast stuff) are of a consistently high quality, honestly when everything comes together it\u2019s a real sight to behold; a glorious, super intricate sort of noise, like a truck carrying fifty guitars and three drum kits rolling off a cliff. The title track\u2019s probably where everything works the best, huge guitar riffs and a catchy chorus (!!!!) holding sway before all hell breaks loose in the last half. The last half\u2019s a bit overlong and repetitive, but having said that I\u2019m a big fan of overlong and repetitive stuff, especially when the riffs are of as good a quality as they are here. Fantastic stuff. If the vocals were as good as the instruments, you\u2019d have an amazing album.\n\nNot to be, though. Those familiar with metal will know that throughout it\u2019s history there\u2019s been a rather perplexing tendency to willingly overlook, or even praise terrible vocalists; Ozzy, that dude in Diamond Head (Sean Harris?), Varg, Akerfeldt, the dude in Agalloch. There\u2019s millions of \u2018em (literally) and I\u2019d say the figurehead of the bad-vocalist apologetics movement would be our man Mustaine. I can appreciate that he was too busy writing awesome thrash riffage here to bother about good vocal lines, and perhaps Megadeth couldn\u2019t afford enough studio time so Mustaine had to record the vocals when he had a cold; alternatively they hired a 13 year old to do the vocals, as a joke. Regardless: they are awe-inspiring in their shittiness. Upon hearing Mustaine\u2019s first vocal line a bunch of questions will undoubtedly enter your mind: Did I accidentally buy/download the Anal Cunt parody of the real thing? Perhaps these are the backing vocals? Will he start singing properly in the chorus? Why did they hire a 13 year old? How is it possible to write such bad vocal melodies? Why didn\u2019t Mustaine bring another vocalist in? And so on and so forth. The vocals are horrible; whiny, nasal tones that struggle to get anywhere near the required pitch, devoid of any power (Dawn Patrol being an amusing example of this; hear Mustaine painfully struggle to get as deep as possible) and just overall terrible on a level you\u2019ve never heard before. Mustaine: he\u2019s an objectively horrible vocalist, no two ways about it.\n\nIt\u2019s a real shame that the vocals blow as hard as they do. It\u2019s a real shame that these guys developed a boner for mid paced riffs. There\u2019s a lot to love about this album- a few songs and plenty of moments of near-perfection- but likewise there\u2019s a lot about this that\u2019s just straight out annoying, and while that accentuates the good parts it also makes them more frustrating. Mustaine is clearly a really gifted songwriter and guitarist, and the rest of Megadeth had a level of mastery on their instruments that\u2019s rarely seen. As it stands though this is good, maybe even great, but not the \"holy crap guys best thing ever\" that they had intended it to be. I\u2019d still recommend you buy it post haste, though.\n",
        "\nBecause this album just fucking rocks.\n\nMany people know that Megadeth are my favorite band, and Peace Sells is just one of the reasons why. This, my friends, is one of the most unique thrash metal albums ever released. The sound here hasn't been replicated to this day, which is a testament to Megadeth's brilliance. This is where Mustaine and the gang really set out to make an album would turn James Heitfeld's wet dreams turn into nightmares. Killing Is My Business was an excellent debut album, but Peace Sells was just better. PSBWB took all the basic proponents of KIMB, ironed out the rough parts and maximized all the positives, while bringing some new ideas into the fray, all at the same time.\n\nOne of the things they ironed out was Mustaine's vocals. His vocals on KIMB were tired and uninspired; not something you'd expect from someone who (at the time) wanted to beat the shit out of Metallica. Mustaine sounds genuinely angry here, something he could not replicate again for 21 years. Another small but not insignificant thing that they managed to turn around was the tracklisting. The tracklisting on KIMB's was a strange affair, to say the least, with the Mechanix and Looking Down The Cross pairing sticking out like a sore thumb. The third thing which Megadeth attended to was the production. Now, the production on KIMB sucked balls, and I actually like the remastered version of KIMB better because the riffs can actually be heard. In Peace Sells, the production is just perfect. The riffs can be heard clearly (except for the odd moment when the riffs get drowned in the drumming.) Its great that the bass is higher in the mix, because there's nothing like the driving sound of a bass to pick up a song. If you are new to Megadeth or haven't heard Peace Sells, I suggest that you listen to the original version of Peace Sells instead of the remastered because the production on the remastered version is complete jackshit.\n\nAs for things they improved on, the aggression stands out. People argue that KIMB was Megadeth's most aggressive album, but I disagree. Peace Sells is more aggressive than KIMB, and in a more controlled manner. Remember children, aggression doesn't need to be wild. Controlled aggression is at times much better than just wild aggression because when your aggression is controlled and held firmly in place, you seem more menacing than you really are. The aggression in KIMB was juvenile and laughable at times, while here in Peace Sells it's mature. \n\nMegadeth brought some new ideas into this album as well. Poland's jazzy solos are more prominent than before, and conjure up a dark and evil atmosphere, even in some of the more \u201cbouncy\u201d songs like Wake Up Dead and My Last Words. This feature of the album is sadly overlooked, despite the fact that the atmosphere was one of the defining points of Peace Sells.\n\nSo far I've talked only about the pro's. What about the cons? To sum it up... the riffs. Don't get me wrong, the riffs are fantastic. But they don't show a lot of variety. Almost all of them sound the same, with the exception of some of the riffs in Good Mourning/Black Friday. Mustaine's riff tank almost dried up in KIMB and Peace Sells drained it completely. This actually explains why Megadeth's first two albums sound so different from the rest. But if I'd have to choose between KIMB and Peace Sells, and if my choice was to be based on the riffs only, I'd take Megadeth's debut over their sophomore. This is just one of the two flaws here, the other being the lack of memorable songs. Rust In Peace had timeless classics in Holy Wars, Hangar 18 and Tornado of Souls. Peace Sells has none. All the songs are good, and the album is very consistent... but there's nothing here that stands out as being timeless.\n\nOverall, it's a great album. The two small problems only manage to dock 1% from the album, which really says a lot about the album's quality and consistency. Listen to it if you haven't, and you WILL enjoy it. To dislike this album would be the highest form of denial.\n\n(Note to reader: \u201cPeace Sells\u201d refers to the album and not the song.)\n",
        "\nThere, I\u2019ve said it. United Abominations is almost as good as Rust In Peace. I\u2019m not saying that the two albums are similar and that United Abominations is Rust In Peace II. I\u2019m simply saying that United Abominations kicks just as much ass as Rust In Peace does. The title of this review won\u2019t exactly endear me to the majority of metalheads, but I have my reasons. I\u2019ve lived with this album for well over a year, I got it the day it was available in Pakistan, and it was also the first Megadeth album I had the pleasure of hearing. I bought Rust In Peace on the same day as well, and I became addicted to both the albums \u2013 at times I found it hard to decide which album I liked more. Before I bought this album, I had a faint idea of what Megadeth sounded like. I had already heard Peace Sells on GTA: Vice City. I borrowed The System Has Failed from a friend and listened to a couple of songs. But United Abominations just blew me away. Rust In Peace did too - it was my introduction to thrash metal \u2013 but United Abominations introduced me to the harsher side of heavy metal. Had I listened to Rust In Peace BEFORE United Abominations, I\u2019m pretty damn sure I wouldn\u2019t have liked it as much.\n\nBut enough with the nostalgia. What makes this album so great in my eyes, other than the fact that it helped me get out of my Iron Maiden and Judas Priest phase? I couldn\u2019t pin-point it before because I didn\u2019t know a lot about metal. I feel that now I\u2019m able to make a valid judgment, even though it might be biased. But hey, there\u2019s no such thing as an unbiased opinion.\n\nThe thing that caught my attention the first time I listened to it was the pure aggression displayed in this album, both from the vocals and the musicianship. Honestly speaking, I haven\u2019t the faintest idea why some of the reviewers here on the Encyclopaedia Metallum think that the album is devoid of any energy whatsoever. If they can\u2019t notice the venom in Mustaine\u2019s voice when he sings \u201cNo one is safe/When I close my eyes/I come take your life\u201d then they have no right to review this album. Mustaine is able to make three lines of laughable lyrics and turn them upside down with his hate filled vocals. When the vocal performance is compared to Megadeth\u2019s 80\u2019s work, it is definitely superior. The sad thing about Megadeth in the 90\u2019s was that while Mustaine\u2019s vocals continued to improve, the quality of their music began to decline. I am 100% sure that UA features Mustaine\u2019s best ever vocal performance, and top top it off, the music is every bit as good as it once was.\n\nMustaine\u2019s vocals aren\u2019t the only thing in this album that is filled with energy. Mustaine\u2019s riffs are excellent and show a lot of variation. From the groovy riffs of Play For Blood and Gears of War to the speed metal assault of Washington Is Next, none of the riffs in this album are second rate. Every single one is made of 24-carat gold, with my personal favorite being the main riff of Sleepwalker. Mustaine also does some great solos, but Glenn Drover\u2019s work tops Dave\u2019s work at times. Burnt Ice is full of great solos \u2013 10 of them, in fact! The solos contrast with the lead work at times, but also blend in perfectly. A unique combination.\n\nThe drum work is solid. Shawn Drover isn\u2019t a reincarnation of Gar Samuelson, but he doesn\u2019t need to be. He has his own style, and he manages to keep the drum work from getting stale and boring. His drum lines blend in with the Mustaine\u2019s and Glenn Drover\u2019s guitar work perfectly. Shawn has to be appreciated for making his drum work stand out while not taking any attention away from the riffs. \n\nI don\u2019t have much to say about the bass except that it too is solid. It isn\u2019t nearly as audible as when it was in Peace Sells or Killing In My Business, which really is a pity. LoMenzo isn\u2019t the best bassist in the world but he manages to provide the glue between the guitars and the drums.\n\nMustaine has received a lot of criticism for his lyrics in this album. One of the people who reviewed this album stated that it shouldn\u2019t be a problem since Mustaine\u2019s vocals have always been slightly juvenile. The lyrics, like everything else, show variety as well. You have songs about Mustaine being pissed off at people (Sleepwalker, You\u2019re Dead), you have pseudo-political songs (Washington Is Next, United Abominations, Amerikhastan, Gears of War), songs about relationships (A Tout Le Monde, Never Walk Alone). The remaining songs Play For Blood, Blessed Are The Dead and Burnt Ice are about online gaming, religion and drugs respectively.\n\nSo, what about the actual music? I\u2019ve delved into the parts that make the music what it is but I haven\u2019t really said anything about the music itself. Well, the music is the same as its parts. It\u2019s varied, and it never gets boring. The first three tracks are all pounding heavy metal songs which at times tend to lean towards thrash and speed. The next five are more mid tempo and groove oriented, but still manage to kick ass. The final three songs are a bit more experimental and are filled with great solos.\n\nOverall, it\u2019s a great album. Probably the best release of 2007 (barring Systematic Chaos and Paradise Lost). The album has a sense of unity, a sense of purpose and a determination that wasn\u2019t present on any Megadeth release after Youthanasia. Mustaine set out to make an album that would kick his detractor\u2019s teeth in, and although others may disagree, Mustaine did just that.\n\nStand-out tracks:\n\nSleepwalker\nWashington Is Next\nPlay For Blood\nBurnt Ice\nYou're Dead\nUnited Abominations\n",
        "\nNow, I'm one of the biggest Megadeth fans in the world, they were one of my first bands, and still one of my favorite thrash acts (when they were thrash anyways) and Mustaine is one of my favorite songwriters and guitarists. But I have a confession to make, I don't like Mustaine\u2019s vocals. I've heard all the 'It fits the music!' arguments, but most of the time it just doesn't do it for me. I think he would have done good hiring a vocalist and just doing support vocals.\n\nWhat we have here, though, is an exception. Liar starts off in what would be a pretty standard way if you've heard the other stuff from SFSGSW. A pretty fast riff, pretty good thrash with slight punk influences. But then, Mustaine\u2019s voice comes in and you hear him as he should be. Dave\u2019s voice is absolutely dripping with venom, and as soon as he starts everything else in this song comes together, and you can feel the betrayal and hate coming from every pore of this song.\n\nThere is, however, some bad (isn't there always). The riffing and drumwork on this song are pretty standard, and of course, since this is non-remastered, you still have the horrible production. The solos do add a rather unique air to this song though, and as I've already gone over in detail, Dave\u2019s voice is excellent. Very underrated track, from an underrated album, and definitely something any Megadeth fan should check out.\n",
        "\nFirst off, I'll get the issue of Dave Mustaines vocals out of the way. Though I think he's a great studio vocalist, he just does not do live very well. Back in the 80s and early 90s he could kind of pull it off with his helium-type voice, but he definitely can't do it now. The reason I listen to live Megadeth stuff is for the instrumental part.\n\nThe previous paragraph also sums up what I think about the vocal performance for this album. Now, on to the big part of what makes a good live album, the setlist. Overall, it's pretty good, the second disc is better than the first, and the first kinda lags toward the end. There's a good selection from TSHF (Their latest at time of the concert) and a good selection of Megadeth classics. I would have liked to see some new things, but oh well. (On another note, there's a rare performance from Risk with I'll Be There)\n\nAnd the performance itself? Other than the already-mentioned poor vocals, it's fucking solid. Every band member knows his place, and the songs only sound a little different than the studio versions, except with the different live sound.\n\nOverall, this is a solid live album, with a good setlist (Always a must). It's a big improvement over the lackluster Rude Awakening, but I'd only recommend this to the bigger fans of Megadeth, this isn't an essential like Unleashed In The East by Judas Priest.\n",
        "\nDave Mustaine has to be one of the most arrogant metalheads this side of Lars Ulrich. I'm convinced he thinks every shit he shits out is made of pure 24k gold. United Abominations is filled with pseudo-clever political statements that lack any sort of subtlety, or class for that matter. I refuse to refer to them as lyrics, because they're more like rants of a burnt out rockstar. \n\nBut metal is never about the lyrics, so I will talk about the music behind the lyrics. And it is here that it's mostly Dave doing what Dave does. The songs are painfully generic, with nothing to separate them from anything else Dave has done post-Rust in Peace. I don't think Dave knows how to write a good song anymore. All he knows how to write are pop songs (as evident on Risk) and as a result, these come off as modern rock with a metal mask on. It's all verse-chorus-verse-chorus-solo-chorus and nothing in between. There's none of the genuine emotion that was conveyed in past work. There's none of the frustrated anger of Killing is my Business..., none of the social contempt of Peace Sells, and none of the epic narration of Rust in Peace. In ten (or even five) years nobody will know what United Abominations is, and nor will they care. It might get the occasional mallcore kid into Megadeth, sort of like a gateway, but once they discover the more classic works, this won't be listened to. Even Risk will be remembered as \"the album where Dave sucked modern rock cock and swallowed\". But this, along with The System Has Failed, and Cryptic Writings, will not be remembered in the years to come. There's simply nothing to jog the imagination, nothing for the fan to hold on to. This is basically Dave going through the musical motions. The riffs are boring, the chorii are boring, and the solos are boring. Seeing as that's all this is, we can conclude it's a boring album.\n\nLike I said earlier, the words suck too. This is just an album made by a bitter and butthurt man (who cried in that Metallica documentary Some Kind of Monster) and should be treated as such. If you're knowledgable to stumble upon Megadeth on this site, you should know not to get this. There's no reason to get it. If you do, I can guarantee it will gather dust. Dave should just call it quits and admit that Megadeth hasn't made anything of worth since Youthanasia.\n",
        "\nThis album is jazzy in ways that Load could never have hoped to be. I think it\u2019s because Dave Mustaine was reluctant even to do this. He was a man who wanted to make nothing less than metal, and he struggled constantly to get his band to agree. Even when they went for a bluesy, jazzy, almost pop sound, he kept it from becoming tranquilizer music by injecting some liveliness into it. When he sings he doesn\u2019t sound technically as good as Hetfield\u2019s nice deep voice did on Load, but it keeps you awake by retaining the snarl from the old thrash days, while Hetfiled just kind of let the listener drift off into la-la land. Conway Twitty could have sung those songs and the album would have been no better.\n\nComparisons to Metallica are inevitable because both bands went in the same direction at the same time. However, these songs are much more interesting to listen to than the drivel of Load. The Disintegrators is probably the only thing here that comes close to thrash, but FFF is a great song that also reminds of their older songs. Almost Honest, Use the Man, and I\u2019ll Get Even sound like they could be pop songs but because Mustaine wasn\u2019t interested in making pop music they have either a hard edge or a sarcastic tone, making them a fun listen in spite of lyrics that are a downer. Have Cool, Will Travel is similar but with the harmonica and some faster, livelier riffs it sounds even better. The lead track Trust is, with The Disintegrators and She-Wolf, among the most traditional songs on here. Even though I like the bluesy/jazzy sound of most of this album, these more metallic songs are the best to listen to. FFF ends the album on a good note, finishing up with a short, fast-paced song after an album that was deliciously varied.\n\nMy version has many bonus tracks. Normally that doesn\u2019t thrill me very much but in this case there are two alternate versions of songs from the album that better than the official versions that made the cut, both because their lyrics are better. The lyrics to the bonus versions of Sin and Vortex are a vast improvement over the dumbed-down tripe that made it onto the album. The alternate of Vortex was the better of the two, because Sin was already an annoying song, even with the good lyrics. The Spanish version of Trust was atrocious, but Bullprick made up for that greatly, and ended the bonus tracks similar to the way FFF ended the main album.\n\nIt was a sort of On/Off album, but even so it succeeds where Load failed. This has life to it, it has a personality, it keeps the listener engaged. This is not an album of near-white-noise like Load. The lyrics are not about how life\u2019s problems get you down, they\u2019re about getting over those problems and actually achieving something, even if it is just revenge against whatever or whoever got you down in the first place. Listening to this, you will not get a sense that the solution to every problem is to lie back and take it like a slave, whining all the way. With a generally dark attitude, this album leaves the listener optimistic and feeling strong. When Dave sings, he sounds like he really wants to get back at someone, probably his bandmates for choosing a direction he disagreed with. Were it not for him, bastardly ego and all, this album could have been at least as bad as Load. If anything, Risk was Megadeth\u2019s version of Load, because the band still made compelling music here. The metal attitude remained a driving force in their songwriting.\n",
        "\nBeing the latest of the big four debuts, this is easily the most developed. After being kicked out of Metallica a couple years earlier, Dave Mustaine had alot of anger, and it shows. Even on the more humorous songs in this album, a sense of anger is throughout. Dave Mustaine pulls out some incredible chops, and fuels every solo with pure aggression, he also commits a fitting, if weaker, voice to the music. Gar Samuelson also provides some complex drum tracks, while Chris Poland adds some atmospheric solos to the mix. \n\nThe first thing you notice when you put in the CD is the piano. Some would think this doesn't fit the music, but Dave quickly shows as it provides a haunting opposite to what the entire album is filled with, anger. Last Rites (containing the piano) seeps this emotion of betrayal and blind rage through every pore, and this sort of emotion is heard on every song except the less spectacular Chosen Ones. Of particular note is The Skull Beneath The Skin. This song is just plain evil, with almost snake-like solos, incredible vocals from Dave and lyrics that explain how the mascot came about. My favorite song from the album, Looking Down The Cross, is from the eyes of Jesus, as he's about to go to the cross and says his last words. This song is clearly the hottest of the inferno, and provides interesting lyrics that condemn the church for all the sins they've committed.\n\nSo far, this has been basically a rant about how good this album is (Don't blame me, it's really that good.) but every album has a negative. And the biggest one is related to the strongest part, the themes of the music. While each song provides a clear representation of its material, it doesn't have much consistency. Skull Beneath The Skin, containing lyrics about sacrifice goes straight into Rattlehead which is about head-banging, Looking Down The Cross goes straight into a song about a gas-station mechanic banging girls (Yeah, that's what it's really about, sounded better before, huh?). This is jarring, and keeps the album from full listens. Two songs from this album just aren't as good as they could be. Chosen Ones just doesn't perform as well across the board, and Rattlehead seems like it could be so much better.\n\nOverall, this is an excellent album, and I'd recommend it to anyone who likes thrash metal. \n\nHighlights: Last Rites/Loved To Deth, Looking Down The Cross\n",
        "\nI like to consider this album as Megadeth\u2019s And Justice for All\u2026.It is by far a superb album. It has some of the greatest songs ever written by Deth just like Metallica\u2019s 4th album. Unfortunately, it seems that while progressing in the musical ranks Megadeth seemed to lose some of its raw edge. Just a chip, not a complete break. This is possibly the album where Megadeth strays form the thrash roots and move into a more traditional heavy metal approach. Songs are noticeably slower but still have aggression. Marty Friedman and Nick Menza prove not to be one hit wonders and the metal community establishes them as masters of their respective instruments. Maybe it is because they stopped taking so many drugs on this album (not NEARLY as much) but a pivotal turning point occurred during this album.\n\nRegardless of a change of pace Countdown is an awesome album. It is absolutely stacked with great songs. Dark and mysterious songs like \u201cSymphony of Destruction\u201d, \u201cSweating Bullets\u201d and \u201cCountdown to Extinction\u201d define the album best. Besides being kick-ass songs it really lets you see the mad genius of Dave Mustaine. Songs about politics, mental disease and environmentalism let you see what was really on his mind when he wrote these tracks. The atmosphere of the guitar can be described as \u201cdoomier\u201d than previous four albums. But let me not describe this record as a slow album by far. Fist pumping, headbanging cuts like \u201cSkin O\u2019 My Teeth\u201d and\u201dHigh Speed Dirt\u201d are nasty and speedy. Fillers are mostly inevitable in every album but Megadeth seems almost to bring a sense of humor to them as heard in \u201cCaptive Honor\u201d. Just listen and you will what I mean, I kind of don\u2019t want to kill it.\n\nThis album can not categorized completely as a transformation album, because elements of Megadeth prior to Rust in Peace are resurrected. Remember how there was not one clean part. Softer more melodic parts can be heard throughout the album. The cause could have been from more input on the writing from the other band members rather than the Daves. David Elllefson role in this album has been slightly diminished and you wont here any parts like you did in rust. Marty Friedman has some of his best solos on this album. After hearing this man will start to appreciate him as an excellent sweeper. Dave Mustaine\u2018s riffs are less focused on his classic Chug-A-Chu and simpler in rhythm. The amps finally do have indication that Megadeth do have mids on their amps unlike previous albums. Nick Menza is not as great as RIP but defiantly solid except for his annoying high cymbal which can get annoying. \n\nIn conclusion this CD gets a 95.Why? It is one of the band\u2019s greatest works but over time you will find yourself forgetting or skipping over certain tracks. Songs like \u201cForeclosure of a Dream\u201d and \u201cThis Was My Life\u201d wane over the classic hits of the rest of the album. Also the tempo changes on this album sound similar. A little too similar. However, that is NOOO excuse on why a metalhead should not have this album. Instant classic pure and simple.\n\nSickest Songs \u201cSkin O My Teeth\u201d \u201cSymphony of Destruction\u201d \u201cArchitecture of Aggression\u201d \u201cCountdown to Extinction\u201d \u201cHigh Speed Dirt\u201d\n",
        "\nEveryone knows that there are some bands out there that know how to deliver catchy albums. That type of albums that don't scream technical playing or fantastic riffage, but are still interesting and appealing. Scorpions, Lizzy Borden, Bruce Dickinson, even The Vision Bleak \u2013 if you want a record centered in catchy choruses just ask them. Well, this was what Mr. Mustaine aimed for with Youthanasia: he wanted to create a CATCHY album.\n\nAnd he was able to make it: almost every song is extremely catchy, especially Train of Consequences and A Tout le Monde. But, my God, he centered ALL the record in the choruses and forgot that there are other things than vocals - there are drums, guitars, bass, and if you want a good record there must be, at least, some good and remarkable instrumental passages.\nThat is what this album lacks: powerful instrumentation. The powerful and heavy riffage is gone, the solos are simplified and so is the drum work, with Nick Menza using too much the AC/DC'ish kick-snare-kick-snare pattern. \nI don't understand what happened - suddenly Metallica released a heavy metal album (the Black Album) and Megadeth changed, instantaneously, their sound, in order to follow Metallica's style. Weird. Why not keep putting out thrash records?\n\nThere are some good ideas here, however, and I don't deny it: the first riff of Train of Consequences is a killer and there is another interesting riff, played during the middle section of the title track. The bass line of Train of Consequences is extremely good too. Hell, the drum beginning of Addicted to Chaos is decent too, and works well as an intro to the song.\nAnother good thing is the improvement of Dave Mustaine as a vocalist. He sounded like a dead old woman trying to sing on their first albums but, at this time, he sounded much better - raw, on songs like Addicted to Chaos and Victory, and melodic on the calmer ones.\n\nIn fact, the album begins with some decent tunes; they aren't metal monsters but are still good. Reckoning Day contains some aggressive lyrics and competent riffage. The vocal performance is very raw too.\nTrain of Consequences is the second track and it is, surprisingly, the best song of the album. The chorus is addictive AS HELL, the solos are pretty good and the drum lines are listenable - yay! The first riff is, as I've already said, amazing. Addicted to Chaos is weaker than the previous two tunes, but it's listenable, and so is A Toute Le Monde, the ballad that the band composed in order to surpass the Metallica's ones (look to the track listing, woow, the ballad is the fourth track of the record, guess why?), but, despite working well, it isn't a masterpiece and doesn't even kick, for example, The Unforgiven's ass. Features a french chorus too, which is rather bizarre.\n\nThen, everything goes downhill. The beginning of Elysian Fields sounds like a softer version of the intro to Set the World Afire and, after it, the song becomes forgettable. Well, in fact, all the other songs are very forgettable, except two: Victory and the title track.\nYouthanasia would be extremely forgettable too, but, fortunately, it contains one hell of a guitar riff, played during the middle section, which is absolutely top notch, very reminiscent of the one on the break of Metallica's Frayed Ends of Sanity. Victory has some nice lyrics that feature many titles of past Megadeth songs and works well as a speed metal take, being, of course, pretty fast and headbangable.\n\n...And the album ends. We have eleven songs, but, in fact, only six tunes are worth listening and, in the end, they aren't that great; however when you have a record full of awful songs, even the average ones sound like masterpieces, you know.\nIf you, after reading this, still want to get Youthanasia, I recommend you to search for the remastered and remixed version of it. The bass is more audible and everything sounds great. It also features some bonus tracks, but, meh, they aren't that great.\n\nOh, there is one thing, though, that rules about this record: the ARTWORK.\n\n38 points \u2013 Meh, not great, not great at all!\n",
        "\nFirst of all, I must admit that Megadeth is one of my favorite bands ever. So, I've been dissapointed with the recent stuff that the band has released. But this is the biggest dissapointment so far. Not even Risk, or the Cryptic Sounds ep have reached such a degree of sucking. Now, onto the EP.\nThis features one song taken from the album Risk, 3 remixed songs from that album, a Symphony of Destruction remix and.. a Holy Wars remix (!).\nThe main song of the album sucks, is a cheesy hard rock oriented song. But hey, it was taken from Risk, what did you expect? Then, you hear a remix of the same fucking song that you just heard. The difference? Is electronic fucking bullshit! Did you think that Risk was the worst Megadeth release? Check this fucking crap. Turning a crappy hard rock like song, into a cheesier electronic fucking song! But this does not end here. Then comes a remix of Insomnia, another crappy Risk song. Forgettable. Then comes Symphony of Destruction. This is another electronic remix. Dave is becoming an expert when talking about raping classic songs (see 2007's A Tout le Monde or the last track on this piece of utter shit). This is even longer than the original one! Ten fucking minutes of agony! The fifth song is a remixed version of Crush 'Em. Another forgettable Risk song. But just when you thought that the worst had passed, then comes a Holy Wars remix. An ELECTRONIC Holy Wars remix. WHAT THE FUCK WERE YOU THINKING, DAVE? You completely fucked up one of the band's best songs ever! \n\nThis EP is worthless. I thought I'd never give Megadeth a rating lower than 40 (Risk, of course), but this is just a crash grabber. A really awful cash grabber. This is utter crap, not even for die-hard fans. Download it for free if you want to give it a listen. I wouldn't spend more than $1 in this piece of shit.\n",
        "\nThis album was unique amongst the collection of releases that MegaDeth set to CD in the 1990s, in that it was a complete changeover in style, yet it still worked quite nicely. Whereas \"Countdown to Extinction\" featured a heavier emphasis on strong chorus, but still contained a good collection of speedy songs with thrash-inspired riffs, this album is completely slowed down and all emphasis is placed upon solos and choruses.\n\nThe consequence of the songs on here is quite massive, other than Dave Mustaine's highly distinctive voice, this is almost like a completely different band. Nick Menza has slowed down a bit and is utilizing the toms a lot more in his beats, and Marty Friedman is tailoring his solos more for dramatic effect and less for impressing the audience with speed. All of this fits together nicely, and gives a fresh and original sound that was not merely unique in 1994, it stood completely alone in a desert of creative desolation. The one release that kept me from hating that year like a passion was this one, which was one of my early CD purchases as a post-grunge metal head.\n\nOut of the collection of mid-paced anthems and slower paced rockers, about half of the songs deserve specific analysis, as they do tend to run together a bit. The opening track \"Reckoning Day\" is probably the fastest song on here, and has a great opening riff that reminds me a bit of Whiplash off Metallica's debut album. \"Addicted to Chaos\" has a neat drum intro, although the collection of fully developed and varied riffs are what push it over the top. \"A Tout Le Monde\" is my second favorite tune on here, pretty much a less repetitive and more melodic version of \"Fade to Black\". \"The Killing Road\" and \"Black Curtains\" both have exceptional leads in them, although I would say that the radio-friendly \"Train of Consequences\" takes my pick for the best solo.\n\nHowever, the two true highlights of this album are \"Victory\" and \"Family Tree\". The former has some great nostalgic lyrics for steady fans of MegaDeth who have followed them since their inception in the early 80s, not to mention some good driving riffs. The latter is my personal favorite for that amazing chorus, in the past 12 years I've never been able to get it out of my head, even after not listening to it for more than a year.\n\nThis album may not sit too well with Thrash fans, but fans of Traditional 80s Metal will like this. Anyone who likes a strong song, with all the right hooks, and a good balance between instrument and voice will not be let down. I proudly give this gem, cut from a mountain of coal that was 1994, a strong endorsement.\n",
        "\nOne of the principle differences between 80s thrash and Power metal is the level of emphasis on structure. Where as Power Metal takes the route of story telling through the riffs and is heavily focused on riff development, Thrash takes a more simplistic route in the rhythm section and instead varies the structure with multiple solos. One thing to understand is that although these differences are a bit subtle, they are noteworthy and are what contrast this album from MegaDeth's earlier works.\n\nDave Mustaine is believed to have been trying to compete with Metallica's Black Album on this release (a band that pretty much stole their original early 80s sound from him), and this is probably the case, but the result has been quite different. While MegaDeth has slowed down some of their songs, we still have some fairly high speed killers on here. What has been changed is the level of melody versus soloing.\n\nThe remnants of MegaDeth's 80s material are highly obvious, \"Skin of my teeth\" is super fast, and showcases Nick Menza doing a rather brilliant drum intro. \"High Speed Dirt\" is slightly slower, but loaded with amazing and equally thrashy riffs. \"Ashes in your mouth\" showcases both Dave's and Marty's amazing chops on lead, as well as the bands ability to pump out an amazing thrash epic.\n\nSo where do the more \"Power Metal\" influenced stuff stand out? Here it's mostly found in the slower tracks, which is a bit unusual. The title track has the atmospheric aspects that can be found on some Gamma Ray and Blind Guardian work, but mostly it's the anthem-like quality of the overall song that push it towards this genre. Good examples include tracks like \"Foreclosure of a Dream\", \"Psychotron\" \"Symphony of Destruction\" and \"Sweating Bullets\", which display this changeover, although they still carry guitar riffs more of the thrash variety.\n\nThe remaining tracks sort of dance around between being catchy and being thrash. \"This was my life\" is yet another rehash of a classic song that Mustaine originally wrote of Metallica in \"Phantom Lord\", although a good bit slower. \"Captive Honour\" has some interesting guitar work on it, but suffers greatly in the lyrical department. Although I do enjoy spoken interludes, this one is just plain comical, and unfortunately for MegaDeth this was not what they were shooting for, and as such it lacks the tongue-in-cheek and lighthearted nature that band like Helloween bring to some of their songs.\n\nTo the prospective buyer who doesn't already own this, \"Countdown to Extinction\" is MegaDeth's second most accessible album if you are a non-thrash oriented metal newbie (Cryptic Writings was the most accessible), but it is still one that can be appreciated by traditional thrash fans. I personally prefer earlier masterpieces like \"Peace Sells\" and \"Rust in Peace\", but this ranks high in my MegaDeth collection. I recommended it highly.\n",
        "\nThis album is, by far, the most controversial of the releases that MegaDeth put out during the 90s. Unlike Risk, which everyone can pretty much agree was a complete parking lot full of dinosaur shit, this album has some redeeming moments mixed into a batter of slower and more radio-friendly tracks and some god-awful attempts to match the dry sound of the alternative rock scene. As such, it is necessary to analyze every aspect of this album so that we can measure the weight of the arguments of the defenders and the detractors of this release.\n\nThe first thing to address is the question whether this is MegaDeth\u2019s Black Album, and to this I answer with a highly resounding \u201cNO!\u201d. The Black Album was a complete renouncement of the thrash genre, from start to finish, in favor of a more down tempo and repetitive hybrid of doom/thrash-like style with some clich\u00e9 and obviously mainstream-friendly lyrics. Furthermore, the Black Album had a stellar production and showcased an across-the-board attempt to simplify what was once a highly non-conventional approach to song structure. This album, by contrast, has a rather obvious collection of pure thrash and speed metal songs, mixed in with a collection of songs that are similar to the Black Album\u2019s down tempo approach to riffing, and some rather horrid rip-offs from bands like Soundgarden and Alice in Chains.\n\nThe first set of songs to deal with are the hold-over thrash tracks that stick out like a sore thumb on here. \u201cThe Disintegrators\u201d is the first example of a speedy song, and other than a rather abrupt intro, cooks steadily throughout. The rest of the thrashing tracks, not surprisingly, are all huddled at the tail end of the album. \u201cFFF\u201d is pretty much a politicized version of \u201cMotor Breath\u201d, it's difficult to grasp the point Dave is trying to make here, but the song cooks quite well. \u201cShe-Wolf\u201d is probably the only track on here that I can\u2019t find any flaws with, it has a great galloping guitar line that is reminiscent of MegaDeth\u2019s glory days in the mid-80s, and the lyrics fit right in with the subject matter found on classic albums like \u201cPeace Sells\u201d and \u201cRust in Peace\u201d. \u201cVortex\u201d mostly consists of a riff that sounds like it\u2019s quasi-Judas Priest inspired, which fits well with this outfit as they pretty much borrowed many of their ideas from the NWOBHM, though the contrasting riff right after the solo meanders like crazy.\n\nThe next collection of songs are the ones that have been beaten up rather badly for their radio-friendly nature, though in themselves they are quite strong. \u201cTrust\u201d and \u201cSecret Place\u201d are my two favorites from this mix as they have fairly inspired solos and some rather interesting musical devices at play, in addition to some rather thoughtful lyrics. \u201cAlmost Honest\u201d is pretty much a metal/rock single song that is meant for mainstream consumption, but this doesn\u2019t really bother me as I couldn\u2019t care less what the song was intended for, it\u2019s catchy and it\u2019s fun. \u201cUse the Man\u201d is basically an acoustic remake of the interlude to \u201cPhantom Lord\u201d with some rather goofy lyrics, this would be a song that I\u2019d peg as mediocre although I did enjoy the fast ending. \n\nNow it\u2019s time to deal with the painful part of the job, the disgusting pile of excrement on here that is occupying the remaining 4 tracks on this album. \u201cMastermind\u201d has two good riffs that are a bit similar to \u201cJump in the Fire\u201d, but unfortunately this song is completely destroyed by some of the most ridiculous vocal tracks ever conceived, resulting in perhaps one of the most absurd choruses I\u2019ve ever heard out of a metal band. If they had dropped the stupid fucking interchange between the voices during the chorus, and just kept the \u201cMastermind\u201d vocal drone, I wouldn\u2019t hate this song so much. \u201cI\u2019ll get even\u201d is a slow, repetitive, and ultimately boring Alternative Rock song with a bassline that was ripped off of Peter Steele\u2019s bass part to Type O Negative\u2019s more hard hitting and inspired 1996 song \u201cLove you to Death\u201d. Suffice to say, all the caffeine in the world won\u2019t keep you awake during this one. \u201cSin\u201d is another song tainted with Alternative rock influences, and features one riff repeated much and varied little, although if you can manage to suffer through first minute and a half you get some fairly decent soloing followed by a more metal-like riff section. \u201cHave Cool, Will Travel\u201d has some solid riffs that are completely destroyed by an annoying as all fucking hell harmonica part. Hey Dave? You already wrote \u201cI Ain\u2019t Superstitious\u201d back in 1986, not to mention that corky blues solo to \u201cHigh Speed Dirt\u201d, these kinds of musical jokes do eventually get old.\n\nThis is the actual beginning of MegaDeth\u2019s musical decline. Essentially this album is 2/3 good, which would make it worth about $9 to the fan of metal. However, if you are a fan of MegaDeth\u2019s early thrash and didn\u2019t like the changes that started on \u201cCountdown\u201d, I\u2019d suggest looking for it at $4 or less, as it only has 4 songs that really qualify as worthy of your consumption.\n",
        "\nDave Mustaine has always to be known of man with quite a temper and after Metallica booted him, Dave was a bit angry and this transformed into the Megadeth debut aptly titled \"Killing is my Business...and Business is Good.\" Dave was out to prove that he was the fastest and the best and there was no better way to start out. This is pure, raw thrash at its finest and a must have for any thrasher and Megadeth fan.\n\nThe opening track shows what's about to come in this album. From the creepy little piano intro to the blazing guitar in \"Last Rites\", this track is head rattler for sure. Chris Poland and Dave Mustaine make quite the guitar team with the perfect combination of Dave thrashing and Poland bringing some melody into it. The beginning of \"Skull Beneath the Skin\" is one of the best openers of any song featuring wicked, crawling guitar playing and the song bursts out into a solo and is one the best songs on this album. The pace changes though with \"Looking Down the Cross\" which is a brooding track and gives quite a scary atmosphere to it which makes it sound like something you would hear at a black funeral, not that I have been to one, but this is what I would imagine it like.\n\n\"Mechanix\" is the track that \"The Four Horseman\" by Metallica orginally was. \"Mechanix\" has more speed to it and would tear the other version to shreds based on pure speed, but a person might like the \"The Four Horseman\" better because it has more arrangements and goes a bit slower, but you cannot go wrong with both. \"These Boots\" is the controversial song on here becausing Megadeth took Lee Hazlewood's popular song and basically made a thrashy, dirty lyric version of it and Lee did not take kindly to it. In the 2002 remaster version, some of the words are bleeped out in this song. I'm not sure if it was like that on the orginal, but that's how it is on this version.\n\nSpeaking of the 2002 remastered version, the album sounds much better obviously. and the raw, poor production can be overlooked because the album sounds so much better and cleaner than the original so make sure to buy the 2002 version.\n\nIn the end, this is an album that should be bought and should be bought right now. You will not be disappointed as this is a shining star in the thrash world. Dave is fierce with the vocals and it translates to the fierce guitar shredding. So buy this. Love this. Get this.\n",
        "\nWith song titles like No More Mr. Nice Guy, Breakpoint, Go To Hell, Angry Again, 99 Ways to Die, and Problems, you'd probably think that this was a very dark CD. But in actuality, while the lyrics are at times somewhat serious, the music remains fairly light-hearted and fun throughout. \n\nThis EP came out in 1995, but most of the original material had been written and published years before, giving the material more of a Countdown to Extinction sound, rather than the post-Youthanasia someone might expect based on the year of release. It's true that none of the songs are metal masterpieces; most of the songs were made for movie soundtracks, so they have a commercialized slant to them. Having said that, the music on this EP isn't anywhere near a Risk level of commercialism, or a Youthanasia level of passivity. Most of the songs have a solid, metallic, even sometimes aggressive quality to them. \n\n99 Ways to Die is definitely the best song on the album, staying fairly aggressive throughout, having a catchy chorus, and having the most memorable lyrics on the album. None of the other Megadeth originals are terrible, though they are something of a mixed bag. Breakpoint has some good guitar work, though it doesn't quite reach it's potential. Angry Again is a fairly run-of-the-mill, mid-paced song, though I wouldn't call it filler. Diadems is one of the more unique songs that Megadeth have done, with something akin to a groove metal riff in the middle of the song. Go To Hell is also a mid-paced metal song, but it has a certain evil charm to it that puts it above many of the other tracks on the album.\n\nWhen it comes to the rest of the songs... well, Megadeth have never been particularly good at covers, and what you get here isn't any better than the covers on earlier LP's. The Alice Cooper and Black Sabbath covers aren't bad, they're just stale. The cover of the song Problems, on the other hand, is just plain terrible. \n\nThis album isn't really going to get you banging your head, but as a short EP it can be a fun listen every once in a while.\n",
        "\nWe all listened to Gears of War when it came out (as part of the OST of the game, to the excellence of which a certain Chacko Khan testifies.) and considering how fucking bad that song was, Sonic Abominations seemed like a more apt title for the album. Cut to March 2007, when samples of Sleepwalker were posted on the net. True, I probably had very low expectations from it but the song took me by surprise. It had all the trademarks of ass-kicking era Megadeth : a buzzing sledgehammer of a riff, that pissed-off snarl that ONLY Mustaine can possibly pull off and some superb lead guitar work. Now, here was hope that there was probably going to be a quality thrash/speed metal offering.\n\nAlright, let\u2019s cut to the chase here. There are approximately 93,846,171,015,101 threads on the internet about how MetallicA and Megadeth and some other bands that pioneered the thrash revolution have sold out, are not true to their roots anymore and \u201cMegadeth/MetallicA\u2019s next album : Do you think they can recapture the magic?\u201d. However, the real question about a band like MetallicA or Megadeth today is do they WANT to make an album like Master of Puppets or Rust in Peace. I mean, it was the \u201880s; these guys had mullets and spandex. That kinda shit gets to you and you make pissed off music which kicked muchos behind (really, fucking mullets!!). But NOW, sitting in their 20 million dollar mansion with a tennis court and an indoor hot water pool and Jacuzzi, it\u2019s kind of hard to be pissed off, right? Apparently not, as Mustaine has proved with United Abominations. I don\u2019t know what that fucker is ticked off about now but damn, it\u2019s worked wonders. Wait, maybe it\u2019s George Bush. I mean, it wouldn\u2019t be the first Bush-bashing album that has been outstanding this year. We already had Ministry's The Last Sucker getting a few kvltheads banging.\n\nUnited Abominations is possibly Mustaine\u2019s best output since Countdown to Extinction. It truly signals an intent to get back to producing the angry, vengeful, neck snapping music that we all came to love Mustaine for. The sound on this album is essentially a hark back to Countdown To Extinction and, to a lesser extent, Rust In Peace in terms of sheer ferocity of the riffage, the intricacy of structuring, blistering lyrical work and most importantly, the fucking awesome solo work, something which has been sorely missed since Marty \u201cThe God of Guitar\u201d Friedman moved out. Glen Drover (ex - King Diamond) fills that void more than competently on this album and Mustaine too, is back in fine touch, pulling off a few scorchers himself. Bass duties are handled by James Lomenzo (ex-Black Label Society) but seriously, who are we shitting here? I miss Ellefson.\n\nOn to the good parts of the album now. As mentioned before, the song structuring and lyrical work are highly reminiscent of Countdown To Extinction, especially on songs like Sleepwalker and Amerikhastan which mirror the kind of elaborate finesse displayed on songs like Foreclosure of a dream and Architecture of Aggression. There's a lot of mid-paced ass kickers on the album such as the title song, Pray For Blood and the rather melancholy You're Dead which might I add, is a dead ringer (haw!no pun intended) for This Was My Life. The lyrics are extremely well written too, mostly dealing with the Iraq war and some Bush-bashing thrown in for good effect.\n\n\n\u201cAnd to beat violence, you must ignore the focus groups,\nYou must send in the Mossad, turn off the BBC, CNN\nAnd don't look back\nRest assured there'll be no more Middle Eastern crisis. Hell, there'll be no more Middle East!\u201d\nYEAH! Go Mustaine!\n\nThere are a couple of clunkers on the album, such as the aforementioned Gears Of War and a new version of A Tout Le Monde with Christina Scabbia (of Lacuna Coil) further emasculating an already limp-wristed piece of work.However, these are only minor aberrations in what is otherwise an extremely ballsy, all out thrasher.\n\nI am not going to imply that United Abominations warrants your undividend attention, or that it is going to garner any significant fraction of of the playtime that Rust In Peace or Countdown to Extinction managed to. Indeed, that money might be well utilized in purchasing the new Evile or Fueled By Fire. However, this album holds a lot of retribution value for most Megadeth fans.Vindication for sticking by the band through the bad times. And for my money, Mustaine finally gets his one up on MetallicA.\n\nOriginally written for [url]http://kvltsite.com[/url]\n",
        "\nThis is one of those records which earn so disputes that I can arguably discuss with anybody because everybody, at some point, is right about it, either that it was a sellout, that it is too soft, too slow, or that it is one if the best Megadeth\u2019s albums ever put out. Thus, it forces me to give this review about it with the risk of dislike some people and agree with the agreeable.\n\nFollowing the course with Metallica\u2019s Black Album, Speed Metal in America went Heavy Metal and commercial at all levels. Gone were the thrashy songs and fast tempos with lost of double bass. Thus, Megadeth was not the exception. With Countdown to Extinction they replaced the speed of PSBWIB and RIP for catchier songs with memorable melodies and radio friendly. This is no bad if the songs are good. Therefore, what we get here is a memorable speed/heavy metal album that will remain as one of the best Megadeth albums whatsoever.\n\nSymphony of Destruction is definitely the best known Megadeth song, its catchy riff and melody got a lot of airplay. The song by itself is cool, simple, without technical parts, the only bad thing to me is the solo, too uninspired, thou the lyrics are good too.\n\nForeclosure of a Dream follows and it is like a heavy ballad for the 90\u2019s. Again a ultra catchy melody, double bass (really soft and not fast at all). The solo is more rhythm than ripping but the song has a good mood.\n\nSweating bullets, as almost everybody said is the bizarre song from the album, juxtaposed vocals, passages, again a catchy riff and a psycho video is more than we can hold, which is good for the 90\u2019s pshycodelia. The song is good by all means.\n\nPsychotron has a very good riff although the pace is kind of weird, again, a catchy melody which stands by itself, actually, Symphony and Psycho were the first two songs I listened to from Megadeth back when I was about 14 or 15 years I guess, so catchy they are that until today I love the band, all because those two.\n\nAshes in your Mouth closes, a fast song ala Megadeth, perfect speed metal and although the speed metal distortion is not really present but the technical skills are. \n\nFinally, the production is top notch and all I can say is that although is not the best Megadeth album is one of the good ones, it was a standard, just like the Black Album, for that period of time and comparing with the even more \u2018\u2019suicidetanasia\u2019\u2019, cryptic and risky albums following, this one still stands in a troubling time for metal.\n",
        "\nPeace aged?\n\nPeace Sells is one of the most important thrash albums of all time. This album changed Thrash metal and even other metal genres. Many bands consider Megadeth to be one of their prime influences. However is it still an album that every metalhead should have? Are you better off listening to newer Thrash albums despite the increased quality of the new remixed and remastered version?\n\nI don't think so. While some songs are a bit bland at times, it still has a couple of the best Thrash songs there are out there. Everything sounds a bit predictable in parts though but there are newer Thrash albums that sound quite a bit more predictable.\n\nThe production does have it's flaws. The guitars have some unwanted distortion when playing higher notes and sometimes the album sounds like it has been recorded in a basement. Not that it feels like you are with them in the basement. Instead you hear just the negative side of being in the same basement as the band. The vocals are the best example of this. The guitars however are always at least above average. Black Friday even has some of the best riffs of any metal song I know and it's not the only song with impressive guitar work. Bad Omen, Peace Sells, My Last Words and Devils Island all have very good guitarmanship. The bass is a bit mixed bag however. There is the legendary opening of Peace Sells, a bit bland bass on the I Ain't Superstitious cover to the very nice bass again in the last song My Last Words. The vocals have always been the most critized part of Megadeth. Some people can't either stand the vocals at all while others think it isn't great but it fits well. I am one of the last group. The vocals on this album are never superb but they just fit pretty damn well. The production helps at times with this but also sometimes makes the vocals sound a bit worse. The drums are the weakest part of the album. Granted metal drumming in the 80's wasn't impressive most of the time and with Peace Sells it's the same story. The drums are average compared to the other Thrash bands of that era. However if you listen to the songs as a whole you will hear that everything does fit together very well. Sometimes the instruments really enhance each other like in My Last Words.\n\nWhat does this all make Peace Sells for the newer metal fan? Well, that it is still a very solid release that has aged well. It isn't an album with very complex song structures or just super riffs and solos but that doesn't matter because it sounds very well this way. Peace Sells is still an album every newer metalhead should get and as it looks now it will continue to be an essential must have album forever. It may not an album that leaves you in awe after you listen to it but you will never get tired of it. I'm giving it 85%.\n",
        "\nMegaDave has put together one of the most economically priced box sets in the history of metal. Kudos to Dave for allowing this package to be priced so fairly, because if you consider other bands such as Judas Priest, or Shit-tallica, or Slayer, you'll quickly learn to appreciate the cost of this collector's item.\n\nOverall, much of what you're going to find in this box set, specifically from disc 1-3, you've heard somewhere before. Most of the obscure tracks have been previously released, just not in North America. Stuff like the Duke Nuke'em theme, or New World Order, were B-side material featured in Japan and other overseas markets. Most of these types of tracks can be found as bonus material on the remastered Megadeth catalogue from the Capital Records roster. That being said, its kind of cool to have all of these tracks now compiled together in one specific package. Furthermore, for any of the true Megadeth fans out there, here\u2019s a trivia question for you...Where were the two live tracks, which were recorded in Wisconsin previously featured? Not sure, well the answer is, they were featured on the home video Exposure of A Dream way back in 1992. Seeing as how these were some of the best live renditions you're ever going to hear of these tracks, it only made perfect sense to include them in this great package.\n\nBut truthfully, the main reason as to why I wanted to acquire this box set was for discs 4 and 5. Disc four comes from the classic Wempley Stadium tour from 1990 while the band embarked on the legendary Clash Of The Titans Tour. This is the tour that pretty much catapulted Megadeth into the realm of superstardom, thanks greatly to the success of their now legendary album Rust In Peace. The band was pretty much at the best of their ability in a live setting at the time. This clearly comes through on disc 4, where the band not only plays to perfection, but even Dave, who hasn't been able to sing the classic tracks in key for many years now is able to hit some of the high notes in songs like Lucretia and Take No Prisoners. For me personally, one of the only downfalls to a Megadeth concert has always been Dave's struggle with the vocals, but during this era Dave had his game face on and performed greatly. \nAlso, this live concert features the band playing some live tracks which are no longer played live, tracks such as Black Friday, Rattlehead, or Skull Beneath the Skin, which as far as I'm concerned are the \"golden oldies\" of Megadeth's lengthy catalogue, along with some of the more notable songs such as Peace Sells of course.\n\nLastly, Disc 5, which is the DVD, is another example of Megadeth at their absolute best. Musically, each and every member plays to near perfection and the listener doesn't have to cringe listening to Dave while he sings songs such as Wake Up Dead or Holy Wars. A fatantastic display of great musical ability is apparent throughout the entire set. As far as the mix goes, hey, Andy Sneap did it, need I say more. The only ever so slight complaint is that after watching this DVD, the viewer is left wanting more.\n\nOverall, this may or may not appeal to everyone, however I think that we can at least all agree that this is not a cash grab, but rather a sincere and honest attempt from one of thrash metal\u2019s forefather's, to release a box set of material from the inception of the band right up to the band's 2004 release. Dave has included the rarities, some demos, some live stuff, and the obscure stuff. What more could a Mega fan want in such a well-priced package?\n",
        "\nWell here we go again. The 3rd Megadeth album in a row where all we heard leading up to it's release was how it was going to be the next \"Rust In Piece\" and the return to the thrash roots this band built it's name on in the late 80's early 90's. Much like the last few albums the first song released (from this album it was \"Sleepwalker\", last album it was \"Kick The Chair\") was the thrashiest song from the album really making you believe this was going to be it. Megadeth was back.\n\nWell once again this has all been a wolf in sheeps clothing. \"United Abominations\" is not \"Rust In Piece\", \"Peace Sells\", or even \"Countdown to Extinction\". Dave has once again fooled us but this time there are a few more solid tracks than I was expecting here although I still wouldnt call this a thrash release. But I will admitt it is the best thing this band has released in qutie some. But lets get the bad out of the way first.\n\nThe remake of \"A Toute Le Monde\" is weak. The original sucked and now it features the singer of Lacuna Coil. It's almost like Megadeth were looking for the type of hit Evenesance had a few years ago with \"Bring Me to Life\" which is pathetic. This is supposed to be a thrash album!! \"Never Walk Alone\" is just a slowed down, more radio friendly version of Tornado of Souls\". The riffs are a dead give-a-way and the chorus is lame. Also on many of the tracks there are goofy political soundclips like on the last album, and much like the last album its annoying. You can already get the message through the music and with these soundclips added it just seems too preachy and over the top.\n\nBut there are a good number of solid songs here that might make it worthy for old school fans to check it out. The aformentioned \"Sleepwalker\" is awesome. Even if it is a re-hashed version of \"Good Mourning/Black Friday\". It is the heaviest song on the album and the epic intro leading into the song works perfectly. \"Washington Is Next\" is another solid song although I feel Dave sings too much in the song. Musically its probably the most technical song on the album. New lead guitar play Glenn Drover does and amazing job on the solos, proving he is worthy for the spot once held by great players like Marty Friedman and Chris Poland. \"Pray for Blood\" and Gears of War\" are both two cool songs as well. Their both mid-tempo songs but they donts seem as soft and commerical as many of the mid-tempo songs the band has been doing these past 13 years.\n\nI cant help but get dissapointed as I once again expected this to the glorious return to thrash that Dave and the record label hyped it up to be. I guess I'm a sucker for falling for it a 3rd time. Still I would say this is than the lastest releases from Metallica,and Anthrax, and probably the best thing Megadeth has done since \"Countdown to Extinction\". I know Dave plans on doing at least one more album and I really hope he lets it all fly next time. He has an amazing band beind him and I know he can pull out another classic. The signs are there he just needs to get over the whole radio friendly thing. Your not going to top Metallica in that department Dave. Let it go. Take the higher road and you'll see in the end you'll be more respected.\n",
        "\nThis album is completely disappointing. The amount of praise it receives is largely undeserved and the hype surrounding it leads to high expectations, followed by reactions of \u201cThat\u2019s it?! That\u2019s what all the big fuss is about?!\u201d The only comprehensible reason why this receives so much adulation may be due to the virtuosic musicianship and the frequent catchy moments. Beyond that however, it\u2019s a crapshoot whether one will find anything else of redeemable quality. There is just too much of a certain attitude about this that inhibits Rust in Peace (RIP) from what otherwise would have been a brilliant masterpiece. As a result of this attitude (which will be addressed later), certain songs seem forced, and the album just fails to unify into a cohesive whole.\n\nThe most immediate characteristic that will instantly grab anyone\u2019s attention is the very proficient musicianship. Every Megadeth member of this era displays an incredible ability to perform whatever riffs and rhythms the moment may call for. From catchy mid-tempo riffs, to lightning-fast thrash numbers. Every instrument is played with a keen sense of harmony among them; never overly complicated and always with a fine instinct for melody. RIP is probably the most technically adept Megadeth album. Unfortunately, it sure isn\u2019t their best. \n\nDespite the overall catchiness and practiced technical restraint, there is a substantial amount of quality left to be desired. Dave and crew simply tried too hard at striking a balance between the technical and the memorable, as opposed to letting it occur naturally. As a result of this, certain songs come across as forced. At times, they even become painfully sterile, and truly test the listener\u2019s patience. Holy Wars is particularly bad at this. So is Lecretia, Five Magics, Tornado of Souls and the over-praised Hangar 18, whose solo-after-solo towards the end becomes nerve grating. In these particular songs, the \u2018Deth crew abuses the power metal-style of melody, and creates riffs that come across as overly consonant. There is just no real distinguishable contrast between each riff to make them truly interesting beyond the initial impression of \u201cthat\u2019s catchy\u201d.\n\nThe rest of the songs on this album will range from average, to borderline greatness. Take No Prisoners manages to live up to its name. Of equal quality is Poison was the Cure and the reasonable title track. These songs actually fair quite well as thrash laced with power metal melodies. \n\nThe reason RIP falls a long distance from greatness is because Dave \u2018n crew placed too much emphasis on writing good, catchy, talent-oriented metal, but not enough on wholly unified compositions. The songs seem to be missing climaxes, build-ups, and interplay between varying levels of tension. Despite the average length of these songs and their complex nature, they feel incomplete. It is as if though the simply did not realize their full potential. The fact that these are professional musicians we\u2019re dealing with here makes RIP even more frustrating. All in all, the songwriting here, while complex and varied, manages to be unfulfilling. Climax build-up and release should have played a much more prominent role than simply writing catchy, technical stuff. As a result, RIP sounds bloated and over-ambitious.\n\nThe main reason why RIP feels forced may have something to do with the audience they geared their music towards. This is the attitude that led to over ambition and subsequent disappointment. They tried to hard to impress any normal bloke that may come across this. Every riff of every song clearly exhibits an attempt to impress even the most casual listener. This attitude is really what restrains this album down; preventing it from becoming a masterpiece. It\u2019s a result of wanting to make a batch of songs for metal heads of all tastes. With an attitude like that, it makes a bit difficult to take this thing seriously. \n\nThere is not much else that can be said about RIP. What made previous efforts such as Peace Sells\u2026. But Who\u2019s Buying? a triumph was it\u2019s relentless pursuit of high quality music worth listening to; regardless of what some fan base might say. It didn\u2019t try to appease to anyone\u2019s taste. It simply surged from beneath the ground and laid waste to unsuspecting ears. RIP finds Megadeth hopelessly pursuing the praise of an audience; as a result, the music suffers greatly.\n",
        "\nYes, I am not the slightest bit exaggerating with the title of this review. I seriously believe Rust in Peace is probably the best album ever. I have lots of albums I really love. I know albums that I listen to a lot that are heavier. I know albums I listen to that are faster. I know albums I listen to a lot that are more technical. Not that all three of these musical traits aren't present on Rust In Peace of course, but never in my life have I heard an album with more focus, better composition, and more memorable songwriting than Rust In Peace by the great Megadeth. And while Megadeth did some excellent stuff both before and after this, they have yet to scale these heights again...this is just absolutely phenomenal...\n\nSo enough flash...why exactly is Rust In Peace so amazing? To sum it up...it is basically everything that is great about metal in a nutshell and more. For one thing, this album is EXTREEMLY heavy. The guitar tone (not to mention the production) is fantastic. Crushing and distorted but never \"too heavy\", creating the effect of a \"blur\" sound *cough*Kreator*cough*. The entire album has a very\u201d spacious\u201d, big sound that is perfect for the sonic atmosphere of thrash (all of you \u201ctr00\u201d thrashers who say thrash has to have absolute crap production to be thrash are totally wrong). The album can be extremely fast and punishing at times but has an equal amount of that as slow, more crushing riffs, some more high register technical riffs, even some clean passages to break up the whole \"distortion\" blur. As a result, you get a very multi-dimensional album, one that never sounds repetitive or boring, and makes it accessible to a wide audience. A thrash metal fan would love it just as much as a prog metal fan...but it's the melodicism and memorability of the songwriting that would make even your run of the mill FM Rock Station listener love it.\n\nThe songwriting achieves the \"perfect balance\" factor as well. This album, as mentioned earlier, has all your typical thrash riffs, but also some more progressive-metal ish passages, and even some melodic harmonies that add even more life to the songs. The songs are all extremely intricate and the riffs weave right into each other...yet the band never looses sight of melody, and all of the songs on here can be described as catchy despite the fact they are quite musically complex. Even songs like \"Holy Wars...The Punishment Due\", \"Five Magics\" and \"Rust In Peace...Polaris\" which follow pretty non-traditional structures do not stray too far away from the original song. Basically this album achieves the perfect balance between melodicism and a progressive influence.\n\nThe lyrics, like the music, is very varied. You have your typical thrash songs about war and politics (i.e. \"Holy Wars\", \"Take No Prisoners\", \"Dawn Patrol\", \"Rust In Peace\") done in typical Mustaine fashion (that sort of biting, sardonic satirical thing, usually from the antagonistic POV) and great as usual, but then there\u2019s also songs that show complete different sides of Mustaine\u2019s lyrical abilities. In this album you will also find songs about the occult, aliens, drugs, ghosts, and, most surprisingly for a thrash album, relationships. All of the lyrics sound absolutely perfect for the songs, and this is coming out of a guy who almost never even notices lyrics in music. That\u2019s how good they are.\n\nThe fact that Mustaine had an absolutely outstanding set of musicians at his disposal didn't hurt the album one bit. Mustaine himself is a very accomplished rhythm guitarist, as evidenced by tons of very technical riffs on this album, the fact that he wrote them all and put them all together is even more impressive, as he did a marvelous job with this. His lead playing is a bit on the sloppier side, but they aren't that bad and are very memorable and serve the songs well. They sound kind of like \u201cbiker\u201d type solos really, somewhat trashy but catchy and well executed shred. Dave's best lead on this album is either the last solo on \"Holy Wars\" or the last solo on \"Lucretia\" IMO. His vocals, many other people have complained about, but I find them to be sort of interesting and characteristic; they perfectly fit the words he is singing (he is much better than some utterly horrid thrash vocalists like Tom Araya and Tom Angelripper).\n\nProbably the most impressive member of the band though is new guitarist Marty Friedman. A veteran of the excellent shred-metal ensemble Cacophony, Friedman's leads are simply masterful. Are they fast? Hell yeah. But they are also VERY melodic and serve the songs perfectly. Not to mention Friedman's technique is simply incredible, one of the most fluid, beautiful players ever, and all this while shredding really damn fast. His legato runs and sweep licks on here really display his trademark techniques at their best. He even displays versatility in his playing during the acoustic classical solo in \"Holy Wars\". He is also, without saying really, an accomplished rhythm guitarist, obviously having to double up all of Mustaines technical riffs. Also on the many guitar harmonies on the album Friedman plays the upper register and keeps in perfect time with Mustaine. A great player is an understatement. Simply a master. It\u2019s hard to pick a stand out solo, their all fantastic in their own way.\n\nThough many may disagree with me on this, the weakest link of Megadeth is definitely bassist David Ellefson. First of all, the bass line on \u201cDawn Patrol\u201d is not hard AT ALL, I am a guitar player and I can play it perfectly. However that he is the weakest link is saying a lot. Ellefson is still a fine musician. His bass lines on here are pretty intricate and don\u2019t just follow the guitars all the time, they are actually audible too. His off the wall bass lines in songs like \u201cHangar 18\u201d and \u201cFive Magics\u201d are excellent, I honestly don\u2019t understand why he downplayed himself so much on Dawn Patrol.\n\nFinally we have drummer Nick Menza, another new addition to Megadeth, and certainly a welcome one. Menza is a masterful drummer, probably the best they have ever had (sorry Gar [RIP]). His has very impressive foot speed, yet his drumming is not all about double bass. All his beats fit the music perfectly and he throws in some truly incredible fills throughout every song. Definitely a very underrated drummer right here. I\u2019d like to see Dave Lombardo tackle all those weird meters in \u201cFive Magics\u201d, or even just play the drum beat for the title song (one of the craziest beats I have ever heard in my life and certainly one of the best). His drums sort of have a \u201cmechanical\u201d feel to them which I like for drums especially in metal, but there is reverb going on which fits this albums very \u201cspacious\u201d production value. Another excellent musician.\n\nThe album kicks off with \u201cHoly Wars\u2026The Punishment Due\u201d and right from that frantic, technical opening riff you know this album is going to be a winner. It continues with this riff for a while and then Mustaine plays a melodic line over it, making the song even more memorable. The lyrics come in with Mustaine singing about what can be assumed is the Persian Gulf war, a religious war going on at the time of this albums release. It continues in this vein for a while but then all the sudden the song comes to a halt, and Marty Friedman throws in this beautiful Arabic sounding guitar solo, and all the sudden the song changes into this absolutely crushing weird timed riff comes in with Mustaine singing in the weirdest way over it, as odd as it is, it totally makes sense for whatever reason. Then the song goes into a slower riff and Mustaine wails over it, with Friedman taking some excellent, exotic solos between verses, at that point you think, \u201ccan this get any better!\u201d, and then it does\u2026after Friedman\u2019s second solo the riff suddenly turns heavy and fast like the first part of the song again, Mustaine takes probably his best solo on the album and then the final verse begins. The melodic guitar line from the intro comes in again and the song ends with Mustaine shouting \u201cnext thing you know they\u2019ll take my thoughts away!\u201d\u2026and you are just left at loss for words. An incredible, incredible track.\n\nThe next song is the ultimate guitar song, \u201cHangar 18\u201d. This song is probably closer to progressive metal than thrash metal, with a strong neo-classical influence even in the riffing, based heavily on diminished and 7th chord patterns. The riffs all simply weave right into each other in the intro and it sounds incredible. The lyrics come in, about the infamous Roswell incident. Then the first solo, by Friedman comes in, which is excellent. This pattern continues for a verse, and then all the sudden, the entire key of the song changes and Friedman and Mustaine get into the ultimate guitar battle. The song has a grand total of I believe 11 solos and they are all totally sick, yet the catchy riffs of the album come in between lead breaks to break up to potential monotony of a solo filled song. After Mustaines epic final solo, the song ends. Talk about head spinning. At this point, after only two songs, you know this album is just incredible.\n\nAfter two ultra-complex progressive songs, the much more straight up thrasher \u201cTake No Prisoners\u201d comes in. This is relatively straight forward compared to the rest of the album, but the riffs are still pretty damn fast and hard to play, after the absolutely metronomic opening riff the lyrics come in, about prisoners of war. The vocals at first are sort of a call-and-response thing between Mustaine and the rest of the band (\u201cgot one chance-INFILTRATE THEM\u201d/\u201dget it right-TERMINATE THEM\u201d, etc.) There is a pretty decent, really fast bass solo, and then the song proceeds into a really crazy riff with Mustaine frantically signing over. There are little guitar fills between vocal phrases. Finally the song calms down a little, playing a simpler open chord riff. Friedman goes into one of his trademark harmonic minor solos, and as this is going on the call and response thing comes back with the songs classic line (\u201ctake no prisoners-TAKE NO SHIT!\u201d). This continues until the songs humorous ending (the entire band crying \u201cSHIT!\u201d). Talk about a face melter.\n\nIf you thought the first 3 songs were technical, then you will be totally unprepared for \u201cFive Magics\u201d. The song starts out with a frantic riff, then goes into a very off the wall but cool sounding bass line, with Menza playing an almost jazz sounding little beat under it. Friedman and Mustaine play a haunting harmony over it twice\u2026before the song goes into it\u2019s \u201cthrash section\u201d. The lyrics seem to deal with the occult, Mustaine speaks of being the \u201cmaster of five magics\u201d. The riff sounds very oddly timed and put together, but it works really well, with Friedman throwing in his excellent leads between verses as usual. Then all the sudden after 4 verses, a very weird metered riff comes in, with Friedman coming in for another excellent neoclassical solo. Mustaine even sings over it, which is even more impressive, as weird meter riffs like this are hard to coordinate instrumentally even, especially with vocals. Then the song brakes down into a simpler riff, with the whole call and response vocal thing going on again (\u201cgive me-ALCHEMY\u201d/give me-SORCERY\u201d, etc.). Then during the \u201cchorus line\u201d comes in another weird time riff, and you have to think \u201chow did they get it this tight\u201d, it is no wonder the band rarely plays this song live, God\u2026then there is a really word call and response thing going on between Mustaine and I believe Ellefson over the songs first thrash riff. Then it goes into a Mustaine solo and ends. This song is just indescribable, all that technicality and rhythmic complexity, yet the song is also CATCHY\u2026this is a the ultimate testament to Mustaine\u2019s songwriting skills.\n\nFollowing the absolute technical workout of Five Magics is the decidedly shorter, more straightforward track \u201cPoison Was The Cure\u201d, under 3 minutes long, not just a rarity for Megadeth but in thrash in general (at this point in time the average thrash song was between 5 and 7 minutes). It begins with a chord bass line. Then the guitar comes in, and an extremely fast riff comes in. This riff almost sounds more \u201chard rock\u201d than metal tonally, sort of like Led Zeppelin gone thrash. Mustaines voice comes in for some ultra-fast singing. The song basically follows this format for most of the song and only changes really during the \u201cchorus\u201d breakdowns. The song ends with a solo trade of, both of which are quite good. Though not by any means the albums best song, it is a good, catchy thrasher that is a nice change from the more complex, long songs that preceded it.\n\nThe next song up is \u201cLucretia\u201d. Like \u201cHangar 18\u201d, Lucretia gives off a more prog/power metal feel due to being played in the higher register. The high register opening riff (which I believe is made up at least partially of harmonics) starts up, then it is sort of expanded on in a weird timed second riff, which is sort of the hook of the song, which is also played in the higher register. Then the vocals come in, and the vocal approach also sounds a little off-kilter, as are the lyrics. The song is about Mustaine finding a ghost in his house and talking to it (apparently his grandmother). After the verse ends there is a bouncy little riff, and then the intro riff repeats itself and goes into the second verse. This same pattern continues into the next post-verse riff, and then goes into another somewhat bouncy sounding riff, and the solo section begins. Friedman\u2019s solo here is decidedly more laid-back than some of his other solos on the album and sounds off-kilter, but fits the song well. Mustaine comes in with an excellent, more shred-oriented solo and then, after the post-verse riff is repeated (and harmonized over) the song ends. A slightly off-kilter but well done and excellent song.\n\nUp next is \u201cTornado of Souls\u201d. Starting with an immediate hooky palm-mute and harmonics intro, and then going into a hyperactive but melodic riff, this is the most catchy song on the album. After the verse riff plays a few times, Mustaine begins singing. Now something particularly interesting about this song is the lyrics. The lyrics tackle a subject almost completely taboo to thrash metal\u2026relationships. The lyrics seem to revolve around Mustaine just dumping his girlfriend and anticipating hard times ahead. As much as a song like this could fail in music like this, it is executed so well you don\u2019t even know; as it is angry instead of whiny (mall metal bands pay attention to this). The rest of the song is relatively simpler and driving, focusing on that one hyperactive but melodic and almost bluesy riff from the intro. There is an excellent drum fill from Nick Menza in here, and then Marty Friedman\u2019s solo. Unlike the neoclassical, exotic style of most of his solos on here, Friedman\u2019s Tornado of Souls solo is decidedly more melodic and simpler, using basic major scale modes instead of say, a harmonic minor or diminished or Arabic scale that makes up the majority of the solos on this album. It is for the most part melodic, though goes into some excellent sweep sections. It immediately sticks in your mind and is just perfectly executed. The song ends similar to the way it begins. The most hooky and catchy song on the entire album, defying every \u201crule\u201d of metal\u2026but still excellent.\n\n\u201cDawn Patrol\u201d, the albums infamous fill track, follows next. It\u2019s not much really musically. Just a pretty simple bass line over a pretty simple drum beat, with guitars appearing periodically, and Mustaine singing in a hilarious deep British accent. Some of the lyrics in here are very darkly humorous and unfortunately accurate (\u201cwith the greenhouse in effect, our environment was wrecked\u201d), but it is otherwise skip-able. Still, they could have done much worse with a song like this.\n\nFinally we come to the album\u2019s title track, the lost song on the official album, \u201cRust In Peace\u2026Polaris\u201d. The song begins with an insane off the wall drum beat but Nick Menza (I can only imagine how long it took him to get it down). The first riff is also a bit unorthodox sounding. Friedman comes in and plays a brief, bluesy fill, and then Mustaine\u2019s vocals, even odder sounding than usual, come in. The song is about nuclear war (the \u201cPolaris\u201d connection is still a mystery to me) and was directly inspired by that infamous bumper sticker that inspired this albums title (\u201cwarheads shall all rust in peace!\u201d). After a few verses\u2026the song suddenly comes to halt, another riff comes in. The only lyric from this point on is \u201ceradication of earths population loves-Polaris\u201d, with Friedman throwing an excellent solo after the first round of this, and metronomic riffs fill in the blanks between. Then with a final set of lyrics, and Mustaine doing a sort of death metal scream under it, the song ends with a sustained cymbal hit. Another masterful song and a great end to a completely marvelous album.\n\nThe Remastered version also contains a song \u201cMy Creation\u201d, which is a decent but relatively uninteresting song, and demo versions of \u201cHoly Wars\u201d, \u201cTake No Prisoners\u201d, and \u201cRust In Peace\u201d, which are interesting to hear, though none of them are superior to the final recordings. Still, in the end, Rust In Peace is an absolutely incredible album with amazing songs, incredible composition, technical, progressive moments, masterful musicianship, and marvelous focus. I can\u2019t say anything at this point I haven\u2019t said about it. It is a must have for EVERYONE. All metalheads of all subgenres, and non metalheads who just want to hear great rock music, this album is a must have. That\u2019s my final verdict.\n\nFinal Rating: 100% (okay nothing is perfect, but this is the closest there is to it)\n",
        "\nSo this isn't thrash or even heavy metal, that doesn't necessarily mean it's bad. The people who think non-thrash equals shit need some lessons in logics, because the only thing that can truly ruin an album is the songmaterial, not the genre.\n\nThe question is whether there is bad material on this album and my answer is: yes there is, but not a lot of it. The only song which really doesn't do it for me is Insomnia, simply because the lyrics suck and the music is too much off the same riff over and over again. \n\nNow I like other music next to metal, so it really doesn't hurt me there are no snarls or heavy riffs present. The reason why I like Megadeth in the first place is Dave Mustaine's voice and his lyrics, therefore there's nothing which will stop me from liking Wanderlust, I'll Be There For You, Time, Crush 'Em and The Doctor's Calling. Why? Because these are good, honest rock songs with excellent vocals, melodies en solo's. I just can't understand people comparing this album with 'N Sync and Ashley Simpson, because it's way to heavy to sound anything like it. 'Rock' doesn't equal 'soft'. Megadeth never was an all thrash metal act, Megadeth IS Dave Mustaine with his inner demons and political opinions, whether the guy is thrashing out or dancing to Russian folk songs.\n\nLike I said before: apart from Insomnia, there are no bad songs. My personal favorite is Wanderlust, which I rank in my top 10 of best Megadeth songs. Honest rock, good lyrics which remind me of Clint Eastwood cowboy movies and wonderful vocal lines.\n\nIf you are openminded enough and liked the softer songs from Cryptic Writings you shouldn't have any problems with this album at all. If you keep whining about the fact it isn't heavy at all, go listen to Slayer (now there's some overrated band) or some corpse grinding black/death act. However, if you are open to quality, 'soft' music, you'll be able to like it well enough.\n",
        "\nThe new Megadeth album was highly expected and has gained some of the highest chart positions for the band in many years. This was surely mainly due to Megadeth active touring in the past three years, their new record label Roadrunner and the dedication of their fans. While many people seem to expect another Rust in Peace this will propably never happen \u2018cause all records are products of their time. With the comeback record, The System Has Failed in 2004 Megadeth surely was a one man band supported by session musicians. The album however showcased some of the most powerfull tracks since the classic Countdown to Extinction, in the form of Blackmail the Universe, Kick the Chair and The Scorpion and you knew to expect something good for the future. With a steady line-up that grew together while touring Megadeth is once again a true band and this can be heard on their latest release United Abominations.\n\nThe album opener Sleepwalker really showcases this statement, all the members seem to have had input in this track with James Lomenzo delivering some well executed basslines in the beginning, good melodic solos by Glen Drover and very good drumming by Shawn Drover, all lead tightly by the brainchild himself, Dave Mustaine. One that really pops into a listeners mind is the fact of this album consists of very different tracks and tons of solos. The songwriting here is very good with some suprising time changes on few tracks and the voice of Dave Mustaine has never been as captivating. The riffing on this album really uses elements from all the albums in the bands catalogue and some new elements have been thrown in as well with some progish vibe here and there. The controversial \u00c0 Tout Le Monde is a good remake of the classic but with a more mainstream rock feel, a good remake but pales in comparison to the original and breaks the more aggressive vibe of the album a bit. The songs are heavy, yet melodic and catchy demonstrated best with the single track Washington Is Next!.\n\nFrom a lyrical point of view this album really has a lot to say. Now the title really showcases only one aspect of the album which is political, but there ain\u2019t more than four tracks dealing with politics. The rest well, some of getting even or revenge, some biblical references, human relationships and the closing track Burnt Ice showcases the tragedy of a drug addict.\n\nNow the production is very good with thick basslines and clear solos although at times the rhythm guitar could\u2019ve been thicker and personally I\u2019m not a fan of the basic thrash metallic floppy bass drum sound. United Abominations is a very good album by Megadeth, not their best work but truly impressive of a band with such a long history of complications. If you liked albums like Countdown to Extinction and Cryptic Writings, United Abominations is almost as diverse as those and this definitely is the most solid and natural release with the classic Megadeth vibe since Countdown in 1992.\n",
        "\nThe post-1991 output of a great number of 80s thrash bands in the wake of Metallica\u2019s hugely successful \u2018Black Album\u2019 boast a consciously simplified and commercialised sound that largely replaces the aggressive, punk-inspired nihilism of their earlier work with a more refined, approachable, and in most cases mellow direction more in line with current musical trends. Following the example of their more successful rival, Megadeth\u2019s sound entered a process of gradual departure from the speedy thrash perfection of 1990\u2019s \u2018Rust in Peace,\u2019 as their subsequent albums became increasingly consumer-oriented. Third stop along this line is \u2018Cryptic Writings,\u2019 representing the culmination of this radio-friendly approach, before careening off the rails with the frankly embarrassing chaos of 1999\u2019s \u2018Risk.\u2019\n\nAbandoning thrash for the most part in favour of a more traditional heavy metal style, though targeted more towards its dissolution through the popular grunge bands of the time, \u2018Cryptic Writings\u2019 features twelve unremarkable and unsurprising songs ranging from around three minutes long to about five. Dave Mustaine\u2019s trademark growl improved over the course of the band\u2019s early albums as he started to sound less like an angry school girl and more like a grown up man doing a childish impression of a goblin, but it\u2019s pretty much the same delivery that\u2019s been used since \u2018Countdown to Extinction,\u2019 as are the default medium speed rhythms and restrained guitars. As the band is still called Megadeth, and is thus obligated to remain a little on the dark side, there are no glam rock piano ballads or overly optimistic lyrics, as the material ranges from short and punchy Nirvana-style generic disgust to acoustic ennui with catchy choruses, and occasional short-but-sweet call-backs to the band\u2019s more energetic days.\n\nSetting the pace of the album right from the start, the single \u2018Trust\u2019 opens with a slow drum solo that\u2019s almost tribal sounding, one of the few mildly interesting touches of percussion on the album, before atmospheric backing keyboards fade in and David Eleffson\u2019s bass clunks slowly along until it settles upon the recognisable main riff of the song, all too soon joined by Mustaine\u2019s crisp sounding guitar. The production job on this album is technically impressive as is the norm for Megadeth\u2019s 1990s releases, the instruments generally filling out the sound-scape with a little help from backing keyboards, making a radical departure from the dirty, echoed sound of their earlier work. As one of the longest songs on the album, still coming in at under six minutes, the song diversifies slightly through a soft, whispered middle section featuring acoustic guitar before the chorus returns and Mustaine is permitted to go off on one with his guitar solos. Overall, a song that owes far more to Black Sabbath or Nirvana than 80s Megadeth, but competently executed and inoffensive, much like the majority of the music to follow. The driving riff of the poppier \u2018Almost Honest\u2019 sounds even more like straight-up rock as the song leaves heavy metal behind, and this piece generally sounds a little outdated, even down to the slower, blues-inspired guitar solo. The main chorus is annoyingly and inappropriately upbeat and bouncy for the subject matter, but there\u2019s really very little of interest here.\n\nPerhaps taking note of this disappointing descent into archaism, the much improved \u2018Use the Man\u2019 begins with the conceit of a jolly sounding soft rock song in the vein of the Beatles being piped through a tinny radio, a trick used earlier in the band\u2019s career with the album \u2018So Far, So Good... So What?\u2019 which proceeded to explode into a fast thrash riff. Here, the change is less cataclysmic and more mournful, as Mustaine takes over with an acoustic guitar, creating a spartan atmosphere for this tirade on drug use. Mustaine sounds like Kurt Cobain on this one, and his electric riffs, when they kick in, sound a lot like Sabbath. The climax of this song makes it all worthwhile, as strange sound effects beckon an unprecedented faster take on the song for the final forty seconds, which has the adverse effect of making the rest seem like a waste of time. It may be my own preference for the band\u2019s earlier catalogue taking over, but the faster sections of this album, the really fast sections that stand out as being fast and full of energy, always prove to be my favourite parts.\n\nAlthough the material thus far has been far from extraordinary, the songs have generally been individual and memorable enough to be credited as such. On an album of twelve very similar sounding songs, a useless filler track was going to come along sooner or later, and \u2018Mastermind\u2019 proves to be the first. Again sounding more like a traditional rock song than anything contemporary, perhaps revealing Mustaine\u2019s own listening habits as Metallica would later unveil their taste for hard rock and country on \u2018Load,\u2019 this song does little more than take up three and a half minutes between two much more worthwhile songs, and not only because of Mustaine\u2019s unintentional self-parody in the chorus, performing his snarling monster impressions for no reason. The only factor in this song\u2019s credit is the guitar solo, which lasts a little longer and harks back to the slower solo sections of the classic \u2018Rust in Peace\u2019 album, something that continues in the very Megadeth-sounding \u2018The Disintegrators.\u2019 This shorter piece is the fastest on the album so far, lacking some of the volume and power of early Megadeth but still generating enough energy in the fast delivery of the chorus that Mustaine occasionally forgets to shout along in time. Even if it fades from memory after the disc is ejected, this song will at least, perhaps, cause the listener to think \u2018there was quite a good fast one somewhere around track five.\u2019\n\n\u2018I\u2019ll Get Even\u2019 returns to pop territory a little, with the most obvious \u2018beat\u2019 of the album and a slow, sing-along chorus, but for once it\u2019s done exactly right. The lyrics of insomnia and depression are perfectly suited to Mustaine\u2019s off-sounding vocals, almost spoken word but still somehow managing to bridge a gap between rasping and singing, while the cool, slow guitar riffs are complemented by refreshingly unusual cow bells. This one stood out significantly on my last listen, even if it doesn\u2019t sound as traditionally \u2018Megadethy\u2019 as the previous offering. Sadly, it\u2019s time for another piece of filler, this time with a second-rate replica of \u2018Trust\u2019 that I keep expecting to descend back into that opening riff of the album. Mustaine continues to use the same vocal delivery as \u2018I\u2019ll Get Even,\u2019 interspersing spoken word between guitar chords, but it sounds a lot more formulaic this time around. \u2018A Secret Place\u2019 is one of the most repetitive songs on the album, and pop-oriented again in the vein of \u2018Almost Honest\u2019 and \u2018I\u2019ll Get Even,\u2019 but is weirdly my favourite of the lot. After the opening \u2018THX digitally mastered\u2019-sounding build-up comes an Eastern-sounding melody that lasts throughout the whole song, occasionally transferred between instruments if Mustaine needs to do a bit of a solo. It\u2019s far from being a perfect song, ending frustratingly soon before heading off in interesting directions, but still individual enough to stand out.\n\nIn a seemingly deliberate reaffirmation of Megadeth\u2019s political edge after all the wussy stuff, the band unwisely start the final third of the album with the mostly irritating \u2018Have Cool, Will Travel.\u2019 As the stupid title suggests, this is something of an unusual song, featuring harmonica and piano sections, but is primarily a very tired sounding blend of knock-off Sabbath riffs and unimaginative \u2018nothing\u2019s getting done\u2019 and \u2018point the finger\u2019 accusations. Things look up with \u2018She-Wolf,\u2019 likely my favourite song on the album and a fine return to form, opening with a scratchy thrash riff that only increases to blistering speed as the music continues. With lyrics concerning the \u2018mother of all that is evil,\u2019 this is a great metal song in the classic tradition, even going out on a dual lead guitar section that would sound fairly run-of-the-mill on an Iron Maiden album, but really shines out here. The next song \u2018Vortex\u2019 continues in the same style, but can\u2019t really keep up with the pace, acting as the filler for this final heavy metal third of the album, and sounding oddly long despite only lasting for three and a half minutes. The final track, enigmatically titled \u2018FFF\u2019 which the chorus reveals, disappointingly, to be merely \u2018Fight For Freedom\u2019 rather than anything more risqu\u00e9, is an average but enjoyable return to Megadeth\u2019s roots as a punk-thrash band, though the uncertain lyrics \u2013 eventually arriving at \u2018fight for anything\u2019\u2013 reveal the naivety of this early, nihilistic attitude. Sounding much like Metallica\u2019s \u2018Motorbreath,\u2019 written when Mustaine was still a primary songwriter before that band started releasing albums, this nevertheless feels more nostalgic than genuine.\n\nThe desperation for radio/MTV attention permeates the entire album, and it\u2019s clear that the formerly talented and experimental musicians, particularly lead guitarist Marty Friedman, face imposing restrictions on their originality due to Mustaine\u2019s self-confessed desire \u2018for that Number One record I so badly needed,\u2019 admitted in the album booklet (it would only get to Number Ten). \u2018Cryptic Writings\u2019 is still currently the last Megadeth album to sell comparatively well, showing that the recent return to form with this year\u2019s \u2018United Abominations\u2019 may not be what the public are into so long after the band\u2019s heyday, but at least the band can satisfy and win back its large and loyal fan base.\n\n\u2018She-Wolf\u2019 is perhaps the only song on here to live up to fan expectations, though \u2018Trust,\u2019 \u2018I\u2019ll Get Even\u2019 and the last thirty seconds of \u2018Use the Man\u2019 manage to be fairly successful examples of what the band were aiming for at this period; sadly, the majority of the album sounds weak in comparison. \u2018Cryptic Writings\u2019 favours clich\u00e9d emotional lyrics and weakly abstract political themes over the more specifically targeted anarchy the band are more famous for, and no amount of irrelevantly mysterious cover art can satiate disappointed long-time fans.\n",
        "\nAmong the endless sea of forgotten shorter duration releases in the MegaDeth\u2019s back catalog sits this, the only example to date where Mustaine was going it alone on the guitar. Although this is not the most thrash worthy song ever put out by this outfit, it is nonetheless an interesting remake of the Alice Cooper classic, complete with a similarly aggressive vocal delivery and a hell of a lot more guitar distortion. I can remember watching the music video in seeing a sense of disillusion in Dave\u2019s face in between the cuts to scenes of his child equivalent storming out of his house or the scenes from Shocker, most likely as this was during one of the lowest points in Dave\u2019s career personally.\n\nAlthough MegaDeth gets the job done on here, something happens after the song ends that no one would have predicted, they get their asses handed to them by a thrash outfit that was younger and hungrier than they were at that time. Dead On\u2019s contribution to the release, aptly titled \u201cDifferent Breed\u201d, wipes the floor with everything else to be found on here and probably everything on the full Shocker soundtrack, blazing away with full riffs ahead. Even though more than a minute of classic thrash riffing and breakdown sections has been ripped from this amazing song in order to make it more radio friendly, a travesty against man and beast alike, it still kicks your ass three ways from yesterday.\n\nThe third track by Dangerous Toys, which rounds out this album, has a more glam vibe to it. Just picture either Ratt or Krokus with slightly more attitude and you\u2019ll get the picture; it doesn\u2019t take anything away from the other 2 songs, but it\u2019s not nearly as metal as they are. In fact, I\u2019m of a mind to argue that Vic should be taken off the cover of this release if a special edition of it ever pops up the future and be replaced with the members of Dead On escorting Dave Mustaine to the injury recovery room at a hospital for a period of recuperation after the beating he took on here.\n\nIf you are a fan of thrash and MegaDeth and you somehow track down this obvious rarity, it would be worthy picking up if you were unable to get MegaDeth\u2019s \u201cHidden Treasures\u201d, which contained the featured song on here, and if for some reason you are not inclined to purchase Dead On\u2019s full length release, although I can\u2019t imagine why you wouldn\u2019t.\n",
        "\nMegadeth hit it big in the \"mainstream\" metal world with the release of Countdown to Extinction and everyone was just waiting to see what direction Megadeth would head next. Would they move in a more general metal direction or would they revert back to their no holds thrash sound again? Once one listens to Youthanasia it's pretty easy to hear that they continue down the Classic Metal path.\n\nThis isn't a bad concept at all. Megadeth prove that they are able to write under this approach and write it well. There are some very catchy songs on Youthanasia that don't lose the technicality or heaviness. Youthanasia proves that one can write great songs without compromising validity.\n\nDave and Marty take their guitar abilities back a few steps for Youthanasia. Although its not balls out speed and tech work, they do play wonderfully catchy riffs intermixed with some amazing solos and leads. There are some new concepts that Megadeth try out on this album, like chunkier riffs (the awesome train imitating riff in \"Train of Consequences\") and new timing concepts. There are some great time changes on this album and Megadeth did seem to discover the concept of negative space. That sometimes it's the silence that can speak. A Tout Le Monde uses this timing concept perfectly and it creates one of the best metal ballads I have ever heard. \n\nThe bass and drum work is also top notch once again with Ellefson and Menza really taking a bigger role in the music. Since the music is slowed down a bit and there is a bigger emphasis on the heavy chunky riffs, the bass and drums do have an increased sound. I don't ever really remember thinking that the bass and drums were anything to blow my underwear off - but they obviously get the job done and do it well.\n\nDave Mustaine doesn't try too much different with his vocals since Countdown to Extinction although as it turns out he does have a wonderful singing voice on the ballad, A Tout Le Monde. There is a less harshness in his vocals than on previous efforts and he does do more melodic parts but overall he does exactly what he does. If you enjoy his vocals, you'll love it. If you hate his vocals, you'll hate it.\n\nOverall this is a really solid album. What is does lack is charisma. It's very hard to explain but it seems as though the album has plenty of great songs but nothing that's GREAT. There is no edge that just leaps out and snags the neck of the listener. It's a solid and good album but its missing that one thing that will make it special.\n\nSongs to check out: Reckoning Day, A Tout Le Monde, Blood of Heroes.\n",
        "\nMegadeth has released a lot of good material over the years. Cryptic Writings isn't quite as bad as everyone claims it to be, although it still isn't anything near to an amazing album. The fact of the matter is that Cryptic Writings is a little too diverse to really be a solid album. Too much variation of the formula led to discrepancies in writing and, in the end, product. \n\nCryptic Writings still has some good moments. But overall as an album it is still one of the weakest Megadeth has produced. There are some catchy tunes and even some good thrashers on it but the good qualities couldn't override mediocrity.\n\nThe guitar work is well played. Both Mustaine and Friedman are amazing guitar players and writers but their love for other genres of music has allowed this album to stray a little too far from safety. Even Friedman's Oriental music influence comes into play on the song \"A Secret Place\". The album does have amazing variety. Some bombastic riffs, melodic intersections, acoustic breaks, and firework solos all grace this album but the way in which they are put together is a little frantic and it feels unfinished at times. Some of the songs are pretty simple guitar structures for two guitar gods (Almost Honest, although catchy, is pretty damn simple). Much of this album is pretty disappointing in the guitar area because listeners have come to expect so much more from the two that this album seems very pop influenced in comparison. The likening to hard rock rather than metal is apparent at points on the album too.\n\nThe bass work is also pretty simplified for a great bassist as Ellefson. Although there are still some very awesome bass lines on the album - its simplicity once again seems to pale in their previous shadow and in the end I felt like there could have been a lot more depth.\n\nThe same problem resides in the drum writing on this album too. The diversity is good in the drum area but the overall simplicity and poor song structure create too many flaws for performance to overcome. Menza is a lot more technical and better than what Cryptic Writings shows for the band.\n\nDave Mustaine's vocals are too layered. Too many layers are present (and obviously present) on Cryptic Writings. I love that he is willing to try a little more singing and variation on his vocals but when there is heavy computer distortion added at times it diverted my attention from the song. It was too distracting from the music at times. He does some pretty good material and his lyrical writing is still very clever despite its change in direction to a more personal aspect. \n\nCryptic Writings will appeal to those just getting into Megadeth because of its catchy riffs and rhythms but fans of earlier material are going to roll their eyes at most of the material. Songs like Mastermind are going to make some fans cringe and others are going to really dig its groove. Personally, I felt that the album was too eclectic to be truly an amazing album. \n\nSongs to check out: Trust, She-Wolf, FFF.\n",
        "\nNOTE: It's hard for me to really review this album. As you read further I'm pretty much going to tear this album apart but that is only about half the truth. In reality, this review is written from the standpoint listening to Risk as a metal album - when really a review should be written from the view of a hard rock album. That is what Risk is. This isn't metal. It's hard rock. And I thoroughly enjoy this album. It's one of the best hard rock albums I have ever listened to. This review is concerned with how Risk fits into the metal world. Thusly...let's begin.\n\nThis album really shouldn't have the name Megadeth on it. Yeah, it's all the same players as Megadeth but really - it doesn't even sound like Megadeth. The MD.50 Dave Mustaine side project is more Megadeth than this. One could tell that Dave was burnt out on Megadeth during the writing of this album and wanted to spread his wings a bit. The writing is still quite good - even if it really isn't metal.\n\nThe guitar parts for Risk are really watered down. Instead of insanely complicated riffs intermixed with lightning fret solos and leads, Risk is full of acoustic breaks, melodic chords and an occasional metal sounding riff. The solos and melodic lines are well performed, but for the talented guitar players in the band this is really kid material. Nothing all that heavy and when there is a nice riff, it never lasts very long and gets dropped. \n\nThe bass work has also been simplified to the point of absurdity. For a metal band, the bass should carry the heavy end of the album so that there is forward motion in the song and album. Not Risk. The bass has a pop tone to it that really is more groove oriented and simple to the point of absurdity. \n\nThe drumming really is the highlight of this album with Menza giving some of his best...well most diverse playing yet. His technicality and diversity are some of the best in the genre and even though this album doesn't have him playing at 180 bpm he does an amazing job at his instrument. There is still a little left to be desired with the writing itself, but he plays well for the album.\n\nDave's voice is still the same really. If you don't enjoy it, you still won't on Risk. And if you do enjoy it he pretty much does the same thing he has before. There are some little differences one may note. There are a few times where he uses distortion on his vocals. Not too often but enough to be noticed. He has tries to use a greater range of singing. From his high shrill notes to spoken word, he hits everything in-between. Nothing to harsh though and his lyrical writing is definitely more personal.\n\nOverall this is an album most metalheads are going to hate. Even I find it hard to justify some of the choices made on this album. If one keeps an open mind to the music and looks at it in more of a hard rock sense then one will enjoy it. Otherwise its better to just stick with older Megadeth material.\n\nSongs to check out: Insomnia, Prince of Darkness, I'll Be There.\n",
        "\n'United abominations' has been described in some quarters as the thrashiest Megadeth CD since 'Rust in peace', and while that may be true, it's a bit of a misleading sentiment. There are certainly a few breaks here and there that approach the Megadeth style of old, but there is no way 'United abominations' could be looked on as a thrash CD. Being no less than their 3rd release in a row to be described with that old 'return-to-the-roots' adage, its refreshing to see that, while it certainly isn't entirely true, Dave Mustaine has at least written a collection of songs that are unmistakably metal from start to finish for the first time in over a decade. \n\nAlong with his new colleagues, guitarist Glen Drover, his drummer brother Shawn (both from the Canadian band Eidolon), and former Black Label Society bass player James Lomenzo, Mustaine has turned out a very consistent selection of songs that while hardly world-beating, are mostly enjoyable enough if taken in their own right. It may seem like setting expectations a little low, but a bit of realism is needed when awaiting a new Megadeth CD. Following their total abandonment of their thrash roots for 1994's power metallish 'Youthanasia', Megadeth's decline was almost terminal. The 2 separate comeback CDs \u2013 one from the pop-rock nonsense that was 'Risk' and the other from a self-imposed exile, were both fair efforts, but were hamstrung by some weak songs and a simple lack of inspiration. \n\n'United abominations' is certainly an improvement on its 2 predecessors, 'The system has failed' and 'The world needs a hero', but at times also sounds quite unimaginative and lifeless, without ever becoming offensive to the ears. Songs like \"Gears of war\" just seem to plod along without really going anywhere, whereas others such as \"Blood on ice\" are in fact really quite good. Definitely the best aspect of the recording, as you would perhaps expect, is the lead playing \u2013 Mustaine and Drover turn out some brilliant solos that liven up plenty of the songs and lift a few from mediocrity to something a little more impressive. The closest comparison that could be made to a previous Megadeth CD is probably 'Youthanasia', with most of the songs staying in midtempo and keeping to the same traditional metal sound. \n\nUnfortunately, those infernal spoken vocals that plagued the 2 previous CDs are still hanging around like a bad smell. While thankfully not reaching the cringeworthy levels of the soundbites on the 2 preceding CDs, Mustaine's insistence of shoehorning in the things he wanted to say in the song but couldn't force into the lyrics, particularly at the start of the title track come across as needless and pretty self-serving. \n\nThis brings us to the lyrics themselves. Mustaine has never been a stranger to political content in his songs, but for the most part he has never come across as being too overbearing and indeed confused sounding as he does here. With the title track decrying the United Nations and backing the foreign policy of the U.S. administration to the hilt, its then baffling to hear his government being described in the same terms as the Roman Empire in \"Washington is next!\". Lyrical content is rarely a big distraction for me when it comes to metal, but when they are this muddled and, in the case of \"Sleepwalker\" and a few others, just plain stupid, it grates severely. Not only this, but it seems as though a great deal of the lyrics were written with little thought to how they would fit into the songs \u2013 often they don't rhyme, or simply don't flow well with the music at all. Often it just sounds like Mustaine is just muttering a speech he has written over the riffs. \n\nIn simplest terms, 'United abominations' is merely a solid heavy metal record that excels in as many places as it drags. Based on the overall improvement over the last 2 Megadeth records (in my opinion, this is in fact their best in 13 years, but that's hardly saying much) and an apparent steadiness in the line-up that has been missing for some time now, it depends on your level of optimism as to what the future holds for the new-look version of the band. Will they continue to build on the progress shown here and perhaps deliver that final classic CD? Or will they continue coasting along turning out slightly above average efforts? I'd bet on the latter, but at least with CDs like this one, no further harm is being done to the band's legacy.\n\n(Originally written for http://www.metalcdratings.com/)\n",
        "\nI\u2019ve never felt like such a sucker as I did when I finished my first listen to this record. Can I get my $9.99 back? In my youthful naivete, I would never have imagined that a decade later my favorite band (a word I use loosely at this point) would sink so low. Put simply, this would be awful even by the low standards of a second tier thrash act. The only reason I haven\u2019t given it a 0% is the fact that many would regard that as mere hyperbole, when in truth I don\u2019t believe it deserves anything more.\n\nI\u2019ll get the few positives out of the way before I go into what will likely be a poorly organized (due to my extreme irritation) rant on how much everything else sucks:\n- There are a few (and I stress \"few\") noteworthy riffs that remind one of what Mustaine was once capable of.\n- When he isn't ripping off his own pull-off patterns from 1986, Mustaine's lead phrasing is, as always, interesting.\n- Glen Drover, while not a tenth as intriguing as Poland/Friedman, can play.\n\nNothing else is positive: you know your record is a piece of shit when a song from a prior record is rerecorded in inferior form and is still by far the best track. 80-90% of the riffs here are, even when pleasing to the ear of a non-discerning fan, not remotely inventive (and in some cases totally inappropriate: see Burnt Ice), and there's nothing to listen to drum-wise. The real issue, though, is Mustaine. At this point, there are three possibilities:\n1) The first four records were happy accidents and everything from Countdown to Extinction through Risk involved substantial help from bandmates/producers with the lyrics, vocal melodies, and arrangements;\n2) the lyrics, etc. have simply fallen off due to the man's disinterest in the subject matter he's now forcing (as proven by the fact that Never Walk Alone, while not a good song, is probably the least offensive track here lyrically, and is not coincidentally the only one to touch on post-CTE subject matter);\n3) he can only write when high on something.\n\nI suspect we're dealing with a combination of all three, and fuck is it depressing. Post CTE/Youthania, I'd have called (and did call) Mustaine one of metal's top five or so lyricists. He doesn't even register now, clocking in even lower than the most derivative death metal acts, who at least know their limitations. The second reason above is the one that most grates on me: I believe Mustaine loves the fan adoration he gets when playing metal, but I do not believe for a moment that he personally enjoys most of the shit he's produced since Risk. Face it people: the man wants to write pop/rock songs, and if his fans would let him get away with it, he\u2019d be doing just that. \n\nAnyway, the vocal melodies are even worse than the lyrics themselves, and are awkward beyond belief. The number one culprit here is the title track, over which I nearly retched. Where were the producers here? Everything about this is amateurish. It's amazing how A Tout le Monde, a song I don't even particularly care for, stands out so much due to the sole fact that the vocal lines actually fit the meter, etc. Vocally his voice is strong, but there's nary a hint of the promise he showed on Risk as far as his range (in all senses).\n\nFinally, the arrangements are, to repeat this term, amateurish, with inappropriate solos laid down constantly in places they have no business being, like an afterthought. There is barely anything approaching an attempt at actual songwriting, and unlike the enjoyable riff-salads we get in some of the more extreme genres, in this case there isn\u2019t even any passion to carry the day.\n\nI'm done. Worst record I've heard, in any genre of music, in at least three years. As the title suggests, I imagine things will only get worse, as a fifty-year old Mustaine continues pumping out recycled garbage based on the encouragement of listeners who seek nothing beyond the mere genre classification of \u201cmetal.\u201d\n\nNow where is my copy of Peace Sells?\n",
        "\nOne of the things that I\u2019ve come to understand about my love for the musical genre of heavy metal is all the controversy surrounding it. Nowhere is this more present than in the case of MegaDeth\u2019s latest compositional offering \u201cUnited Abominations\u201d, which is the closest thing to a return to form for Mustaine musically, although lyrically it may go down as the most misunderstood album by those who are otherwise fans of MegaDeth\u2019s heavily present political ideology.\n\nMusically this is the greatest thing I\u2019ve heard out of the band since \u201cYouthanasia\u201d, and in certain areas surpasses both that release and its predecessor \u201cCountdown to Extinction\u201d in terms of sheer energy. The lead work put forth by Mustaine and Glenn Drover alone blows most of their 90s material clear out of the water, blending memorable melodic ideas with plenty of shred passages, and resurrecting the once thought dead dueling guitar dialogues that this band used to pump out with intrigue. There are also some signature riffs put forth on the first single \u201cGears of War\u201d and \u201cNever Walk Alone\u201d that challenge some of the 80s material, to speak nothing for the sub-par work afterwards.\n\nThe pacing of the entire opus listens like a classic thrash album with a sizable slow spot in the middle, probably the only real flaw aside from a somewhat botched attempt at a remake in \u201cA Toute Le Monde\u201d. We start off with \u201cSleepwalker\u201d, which sounds like \u201cBlackmail the Universe\u201d minus the repetitiveness and the spoken parts, definitely a keeper. \u201cWashington is Next\u201d ratchets up the tempo even more with a crushing galloping riff with a beat to match; some peg one of the guitar parts as a Maiden rip-off, but I don\u2019t hear it anywhere. After \u201cNever Walk Alone\u201d, a song that reminds me somewhat of \u201cIsland of Tornados\u201d, the tempo drops significantly and you\u2019re left wondering where all the thrash went.\n\n\u201cGears of War\u201d the title track and \u201cPlay for Blood\u201d are solid slower tracks that listen like something off of \u201cYouthanasia\u201d, and do occasionally pick up a bit after a while. The other 2 songs stuck in the middle of what would otherwise be a strict thrash album, however, don\u2019t quite measure up. \u201cA Tout Le Monde\u201d puts together two elements that I would otherwise approve of, but fails to recapture the spirit of the original in any way, shape, or form. I can picture Cristina Scabbia\u2019s eyes full of stars at the thought of doing a duet with Mustaine, since it\u2019s more than likely that he was one of the ones that inspired her to join a metal band. Unfortunately the song is just too fast to fit the subject matter, and the ending lead section that gave me goose bumps in the original version has been drastically diminished.\n\nThe closing 3 songs on here take the album back to where it should be, speeding down the highway with the high beams blaring. \u201cYou\u2019re Dead\u201d easily beats the other two, combining together some heavy as hell grooves during the early sections with a blazing solo section that takes you back to the glory days of \u201cSo Far, So Good, So What?\u201d. The other 2 songs that round out the mix are also solid thrashers employing plenty of masterful guitar ideas with Dave\u2019s angry, singing through his teeth sounding voice. If these don\u2019t make you shout out that MegaDeth is back, nothing will.\n\nMany have noted the controversial political rhetoric found on some of the songs on here, particularly those containing spoken sections. Although to many the thought of attacking the UN seems a Neo-Con method of propagandizing the metal masses into the blind patriotism that the current American government seeks from its citizens, this conclusion fails to appreciate the complexity of America\u2019s body politic and that of this entire album. It is somewhat odd that someone would glorify the foreign policy of George W. Bush in the title song and then criticize the proliferation of weapons technology in \u201cGears of War\u201d. In fact, it seems more likely that Mustaine is attacking the UN because it has shared complicity in most of the atrocities visited upon Iraq and several other poorer nations.\n\nThe political message on here seems less in line with the Neo-Cons, who are mostly pro-UN, and more in line with Libertarian hardliners like Alex Jones who regularly tear apart the likes of former Presidents FDR and Harry Truman. The first spoken passage of the song \u201cAmerikastan\u201d sounds more like a warning to the American people about the potential for what the CIA refers to as \u201cBlowback\u201d, while the second suggests that America\u2019s foreign policy has been hijacked by Halliburton. This is not the kind of viewpoint that I would associate with the Corporatist ideology of the Neo-Cons, but if not taken as a whole it is understandable that one would think this album is praising America\u2019s disastrous foreign policy.\n\nIf you liked MegaDeth before the incident that is otherwise known as \u201cRisk\u201d, you will be greatly pleased with what has been recorded for your listening pleasure. Although not a full return to the glory days of \u201cRust in Peace\u201d and \u201cPeace Sells, But who\u2019s buying\u201d, there is far more good to be heard on here than bad. If you don\u2019t like thrash metal for the politics, it\u2019ll be a bit tough to tune out the narrations found on a couple of the songs. If you do follow the politics of the music you buy, try to take this album as a whole before jumping to conclusions about what it is saying. I for one have been waiting 13 years for an album that sounds like this from Mustaine, and I plan to give it plenty more attention before shelving it to devote time to newer purchases.\n",
        "\nI'm kind of in the middle of the road on this one. It's clearly not an offensive album at all, nor is it Megadeth's best yet or any semblance of a thrash album (although I could care less if they made the second coming of Rust in Peace). None of the songs are outwardly terrible (perhaps save for the pitiful remake of \"A Tout Le Monde\"), and overall this album is fairly solid. I think that's the main problem with it though---this album doesn't really do much of anything, or try to go anywhere. It just starts somewhere and ends in the very same place, like a hamster in a spinning wheel. United Abominations is a passable, but thoroughly uncreative and uninteresting piece of work. Mustaine just isn't challenging himself like he used to, he's taking the easy way out and making 'easy listening' metal that virtually anyone can enjoy, blandly faceless and pedestrian. I suspect this is to prove that he can still do metal, but I'd rather him make another rock album like Youthanasia than hear this one.\n\nThe other problem here is Mustaine's insane drive to include his political messages into his music. The music is practically a second-class citizen here, what with Mustaine's drawn out spoken word passages dominating songs like the title track and especially \"Amerikhastan.\" There's really no need for that, since I know I don't listen to thrash metal to hear a political commentary, and I'm pretty sure most others don't, either. It would be fine if he worded these into a more lyrical form as he used to, but for some reason he's content with smothering the riffs with those obnoxious spoken word passages. Mustaine's singing has degraded here, too. It's more like talking than actual singing, a lot of the time, and it just doesn't flow well with the music. It doesn't help that the lyrics aren't really written with many catchy hooks most of the time (there are exceptions, like how the chorus of \"Blessed are the Dead\" never gets out of my head), like essays. If Mustaine has so much to say, he could just include it in the damn liner notes of the booklet, or better yet, write his own novel. Then we could enjoy some of the songs here that were butchered by his monologues.\n\nThe songs without spoken word passages are fine musically, such as \"Gears of War\", \"Blessed are the Dead\", \"You're Dead\" and \"Burnt Ice\", and the two opening tracks are very nice as well with some decent riffs and shredding solos. But not one ounce of emotion is invoked here, not in the least. It's passable and well played heavy metal, but it's just not very energized. Mustaine has always wanted to best Metallica, and perhaps he has done that musically, but at least Metallica invokes aggrivation or anger in their listeners these days, actual emotions, which is still more than can be said for Megadeth. For Megadeth fanboys, this is the shit, and you'll probably enjoy it more than I did. This isn't bad, and maybe I'll even play it sometimes, but Mustaine can do better. Recommended only to the Megadeth diehards.\n",
        "\nI don't care how much platitudinous it will sound for you, but I'm highly amazed that after 24 years of activity, Megadeth released such astonishing album without sound recycled even a little bit. Get the fuck out from your 1990 hole, it isn't R.I.P 2, it won't be, and it's excellent like that. Why should you expect from them to release the same album again? What's the point with listenning to something you already know? Classic remains classic, and it can't be done again, deal with it. When you listening to \"United Abominations\", be sure you won't find any thrash moments here. This is a heavy metal album, with some power metal moments though, but it's mostly sounds like melodic heavy metal. It isn't fast as Megadeth's 80's albums, but this is still a pretty fast album here and there with a lot of technical riffs and solos.\n\nThe production here is flawless, honestly. The bass can be heard loud and clear, the guitars sounds pretty heavy and the drums aren't too much dominant and flows perfectly. Mustiane does a very good job with the vocals. He doesn't sounds worned out even a bit, he sounds fresh and piercing enough when he needs to. Maybe this is his best album in terms of vocals, it's amazing that after forty years he sounds more intensive and powerful than how he was in his 20's.\n\n\"Sleepwaker\", while being the longest track here, sounds shorter than other tracks due to his big variation and interesting composition. It opens with clean guitar pluckings and then comes some choirs and pretty solid bass riffing, then the guitars becomes distorted and builds up intensively until the first verse beings. Daves sings with full heat together with the flowing riffing and gets warmer and warmer in a pretty solid bridge, and then comes another verse and bridge and immediately the chorus comes in and changes the mood. It's a pretty catchy chorus with awesome using of acoustic guitars among distorted guitars, and there is also pretty good using with dual vocals, one repeats the word Sleepwalker and the other one sings different melody, together it's just sounds extremely catchy. The break in the middle is pretty awesome too, piercing riffs and overwhelming leading guitar which brings you back to the technical ecstasy of well known classics such as \"Hangar 18\". What can I say, this is one of their most intensive opener tracks to date and it really makes you feel energetic, \"Sleepwalker\" can be easily one of Megadeth's best hymns at their live shows.\n\n\"Washington Is Next!\" and \"Never Walk Alone...A Call To Arms\" are pretty good continuers to the awesome opener track, as they are pretty catchy and has some very good sweeping sections which makes you wondering how the hell Mustaine can put out so much excellent moments within several moments and sound so seething. The title track has a bunch of well written riffs and again, another overwhelming chorus. It talks pretty much about politics (as the rest of the album) and contains some french spoken parts in the middle which gives the song a bit more realistic sense and makes you think a bit about our world.\n\nAnother mentionable track is of course \"A Tout Le Monde\". It's a remake of their well known hit from 94's Youthanasia, with a slight difference within it's original composition. However, the individual aspect of it from the original track is the appearance of Cristina Scabbia (Lacuna Coil) with Mustaine in the vocals which adds a more feminine touch for the track. It begins with clean guitars and Mustiane sings calmly the first verse, then it gains distrotion and Scabbia comes in as a background vocalist. The chorus sounds pretty melodic with the soft touch of the clean guitars and Scabbia's vocals among Mustaine rougher approach and overdriven guitars, again pretty good variation using which makes this song sounds a bit livelier than it's original version. The second verse is a bit different with some changes with the vocals divisions of Mustaine and Scabbia and the chorus which comes after that sounds amazing again. Then comes an amazingly orgasmic solo and the verse later sounds more exalted and so it's just flows with the chorus and makes you feel an incredible excitement. Overall, it's pretty exciting to hear this old track in a different, more modern form with a bit cleaner production. I don't know which version I prefer, the one from Youthanasia or this one, but after all both of the versions are awesome, and the new one doesn't disappoints even a bit and changes pretty good the mood between the former and the follower track.\n\nSo well, \"United Abominations\" is definitely the best album of Megadeth since 1990. Yes, it's better than \"Countdown to Extinction\", and this is one of the best heavy metal albums I've heard from our currently decade. A must have for each Megadeh fan or heavy metal fonder, just buy it and I'll sure you won't regret. I've listened to it countless times and I'm enjoyes it each time and feels grateful to Mustaine that still remains one of the best song writers in the heavy metal music today. I can't believe that I gonna see them live on July, performing some material from this amazing album...oh yeah.\n",
        "\nMegadeth\u2019s United Abominations, while not a return to their trash roots is still a very good album. Most songs on this disk are mid tempo, with some a little quicker then others. The only real all out thrasher is the lead track Sleepwalker. That is not however to say that album lags in any way. Megadeth have pulled off great albums without breakneck tempos before, and this release is on par with Countdown to Extinction or anything after. Making up for the slower tempos are fantastic lead work from Dave Mustaine and Glen Drover that bring back thoughts of Dave and Marty back in early 90\u2019s. \n\nThis album like The System Has Failed is a return to Megadeth playing just metal songs, no pop songs that were made just for radio like on Cryptic Writings or Risk. Dave returns to form bringing back what he has made his career out of, political songs. For the most part everything after Countdown, with a few exceptions was not political. United Abominations goes back to Megadeth\u2019s early days containing many politically driven songs.\n\nThe best of the best on this album are the first three tracks, and the closer. Sleepwalker is very thrashy with some nice solo work, Washington is Next! is a driving song that paints a picture of America falling out as a super power, and Never Walk Alone\u2026A Call To Arms is very catchy song that is centered around the catchiest chorus on the album. The album finishes with a bang with Burnt Ice. Burnt Ice starts off with coughing reminiscent of Sweet Leaf by Black Sabbath, and for the most part is built around the guitar solos that contain some top notch lead work reminiscent of the Rust in Peace days. \n\nThe rest of the album is also very good but nothing stands out as much as the tracks above. United Abominations, Gears of War, Blessed are the Dead, Amerikastan, and Your Dead are all very good tracks that fit the album very well and give the disk a nice flow. The only problems I had with United Abominations are the remake of A Tout Le Monde, and Play for Blood. First off Play for Blood has some good riff work, but just seems to much in the vein of Crush \u2018Em for my liking. It seems Dave just wrote that one to try to get Megadeth back in sport arenas and I didn\u2019t much care for it. A Tout Le Monde (Set Me Free) has caught a lot of heat from die hard fans as this version just is unable to keep pace with the original. This song just lacks what the original had. The faster tempo takes the melancholy ambiance out of the song and that is what made the original so good. \n\nUnited Abominations is not the masterwork Rust In Peace was, though it is another great album from Megadeth. While I would not say this is better then Countdown, it is on par with it and perhaps their best release since then.\n",
        "\nA new Megadeth-album is always a guarantee for a lot of debate among fans and critics. There will always be people who will only be satisfied with another \u2018Rust In Peace\u2019 and as a result were disappointed by any album that came out since. For me personally, only \u2018Risk\u2019 and \u2018World Needs A Hero\u2019 were shit products, but even those albums had their moments. Megadeth\u2019s latest effort \u2018The System Has Failed\u2019 was to me a great album. Maybe not the Megadeth we could hear on \u2018Rust In Peace\u2019, but \u2013 although I wouldn\u2019t complain if we got another \u2018Rust In Peace\u2019 \u2013 that\u2019s not really necessary either. The newest effort, \u2018United Abominations\u2019, more or less falls into the same category as its predecessor: it\u2019s a very decent Heavy Metal album with Dave Mustaine in top form again. Nothing earth shattering, but nothing to be ashamed of either.\n\nWith that in mind, the beginning of the album comes as a very pleasant surprise. \u2018Sleepwalker\u2019 and \u2018Washington Is Next\u2019 are simply the best two tracks Megadeth has started an album with since \u2018Holy Wars\u2019 and \u2018Hangar 18\u2019 on \u2018Rust In Peace\u2019. \u2018Sleepwalker\u2019 even contains the so desired Thrash riffing that old school Megadeth-fans have yearned for for so long. The great guitar solos (Glen Drover is every bit as good as Marty Friedman) and an extremely pissed off Dave Mustaine just give the song the finishing touch it needs. \u2018Washington Is Next\u2019 is more melodic and packed with irresistable, infectious melodies. Those verses just gave me goosebumps. And as the title suggests, religious or not, Dave Mustaine will always be pissed off at governments in general.\n\nThat\u2019s where the problem starts. And the problem I want to point out is two sided. First of all, it might not have been a very good idea to start the album off with its two best tracks. It\u2019s like wasting the vast majority of your ammunition on your first two enemies, only to find out that there\u2019s a lot more waiting after that. There\u2019s still a lot to enjoy after that, but the high level of the first two tracks is never reached again.\n\nSecond part of the problem is that Dave Mustaine sometimes seems to put his political views higher on the ladder of importance than the music itself. \u2018United Abominations\u2019 has some killer riffing, but Mustaine just doesn\u2019t seem to know when to stop his rants. Way too many spoken words. The same goes more or less for \u2018Amerikhastan\u2019 (notice the pattern in wordplaying in the titles?). It\u2019s annoying. And that\u2019s not necessarily because I disagree with Mustaine \u2013 although I definitely think he exaggerates in the album\u2019s title track \u2013 but I\u2019m interested in what Mustaine\u2019s guitar has to say and what he has to sing, not in his speeches.\n\nThe lyrics to \u2018Blessed Are The Dead\u2019 are extremely cheesy as well. Seriously, the whole four horsemen theme is a tap from which all of the good water is already taken. Especially when it\u2019s done as uninventive as in this song. Musically, the song isn\u2019t all that interesting either. And \u2018Never Walk Alone...A Call To Arms\u2019 is a complete ripoff of \u2018Vortex\u2019 from \u2018Cryptic Writings\u2019. The slower tempo and the song\u2019s good chorus don\u2019t really mask that.the main riffs of both of the songs are quite similar. Not a bad song at all, but let\u2019s just say I prefer the original.\n\nSpeaking of prefering the original...the absolute low point of the album is the remake of \u2018A Tout Le Monde\u2019 from \u2018Youthanasia\u2019. Contrary to a popular opinion (although the ones bashing the song are usually the same people that sing the song along the loudest), I really like the original. And nothing can outdo the original, right? Definitely right in this case. The higher tempo doesn\u2019t suit the song at all and the addition of Lacuna Coil-singer Cristina Scabbia adds absolutely nothing to this version. Maybe some abominable vocal harmonies that are slightly off-key. Mustaine never should have raped this otherwise fine ballad this way. I suspect that letting Scabbia guest is purely based on commercial motives.\n\nHowever, there is still quite a lot to enjoy on \u2018United Abominations\u2019. \u2018Gears Of War\u2019 is a very powerful track and its solo section is probably the finest on the album. Not the solo itself, but the riff underneath the solo is especially something to my delight. It really has this mighty eighties feel and it gave me goosebumps. Totally killer riff fest as well by the way. Another great solo section can be found in the song \u2018You\u2019re Dead\u2019. The ending of the song is pure speed Metal. That solo section may be a little short, but definitely very fine! The song itself is a bit more progressive, but that suits this lineup of Megadeth fine. And \u2018Burnt Ice\u2019 is a nice closer. It slightly reminds me of \u2018Ashes In Your Mouth\u2019 from \u2018Countdown To Extinction\u2019, although the latter is definitely better.\n\nSo now for the hardest part of this review...where to place this album in Megadeth\u2019s curriculum? I think it fits best somewhere between \u2018Countdown To Extinction\u2019 and \u2018Youthanasia\u2019. Stylistically, the balanced mix between Hard Rock, traditional Heavy Metal and Thrash / Speed Metal would fit well on \u2018Countdown To Extinction\u2019. But quality-wise, this album is closer to \u2018Youthanasia\u2019. I think \u2018United Abominations\u2019 is slightly more consistent than \u2018Youthanasia\u2019, but \u2018Youthanasia\u2019 fits certain moods better than \u2018United Abominations\u2019.\n\nFans of Megadeth\u2019s post-1990 work can blindly buy this album. \u2018Sleepwalker\u2019, \u2018Washington Is Next\u2019 and to a lesser extent \u2018Gears Of War\u2019 alone are already worth every penny you pay for this album. It may be a bit of a letdown after \u2018The System Has Failed\u2019 though. \u2018The System Has Failed\u2019 started out with seven stellar tracks. There aren\u2019t even seven steller tracks on \u2018United Abominations\u2019 as a whole. What you get in the form of \u2018United Abominations\u2019 is a decent Heavy Metal album that proofs Megadeth isn\u2019t dead yet. Not even close.\n",
        "\nThis album, along with its apologists, is full of misleading tripe. Anyone with half a brain predicted that this album would be full of references to current world events, the United Nations and whatnot, but this? This is nothing but a tool for Mustaine to vent his frustrations with the world. It would be a different story if he channeled his rage and disgust and used it to fashion music based on that, but alas it is not so, as he is a snob. Worse yet, the political ideals represented by the lyrics and spoken passages are so overt that it practically renders all musical qualities as immediately forgettable.\n\nThere are two outstanding tracks: \u2018Sleepwalker\u2019 has a half-decent riff and a recall to \u2018Take No Prisoners\u2019 at the 3:20 mark at the break, and \u2018Gears of War\u2019 has both a catchy opening (\u201cgears of war\u2026 gears of war\u2026\u201d) and chorus. The reason these are outstanding? No, not because they\u2019re great songs bunched in with a bunch of shitty ones, but because neither of these feature the overbearing lyrical themes which overshadow all the others (the second coming of \u2018A Tout le Monde\u2019 is an exception, but that one\u2019s awful anyway). Unless I bothered to carefully dissect it, the former could be about an actual sleepwalker, so it doesn\u2019t outright force-feed the listener with political garbage. The latter sounds as if Dave, completely by accident, stumbled upon the genius found on such tracks as \u2018Polaris\u2019 from Rust in Peace by targeting warfare lyrically, but remaining somewhat indirect and accentuating the melody and catchiness. There\u2019s no wonder as to why \u2018Gears of War\u2019 was released as a single and \u2018Sleepwalker\u2019 was a playable track on their MySpace. Despite being decent, these songs have practically nothing in common with the classic \u2018Deth albums and even less to do with a high quality of musicianship, especially considering the man penning these songs.\n\nThe other single which isn\u2019t painful to listen to is \u2018Washington is Next\u2019, but as you would have guessed by the title it\u2019s driven by its lyrical themes, discussing direct issues without creatively turning them into actual songs. This is especially true of the title track; it begins with a spoken passage addressing some bullshit I don\u2019t care about, and the rest of it plods along, complimenting the droning lyrics. Listening to this album is like listening to a lecture you\u2019re not particularly interested in: after it\u2019s done, you can\u2019t really recall anything specific despite it having been about a specific subject.\n\nThat\u2019s why tracks like \u2018Gears of War\u2019 work, while the other tracks just do not. The former sacrifices the details of current events and issues in the name of musical quality, whereas the latter are just commentaries without the application of artistic integrity. Songs aren\u2019t supposed to just convey talking points outright without bothering to articulate them in at least somewhat poetically, otherwise it\u2019s just garbage. And that\u2019s the overbearing fault of United Abominations: It\u2019s just a series of messages that aren\u2019t even vague to the listener, and the music is little more than a background that isn\u2019t one bit creative. In summary, this album is bereft of any discernable quality and creativity due to the glorification of what appears to be Dave Mustaine\u2019s opinion on everything.\n\nDue to the fact that the actual music is just there to compliment the ideals and values, the album becomes even worse because it just seems like an exercise of mental masturbation. Megadeth has made zero progress, musically, in the last decade, this outing included. Essentially, this album is a portrait of a bitter man venting his frustrations and blasting everything he hates about the world without even bothering to make music. The music\u2019s presence merely serves as a platter to dish out the verbal excrement, really. Dave\u2019s attempts at criticizing world powers through music are a bit too rich when one considers that he has barely taken the time to construct anything worthwhile himself and expects his fans to pay just to listen to his bullshit. Maybe it sounds like an unfair or invalid criticism because, hey, after all it is music\u2026 but that IS the music, as sad as that sounds. I can only implore you to never, ever bother with this. Ever.\n\nOh, and did I mention there\u2019s another \u2018A Tout le Monde\u2019? It\u2019s like the first one, except this time it\u2019s about as enjoyable as a turd in a bathtub.\n",
        "\nThere is such much gossip over this album that it\u2019s exhausting. Half the reviews I read are not even about the music. Well, all I can say is that this one will be.\n\nUnited Abominations takes off in a dark and thrashy direction. The riffs are techy and fast like on, although not to the level of, Rust in Peace. Many have the attitude and edginess of those on Peace Sells. There are lots of melodic and catchy choruses like on Countdown to Extinction. Dave\u2019s lyrics are extremely political, although he sounds a tad less pissed off than he did in the early 90\u2019s. The rest of the band follows along as one would expect with new recruits joining a legendary name: they follow. The rhythm guys are good but don\u2019t stand out like Menza and Ellefson did back in the day. Glen Drover however holds his own and sometimes overshadows Mustaine himself in the lead department. That\u2019s all I\u2019ll say as far as comparing this to the \u201cold\u201d Megadeth.\n\nNow to the important question: does United Abominations hold its own in a modern forum? My answer to this may seem strange: yes, but because it\u2019s old school. Strait up metal riffs with good clean vocals and tons of lead guitar. That used to be the definition of metal, but nowadays is becoming rarer and rarer. Megadeth are heavy but not brutal, catchy but not radio-friendly. It may be that labels are seeking extremes for marketing purposes, but Megadeth have their legacy to ride on so they can afford to be sonically on the fence.\n\nThere are a few filler tracks on this record, one of which is, surprisingly, the title track. It comes across kind of like something Dave really wanted to say so he shoved it into a song. I might suggest he use his blog in the future for such rants instead of his albums. What totally makes up for this though is the solos. I haven\u2019t heard an album with solos this good since Nevermore\u2019s This God Less Endeavor (and had been waiting a long time before that). There was no fear of saturating the album with them either, wherever a solo can be played, it is, and it sounds awesome. I think this may have to do with their being no let-up in the rhythm section during the leads, keeping heavy even if the wankery draws on.\n\nHighlights are the three first tracks, and the closer Burnt Ice. Since I don\u2019t own Youthanasia, I\u2019m happy they redid \u00c0 Tout le Monde. That song has been pulling my heart strings ever since Dave dedicated it to the victims of the Dawson College shooting at the Montreal Gigantour stop.\n\nIn the end, if you liked The System Has Failed, you\u2019ll probably like United Abominations. Dave is doing a respectable job at reviving the late-80s-early-90s Megadeth vibe while keeping it fresh with new ideas (and band members).\n",
        "\nFor those of us fortunate enough to have had exposure to MegaDeth\u2019s pre-Countdown to Extinction material, we remember a band that was well known for filling entire albums with fast paced thrash material like this song. Songs replete with hard edged riffs, galloping guitar and drum lines, and a nasal vocal delivery sung straight through the teeth of an angry man. Fortunately, unlike James Hetfield, Dave does not need to sing about wanting his anger to be healthy, for he speaks with louder with his overall delivery rather than through a pile of half-assed vocal clich\u00e9s. \n\nUnfortunately not everyone can be pleased no matter how good of a job you do. Some have stated that the principle lead riff was lifted off of Maiden\u2019s \u201cWasted Years\u201d, which is patently absurd. I suppose every song containing a fast pull off pattern on the high E string will also be lumped into this category, because that is about all the two have in common, to speak nothing for the rest of the song which is stylistically much faster and more aggressive than anything a member of the NWOBHM would seek to put forth. I will always have a preference to Deth\u2019s 80s material, but that doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m going to trash newer music simply to make myself look learned and wise.\n\nBut I digress, \u201cWashington is Next\u201d is not quite up to the task of being compared with anything off of Rust in Peace, but it definitely listens like something taken from the later 80s or early 90s. The solo interchanges are impressive, as is rumored to be the case with much of the material on the album, which I am anxiously awaiting the arrival of through mail order. It wipes the floor with all the post-Rust in Peace solo duels and challenges some of the better stuff found on \u201cSo Far, So Good, So What\u201d.\n\nI\u2019m not often one to recommend purchasing singles when there is no bonus material to accompany the featured song, and in this case I\u2019d pretty much say you\u2019d be better off getting the whole album. If you are hard pressed for cash right now and you want to own something from the latest Deth offering, then I\u2019d say get it. If you have the funds, treat this as yet another incentive for getting the full opus.\n",
        "\nRight, let me tell you I totally dig the speedmetal album \u2018Killing Is My Business\u2019, the thrash metal classic \u2018Rust in Peace\u2019 and the melodic metal album \u2018Youthanasia\u2019. I really like a lot Megadeth has done over the years. Nothing however comes close to their album of albums, the thrash metal masterpiece \u2018Peace Sells\u2026 but who\u2019s buying\u2019. How I\u2019ve given them plenty of chances since 1997, buying each new album as it came out, playing it over and over. Some albums grew on me, some are collecting dust. The latter experience is something that unfortunetaly suits \u2018United Abominations\u2019 as well and now I\u2019m really getting fed up with Megadeth. \n\n\u2018United Abominations\u2019 is neither a really melodic metal album nor a heavy one nor thrash metal. It\u2019s all so bloody nice and safely in the middle of everything that I can only describe this as a load of boring crap. I am not going to describe individual songs here since that would be a waste of time. There is practically nothing happening except for a handfull of good riffs, but none of the riffs and melodies are transformed into quality songs. Only a few sparce moments made me look up from my book but it didn\u2019t take long before all got dull again. Midtempo Megadeth isn\u2019t bad. \u2018Symphony of Destruction\u2019 proved that back in 1992. Melody isn\u2019t bad. As said, Youthanasia proved that. But it should be translated into good songs. Just a few good melodies and good riffs don\u2019t automatically make it a good album. Good songwriting comes first.\n\nThere is no real thrash nor is there actual speedmetal. There are no real melodic (new) songs that are as catchy as earlier works. Even the new version of \u2018a Tout Le Monde\u2019 sucks vocally and dynamically. There are just some typical Mustaine lyrics. And NO, there is almost nothing \u2018thrash\u2019 about \u2018Washington is Next\u2019. A few riffs do not automatically make something thrash metal. \u2018Set the world afire\u2019, that was thrash metal! For that matter \u2018St Anger\u2019 has more aggression than \u2018United Abomination\u2019. I\u2019m sorry to say for the first time in 17 years Metallica has defeated Megadeth in terms of aggressive metal. Can you imagine that? I\u2019m really disappointed.\n",
        "\nWith Megadeth it is pretty much always the same every time they release a new album. The band will allegedly be returning to its thrash roots. Everybody will get hyped up about it. The record will be solid, but not the full on thrash metal that was \"promised.\" People will be upset and bash Megadeth for not being tr00-metal4lyfe-thrashheads and releasing Rust in Peace II. And people will complain about the complaining. It's a never ending cycle. With the latest addition to Megadeth's discography, such a cycle will not really change all that much. Dave Mustaine has gone on record, saying that United Abominations will not be Rust in Peace 2, but it might make him forget everything that has happened in between. While I quite enjoy what the band has offered over the past fifteen years, such statements aren't so far from the truth. United Abominations is the best thing Megadeth has put together since Youthanasia. \n\nWith United Abominations, Megadeth presents listeners a fair take on the band's career thus far. Megadeth fans should be pleased with the band's eleventh studio album, as it effortlessly makes the transition between thrash (Washington is Next!) to mainstream (A Toute le Monde (Set Me Free)), and does it quite well. However, the sound stressed the most throughout the 48 minute record is an agglomeration of the Peace Sells/Rust in Peace sound and that which is found on Cryptic Writings. The song which perhaps best suits this combination is the album opener, Sleepwalker. The song opens with a chilling acoustic guitar intro somewhat similar to Good Morning/Black Friday before descending into a riffy thrash assault. The chorus is quite catchy and simple, and while it doesn't exactly contribute to the intensity put forward by some of the verses, it makes for an interesting combination. With that in mind, United Abomination's best song would be Washington is Next which would definitely be far the band's strongest song in, say, seventeen years. With blistering riffs, sarcastic lyrics, a strong instrumental base, and powerful imagery it seems almost destined to become a classic Megadeth song. Particularly entertaining is the lengthy instrumental, led largely by guitarists Dave Mustaine and Glenn Drover. Glenn proves his worthiness, handling the melodic leads with skill and expertise throughout the track. \n\nYet with all this to consider, there are a couple of points which drag the album down. For one, not all of the material is quite strong or consistent enough. Tracks like, Gears of War, Amerikhastan, and Play for Blood are all decent songs. But they don't have the same killer instinct which songs like Never Walk Alone or Washington is Next contain. They're just there, really. Filler tracks if you will. Similarly, a song like You're Dead contains some cool harmonies and vocal lines, but again when compared to a stronger song such as Blessed Are the Dead, it's rather uninteresting. Another irritating part about United Abominations would be the lyrics. Now, Dave will never be among the greatest lyricists of our time, but aside from Washington is Next (which is rather interesting, I must admit) and perhaps Never Walk Alone, the lyrics penned for the album are downright awful. Need an example? Check out Sleepwalker. \"Just taking a stroll / don't go to sleep / Here's some toothpicks for your eyes!\" \u2026Yeah. Amerikhastan also contains some rather cringe-worthy lines, most notably the spoken line \"Hey Jihad Joe guess what / we're coming to get you!\" While Dave won't exactly be remembered for his poetry skills, like I've already mentioned, I do feel that he can do a much better job. Fortunately, aside from the Jihad Joe thing, United Abominations does not really suffer at all from the quality of its lyrical work and generally makes for an appealing listen.\n\nUnited Abominations isn't Rust in Peace 2. It won't end up being one of 2007's greatest albums. So don't get your hopes up too high. But with that in mind, Megadeth's eleventh album is perhaps the band's best in quite awhile. The band's popular thrash sound Musically, the song writing is fairly strong, especially in tracks such as United Abominations, Washington is Next and Blessed are the Dead, and Megadeth's performance is as strong as its ever been over the last few years. The lyrics can be a little dull at times, as can some of the closing tracks, but overall, Megadeth's United Abominations is a very worthwhile album. Pick it up right away.\n\n(Originally written for Sputnikmusic)\n",
        "\nThe hype around the release of United Abominations has been quite astounding. There has been enough press about 'Megadeth's return to thrash' that it almost had me disenfranchised me towards this release. Megadeth are my favorite band and quite frankly I haven't really been disappointed with some of their releases - whether they are thrash metal or not is another case - but I have enjoyed their catalog nonetheless. I was cautious about United Abominations.\n\nTo say the least United Abominations is not all that I was hoping for. A modern Rust in Peace it is not. It is however a definite return to a thrashier form for Megadeth. I would argue that sound is a definite mix of Youthanasia and Rust in Peace. For those of you that are new to the Megadeth scene let me explain all the elements for you.\n\nThe guitar work on United Abominations definitely thrash. It also has retained much of the melody that later Megadeth albums attained. The riffs are complex as hell and the trade offs between Mustaine and Drover are quite flawless. The speed is quick through most of the album and the leads show that Dave Mustaine has not lost his place as one of the best guitar writers/players in the world. There is still quite a bit of groove element to it (hence the Youthanasia element). The solos are back with a vengeance with both Mustaine and Drover giving back to back amazing performances. The chemistry between the guitars is stunning on the album - I didn't realize that Drover would fit in so quickly. To top it all off - I think what makes this thrash album so damn good guitar wise is the clean sound of the guitars. Most modern thrash bands try to retain a good deal of technicality but a lot can be lost in the crunch. United Abominations is heavy but still clean and technical sounding.\n\nThe bass work is still lacking on United Abominations - even though Lomenzo does a fine job - the bass has lacked a good character since Dave Ellefson left. There is a good foundation that is established by the bass work and that seems to be enough for the guitars to flourish over. Really the bass is second string to the guitar work.\n\nShawn Drover is the best drummer to be in Megadeth since Nick Menza. (There hasn't been that many...) His style on United Abominations is quite reminiscent of old-school thrash. There is a good deal of variety in the drum work - Drover can easily move from groove to speed to complexity very quickly. The Drover brothers a very talented duo that are a great addition to the Megadeth line-up.\n\nDave's vocals are still the same. Basically. He doesn't do quite as much high pitched material anymore (age does do that). But his lower vocals were always a preference of mine anyway. He does do quite a bit of spoken parts on this album (United Abominations and Amerikhastan in particular). There is much debate whether or not his voice is even good - but as far as I'm concerned, he is the voice of Megadeth and had it changed much then I would have been upset.\n\nLyrically, United Abominations has been under some heavy fire. The lyrics (although politically and socially inspired once more) are not near as subtle in its application. The lyrics are pretty straight forward if one looks at them as such. One of the beautiful things about this album is the debates I have read online on whether the album is right or left winged propaganda. The fact that people have long debates over the meaning of the lyrics probably mean that the depth of them is more than just surface value. Topics including the UN, war, death, love, and drugs are all covered. Also, the lyrics at times don't fit quite with the rhythm of the music - like Dave's trying to fit in more words than the music allows. Its not often on the album but I caught it every once in a while.\n\nMegadeth are really upping the ante on United Abominations. Although I loved The System Has Failed - United Abominations tops it. The album is thrashier, angrier, and overall more complex musical writing. The lyrics leave a little to be worked on - but they do sound a bit more emotional. Best work Megadeth has done since Countdown to Extinction.\n\nSongs to check out: Sleepwalker, Washington is Next!, Play for Blood.\n",
        "\nFrom the moment I first heard a live version of this song on Megadeth's myspace, I had gained alot more faith in the upcoming United Abominations album and I am more than pleased to see that this future classic is being released as a single.\n\nMany people have stated that there is no hope in ever getting a Rust in Peace 2 and I too believe that we will never get a masterpiece like that again, however this song here is probably the closest we're going to get.\n\nThe opening is a very melodic bit which immediately reminds me of the classic Hangar 18 opening, yes the opening is THAT good. After that Dave's vocals come and and it's backed up by... a thrash riff? Yes a thrash riff, and a damn good one at that. Dave's singing is also in top form, although it still doesn't live up to his whining snarl from the early days. That opening melody is recycled to make for one awesome chorus then we go back to the thrashy verse. The solos displayed on here are probably the best they've done since maybe Youthanasia. The song closes with the music slowing down, gaining an epic feel and Dave's singing turns to talking as he hypes up the conclusive ending... Washington, you're next!\n\nThis is the type of song Megadeth need as a single to hype up an upcoming album, it's probably the closest we'll get to Megadeth of old and it's alot more accessable to a true metalhead than the A Tout Le Monde remake...\n",
        "\nThe singles seem to be coming out of this album like baby rabbits. The third single from United Abominations has reared its head and I was expecting something horrible like another Mustaine- Scabbia duet. But in all actuallity, it's not that bad.\n\nThe song starts off with a decent riff playing that reintroduces itself in every chorus session in the song, but it's not as heavy as it could've been. During the body of the song, a heavier version of the intro riff, plays throughout the rest of the song with the exception of a good piece of soloing work from Drover. \n\nVocals are top notch in the song, probably one of Dave's best since Risk came out, but I'd wish he'd snarl in this song some like he used to. However, with the exception of the chorus, the vocals don't flow very well like they used to in the early 90's and sound broken, if you know what I mean.\n\nDefinately not the best Deth song ever, but it's sure as hell not the worst. Hopefully, the rest of United Abominations, with the exception of the A Toute Le Monde remake, will sound like this and better.\n",
        "\nThe new Megadeth. Will it live up to the expectations? Will it surprise the hell out of me? - A lot of questions turned up when I heard about \"United Abominations\". \n\nI heard the \"Gears of War\" single a few months ago and thought it was acceptable, if quite unspectacular and generic. It was far away from thrash metal and I was already expecting another mediocre 'Deth album with a few good songs and a bunch of fillers. So I set my expectations rather low and downloaded this album to be sure it wouldn't be a bad bargain when I bought it. \n\nLuckily, my expectations were surpassed. \n\nSome vintage Thrash influence managed to creep back into Megadeth, more so than on this album's predecessor. Now, don't expect another \"Rust in Peace\" but a few moments of former glory finally got back into the sound. Some riffs do bear a strong resemblance to pre-1992 Megadeth, coming after you with an almost renewed intensity. Best examples of this are probably \"Sleepwalker\", \"Never Walk Alone\" and the second half of \"Burnt Ice\". The overall riffing could be comparable to a mix of a slight touch of \"Rust in Peace\"- era thrash riffage + \"Countdown to Extinction\" heavy metal. \n\nOh, and these solo sections! Definitely the most surprising highlight on this album. Some of Deth's better solos appear here, and again, the best ones can be found in the thrashier songs. They are usually accompanied by a strong thrash riff and therefore command you to bang your head as hard as physically possible.\n\nAnother plus is the improvement in Dave's voice. His old snarl does still appear here and there but his vocals as a whole improved a great lot (they are actually in tune now) and he certainly gained some strength in his voice.\n\nThe obligatory odd song on this album is the re-recorded version of \"A Tout Le Monde\". It was sped up considerably and features guest vocals by the Lacuna Coil singer Christina Scabbia. To be honest, her participation is simply useless. She sings/whispers a few lines on it and her voice was digitally distorted in most parts, which sounds completely ridiculous. The added solo sounds damn good though, but it is too short (longer solos wouldn't be acceptable for the crowd the song is clearly aimed at). The song isn't as bad as people say it is, but well, it still kind of sucks. \n\nOther than this dud, there is no crappy song to be found here, which is a major improvement over the last couple of 'Deth albums. \n\nHighlights are the aforementioned \"Sleepwalker\", \"Washington is Next\", \"Never Walk Alone\" and \"Burnt Ice\". If you enjoy any Megadeth album after \"Rust in Peace\", I'm sure you'll enjoy this. \n\nJust one more thing Dave, drop the spoken-word passages. They are simply annoying and unnecessary; you surely got your point across. \n\nRecommended.\n",
        "\nWhy, Dave? Why do you made that fucking horrible version with that girl from Lacuna Coil? That's my question. Instead of recording a new song for his upcoming album, \"United Abominations\", Dave Mustaine preferred to record a duet with Cristina Scabbia, playing \"A Toute Le Monde\". This is one of the best classic songs of Megadeth, included on that kickassing record, \"Youthanasia\". Years have passed, Megadeth changed a lot (for worse), and now it seems that Dave just wants to sit down in his room and start counting his money. I don't find another reason for this unnecessary duet.\n\n\nOk, let's see. The song starts good, Dave's voice is OK, the guitars are OK. But at the chorus, Scabbia's voice appears. Damn. Till that point, the song was good, acceptable. But when the girl started singing, all turned into POP music. Yes, it is. POP music. Megadeth had some 'slides' on their repertoire, but I think this is the lowest point of their whole career. The rest of the song is similar to the original, but with Scabbia singing in some parts, a fact that takes the 95% of the blame of the low quality of this revisited version. \n\n\nWell, this song sucks, literally. I don't know if \"UA\" will be better or worse than this (well, worse than this is pretty hard), but this turned inmediatly in a song to skip.\n",
        "\nThe first single offering off the \u201cUnited Abominations\u201d release, MegaDeth\u2019s \u201cGears of War\u201d is both indicative of the character of that album yet deceptive in many ways. While the LP it comes from is a much faster and harder edged listen than \u201cThe System has failed\u201d, this song is among the most mid-tempo and subdued of the fold. The riffs are in good order, as is Mustaine\u2019s vocal delivery, but the general feel of the song is more in line with the moderately paced rockers that Judas Priest was pumping out in the earlier 80s. \n\nThe intro to the song has an anthem like quality to it, somewhat similar to the military march intro to \u201cInto the lungs of hell\u201d, but with a more ominous quality to it. The principle riff screams NWOBHM influence, which was typical of the early thrash style, accompanied by a whispered chant of the song\u2019s title for extra atmosphere. Although the song doesn\u2019t take off flying the way much of the material on their 80s stuff tended to, the solo section has some solid interchanges. Glenn Drover\u2019s work with King Diamond was, in my opinion, second only to the genius that Michael Denner put forth on \u201cFatal Portrait\u201d and \u201cAbigail\u201d. Although we only get a small sample of his work on this song, those who do get around to picking up a copy of \u201cUnited Abominations\u201d are in for quite a treat.\n\nIt is somewhat ironic that Dave and company decided to put this out as the first single in that it presents a slower song to a faster album, while the first single off \u201cThe System has failed\u201d took the opposite approach and placed the two thrash songs at the helm. This single will likely only be possessed by those who jumped the gun and bought it before the album came out, me being one of them. If you already have the LP and you don\u2019t feel the need to own absolutely everything with the MegaDeth name on it, just take this review as an augmentation of my endorsement of the full album.\n",
        "\nHell yes. This isn't old-school Megadeth nor is it even true thrash, but it still kicks ass all over the place. I have been thoroughly unimpressed with anything Megadeth has put out since Rust in Peace (I could never grasp why everyone loves Countdown and Youthanasia - both have their share of truly dull songs mixed in with the good ones), but now, for the first time since that masterpiece, we have a Megadeth album that is solid all the way through. That's not to say this even comes close to RiP, but I think its safe to say it's better than anything since.\n\nThis definitely isn't a return to Megadeth's old sound, though it does crop up here and there in songs like \"Sleepwalker\" and \"Play For Blood\" (and note that by \"old sound\" I mean what they did on their first four albums, the only sound worth returning to). In a lot of ways, however, it is a return to what made them kick so much ass to begin with: attitude. With the exception of the \"A Tout Le Monde\" remake, this album of political diatribes, snarled vocals and powerful guitar (even if good thrash riffs are in short supply) has a vitality and edge to it that has been noticably missing from this band for years,\n\nAs I mentioned before, it's very solid. There are few great songs, but no bad ones. Some particular standouts include the opener \"Sleepwalker,\" which is an absolute beast, the shredfests of \"Amerikhastan\" and \"Burnt Ice,\" and the guitar solos in, well, pretty much all the other songs. In the context of everything else, even the pointless \"A Tout Le Monde\" is tolerable.\n\nDave sounds as good (or bad, depending on what you think of his distinctive voice) as he ever has, and the lyrics are, for the most part, pretty good. \"Sleepwalker\" is a bit cheesy, and I could do without the almost constant references to the Book of Revelation (Dave must really think the world's about to end), but then again, Megadeth lyrics have always been rather hit or miss.\n\nA word about the solos: they destroy worlds. Megadeth might not be churning out the killer riffs they used to, but the lead guitar work on this album almost makes up for that. The solos are plentiful and face-melting - what more could you ask for?\n\nBottom line: I still long for the Killing is My Business through Rust in Peace days, but I think it's pretty clear those days are over. I'm glad Megadeth has finally found a way to sound good doing something different. This is the album they've been trying to make since Risk fell flat, and while it's not the old Megadeth, it sure as hell is the best the new Megadeth has ever done.\n",
        "\nThis was where Megadeth began to streamline their sound to attract more fans. This means much of the thrash from the previous albums is lost in favour of more mid-tempo numbers. The riffs are not as technical either. Still, this album is by no means a total disaster.\n\nAshes In Your Mouth is easily the highlight. It's tucked away right at the end of the album but it's a great way to finish off. It's the only song that sounds like it could have been on Rust In Peace. This also has some of my favourite lyrics by the band. The faster section that begins just before the solo owns! I especially like the way the song ends with the same riff being repeated over and over as the song fades out! Killer song! One of my all-time favourite Megadeth tunes!\n\nWhile nothing else on here can come close to the greatness of that song, Skin O' My Teeth and High Speed Dirt are both faster paced songs with great riffs. Nothing to rival Five Magics but they are well-crafted nonetheless\n\nSymphony Of Destruction is probably the band's best known song. While I used to love it, I have grown tired of hearing it over and over during the years. Still, I'd rather hear this than 99.9% of what get's played on the radio these days. Swaeting Bullets is notable for its odd structure and Dave's vocal interplay. This song also fetaured a memorable video with multiple Mustaines! Imagine being trapped in a room with them!\n\nForeclosure Of A Dream is a decent ballad although Megadeth's definitive example of this style would occur on their next album. This Was My Life has a nice main riff and decent lyrics. The rest of the songs are fairly unremarkable but there's nothing truly atrocious. Unlike some of their later albums....\n\nThis album would have been seen in a better light had it not been the follow-up to Rust In Peace. It's arguably the best album Megadeth released between 1992-2007 before they made a great comeback with United Abominations. Even though, it's not the best the band has to offer, it's still a very good album worthy of your time.\n",
        "\nThis was the hardest Megadeth album for me to get into. Other than Reckoning Day, this album did nothing for me. A few years later, I gave the album another listen and enjoyed it a lot more.\n\nThis is defnitely their catchiest album. There are some wonderful choruses that make you want to sing out loud! But the band has not forgotten about the riffs! The aforementioned Reckoning Day has a classic headbanging riff and still remains my favourite song from the album. The Killing Road is my second favourite on here. It's arguably the fastest on the album although it's more power metal than thrash. Blood Of Heroes is the catchiest song and another highlight. A Tout Le Monde is the best ballad Megadeth ever did. It has just the right balance between lighter and heavier moments. The live version is even more fantastic. Although the later version was a decent remake, the original will always remain superior.\n\nThe main problem I have with the album is the lack of variety. Since many of the songs are the same tempo, they all seem to sound similar to each other. This was the reason it took me so long to get into the album as I could not find anything that really stood out. Despite my newly found admiration for the album, there are still songs which leave me cold. Black Curtains and the tit;e track are especially boring to me. In fact, the second half of the album is much weaker than the first aside from Blood Of Heroes.\n\nOverall, this is a solid release that 's worth owning.\n",
        "\nThis was where Megadeth really went into decline. Although this process started with Coutndown To Extinction, it was not until this album before it really maifested itself. There are some good songs but an awful lot of crap too.\n\nThe most striking thing about this album are the inclusion of some of the fastest songs since the RIP days. The Disintegrators is an all-too brief blast of speed that was lacking on the past two releases by the band. She-Wolf is probably the best overall song with it's thrashy riff and excellent soloing. FFF sounds an awful lot like Metallica's Motorbreath but it remains an enjoyable listen regardless. Vortex has some good lyrics too.\n\nAs for the other songs, Trust is easily the best. It's very catchy (I always find myself tapping along with drum intro) and features a decent riff even though it is obviously very commercial. This became the band's biggest hit on rock radio and the only one from this album worth hearing live. \n\nThe remaining songs are nothing special. Almost Honest is tolerable I suppose and Mastermind is ok once it gets heavier. But the other songs are pretty much a waste of space. The likes of I'll Get Even and Have Cool, Will Travel are some of the worst stuff the band has ever written. Dave was really getting into \"hit single\" mode here. This would of course culminate with the following album.\n\nIf you can get this album very cheap, then it's worth having for the 5 good songs. A dissapointing effort and it only gets worse.....\n",
        "\nI remember back in 2004 how excited I was to hear about this album. Like many, I was hoping this would be the return to form for the band we'd all been hoping for. While 2001's The World Needs A Hero was a big improvement on Risk, it was nothing special. Fortunately, The System Has Failed is a substantial improvement.\n\nBy far the album's best moment comes in the form of Kick The Chair. This song kicks your ass right from the moment it starts and does not let up once thorughout it's length. It has rightfully become a mainstay of the band's set list and I hope it stays there for years to come.\n\nOther highlights include opener Blackmail The Universe, Back In The Day and Tears In A Vial. Back In The Day in paricular is a very good power metal song celebrating the glory of metal. Mercifully, the song is nowhere as cheesy as similar opuses by other bands I can think of (I'm looking at you, Manowar!) It comes off very well live with the whole crowd singing along. \n\nUnfortunately, this album has quite a bit of filler. The worst examples are I Know Jack and Shadow Of Death. These can barely even be called songs. If sections of these were used as intros for a couple of the other tracks on the album, I perhaps wouldn't mind so much. But they do not warrant album space of their own!\n\nMost of the other songs are pretty mediocre particularly Something I'm Not and Shadow Of Deth. Truth Be Told is quite decent once it speeds up but it does not mesh well with the song's first half. The Scorpion and Of Mice And Men have potential to be good but end being up plodding and lacking in speed. \n\nI would also like to mention the return of Chris Poland on lead guitar. It's nice to have another previous member of the band on this record. Although Glen Drover has proven to be an excellent guitarist in his own right, it's a shame Poland was not on the accompanying tour for this album. At least there would have been some consistency between lineups since the tour lineup for The System Has Failed was completly different from the studio one!\n\nDespite its flaws, this is a solid Megadeth album. Anyone who enjoys albums such as Countdown To Extinction, Youthanasia and Cryptic Writings will find much to enjoy here. Even those who crave for Rust In Peace 2 are likely to find at least a song or two they are fond of.\n",
        "\nSo I was absentmindedly working on some stuff and this song came on. Forgetting I was listening to Megadeth, my immediate thoughts were \"What is this shit? Oh wait, am I still listening to Megadeth? Jesus fucking christ.\"\n\nFor the uninitiated, Dave Mustaine and his musketeers have teamed up with Lacuna Coil vocalist Cristina Scabbia of all people to 'remaster' this old song of theirs. That wasn't a good idea, and it certainly wasn't indicative of the overall quality of their next release. \"A Tout Le Monde (Set Me Free)\" is a radio friendly alternative rock song with little to no metal semblances at all. Now, the original song was no raging headbanger either, but there's a difference between touching balladry and radio garbage. The riffs are monotonous and unmemorable, and Dave's vocals actually sound much worse here then they did on the original. He might have improved his clean singing talents, but the singing here lacks any real emotion that may have been presented on the original. Scabbia's input doesn't seem to be too prominent, but she sounds awful, just like she does with her own band. And they sped the fucking song up---thus robbing it of any feeling or worth it had in it's original form.\n\nWhat will the newer fans think when they hear this? This is worthless fecal matter only fit for fans of My Chemical Romance, Avenged Sevenfold, and Green Day. It's heavier and more thoughtful, but overall it's the same. Just shitty radio rock. Not exactly an outstanding testament to what was once a touching ballad. What an awful first impression of the Megadeth of old.\n\nNot recommended to anyone, really. It gets 25% because it's listenable---but that doesn't make it any good. Yawn.\n",
        "\n\"No More Mr. Nice Guy\" hasn't just been one of my favourite Alice Cooper songs, but one of my favourite songs in general. Megadeth have been one of my favourite metal bands of all time and I'm always a fan of their cover songs, so surely you'd expect me to go out of my way to get this song and for my expectations of it to be pretty high. Well, you're right.\n\nAnd does it deliver? You're damn right it does!\n\nThat awesome riff goes from a rocky groove to a piece of metal without it actually changing much at all, and instrumentally the song is performed perfectly and at times I feel it even out-performs the Cooper classic from '73. \n\nAlice Cooper is one hell of a singer, one of the best in metal/rock and as for Dave, well, at least he makes his voice suit the music he plays. He lets his voice suit his cover songs because usually he changes the song around a fair bit musically to make it more thrashier, but he doesn't change the song drastically at all (except it's a bit faster and has a short solo). However, his snarl is a perfect match for this song and is one of those factors that really enhances the track instead of weakening its quality.\n\nSo once again, Dave takes a song that is far from being Megadeth and turns it into one of his own. Surely the godfather of rock, Alice Cooper, would be proud of this and with good reason. Now let's just hope Dave decides to cover \"Billion Dollar Babies\" next.\n",
        "\nSeriously, I'm not quite sure what Dave was thinking with this one. As a previous reviewer mentioned, the other songs from United Abominations that have been released are really quite promising (while they're not on par with the classics of old, they're definitely better than anything released since Rust in Peace). So why not make one of those your leading single? This song isn't bad in and of itself, but it sure doesn't foreshadow the kind of balls-out thrash that everyone's hoping for.\n\nHowever, ignoring the poor decision to make it a single before the album was released, it's really not all that bad. I've never been one of those who hail the original as a masterpiece (it was a good song, but it had nothing on the old-school thrash material), so maybe that's why I don't see it as blasphemous. The duet with the Lacuna Coil singer is alright, as long as you allow yourself to temporarily forget that, well, it's Dave Mustaine, the world's biggest badass, doing a duet with the Lacuna Coil singer - in any case, the vocal harmony suits the chorus well. I also think the faster pace of the song works; just because it was originally written as a slow song doesn't mean it doesn't lend itself well to a faster version. As has already been mentioned, the solo is very good, and is probably the one area in which this version actually tops the original.\n\nOn the whole, this one isn't quite is good as the originally, but it's not that much worse. Doing a slightly weaker remake of one of the post-Rust in Peace songs is forgivable - it's not like it would be if Dave watered down something like \"Holy Wars\" or \"Set the World Afire;\" now THAT would have been blasphemous. The main problem is that releasing a remake as your leading single is not a good idea, nor is choosing one of the album's softer songs when the album itself is the heaviest you've done in a while.\n\nSo here's hoping that the rest of United Abominations is in the \"Sleepwalker\" and \"Never Walk Alone\" vein. In that context, this track, while not a highlight, will at least be an enjoyable listen in between the big guns of the album.\n",
        "\nAs you can clearly see, this song hasn't been getting alot of love and I can see why. In 1994, Dave Mustaine created a masterpiece known as the touching ballad A Tout Le Monde; one of the more beautiful songs of metal, which had a nice yet depressing feel. It was filled with so much emotion that you didn't even need to know what the chorus translated into to know exactly what he was singing about... Truly a one in a million type of song.\n\nAgain, ONE in a million... not two.\n\nSo enter 2007, the highly awaited United Abominations release is right around the corner and the first single to support this album is a remake of this previously mentioned classic. However they sped up the tempo, stripping it off the depressing ballad aspect of the song. Then they add some Goth chick to the fold that makes it seem alot more commercial and 'sell outy', smart one Dave.\n\nHowever, the reason why I gave it a 51%, which statistically makes it more good than bad is the fact that A Tout Le Monde is still an awesomely beautiful song, and despite being neutered here... it's still A Tout Le Monde to me damnit. Plus the guitaring is in top form and that solo would make Friedman himself proud.\n\nHowever, don't let this cloud your judgement of the new album because the three other songs off of it that I have heard so far (Gears of War, Washington is Next and Sleepwalker) are nothing like this and they sound like a long awaited return to Megadeth of old... lets just hope the rest of the album is like those songs and not this one.\n",
        "\nO yea that\u2019s right because I had no idea how much of a waste this album was. Dave put this album out after he thought Megadeth was done so I guess it was kinda to appease the record company, they couldn\u2019t put out another greatest hits record, they just put out a live record, so why not just do something completely insane and put out half a live album and half The World Needs a Hero???\n\nWell with all that being said the live stuff on this record isn\u2019t that bad. Holy Wars is done very well on here and sounds awesome live anytime, and we also get a nice little new thing on Symphony of Destruction with some new parts and a harmony. Sweating Bullets is all right live but I still prefer the studio version any day over this. Time/Use The Man is also a stand out track on here. Time being the best song by far of Risk and Use The Man was one of the better songs of Cryptic Writings flow together nicely Megadeth does very well with this acoustic medley. In My Darkest Hour is all right except for the fact the cool acoustic intro isn\u2019t done here nothing else is special about the rest of it, I just wish they would have played that they played it at the end but not in the intro? One of the good parts about this album is the Conjuring being put on here. This song is easy to get overlooked coming off of the masterpiece Peace Sells, but is one of the bands best songs ever this song is missing none of the energy that it had off Peace Sells the lyrics are really cool and the guitar riffs are top notch.\n\nOne of the main grips for pretty much Megadeths entire career is Mustaine\u2019s voice. Which on this record isn\u2019t great, it never is great nor will it ever be but it suites the music just fine and I never had a real problem with it, because if you are buying a Megadeth album for Dave\u2019s vocals you just missed the total point of this band, the supreme musicianship and guitar playing! \n\nThe stuff off the World Needs A Hero isn\u2019t all that special. There is no all out thrashers on here but still so good metal tunes. Dread and the Fugitive Mind which came off Capitol Punishment has a nice riff and some okay solos, I would have preferred Kill the King but this song is almost as good. Moto Psycho is pretty plain as far as songs go. The riff isn\u2019t that memorable, its kinda fast but no where near the speed of something like the Disintegrators. Promises is some sort of beyond the grave ballad and has some seriously cheesy lyrics but has a very nice guitar solo by Al Pitrelli. The World Needs a Hero the song itself is nice for the face Dave wrote a political song again, something that was missing off of seemingly everything after Countdown. Burning Bridges is one of my favorite songs off the World Needs a Hero section of this album, its got a nice riff and a nice slow intro riff to start off. The album closes with the sequel to Hanger 18, Return to Hangar. This song is a nice try to get back to the bands metal roots after Risk failed so horrifically. Its done pretty well with some good riffs and solos. Fact is though Al is a good guitar player who can stand up to the standard Marty set on the original Hangar 18? \n\nAll in all this album is pretty much a waste. You would be much better off buying either The World Needs a Hero, or Rude Awakening. I can find no real reason to go out and buy this album unless you see it sitting in a used bin for $4 or something less, or you just want everything Megadeth ever put out. Outside of that don\u2019t waste your time with this.\n",
        "\nI really don't hate this song as much as I hate Dave's \"improvements,\" much like how he neutered Rust In Peace in its remastered form. I actually enjoyed the original of this song, even though I do find it quite cheesy. \n\nOkay, why the hell are you playing it faster? It now sounds like a fucking emo song with Dave crooning over it. Damn it, that was one of the stupidest ideas I have ever heard coming from Dave! Slowing it down would have made more sense, but now it feels bouncy and happy. In the words of Frank Booth from Blue Velvet, FUCK THAT SHIT!\n\nCristina Scabbia pours on the cheese hot and heavy, like a big glob of ultraprocessed 7/11 nacho sauce. She might be good at what she does in Lacuna Coil, but not in fucking Megadeth. I know that there is a difference between Cristina and Amy Lee from Effervescence, but for fuck's sake, this sounds like a blatant attempt to ape the \"Bring Me to Life\" craze, albeit in its retarded shadow/inverted sense. And YOU must admit, Dave probably had that in mind when re-doing this.\n\nThe Drover solo is quite nice, and I've got mega respect for the man. I'd like to give 30 points based mainly on the compentency of the band involved, and the fact that I feel sorry for them, but that would be out of character. They must be quite embarassed about being involved in this atrocity...\n\nThis is a real insult. \n\nShame on you, Dave Mustaine!\n",
        "\nWith a name like 'That One Night', you'd expect this to be one hell of a special concert and surely enough Megadeth deliver here. This is one of the best live performances of Megadeth I have ever witnessed, if not the best. The track list is pretty damn solid considering that it is from the tour in support of the sub-par album The System has Failed so as you'd expect it would contain a lot of songs from that album.\n\nFirst off is the fast and thrashy Blackmail the Universe which is one of the better 'System' songs and it is performed greatly, it then seamlessly cuts into the classic Set the World Afire which is also performed greatly and these two tracks are make an awesome way to get this concert started.\n\nOn this DVD you get a bit of everything from the Megadeth career (sans tracks from Killing is My Business, which is a shame), you even get something from Risk; the borderline soft rock song I'll Be There, but even that song is performed greatly and I rarely find myself skipping through it. The tracks that I have to say steal the show here however would have to be In My Darkest Hour, the killer combo of Hangar 18 and Return to Hangar and finally the closing tracks Symphony of Destruction, Peace Sells and Holy Wars.\n\nMuch like Megadeth's previous live release Rude Awakenings; Dave Mustaine\u2019s vocals leave a lot to be desired, however his voice has improved a fair amount and even make a lot of the songs sound much better (Trust and Kick the Chair are two prime examples here), and instrumentally the band is in near perfect form nailing every solo flawlessly, including the highly difficult songs like Hangar 18/Return to Hanger at Tornado of Souls.\n\nBut one of the biggest standouts of the DVD would have to be the picture quality, as stupid as it may sound. I mean the picture here is amazingly clear, words cannot describe how perfect the picture quality here is, you really have to see it to believe it. Even if you don't like the music, you should get this just to witness how clear a live DVD can be.\n\nAn extra cool little bonus is before some tracks it cuts to footage of the guys performing some songs acoustically at some park with some fans, really shows that these guys love their fans and they love what they do for them.\n\nIn short this is an amazing live DVD and it shows that even after 20 years and after a decade of mediocrity, Megadeth are still one of the best and are still able to be a force to be reckoned with.\n",
        "\nThis sounds like taking a ten year old cassette copy of 'Youthanasia' and playing it on a twenty year old stereo, while recording a thirteen year old girl singing along to it. It's been sped up, the vocals sound like Dave is getting his nuts stepped on and it's just plain and simple: a shitty remake. \n\nIt's lost the complexity and beauty of the original, it just feels tainted. Musically its almost idenitcal to the original, only with the \"old sped up tape\" sound. The solo has a new edge to it, and quite possibly the strongest part of the whole song. Perhaps if you've never heard the original it would be a 'decent' single. But when trying to improve a masterpiece (which has always been my favorite from Youthanasia), and presented with this garbage; it's not really a good mix.\n\nAll in all re-recorded songs are always the \"love 'em or hate 'em\" cliche'. Personally, this is a situation where you can scrap this.\n",
        "\nIts difficult for me to make my mind up on what I\u2019ve heard here because I\u2019ve been a steady fan of MegaDeth for more than a decade, and I\u2019ve also followed Lacuna Coil fairly avidly for the past 5 years. Although separately they each have their own unique flavor that I can indulge in with a pure sense of enjoyment, like certain additives in any recipe, when combined you can come up with something that doesn\u2019t taste too good. \n\nMy principle criticism about this remake is that it is far too fast, it is somewhat close to the faster stuff that Lacuna Coil has done. This song is about a suicide, and although it carried a sense of woeful beauty in its original form, it doesn\u2019t fully fit the Goth Metal/Rock format too well. Dave\u2019s vocals are well done, but a little bit too clean in comparison to what I have always enjoyed in his fast vocal works. Cristina\u2019s vocal performance is fine, as always, but clashes with Dave\u2019s and the background voices work against the simplicity of the song.\n\nThe production and overall sound is highly mechanical, not quite as blatantly as was the case on \u201cRisk\u201d, but definitely headed back in that direction. The clean guitar sounds are thin, the distorted ones don\u2019t have much edge to them, and the lead tracks get buried under the rest of the arrangement. The part where the mix truly falls apart is at the end where the principle lead track that culminates the entire song is hardly audible.\n\nIf you were okay with what you heard on \u201cRisk\u201d and the less metal songs on \u201cCryptic Writings\u201d, this might have some appeal. I can rationalize blowing a dollar or two on this vis-avis itunes or some other mp3 outlet, but if you like older MegaDeth I would definitely save your money for something else. This seems more to be a one-time experiment by the band rather than a clue as to the total direction of \u201cUnited Abominations\u201d, which I can forgive, but I could well be wrong.\n",
        "\nThis song has always been a favored whipping boy by Thrash purists due to its commercial success and because it resembles a similar slowness and simplicity as that was exhibited by Metallica on the Black Album. The main riff has the catchiness factor applied so strongly that it draws comparisons to \u201cIron Man\u201d and \u201cSmoke on the Water\u201d, along with the famed Metallica commercial breakthrough \u201cEnter Sandman\u201d, although MegaDeth has avoided the trap of allowing their guitar solos to become comical and their riffs to get overly repetitive.\n\nLike many others, I obtained the European release a few years back, which included \u201cBreakpoint\u201d and \u201cGo to Hell\u201d. Although these songs are also found on \u201cHidden Treasures\u201d, which I also possess, their inclusion on this single hints that Dave was in fact attempting to one-up his former band mates in the sales department, as these songs are a bit more thrash oriented, but contain similar moments of commercial cheese that was in high demand at the time. \u201cBreakpoint\u201d is probably the last truly speed oriented song put out by Deth before going towards the mid-tempo style of \u201cYouthanasia\u201d, which still endures to this day. Minus the goofy \u201cNow I lay me down to sleep\u201d spoken part, \u201cGo to Hell\u201d is also a fun song, and takes my pick for the best track off the Bill and Ted\u2019s Bogus Journey soundtrack, a movie that like its predecessor is a guilty pleasure of mine.\n\nAll in all, pretty commercial, but a good listening experience all the same. Since Hidden Treasure has gone out of print, the value of this particular version of the single is a bit higher to those looking for songs not found on the primary studio releases. 1992 was not a particularly good year for the Metal genre, especially the thrash genre, but as always there are some exceptions and this is one of them.\n",
        "\nMegadeth are a band many of you will be familiar with, and rightly so. Personally, they are my favourite metal band, ever. However, it was only recently I really discovered this little gem. Sandwiched between the legendary Peace Sells and Rust In Peace and, hence, so far before the more radio-friendly sounds of Youthanasia and Cryptic Writings, its quite easy to forget this masterpiece.\n\nHowever, in my opinion it embodies the raw spirit of Megadeth far better than even my album of preference (the brilliant Rust In Peace). It blasts out brutal riffs, fantastic solos and the usual high standard of lyrics Mustaine spits out, while keeping the listener hanging on every note.\n\nThe dramatic, incredible opener \"Into The Lungs Of Hell\" sets off the album with a level of class most instrumentals can only dream of. I'll admit I'm not usually a fan of instrumentals, but Into The Lungs Of Hell is, put simply, incredible. Setting the tone for an album can be difficult, but it draws the listener into the mood of the album, while not sounding like an overture or medley.\n\nSet The World Afire follows suit with astonishing panache, maintaining the power and drive of the introduction, while not sounding samey or repetitive. However, the next song, a cover of The Sex Pistols' Anarchy In The UK is a source of contention - personally I like it, and covers one of the most important songs in British music history with flare and respect to the original. They really make it their own without leaving the Pistols' version redundant. Sure, its a bit silly for an American metal band in the late '80s to cover a British punk song from the '70s, and many Pistols purists will think it an unthinkable idea. But hey, it works. As does just about every song on this album.\n\nThere's no pauses for thought for the simple fact that, with Dave Mustaine at the wheel, you don't need any. There is plenty of lyrical depth and power to be found, without a moment's rest in the assault on the ears. In particular 502 and Hook In Mouth are fine examples of this, with In My Hour Of Need spitting more resentment than just about any other song to an ex-lover could even contemplate. The album encapsulates everything Megadeth was, is and should be about.\n\nHowever, in saying that, it is by no means flawless. Although each song has its own flavour and power, it lacks the diversity, energy and inventiveness of the two albums they'll be remembered for. Despite all the power of Hook In Mouth, there is no beautifully psychotic rant on a par with Rust In Peace...Polaris or Peace Sells. Furthermore, the album is simply too damn short. Hook In Mouth comes to a close and you're waiting for the next assault on your eardrums. But it, frustratingly, never comes. However, when one of the few floors to an album is it being too short, you know the quality's high. And very high it is - this is head and shoulders above some of Megadeth's other albums and would a fine candidate for legendary album number 3.\n\nAll in all So Far, So Good, So What? is a classic that no Megadeth fan should be without, and a damn fine introduction for anyone interested in one of the most important thrash bands in metal history.\n",
        "\nYes, this is a remake of an old song. And let me tell you what, it is BAD remake. Actually very bad. I prefer the old version by a long shot, this remake truly butchers the original.\n\nFirst of all, Dave's singing may have improved, but I prefer the old style. Despite his voice was VERY hit or miss, at least it sounded raw and aggresive. In this \"new\" song, it lacks both qualities. But the vocal department is not complete yet, as we also have a powerless version of [insert average gothic female singer here] in the form of Cristina Scabbia, of LaKorna Coil's fame. (Yeah, LaKorna Coil.) This girl has the most powerless voice I've ever heard this side of Britney Spears. The multi-layers add power and are helpful, but in the last verse when only one layer is used, the lack of power is SO evident that it screws her whole performance.\n\nThe guitars are not very heavy, and this sounds like mainstream heavy metal worse than the black album (by you know who). I liked the original version despite it was nowhere near the old 80's stuff, but this version goes too far in the lack of aggression. I really hope this is not a good advance of the new album, and after hearing this song I decided I'm gonna give the whole album a listen or two before buying it.\n",
        "\nThe phenomenon of MegaDeth\u2019s \u201cRust in Peace\u201d is quite a unique one, owing to a long history of tumult following the life of its founder Dave Mustaine and the subsequent line-ups changes that had coincided with it. With perhaps the exception of \u201cPeace Sells\u201d Mustaine\u2019s approach to album creation has been an exercise in pure intuition that seemed to magically align a set of varied influences into a cohesive whole. This can be readily observed in the seemingly out-of-place yet fitting classical piano intro to the debut album, and the host of seemingly unrelated lyrical topics and musical section changes in \u201cSo far, so good, so what?\u201d Where this album differs is that it takes the opposite approach and instead creates something that is purposefully structured and more symmetrical.\n\nAlthough I am personally a bigger fan of Chris Poland\u2019s mellow yet fast approach to soloing, it is clear that Marty Friedman has the edge on chops as well as instrumental storytelling. He acts as a slightly more technical foil to Mustaine\u2019s leads, resulting in a dueling soloist approach that gives a sense of unity between the two, rather than the sense of conflict that manifested itself on the solo sections of \u201cPeace Sells\u201d. Nowhere is this more present than in the cases of the first 2 epic thrashers on the track list, which showcase a variety of stylistic influences from Iron Maiden to classical guitarist Carlo Domeniconi.\n\nIndeed, the entire tone of this album screams epic, not only in the proportion of music found on here but also in the approach to the subject matter covered. Although Mustaine mostly delves into themes of government conspiracy and social awareness in the cases of \u201cHoly Wars\u201d, \u201cHanger 18\u201d, \u201cDawn Patrol\u201d and the title track, he makes room for such wildly different subjects such as fantasy in the case of \u201cFive Magics\u201d and what appears to be an analogy to Dante\u2019s 2nd plane of hell and a song of lust and self-destruction in \"Tornado of Souls\".\n\nThe songs do exhibit the same sense of creative freedom and intuitiveness that Dave has always possessed, but the focus has become clearer. \u201cHoly Wars\u201d has an intro riff that immediately grabs the ear, while the vocal delivery that follows over a series of well placed riffs is almost clean in its precision, though raunchy in timbre. The mystical sounding classical guitar interlude provided by Friedman throws the listener for a loop, yet takes nothing from the unity of the song. \u201cTake no prisoners\u201d, \u201cPoison was the cure\u201d, and \u201cLucretia\u201d are all full speed ahead, uncompromising riff thrashers, the first of which containing a brief bass solo that challenges Joey Demaio\u2019s status as the most out of control soloist on the instrument. \n\n\u201cFive Magics\u201d continues to buck expectations and leads off with an evil sounding intro that reminds a bit of Slayer, followed by an extravaganza of lead lines and some off-the-cuff vocal interchanges. \u201cTornado of Souls\u201d is the only song that could potentially be described as mid-tempo and comes off as the most memorable and catchy of the bunch. The title track is a thrash epic that sounds longer than the sub-6 minute time length, lyrically depicting the decay of ballistic missiles and attributing the name Polaris (also the name of the trinary star system that is referred to as the North Star) to a weapons system that is given the characteristics of a human tyrant. The only weak link in the bunch is \u201cDawn Patrol\u201d, which does contain some fancy bass work, but doesn\u2019t work well and contains a rather goofy vocal performance that doesn\u2019t succeed as being humorous or scary.\n\nAlthough from start to finish this album screams musical brilliance, the greatest song on here is \u201cHanger 18\u201d. It\u2019s principle chord progression is taken from Mustaine\u2019s compositional contribution to Metallica in \u201cCall of Ktulu\u201d, which has been further elaborated and reclaimed by its rightful owner. The number of varying ideas drawn from this singular progression is quite large, presenting an exciting thrash epic with catchy vocals rather than the repetitive and somewhat overlong instrumental of its predecessor which was mostly a song displaying Cliff Burton\u2019s technical prowess. The solo section and riff interchange at the end bears much resemblance to the classic Maiden epic title track off \u201cSeventh Son of a Seventh Son\u201d, although a bit faster and lacking any keyboard tracks.\n\nSo the question is simply, is this album worthy of all the praise? Absolutely, but I must differ with the majority of the MegaDeth faithful whom say this is their best. When I listen to \u201cPeace Sells\u201d I hear absolute perfection by way of chance, when I listen to this I hear near perfection through intentional effort. It is a great album, one of the best in its genre, and if you get the re-mastered CD you\u2019ll be treated to hearing a fine bonus song in \u201cMy Creation\u201d and 3 songs off this album with Chris Poland doing leads. Mustaine has succeeded not once, but twice now in surpassing his former band mates in Metallica, and to this day continues to outshine them, regardless to what album sales and conventional wisdom say to the contrary.\n",
        "\nAmong the rather stylistically consistent yet lyrically incongruous offerings off of \u201cSo far, so good, so what\u201d is this rather witty, comical, and vulgar polemic against former band mate Chris Poland. Many consider this to be a low point in Mustaine\u2019s song writing career, but I can not help but disagree. If you listen to Storm Troopers of Death, Nuclear Blast, or other rougher edged thrash acts with greater punk tendencies, you will note that this approach to humorous/angry lyric writing is not unique to Mustaine, nor was it unheard of for him to write this style of song on previous releases.\n\nThe song itself is highly aggressive, particularly Dave\u2019s vocal delivery on the chorus where he shouts \u201cLiar!\u201d like an angry imp hemorrhaging blood through his throat. The riffs are well emphasized; the solos are fast and complex, all despite the fact that this song is barely over 3 minutes long. If there is any flaw in this single it is that there is no additional perk for tracking it down, no b-sides, nothing to make it worth getting it in along side picking up the studio version. \u201cMary Jane\u201d and \u201cAnarchy in the UK\u201d both at least had some accompanying songs, albeit ones that weren\u2019t quite spectacular.\n\nIf you already own the album it came off of, this single is not really worthy of seeking out. If you managed to pick this up when it was in circulation, you\u2019ve probably got something that would be worth a bit to some eccentric MegaDeth collector. The song does stand well on its own, and that is one of the reasons why I elected to do this review, as this song has been subject to some harsh criticism in some quarters.\n",
        "\nThere have been some who have speculated that if Dave Mustaine had never been in Metallica, they would never have gotten off the ground, particularly considering the massive songwriting credits attributed to him on that album. While I\u2019m not sure of it myself; one thing is certain, he was the principle source of Metallica\u2019s thrash orientation. This can be readily observed in the contents of this, the first demo by MegaDeth, in its completely unrestricted aggression.\n\nObviously the production is rough as hell, but for a demo, it ranks high for its time in terms of quality. When compared with the recently re-mastered versions on \u201cKilling is my Business\u201d, it is hard to believe that this was done on a 4-track in 1984. Dave\u2019s vocal delivery is not quite as dead on as it was on the LP that followed, in fact it is downright ugly, but it never really comes across as sloppy or amateurish in its entire eleven minute duration.\n\n\u201cLast Rites/Loved to Death\u201d is a break with the current established standards of no keyboards with a nice little classical piano intro, but one should consider that in the beginning these rather silly limitations on the genre didn\u2019t exist, because Dave was one of the ones who originally defined it. \u201cThe Skull beneath the Skin\u201d takes the lead in terms of riff content, blazing through a series of skull crushing guitar figures with an occasional vocal part in between two of Dave\u2019s crazy leads.\n\nThe obvious point of interest on here is \u201cMechanix\u201d which is a shorter version of \u201cFour Horsemen\u201d which is free of the repetitive quasi-epic riffs that Hetfield and company contributed to their version, as well as jacked up on coke to boot. The shuffle riff that bears a lot of similarity to the main riff of Children of the Grave is to damn fast that to this day it kills my wrist when I play it along with the CD. The subject matter of the song has obviously been altered from a fit of self-promotion in the case of Metallica to a nice little analogical comparison between some hard thrashing sex and fixing a car, E.E. Cummings would be proud.\n\nThanks to renewed interest this demo is now available along with the re-mastered version of \u201cKilling is my Business\u201d, an added bonus for any MegaDeth fan, young or old, who has yet to get that particular album on CD. It is a great listening experience that is completely removed from all of the slick productions, pomp, and fanfare tendencies that would later creep their way into the genre.\n",
        "\nThis is a pretty underrated classic of Megadeth's catalog, and considering all the turmoil the band was going through at the time, I'm surprised it doesn't sound any worse. It nearly rivals Killing Is My Business in terms of sheer sonic ugliness, but not so when you get the remaster, where all the various layers are revealed rather crisply.\n\nOverall, the sound here is rather progressive. By that, I mean that there are quite a few layered guitar sounds. \"Mary Jane\" and \"In My Darkest Hour\" are the best examples of this. In fact, \"Mary Jane\" has to be the creepiest damn thing Megadeth has ever written, sounding heavily influenced by Mercyful Fate, and Mustaine sounds like he's literally going insane. Excellent! Great solo on this one, too! The opening melody is downright haunting, as is the acoustic sections of \"In My Darkest Hour.\" \n\nStill, there's a lot of straight up shredding on here. \"Set the World Afire\" is a fercious maelstrom of angry riffs, guaranteed to tear your flesh off like a nuclear explosion...damn, it really evokes images of an apocalypse! \"502\" and \"Liar\" are both shredfests with maniacal, threatening vocals to match the voracious riffing. Mustaine's soloing is downright lethal, and Jeff Young is no slouch either. The only weak link is Chuck Behler, who though adequete, really doesn't offer anything of note, especailly when sandwiched between the godly Gar Samuelson and Nick Menza. Even worse, the cymbals were recorded seperately from the drums, leaving an irritating pause that makes them sound like a drum machine...that really kills a lot of the energy of the ablum. \n\nI don't care for the Sex Pistols cover at all. It's punky, jolly feel disturbs the overall dark and threatening atmosphere of the album. Mustaine still sounds nasty in his vocal snarling, though. \n\nIf this came out before Peace Sells, it would no doubt enjoy a more esteemed position, but this era and album were a transitional period that didn't last. For the next album, Mustaine honed his agression and remained sober to create the finest piece of thrash ever...\n",
        "\nMany would seem surprised as this being a MegaDeth cover song, but in doing so they bring into question their own knowledge about the thrash genre, and where it gets its unique dose of aggression from. Mustaine\u2019s hostility to the majority sentiments of his time is right at home with the likes of the Sex Pistols, who were too principled to dignify an induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame with their presence. The only contradiction to be found in this re-singing of the classic anthem of British angst is the attitude towards the musicality surrounding the words.\n\nMegaDeth is, at heart, a collection of virtuoso musicians who seek to express their greatness through technical display. The additional guitar solos and Mustaine\u2019s vocal delivery are far superior technically and musically than anything Johnny Rotten and company could deliver, although Steve Jones does contribute a nice little lead riff to this version. The change of UK to USA is somewhat ironic in that it is all that is needed to transfer the context of the song from one nation to the next; that is how similar the trends of both countries were in the respective times that these two versions of the song were committed to the audio medium.\n\nThe accompanying live version of \u201cDevil\u2019s Island\u201d is well done, although naturally I have a preference to the studio version as the sound quality is superior. Although several versions exist, if you are on the hunt for this single the version containing these two tracks is the most likely to be available. It is a worthy purchase if you are a rabid collector or a MegaDeth completist, otherwise simply treat this review as extra incentive to pick up \u201cSo Far, So Good, So what?\u201d, which also carries this rather unique yet unsurprisingly good cover song.\n",
        "\nWith all of the problems facing both Dave Mustaine personally and his then still young thrash project MegaDeth, there is a somewhat peculiar sense of irony to the album \u201cSo far, so good, so what?\u201d, both in its title and the consistent yet varied subject matter contained in its eight various chapters. The musical dimensions from track to track contrast quite starkly, combining Mustaine\u2019s unique blend of epic songwriting and raw thrash attitude with lyrical themes spanning several issues relevant both to Dave personally and society in general at the time.\n\nComing off a brief stint as a three piece outfit for their slot on the movie soundtrack \u201cShocker\u201d, MegaDeth had a rather large task of matching the expectations created by their early career peak \u201cPeace Sells\u201d with a near completely revamped line-up. Jeff Young is worthy of the position that he holds on this album and does a good enough job when assuming lead duties, but between Poland and Friedman it is really difficult to wow the core-MegaDeth fan, and compared to them his style is not terribly distinctive. Chuck Behler manages to make a hell of a racket on the kit on several of the faster tracks on here, check out \u201cHook in Mouth\u201d and \u201c502\u201d in particular to see what I mean.\n\nThe album opens in with a curve ball quite similar to the one found on Deth\u2019s debut, only manifesting itself in a rather inspired military march complete with accompanying brass instruments. \u201cThrough the Lungs of Hell\u201d functions as a sort of extended multi-movement epic prelude to \u201cSet the World Afire\u201d, which is among the more powerful speed metal songs on here. The riff development is quite impressive as the first minute and a half of music are loaded with winning ideas, all of them hard edged, all of them memorable. The vocal delivery showcases Mustaine at his most crisp and precise, lacking any misplaced or overtly raw throat anomalies that were occasionally found on earlier songs.\n\nMuch of the other speed tracks on here are shorter and simpler, drawing upon the fewer riffs and fragmented solos approach of earlier releases. \u201cLiar\u201d features the roughest vocal delivery, appropriately so as Mustaine has opted to rip apart former band mate Chris Poland for stealing from him. \u201c502\u201d is an anthem for high speed driving that makes Sammy Hagar\u2019s \u201cI can\u2019t drive 55\u201d sound like the theme music to Driving Miss Daisy. But the true goods are delivered on the riff monster \u201cHook in Mouth\u201d, where Dave is at his socio-politically conscious best as he accurately depicts one of the most hideous enemies of freedom of speech Tipper Gore.\n\nWhere things really get interesting is on the slower tracks, which showcase Dave\u2019s varied approach to songwriting probably better than any other release has. \u201cMary Jane\u201d has a dream like atmosphere to it, contrasting a series of gloomy lead riffs with a set of mellow clean guitar drones. Mustaine\u2019s vocal delivery is colored by both a sense of fear and excitement, leading one to believe that he is either in the midst of a drug trip or experiencing some sort of supernatural occurrence. \u201cIn my darkest hour\u201d is quite a morose yet sorrowful elegy to former friend and band mater Cliff Burton, featuring a gloomy acoustic intro as well as a somewhat modified version of the main riff of \u201cJump in the Fire\u201d.\n\nFor those aspiring thrash fans who have yet to purchase this particular MegaDeth opus, it is among the better ones put out by them, despite the turmoil surrounding the band at the time and the inconsistency of its line-up. All of the original songs found within, as well as the rather well modified Sex Pistols cover, are shinning examples of Mustaine\u2019s genius and resilience. The re-mastered version includes 4 alternative mixes of some of the songs that give some insight as to how the original product sounded; a definite must for the sake of past perspective. This is something of a swansong for MegaDeth in many ways, and to this day continues to be underrated by core-fan and casual listeners alike.\n",
        "\nIf someone who was an expert at the general history of thrash was by some odd coincidence not familiar with MegaDeth listened to this album, he would probably conclude that it was recorded in 1984 and composed a few years before. Like many of the first offerings in the thrash genre, every song is lightning fast and loaded with flash solos, not to mention a vocal delivery that relies more on rawness and attitude than skill and precision. However, one aspect of this album that separates it from the fold, even when considering how late it was by the standard of the genre, is Dave Mustaine\u2019s rather unique approach to songwriting.\n\nDave\u2019s quasi-classical tendencies jump out at the listener from the intro \u201cLast Rites\u201d, which gives this otherwise primitive thrash album a somewhat epic feel. The second half of the opening song \u201cLove you to Death\u201d follows all speed, zero niceness approach that Mustaine originally suggested his ex-band mates in Metallica follow. The beginning of \u201cLooking down the Cross\u201d also defies the textbook approach that Hetfield and company followed on their debut and incorporates some quasi-Sabbath sounding doom elements, not all that dissimilar from Overkill\u2019s \u201cRaise the Dead\u201d actually.\n\nThe area of this album where MegaDeth holds the edge over most of the competition, most particularly Kirk Hammet, is the lead guitar department. Both Mustaine and Poland avoid the clich\u00e9 sound of an angry man venting with repetitive shred licks and create solos that are both methodically structured and individual in character. The former has his moment of triumph on \u201cMechanix\u201d, a solo which is probably better known on Metallica\u2019s debut, albeit played by someone who never could have composed it. Poland has various moments of brilliance on \u201cSkull beneath the skin\u201d and the title track, where note quantity does not supplant their quality.\n\nAlthough complexity is a noteworthy feature of this album, it is also important to note the strength that is exhibited through the purely fast and simplistic numbers. \u201cChosen Ones\u201d is short, but sweet, assaulting the ears with a barrage of speed riffs that puts \u201cHit the Lights\u201d on notice. \u201cRattlehead\u201d succeeds in being the most catchy, mosh worthy, and one of my top 5 favorites in the genre. It attacks with the same viciousness as Anthrax\u2019s \u201cDeathrider\u201d, while exhibiting a similar sense of polish as can be heard on Metallica\u2019s \u201cTrapped under Ice\u201d, although it doesn\u2019t share the slick production.\n\nLike any good heavy guitar player who didn\u2019t contemplate killing himself every time he wrote a song, Mustaine is not without a sense of comedy. Although the censors who continue to insist that his remake of the Nancy Sinatra classic \u201cThese Boots\u201d is not fit for our consumption can\u2019t be bothered with cracking even a little smile, I can\u2019t help but be tickled pink both by how ridiculously fast and lyrically profane it is. It rivals somewhat less vulgar joke songs such as Priest\u2019s \u201cEat me alive\u201d and challenges the super unfettered satirical mayhem of Storm Troopers of Death. However, I can\u2019t tell which is funnier, the unedited version I downloaded a year ago, or the bleeped out on my CD. Anyone who thinks that a teenager hasn\u2019t heard what Dave is saying before is definitely worthy of being chuckled at.\n\nTo those of you who have yet to obtain this album, the recent re-master also provides you with the 3 tracks from the \u201cLast Rites\u201d demo, a powerful bonus to accompany what is already a solid album. If you liked the Anthrax and Metallica debuts, this will definitely leave your neck just as sore and the imaginary bells around your head ringing just as loud. It\u2019s not the most shinning example of a slick production, and it\u2019s barely over a half hour long, but it packs a punch that will leave your head rattling well into next week.\n",
        "\nIt was 2000. I was wandering a Kmart store with money in my pockets to spend on something. Lo and behold, there happened to be a bargain bin full of CDs and in it was Risk. I don't know why, but the cover just appealed to me for some reason. So I bought it for four bucks, went home, listened to it and didn't think it was that bad. That was seven years ago, and my opinion has changed dramatically.\n\nRisk is absolutely the biggest shit pile Megadeth has ever come out with. It's an insult to the Megadeth name. Even Cryptic Pissings seems like God compared to this monstrosity. \n\nSome of the songs have this retarded electronica beat in the background, especially Insomnia. In fact, most of the song sounds like a Middle Eastern rock song or something. Right before the annoying, pop-echo of \"Insomnia, nia, nia...\u201d the beat sounds like something used in a shitty rap song. \n\nCrush Em is a typically shitty sports anthem type of song, and has chants of the song's title in between small portions of guitar playing, and distorted pop vocals in the background, but unfortunately has the tendency to stick in your head. \n\nMost of the other songs are like this or have a country thing going on, with two stand out exceptions: Prince of Darkness and (ugh) The Doctor Is Calling. Prince of Darkness is the best and heaviest song on Risk and has some decent guitar work in it, but still sounds like something that should be on a rock album. On the other end of the shitastic spectrum, we have The Doctor Is Calling, the absolute worst piece of shit I have heard come from a metal band. It doesn't even classify itself as metal, or music for that matter; it's just a cacophony of overused pop vocal distortion, poppy guitars and it just doesn't flow nicely at all. It sucks harder than a hooker.\n\nIf you're into Megadeth and love the old shit from the 80s and Rust In Peace, then steer clear of this steaming pile of pig shit and stick to the good stuff. But if you're into Ashlee Simpson and 'N SYNC or shit like that, then by all means, buy the damn thing. But if you're caught humming tunes from this record in public, then you're in for a beating. This is the shittiest album from a metal band ever released. I'd rather drown in dog shit than listen to this abomination.\n",
        "\nOk first of all many people who have only in recent years gotten into Megadeth believe this to be a new song. This is actually a remake of a song from Youthanasia in 1994. This song doen't represent the \"future\" of Megadeth since it's not a \"new\" song per say. It only represents that Mustaine can still play his old material as well as he used to, (even better in this version IMO). The vocals on the newer version of this song are very top notch and i even believe Dave's voice has improved over time (unlike Hetfield who can't sing his old stuff worth a crap). Having Cristina from Lacuna Coil adds a nice emotion to the song, and even a nice balance as well. This song is every bit of itself that it used to be and hasn't been \"watered down\" like some bands that try to remake older songs. I say very well done Dave.\n",
        "\nThere is no doubt countless stories of children who discovered the phenomenon of metal in their early teens or late pre-teen years, I myself had been subject to such an experience at the dusk of the genre\u2019s prominence. My brother, like many adherents of the 80s metal scene, had decided it was time to hang up his fixation with the seemingly obsolete (in his mind) genre and thus I inherited a sizable supply of audio cassettes and a couple of vinyl records from an era that was fast being forgotten. \u201cPeace Sells\u201d, the album in question, was my first real experience with metal outside of the mainstream glam scene that I had been into as a younger child.\n\nI was taken in by the album for a number of reasons, but the most salient one was my desire to grow as a musician, which was bolstered by the impressive display of instrumental virtuosity expressed both by Dave Mustaine and Chris Poland. The former of the two has a keen sense for riffs and song structure that can be observed in every single song on here, to speak nothing for his agitated pentatonic shredding. The latter\u2019s soloing style is highly unique, blending a powerful dose of technical ability with a rather uncommon mellowness reminiscent of older soloists of the blues/rock persuasion.\n\nThe politics of the album obviously took a little while to grow on me, if for no other reason than that a teenager knows only as much as he is taught, and what schools teach children is contrary to the more accurate picture of American politics as portrayed in Mustaine\u2019s lyrics. I still have my share of differences with him on certain things, but I have found his sentiments on the foreign policy and internal policy of the 80s to be highly accurate, particularly the rise of the Christian Coalition and various other malformations of the New Right. Some may look at his current Christianity and see hypocrisy under the guise of maturity, but as a practicing Catholic that loves metal, I can appreciate the courage of both choosing to believe something while simultaneously fighting those who use the same belief as a tool of oppression.\n\nConsidering that the thrash genre has often been pigeonholed as one-dimensional (it began this way of course), this album is revolutionary in its measured approach to consistency and variation. \u201cWake up Dead\u201d places a large emphasis on instrumental sections and lead breaks, being steeped in solos and tempo changes yet having only a small collection of lyrics. \u201cThe Conjuring\u201d has a bit more atmosphere to it at the beginning, but follows the same emphasis on riffs, lead and speed that the opening track features. The title track and \u201cDevil\u2019s Island\u201d are the most traditionally formatted of the bunch, feature some fancy bass work, choruses with a lot of sing-along value, in addition to the usual sectional development.\n\n\u201cGood Mourning/Black Friday\u201d is a double feature of sorts that throws some sand into the gears with a quiet and gloomy acoustic/electric intro, before exploding into a blazing fury of speed. \u201cBad Omen\u201d begins similarly, though the intro is less sorrowful and more menacing and the eventual body of the song is not quite as fast. \u201cI ain\u2019t superstitious\u201d defines the thrash sense of humor, drawing upon the old 12 bar blues model (though obviously elaborated more than is common to that older style) and injecting it with witty yet profane lyrics deriding something absurd. Our closing track \u201cMy last words\u201d is another soft intro followed by classic speed/thrash, a final brief break before the last fateful burst of brilliance.\n\nFor the prospective buyer, the greatest perk offered by the re-mastered version is 4 songs in their original format as bonus tracks. The principle difference to be observed between the older mixes is the vocal presence, which is somewhat mired by overuse of reverb, which was typical during the 80s. The result is a radical difference in the dimension of the lead vocals and the backup parts that occasionally pop in and out. Although I experienced the original first, I wholeheartedly endorse the changes made, as they have done nothing to corrupt the timeless music contained on here. This is a piece of thrash history that not only championed all the best components of the genre, but also changed my life as a guitarist and musician.\n",
        "\nI sure hope this isn't a representation of the upcoming album, because this is NOT what I want to hear from Megadeth. In fact, this is worse than Risk, dare I say. I might be just adding fuel to the flame, but seriously, this isn't good.\n\nThe riffs, ah yes; really, really melodic death riffs, but with the death. All we have is a melodic riff or two repeated until the solo. Cristina Scabbia can sing, but that doesn't excuse this poor recording. I've never liked Lacuna Coil, and THIS will not convince me to buy a record. \n\nDave, Dave, Dave. What the hell were you thinking? WHAT? I know you're supposed to be sober, but you came up with better songs while you were drunk, I mean come on. This isn't a return to form, it's brining you even deeper into the hole that I call mainstream music. Megadeth isn't the powerhouse thrash monster it was in 84'-91', it's just well, a hideous monster. Not the good monster, the horribly made B-movie monster.\n\nPlease, do not let this be a representation of the upcoming album, I PLEAD TO YOU DAVE!\n",
        "\nIf I were to give percentages to albums based on how I rank them, 100% being the absolute best and 0% being the worst, I wouldn\u2019t regret giving this 100%. I don\u2019t hand out percentages that way though; I prefer to score albums on their worth. I don\u2019t think this will be the only album I review and give a perfect score to, but this is my favourite, bar none.\n\nRust in Peace is the supreme example of how to create an album using a slew of styles from the decade that preceded it, and how to master each style. This is why there could not have possibly been an album this good in 1986, or anytime in the 1980s for that matter; metal had just about reached its peak in creativity in the late \u201880s and it wasn\u2019t until this album came along that anyone had looked back, evaluated the landscape, advantageously implemented styles into their work, find a way to expand upon ideas even further and go the next step further by making the most of the entire band\u2019s talent. That\u2019s one hell of an accomplishment, and there isn\u2019t any album from 1990 that has the same replay value; Slayer\u2019s \u2018Seasons\u2026\u2019 wasn\u2019t even an improvement from past releases, Pantera\u2019s \u2018Cowboys\u2026\u2019 seldom deviates from the same idea carried throughout and Priest\u2019s \u2018Painkiller\u2019 doesn\u2019t quite match the energy that this has. And they\u2019re all excellent efforts.\n\n(Ironically enough, many of these songs had been written years prior to the LP\u2019s release, with some even dating back to 1982 according to Dave. Imagine if the title track had been unveiled 1983 or so! Brutality!) \n\nAs expected, thrash is a key element yet still manages to compliment everything else. Take No Prisoners exemplifies the over-the-top attitude and musical execution of bands like Overkill and Anthrax; there are some complex rhythm and lead stops throughout, catchy lyrics and a great chant-along at the end. It may be the simplest track (except for Dawn Patrol) but it\u2019s still very detailed in execution. But we\u2019re not even into the rest yet! Polaris is more mid-paced than speedy, but the riffs are monstrous and thrashy without being pretentiously heavy. And then, near the end, it does get fast. Very riff oriented. After its calm, concentrated opening, Poison Was the Cure is just straight-forward, mind-numbing thrash bordering on speed metal, and ends with solo (and there are A LOT of those throughout the album). And when Five Magics gets going, damn. This one\u2019s an often overlooked classic; there are so many catchy lyrics, wild, blistering solos (yet despite their aggressiveness are technically proficient), an intense little break towards the end of the song and beneath it all a crazy time signature. Words cannot do this song justice.\n\nAnd the forerunner to all of this? Holy Wars.\n\nFucking Holy Wars.\n\nIf this isn\u2019t my favourite thrash song ever... no, it is. How the fuck is Dave playing this while singing? The riffs may not be the fastest out there, but they may very well be most memorable out of every thrash song I\u2019ve heard. The riffs go on for a minute and a half before even getting to the vocals and still and it keeps on going without becoming boring at all. This completely changes after \u201cHoly Waaaarssss\u201d when the riffs change to a slow, deliberate pace. This section totally commands your attention. And of course, when it all keys back up again it\u2019s back to the riffs with an awesome Friedman solo. Game over. Along with Tornado of Souls, this is the highlight of the album.\n\nOn the flipside of the coin is the catchier stuff which is all a mix of power, speed and straight-up heavy metal. Lucretia has a heavy emphasis on the lead work and features YET ANOTHER awesome solo. These just keep on coming! And of course, the song\u2019s about the ghost that lives in Dave\u2019s attic.\n\nAmazingly, Friedman manages to top that solo in Tornado of Souls, and it\u2019s arguably Megadeth\u2019s greatest. Tornado contrasts from Holy Wars\u2019 execution not only in the style of music, but the flow; Holy Wars plunges forward, slows down and starts up again whereas Tornado doesn\u2019t let up. It isn\u2019t the fastest track on the album, but the guitar work is almost too cacophonous to describe (and Friedman\u2019s from Cacophony, how about that).\n\nAnd of course\u2026 Hangar 18. This is very reminiscent of Iron Maiden in the verses and such, but then the time signature changes, and then changes some more. Can you say \u201cDueling solos\u201d? Solo after solo after solo after solo after solo after solo. After solo after solo after solo.\n\nAfter solo.\n\n\nThis is perfection, right here. Everything good about the \u201880s was duplicated and then enhanced and expanded. Here, thrash becomes calculated, technical and catchy; technicality becomes aggressive and riotous; intelligent, provocative lyrics become memorable tunes that you\u2019ll never forget. I give it my highest recommendation.\n",
        "\nAt that time, back in 2000, Megadeth needed one record to finish their contract with Capitol Records, so they released this compilation. Megadeth never released a compilation album before, at least a serious attempt of a compilation. But this is just a compilation, not a 'best of' album. This was edited clearly thinking about incomes, because the most succesful songs are here, but in commercial terms. That's why I miss some stuff from the first album, like \"Last Rites/Loved to Death\", \"Mechanix\" or \"Rattlehead\", huge Megadeth's classics and better than some songs included in this compilation. Of course, anthems like \"Hangar 18\", \"Holy Wars\", \"Peace Sells\" and \"Symphony of Destruction\" are here, and also some radio hits like \"Train of Consequences\", \"Sweating Bullets\" and \"A Tout le Monde\". But some older stuff and even of the recent albums, like \"Reckoning Day\" or things like that, are missing. \n\nAnyway, this is a good approach to Megadeth's music. If you want to introduce yourself or somebody to Megadeth, this record is very OK for that. And we've got new songs here (at that time): \"Kill the King\" and \"Dread and the Fugitive Mind\". Both songs are fucking great. \"Kill the King\" is catchy and powerful, the riffs and drums playing is astonishing. \"Dread and the Fugitive Mind\" is as good or better. The lyrics are excellent and the solos great. This reminds me \"Sweating Bullets\" a lot, mainly for the beginning of the song. But it's kind of boring the fact that this song was included in two albums, one afther the other, and with any new arrangement. Then, why they don't put it in the \"Kill the King\" single, released before this compilation? And \"Dread...\" rules, and \"The World Needs a Hero\", didn't rule that much.\n\nThe old songs aren't that well chosen. Why there's a \"Risk\" song here? Even Mustaine hates this record, and you can count the times they played any song from that record with one hand (but, luckly?, here in Chile they played \"I'll Be There\") I confess that I've never heard anything from \"Risk\", but if \"Crush 'Em\" is the 'best' song from that record, I'll never listen or buy or even download that shit album. The compilation gets better in \"Trust\", when all the songs are really 'mega-hits'. It's a great part of the album, but I dislike those track before \"Trust\" (exceptions are the two first tracks) \n\nWell, I don't have many words to describe this, and it doesn't needs many descriptions if we think that those are the most known Megadeth songs, thay they have played them thousands of times live and most of metalheads have listened already. \"Capitol Punishment\" is a hidden medley, after \"Peace Sells\", it's somebody changing the radio stations, finding many Megadeth songs. This is some kind of irony, but describes how the tracks were chosen. Well, still a good compilation. And now this went out of print, a fact that makes this more valuable. But own it only if you are a Megadeth fanboy.\n",
        "\nBecause I had been too busy with school recently, it actually caught me by surprise that Megadeth had a new DVD out. But, as a big fan of most of the stuff Dave Mustaine and his men released, I bought it without further notice. I had seen Megadeth play live on the tour during which this DVD was recorded and was absolutely blown away by what this lineup had to offer. My main concerns were if this DVD was good enough to surpass 'Rude Awakening' and if it shows the lineup in optima forma. Both questions can be answered with a \"yes\".\n\nThere is a \"however\" though. First of all, it's the sound. Most of the time, the sound is great, but James MacDonough's bass is just about inaudible during the first couple of songs. That little point of criticism is fixed later (during 'She-Wolf', Jimmy's back at full strength), but in 'Wake Up Dead' and 'In My Darkest Hour', songs that partly rely on a dominant bass line, it's slightly disturbing.\n\nAnother thing is the set list. And I'm not going to say the usual thing, being that they often play the same songs, because I don't mind at all, the songs they often play are the ones I want to hear anyway. When I saw them play that tour, they played a few songs not included here (like 'Skin O' My Teeth', 'The Scorpion', 'Die Dead Enough', 'Mechanix') which I would have loved to hear in favor of a couple of the songs that ARE on the DVD ('I'll Be There', 'Something That I'm Not'). I'm not too fond of 'Coming Home' either, but it works surprisingly well here!\n\nOn to the positive things on this DVD, because there are plenty of them! The best of all being the picture quality. I have yet to see a DVD that matches this one visually. The images are crystal clear, beautifully colored by the light and director Michael Sarna deserves a prize for editing a concert film so beautifully. At any given moment, you will see just the band member that needs to be on the screen.\n\nAnd of course the music! The music is exactly how it's supposed to be. This lineup is tight and consists of very capable musicians. Glen Drover is one of the best and most versatile lead guitarists I have ever heard, his brother Shawn does a great job on the drums and James MacDonough is, apart from a killer bass player, a very good singer too. Works incredibly well on all those beautiful multi-vocal parts in songs like 'Trust', 'She-Wolf', my personal favorite 'Tornado Of Souls' (I said it before and I will say it again...the song with the best guitar solo ever) and 'Symphony Of Destruction'. Megadeth is pretty damn close to being the perfect band for me. Oh and by the way, Mustaine himself seems to have improved greatly on the vocal area. He still isn't a very good singer, but what he does here is much better than what can be heard on 'Rude Awakening'!\n\nThere are hardly any extras on this DVD, only an alternate mix of 'Symphony Of Destruction', of which I still have to discover the differences with the version on the main feature. But I don't really mind, I tend to only watch the main feature of a DVD anyway and the one on this DVD is good enough to not really give a shit about any extras. The little fun interludes of Mustaine and Glen Drover playing some songs acoustically in a park somewhere in Buenos Aires are extra enough for me anyway.\n\nDid I get my message clear? Let me put it plain and simple: if you have a heart for Megadeth or Heavy Metal in general, this DVD belongs in your collection. The perfect picture quality meets the near perfect band here. I'd like to hate Mustaine for his attitude, but who gives a shit if his products are going to be this good?\n",
        "\nMasterpiece. From when I turned it on, to when I turned it off, i had a smile on my face. I watched the exactly one week before a Megadeth concert in my own hometown and all I can say is I\u2019m pumped. All the old bands that are trying to put shows on now are butchering their old songs, e.g. Metallica, but Megadeth keeps it as real as the song from the album. Even after new members here and there, they can still rock till it hurts.\n\n\nMusic: The sound quality is immaculate, each song sounds as clear as the album, and Dave can still wail like he used to, on both the guitar and his voice box. The crowd really gets into it too, whether it is performing a soccer chant between songs, accompanying the music with chants or drowning out Dave's singing with singing of their own, it really makes you feel that you are there live in the open air. Dave even takes some time to talk and sing to the crowd in their native tongue. What I really like is the cut scenes, where Dave and Shawn are playing acoustic in a park in front many fans that shows a band that is just for the fans. Shawn Drover can still belt out the licks like Poland, Young and Freidman, and gives you the impression that you are watching on of the legendary guitarists.\n\n\nVideo: The concert actually looks like an expensive movie, whether it's the camera angles and panning, or just the over all quality. There are also some breath taking camera angles from behind the audience where they are all jumping in unison, while Dave and the boys are rocking out. It's very cool when the camera shot is from behind the band and you can see just how deep the sea of people is, and how close the surrounding buildings are. It is overall just an amazing DVD, and it makes me want to see Megadeth more then ever.\n",
        "\nWith 1992\u2019s \u201cCountdown to Extinction\u201d Megadeth follows the lead of Metallica, and their 1991 self titled album, by trading in their lengthy, progressive compositions for streamlined, tightly written and played songs more conducive to radio and MTV airplay. But don\u2019t cry out \u201csellout\u201d as this still maintains its artistic credibility.\n\nThe there is a definite glossy sheen to the production, which is in an improvement. While this may take much of the harsher edge to the music away, it makes it more accessible and gives it more oomph. And clearly this worked, as the album went to #2 on the music charts, and became Megadeth\u2019s most successful album.\n\nNow some may scream \u201csellout\u201d at Megadeth for \u201cCountdown to Extinction\u201d, but why? There is still solid heavy metal, but now it the fat has been cut away. They didn\u2019t loose any musical credibility, or change drastically to achieve success. If you put this on next to anything before \u201cRust In Peace\u201d, you will still know it\u2019s the same band (you can\u2019t say the same for some bands) but with better production. That\u2019s all. Another element is the more melodic direction, presumably to attract more fans, but that still does not diminish the integrity of the band. \n\nMaybe the one curious element of \u201cCountdown to Extinction\u201d is the fact that just a few years back Megadeth was thrashing in the underground, firmly against the chart topping pop-metal bands like Motley Crue, yet now they are trying to top the charts. How times change.\n\nMaybe the biggest difference from the previous album, \u201cRust in Peace\u201d is that Marty Friedman no longer shreds at will. He provides some very good solos (along with one blues breakdown in \u201cHigh Speed Dirt\u201d), but this isn\u2019t a shred fest anymore. So if you like copious amounts of shredding check out \u201cRust in Peace\u201d first.\n\nWith all this change to a more stream lined approach it would be reasonable to think that there are many more individual songs that are good, which would be correct. The key tracks on \u201cCountdown to Extinction\u201d are \u201cSkin O\u2019 My Teeth\u201d, \u201cSymphony of Destruction\u201d, \u201cForeclosure of a Dream\u201d, \u201cSweating Bullets\u201d, and the title track \u201cCountdown to Extinction\u201d.\n\nOverall Megadeth\u2019s \u201cCountdown to Extinction\u201d is in no way a sellout, it is still a vibrant heavy metal album. This is essential for any fan of Megadeth.\n",
        "\nThough these days it seems as though Megadeth is less of a thrash act and more of a standard metal act, back in the late 80's the band was universally considered one of the premier thrash metal bands in the world. When you release albums such as Killing is my Business, Peace Sells\u2026But Who's Buying, and Rust in Peace, it isn't quite hard to achieve those lofty heights. But Megadeth did, and was readily grouped with fellow thrash stars Metallica, Slayer, and Anthrax in a group known as the Big Four of Thrash. 1986 had three of the four Thrash juggernauts (Megadeth, Slayer, and Metallica) releasing albums and each of these albums were incredibly successful, with all three being considered classics in the genre. \n\nPeace Sells is a fan favourite of Megadeth fans for a reason. Very rarely does the band stray from the thrash sound that made them so famous in the metal realm, and the result is a very focused effort. Guitarists Dave Mustaine and Chris Poland show off their skill through countless riffs and solos. These two elements are the basis of Megadeth's lightning fast thrash metal assault, and are both generally the most enjoyable parts of the album. Every track, save for the Willy Dixon cover, I Ain't Superstitious, features this traditional Megadeth sound. However, tracks such as Wake Up Dead, Devil's Island, and Good Morning/Black Friday showcase this talent very well. The album has a raw feel to it, as do many of the old school thrash albums do. Overall, this is definitely my favourite part of the album, and where the band impresses the most.\n\nBy many, Dave Mustaine's vocals are not exactly considered among metal's best. Admittedly, I enjoy Dave's singing quite a lot. However, on Peace Sells, he does not give his best performance. Though in tracks like the title cut, he does a very good job, at times, such as in The Conjuring, his effort borderlines on annoying. His trademark snarl is once again present, but at this point in time, it too feels very raw. Albums like Rust in Peace and Countdown to Extinction definitely exhibit a big improvement over this particular album, likely due to the fact that he has had less time to hone his skill (or lack of, according to some). The 2004 re-issue definitely affected his voice positively, as it did away with the poorer sound quality found on the original. Fairly good effort from Mega-Dave, but he's had better moments.\n\nMy only concern with the album is quite similar to that of Rust in Peace: the length. At 36 minutes, it's pretty damn short. Now, I'm aware that many of metal's (especially thrash) older records are a lot shorter that they are now, being around the 30-40 minute mark. But I feel the band could have definitely recorded a few more (or at least longer) songs to make this a longer album. Keep in mind that while the 2004 the re-issue contains 20 extra minutes of music, none of the bonus tracks are new material, rather they are just new mixes by Randy Burns.\n\nPeace Sells\u2026But Who's Buying is definitely among Megadeth's better albums. There isn't much to be disappointed about, save for perhaps the length. A bona-fide thrash metal masterpiece, it possesses everything a fan of metal could ask for. Rapid-paced, heavy riffs that scream through the ears of listeners for the better part of 36 minutes; excellent musicianship from the entire band; and top notch song writing all propel this album to the top of the crowded thrash scene. This album is perfect for those who want to get into both Megadeth and metal, as it contains many of the genre's important aspects. It's pretty cheap too.\n\n(Originally written for Sputnikmusic)\n",
        "\n\"We are the damned of all the world / With sadness in our hearts / The wounded of the wars / We've been hung out to dry\"\n\nSo sings Megadeth vocalist/guitarist Dave Mustaine on the title track of his band's 1994 effort, Youthanasia. In many ways this line is quite reflective of the 'turmoil' that the band's fan base was going through at the time. Both Youthanasia and Megadeth's previous album, Countdown to Extinction, did extremely well Both releases propelled Megadeth to the top of the charts (as high as #2 at one point), and the American band was finally enjoying the fruits of their labour. However, this would not come without a price. Countdown to Extinction took them away from their thrash metal roots in pursuit of a more accessible sound. Does this mean we automatically write them off as sell-outs? Of course not. But many fans who longed for the technical thrash found on the likes of Rust in Peace or Peace Sells did write them off when they took this new musical direction. But Dave and the crew didn't care, and continued making the music they wanted to make. Despite what many will tell you, Youthanasia is not a bad album. However, it does continue the progression that began on Countdown started in 1992.\n\nThough the music found in songs like Reckoning Day and Youthanasia remains quite heavy, it is obvious that thrash metal is very scarce on Megadeth's sixth album. In its place is a more traditional type of metal. Much slower than the likes of Rust in Peace\u2026Polaris or Set the World Afire, the material on Youthanasia is set at more of a medium pace, yet makes up for the lack of speed with a level of catchiness similar to that of Countdown to Extinction. This is accomplished through steady, consistent riffs and memorable vocal efforts (But we'll stick with the musical side of the album right now). One song that showcases this catchiness is the song Victory. Aside from being one of Dave's more clever tracks, it's also one of the album's thrashier cuts. Victory's riffy structure represents the build of several of the album's songs, and even detractors of the album should find it interesting. One of the most enjoyable parts of older albums was the technical shredding that Mustaine and Co. subjected listeners to in many of the group's songs. Youthanasia lacks the three minute soloing from Dave and Marty. But it isn't completely devoid of soloing. Mr. Mustaine and Mr. Friedman both showcase their talents on the axe through (for the most part) shorter, slower, yet still competent guitar solos which remain a staple in the arsenal of Megadeth. Music is not an issue with Youthanasia, and like Countdown to Extinction, is very well done. \n\nNow, one of the most ridiculed aspects of Megadeth lies in the vocal delivery of guitarist/vocalist Dave Mustaine. His efforts on Youthanasia will do nothing to change your mind. But for those who do appreciate his efforts, well, Youthanasia will not disappoint. While I didn't think it was too bad to begin with, Dave's singing significantly improved on Countdown to Extinction. Though the difference is definitely not as large between Countdown and this release, it is still noticeable. He really excels during the various choruses found through the album. The likes of Family Tree and Blood of Heroes have Dave elevating his performance above anything he had ever done at the time. However, the catchiness does not stop there. Songs like Train of Consequences and New World Order also have acceptable vocal lines, yet are somewhat more difficult to get into. This is especially the case in Train of Consequences, where Dave's voice is somewhat irritating the first time you give it a listen. You know, his trademark snarl/growl/vocal style. But aside from some minor moments such as that, Dave has a very good showing on Youthanasia, perhaps his best at that point of his career. \n\nDespite recording a very enjoyable album, Megadeth still got plenty of criticism from their \"tr00 fans.\" No, there aren't any Hangar 18's or Good Morning/Black Friday's or Set the World Afire's, but instead there are an abundance of simpler, more accessible, yet still heavy songs which many can enjoy. The second half of the last verse could be interpreted as the band's response to these hecklers, through the slightly odd career path that they decided to tread (by time Risk came around, Megadeth had lost a lot of it's mainstream appeal as well as most of the tr00 thrash fans which got propelled them to their highs in the first place) If you don't enjoy Megadeth's material (especially Countdown to Extinction), chances are you will not like this, but I find that it's a perfect album for newer Deth fans, along with Peace Sells. Get this album if you have the chance.\n\n\"You didn't want us anyway / And now we're making up our minds / You tell us how to run our lives / We run for youthanasia\"\n\n(Originally written for Sputnikmusic)\n",
        "\nOver their careers, many big bands change the style of music they play. Metallica, once the biggest thrash metal band in the world, softened up their sound to a more accessible, mainstream style of metal. Judas Priest changed their sound many, many times; with styles ranging from classic metal, to a more hard rock sound, as well as speed metal, and even a stint in hair metal. Even Gothenburg Metallers, In Flames, have experimented with new sounds. \n\nMegadeth, one of the \"Big Four\" bands of thrash metal also changed up their music. The band had released four excellent thrash albums, with two of them being considered thrash masterpieces, Rust in Peace in 1990 and Peace Sells\u2026But Who's Buying in 1988. In 1992, the band opted for a more accessible release, entered the studio, and came out with Countdown to Extinction, the band's most successful album to date. Countdown to Extinction reached #2 in the American charts. In the long run, this was probably the worst thing that could have happened to the band. According to the album's linear notes, Megadeth's main man, Dave Mustaine, was very upset that the album didn't hit the coveted #1 spot in the charts. The band wanted to reach #1 so much that they got progressively poppier until their 1999 album, Risk. None of the albums coming after Countdown \u2013 Youthanasia, Cryptic Writings, and Risk \u2013 ever reached #1, and none of them sold as well as Countdown to Extinction either.\n\nJust like when Metallica released the famous Black Album, detractors of Megadeth screamed \"sellout\" after the release of the album. But there is none of that here. With Countdown to Extinction, Megadeth still produced some excellent metal. This time, rather than recording a heavy, technical riff-fest like they did on Rust in Peace, Dave and Co. played simpler, more melodic tunes that will appeal more to the average listener. Songs such as Captive Honour, Countdown to Extinction, and This Was My Life, displayed this more melodic approach to metal, particularly the title track, with its fantastic bridges and interludes. But the album still showcases a heavier side to Megadeth. Songs such as Architecture of Aggression, Pyschotron, Ashes in Your Mouth, and Megadeth's biggest hit, Symphony of Destruction, prove to listeners that the band still retains its heaviness. Also remaining on Countdown are Marty Friedman's amazing guitar solos. While he doesn\u2019t shred like he does on Hangar 18 or Holy Wars\u2026The Punishment Due, he has some exciting moments on the album such as the solo in Symphony of Destruction, or Ashes in Your Mouth.\n\nCountdown to Extinction is home to some of Megadeth's strangest moments and songs. The first is one of the singles, Sweating Bullets. The song starts off with a simple, yet eerie guitar riff, which is followed by a long spoken section in which Dave talks to himself. The spoken section is bitter and sarcastic, mocking Dave and how he lives. The spoken part represents the split personalities and voices that may or may not have actually been inside Dave's head at the time. The album contains several of these spoken sections, and at times the can be pretty entertaining. \"Well me, it's been nice talking to myself\"\u2026 The band would explore this technique again in a later song titled, Dread and the Fugitive Mind. Another slightly odd part of Countdown to Extinction shows up on the tenth song, Captive Honour. The song contains an amusing dialogue between the band members with the scene depicting an on going trial at a courthouse. The dialogue fits into the song's themes, and reminds me of all those short tracks in between songs in a concept album that are there merely to move the story along (See Blind Guardian's Nightfall in Middle Earth, it\u2019s got a dozen of them). \n\nI like Dave's vocals on Countdown to Extinction a lot more than on any other album. Dave Mustaine's singing style is a love it or hate it kind of thing. Those who enjoy listening to Dave belt out the his lyrics in Rust in Peace or Peace Sells will love his singing in Countdown, while those who dislike them will have to look for some other redeeming quality in the music, as Megadeth relies on Dave's singing quite a lot. In my opinion, his vocals are at their best, especially on the title track, Architecture of Aggression, and Captive Honour. Dave's voice sounds really great with the melodic style of music found on this album, and are as catchy as they will ever be. I think his vocals are more suited to the lighter sound of Countdown, Youthanasia, and Cryptic Writings, rather than the gritty, harsher vocals needed for an album like Killing is My Business.\n\nCountdown to Extinction was Megadeth's first step into the world of mainstream music. Despite softening up the sound, the music still remains enjoyable and the band still maintains its identity, something that the band lacked in albums like Risk. Though the band opted for a lighter album (and it isn't exactly light to begin with) traces of the bands former thrash metal sound can still be found on songs such as Architecture of Aggression or Ashes in Your Mouth. Countdown to Extinction is no Rust in Peace, but it is a very enjoyable ride that anybody can enjoy.\n\n(Originally written for Sputnikmusic)\n",
        "\nMegadeth is a band every metalhead knows. Whether you're a fan of thrash or not, chances are you've at least heard of Dave Mustaine's infamous feud with colossal metal band, Metallica. The feud, in a way, helped create the band that Dave Mustaine has toiled in for over twenty years. Dave started Megadeth to get back at his former band mates (and because he was no longer in a band, but most people tend to ignore this). Dave wanted to be faster, heavier, and more successful than Metallica. Save for mainstream success, he pretty much succeeded with the band's 1990 release, Rust in Peace. Heavy, fast, technical, Rust in Peace has it all, and is widely considered to be one of thrash metal's finest albums.\n\nSongwriting is top notch on Rust in Peace, and is anyone really surprised? Back in the day Dave Mustaine wrote some of the thrashiest riffs on albums such as Kill 'Em All, Killing is my Business, and Peace Sells\u2026But Who's Buying. But he steps up is performance on Rust in Peace. Each song on the album, save Dawn Patrol (a song with just drums, bass, and vocals), contains the best riffs Dave has ever written. Just check out the album's third song, Take No Prisoners. The song is very fast, and contains violent riffs, perfect for headbanging. Another excellent example of Rust in Peace's riffs is the fourth song, Five Magics. The song has a blistering two minute instrumental before Dave Mustaine's vocals kick in, leaving the band an excellent opportunity to show their stuff. If you're a fan of thrashy riffs than look no further than Rust in Peace. \n\nAnother big reason why Rust in Peace is such a good album is guitarist Marty Friedman. Marty's skill on the guitar is by far the highest of any member of Megadeth; past, present, and most likely future. By pairing Marty Friedman with Dave Mustaine, Megadeth suddenly had one of the most potent duos in the scene. Need proof? Just check out the last two to three minutes of the second song on the album, Hangar 18. The guitar-off between Marty and Dave is one of the album's best moments. Another impressive solo from Friedman comes up during Tornado of Souls. Quite possibly my favourite solo of them all, it is one of Marty's more melodic solos. The actual solo is slower than a lot of the other solos you'll find on Rust in Peace for the most part, but just as enjoyable, proving that Marty doesn't have to shred to impress. \n\nMany people who listen to Megadeth are not fans of Dave's vocals. It's not too hard to see why, especially on songs such as Take No Prisoners and Poison Was the Cure. While they aren't bad outings, Dave's snarling vocal technique at times feels incoherent (as in Poison Was the Cure) or just plain bad. However he shines during at certain moments too. Dave has some of his best vocal outings in the opening track, Holy Wars\u2026The Punishment Due, particularly during the latter, as well as Tornado of Souls, which is perhaps the most emotional song on the album. That sad, I only have the remaster version of the album, which features different vocal tracks on some of the songs, so I'm not sure how good or bad his vocals are in the original.\n\nIf I had any complaints about Rust in Peace, it would be the song lengths. Some of the songs are too damn short. Poison Was the Cure is an excellent song and builds up great momentum, yet is only 2:56 long. Lucretia, another superb effort from the band just misses the four minute mark, which is disappointing, as it is one of the album's most enjoyable tracks to listen to. The only track I can safely say that I'm glad is short is Dawn Patrol, which seems more like a filler than anything else. As mentioned before, the song consists only of drums, a bass line, and some of Mustaine's worst vocals. Ever. The song clocks in at 1:51, which is more than enough time.\n\nOverall, Rust in Peace is a thrash classic, and easily Megadeth's best album. It features Megadeth at their best, with technical riffing, very impressive shredding and soloing, and some nice bass work. Though Megadeth doesn\u2019t fall completely off the face of the planet with their next album, as hard as they try the band will not match their maximum opus, Rust in Peace, nor do they even record an album that sounding similar. The band claims that the next Megadeth album could fit into the band's RiP - CtE era (as well as some more commercial elements), but can it top Rust in Peace? Unlikely, but we'll just have to wait and see. \n\n(Originally written for Sputnikmusic)\n",
        "\nThe World Needs a Hero is supposed to be Megadeth\u2019s return to a more metal sound \u2013 according to all the hype that surrounded the release of the album. In reality (without media hype) The World Needs a Hero is a really eclectic mix of influences, sounds, and styles of music. I would say overall it\u2019s probably more \u201cmetal\u201d then some previous releases.\n\nThere is a definitely a mix of different sounding songs on The World Needs a Hero. The album may not have fluidity to it but you never know what the next song is going to sound like \u2013 which is fun in its own way. It does allow the album to be fresh for multiple listenings \u2013 but as a Megadeth fan, this album isn\u2019t solid.\n\nDave Mustaine has done a lot in his life and with the music of Megadeth I expect a little experimentation. One can hear plenty of different concepts in work on The World Needs a Hero. There are more classic metal sounding tracks (\u201cDisconnect\u201d) but there is more of a focus on the groove with The World Needs a Hero than before. There is heavy riffing the leads do take a slight back seat to the main structure of the songs. Songs like \u201cThe World Needs a Hero\u201d and \u201cMoto-psycho\u201d have major grooves and focus on that. The guitar work is well done on all the music (even the acoustic/Spanish style on Silent Scorn) and Al Pitrelli (his only Megadeth work) does amazing solos with Dave. \n\nOne track that stands out (especially since they all are so different) is \u201cPromises.\u201d It\u2019s a ballad that has violins and a very epic and sad feel to it. I found at first I thought, \u201coh how sappy.\u201d But afterwards I wanted to listen to it again. It\u2019s really thoughtful and even though it\u2019s not \u201cmetal\u201d in that way \u2013 it\u2019s still an amazing song. \n\nBoth the bass work and drumming have a new focus on The World Needs a Hero. With the new \u201cgroove\u201d lens, this allows the structuring elements of the music to take a step forward. This gives this album a unique feel in the Megadeth catalog. \n\nDave Mustaine does some interesting vocal things on The World Needs a Hero. He seems to do a lot more layering of his vocals lines. He does echoes in the vocals along with an entire track of spoken word. Which is fine \u2013 but the track is a little long to do the entire thing in spoken lines. Luckily the lyrics of that track help with the spoken words because Dave is an amazing lyricist. There is nothing too new on this album \u2013 the lyrics are shady representations of life, politics, speed, and basic anger issues. I love reading Megadeth lyrics because they are well thought out and applicable to story-telling. \n\nIt\u2019s very strange that such a wishy-washy album could be catchy. Megadeth\u2019s use of a variety of tempos, guitar tones, and even violins and trumpets allows this album to be an eclectic (but fun) mixture. It\u2019s not as \u201cmetal\u201d as one would hope but there are some standout tracks even if the entire album isn\u2019t powerful.\n\nSongs to check out: Disconnect, Dread and the Fugitive Mind, Promises.\n",
        "\nMegadeth are back (well Dave Mustaine is anyway) and the band is sounding more metal than they have in a long, long time. I have been a long time Megadeth fan so this review does contain a little bias \u2013 that in itself is not that uncommon in unofficial reviews. The System Has Failed isn\u2019t a return to form or a return to its roots. Simply put \u2013 The System Has Failed is modern Megadeth with thrashier tendencies. Don\u2019t expect Rust in Peace 2 or anything like that.\n\nMusically, The System Has Failed is varied in its form and presentation. There are tracks that feel more hard rock than metal and there is also tracks that sound thrash more than what we are used to from newer Megadeth. The guitar parts are definitely leaning towards a thrashier form than found on the last few albums. Part of this is the return of Chris Poland for the recording sessions. His presence is felt considerably when one listens to all the leads that are present in the guitar work. Dave Mustaine\u2019s guitar work is well constructed and the structure of the songs has taken another step up since Megadeth\u2019s last album. More of a modern thrash sound for the guitars, if you will.\n\nOne element that The System Has Failed lacks is phenomenal drumming parts. Now that Dave Mustaine is writing almost all of the music himself (not that he didn\u2019t do it for the most part prior) the drums don\u2019t feel as expressive as they previously did. Neither does the bass lines \u2013 although the bass parts do feel a little more natural than the drum parts. \n\nAnother aspect musically that I found confusing was the use of keyboards on the song \u201cThe Scorpion.\u201d It really threw me off my rocker because I thought Dave despised using keyboards. It\u2019s a interesting addition \u2013 as far as I can hear it\u2019s only on one track and it makes it stand out. I like it, personally. I find it adds a little variety to the album.\n\nVocally, Dave Mustaine is still the same old gruff and spastic singing. Either you like his singing or you don\u2019t. It can grow on you (it did me) but on first listen it may sound a little strange. It\u2019s an old school thrash idea of singing and he has kept it for a long time. \n\nThere are a couple of moments in the song writing I would like to make comments about. First of all, I personally don\u2019t like it when a band takes a full on political stance and blurts it out into the open. I think Megadeth are one of the best politically influenced bands that avoids this. They make political statements that are ambiguous enough that the listener has to put forth a little thought and opinion. It makes you think about politics not just follow politics. I also love the personal issues that are brought up in songs like \u201cOf Mice and Men\u201d or \u201cSomething I\u2019m Not.\u201d (I believe that song to be a personal stab at Metallica \u2013 but who\u2019s to say?) \n\nThere are some moments on this album that I went\u2026WHA? \u201cI Know Jack\u201d in particular made me stop \u2013 it\u2019s kind of out of place on the album and slows the flow of the album down. It\u2019s a cool guitar line but overall since the first listen I skip it. \n\nOverall this is a particularly interesting album \u2013 a modern thrash album of political and personal elements. It is almost a return to form for Megadeth, but not quite. There are moments of great pleasure and moments of disappointment scattered throughout the album. It\u2019s a great starting place for new Megadeth fans \u2013 but it\u2019s still not going to thrill the old ones. \n\nSongs to check out: Blackmail the Universe, Kick the Chair, Back in the Day.\n",
        "\nMegadeth\u2019s best? Perhaps. Either way, it\u2019s tied for first place with \u2018Peace Sells.\u2019 In my book, these guys are (were?) the masters of thrash. Metallica can\u2019t even compare to them. Metal Church comes close, but no. Dave Mustaine is a genius at songwriting, and this album proves it.\n\nThere is usually only one album of each genre that deserves a score of a perfect 100. For example, in the power metal genre, that honor belongs to Helloween\u2019s Second Keeper. In traditional metal, that\u2019s Dio\u2019s \u2018Holy Diver.\u2019 In thrash\u2026 we have Rust In Peace. This album is thrash perfection, and let me start of by complimenting the songwriting.\n\nSongwriting is definitely something that deserves compliments, and PLENTY of them. Mustaine is\u2026 just\u2026 amazing. No other way to describe it. The solos are flawless. The choruses are flawless. Everything here is just as it needs to be. All the songs open up great. Let\u2019s take Megadeth\u2019s hit \u2018Hangar 18,\u2019 for example. It opens up in a fairly simple series of power chords; easy riffs, yet highly memorable. The percussion in the background is perfect, slowly building up the necessary atmosphere, and then the song erupts into a solo. Then another. Then another. At a minute into the song, Dave Mustaine starts to sing, \u201cWelcome to our fortress tall!!!\u201d At a minute and twenty seconds the chorus starts, and soon after more solos. The transitions between the openings, solos, choruses, and closings of each song is so smooth and flawless. There is no sudden halt, a split second pause, and then a jump to a chorus, as I see happening very often on trash records. Nothing of that sort here. Mustaine wrote is all perfectly.\n\nOf course, there\u2019s the production that needs some compliments too. As always should be expected from Megadeth, the production is crystal-clear. The mixing, especially that of the guitars, is also worthy of praise. The drums mixed in the background are nice and crunchy, without drowning out either the guitars or Mustaine\u2019s vocals, so this is definitely a great success.\n\nAnother great plus of this CD is the overall quality of each song. As you might probably guess from the perfect 100 score, there are no fillers on this album. Each song is a success, and that\u2019s a rare thing indeed. All the way from the legendary \u2018Holy Wars\u2026 The Punishment Due\u2019 to \u2018Rust In Peace\u2026 Polaris,\u2019 each song is a trash masterpiece, and I never find myself wanting to press the skip button. Listening to this whole album, beginning to end, is definitely not a problem.\n\nAhh, that is one point I cannot stress enough. This whole album is filled with classics BEGINNING TO END. As I mentioned, it starts with \u2018Holy Wars,\u2019 an unforgettable Megadeth classic. Then it goes to \u2018Hangar 18,\u2019 perhaps Megadeth\u2019s most known song off of this album. Next we get \u2018Take No Prisoners\u2026\u2019 Another classic. More great songs, more greats songs, until we get to the killer off the album, \u2018Rust In Peace\u2026 Polaris.\u2019 (Have you ever wondered how come Megadeth uses so many periods in so many track titles? This always baffled me\u2026)\n\nObviously, guitarplaying on this album is godly. I shouldn\u2019t even need to go over this, but I have to make clear. NO ONE SHREDS LIKE MEGADETH. Both Dave Mustaine and Marty Friedman are two incomparable guitarists, and the chances of both such legends being in the same band is nothing short of amazing. Each riff is new and fresh. Each solo better than the last; original, fast, and memorable.\n\nYes, Megadeth\u2019s \u2018Rust In Peace\u2019 has it all. This is the album that first got me into thrash, and forever will remain amongst not only my favorite thrash albums, but my favorite albums of all time. It\u2019s a shame no one writes stuff like this anymore, and it\u2019s another shame Megadeth never again came close to writing such a work of art.\n\n-Marcin C.\n",
        "\nMegadeth has always been in my top 10 favorite bands. Releasing classics like \u2018Rust In Peace,\u2019 \u2018Peace Sells\u2026 But Who\u2019s Buying?,\u2019 \u2018So Far, So Good\u2026 So What?,\u2019 \u2018Killing Is My Business\u2026 And Business Is Good!\u2019 and\u2026 yes, \u2018Countdown To Extinction.\u2019\n\nMany fans consider this the album when Megadeth finally sold out. I don\u2019t. \u2018Countdown To Extinction\u2019 may be their last amazing thrash record, and it is definitely not bad. It does have its weaker sides, but it also does contain many unforgettable songs.\n\nFirst of, let me start of by saying this album IS slower than Megadeth\u2019s previous releases. It IS less heavy. But that is not necessarily bad. It does have many pluses as well. \u2019Countdown To Extinction\u2019 is also Dave Mustaine and Co.\u2019s catchiest release, and something that will stay with you for some time.\n\nThere are a couple songs on this album that are necessary to mention. Firstly\u2026 \u2018Symphony Of Destruction.\u2019 Although not as heavy and raw as anything off of \u2018Rust In Peace,\u2019 \u2018Symphony Of Destruction\u2019 does have a strong riff base, good rhythm, and a very catchy flow overall. Perhaps something not expected from Megadeth, but it is not a bad change at all. \u2018Sweating Bullets\u2019 is another important song on here, as it is probably the catchiest song Megadeth has ever written. It starts off with a couple good riffs, and suddenly we hear Mustaine talking to himself, starting out yet another great song.\n\n\u2018This Was My Life\u2019 is another great and catchy song, as is the title track, \u2018Countdown To Extinction.\u2019 Although it does seem a bit more commercialized, it is nowhere NEAR as commercial as, say, Metallica\u2019s Black Album, which was released around the same time. And yes, compared to the Black Album, \u2018Countdown To Extinction\u2019 is better by far.\n\nDave Mustaine\u2019s voice and style of singing didn\u2019t change much on this release from the previous ones, and his singing is the same raspy scratchy voice that we\u2019re all used to and that most of us love. As I said, the huge change in this album is the catchiness. The choruses are catchy. The solos are catchy. The riffs are catchy. Every goddamn thing on this album is catchy! It is obvious that Dave Mustaine and Co. were trying to go for a top seller, and attempted to give us something memorable and more enjoyable to the public rather than just thrash lovers. Because yes, this album does have more rock elements and less metal than the other Megadeth releases.\n\nAnother thing I found I loved on here is the production. Especially on the releases, the sound is crystal-clear and perfect. Mixing is great as well, which provide a great listening experience. Of course, all of Megadeth\u2019s albums are known for their amazing production.\n\nAgain, let me go back to describing one song. \u2018Ashes In Your Mouth\u2019 is the last song on the album, and it is probably the best song on the album. No, this one does not contain any rock elements, or at least, not nearly as many as the other tracks. This song is pure thrash, and seems like something that could easily belong on \u2018Rust In Peace.\u2019 It\u2019s funny how Mustaine put the songs right there at the end of the album, almost unnoticeable.\n\nSo, what are some of the bad elements? Other than the couple songs I mentioned I liked, the rest are just alright. There are a couple song on here whose major problem is that they are trying to be so\u2026 soft. Perhaps to be radio-friendly? That would be my guess. And I don\u2019t like it. It\u2019s obvious Mustaine wrote half of the album to be radio-friendly and commercial, while the other half he attempted to stay true to his fans. (Such as in \u2018Ashes In Your Mouth.\u2019) Although the more commercialized songs aren\u2019t technically that bad, they do have a tendency to start to bore you if you listen to them more than like three times, and in the end you tend to skip them, making them fillers, although they were never intended that way by Mustaine.\n\nOverall, it IS a good album. Some changes from Megadeth, but nothing that\u2019s not worth giving a listen and adjusting to. Hell, you might find to like some of the changes. If not\u2026 It\u2019s still Megadeth. You can definitely hear their older stuff included in here too. Think of it as a slightly slower yet catchier \u2018Rust In Peace.\u2019 ;)\n\n-Marcin C.\n",
        "\nMegadeth followed up their mildly disappointing 1988 album \u201cSo Far, So Good\u2026So What?\u201d with the masterful 1990 album \u201cRust in Peace\u201d. But once again between albums the guitarist, this time Jeff Young, and drummer, this time Chuck Behler, where fired and replaced, just as the same happened after \u201cPeace Sells\u2026But Who\u2019s Buying?\u201d. Who replaced theses vacant spots? Well, on guitar you have \u201cthe purple and pink haired\u201d Marty Friedman, best known for his shredding prowess displayed on his 1988 solo album along with his work with Jason Becker in Cacophony. Nick Menza, a relative unknown was brought in to fill the vacant drummers chair. Little did Megadeths fans, or did the guys in Megadeth themselves realize that this lineup would become the most skilled, hailed, stable and critically successful lineup in Megadeth\u2019s history. \n\nBut let\u2019s return to \u201cRust in Peace\u201d. Simply put this is one of the single most explosive displays of virtuous talent, brilliant songwriting, and one of the most cohesive thrash metal albums ever!\n\nAnd of course with the addition of Marty Friedman, the fret work on this album is the highlight. Both guitarists seem to have a defined role that each is comfortable with, making the tag team effort of each that much better. Both Mustaine and Friedman burn through amazing fret burning solos with ease and impeccable speed due to their collective jaw-dropping skill.\n\nAlso, with the addition of more skilled instrumentalists, Megadeth could write and execute more complex, challenging compositions, clearly evident on \u201cRust in Peace\u201d. Also, with this new found ability to write and execute more complex music, the focus shifts away the lyrics or vocals, which have never been a strong spot for Megadeth. But that said, the lyrics are fairly good, maybe due to the fact that they don\u2019t have to be the main focus and become more fluent and natural and less forced.\n\nAnd with all the focus on the guitars it\u2019s easy to imagine that the rhythm section of bassist Dave Ellefson and drummer Nick Menza are merely second though on this album. But they aren\u2019t, the guitars on this album are the highlight, but without the rhythm section those guitars would devolve into aimless shredding. The rhythm is a driving force and helps the guitars in turn become much more interesting. So in many senses the rhythm section is just as important on \u201cRust in Peace\u201d than any other part.\n\nAs for highlight material, you don\u2019t have to wait that far to find it, as the first two songs, \u201cHoly Wars\u2026The Punishment Due\u201d and \u201cHangar 18\u201d, respectively, are absolute killer tracks! The rest of the tracks aren\u2019t a letdown by any means, but in a sense, they are almost too consistent. Not that they sound the same, it\u2019s just that one of the things that made some Megadeth albums good was the range of material. \u201cTake no Prisoners\u201d is another standout, along with the title track \u201cRust in Peace\u2026Polaris\u201d.\n\nOverall, \u201cRust in Peace\u201d is one the best albums that the thrash era graced us with, and is one of Megadeth\u2019s finest moments. If you ever want to call yourself a true fan of Megadeth, this album is essential.\n",
        "\nEverything about this album shows that it's nothing more than an average release. From the terrible production to the temporary line-up, this album looked like it wasn't anything special. The fact that it lies between arguably Megadeth's two greatest records (Rust In Peace and Peace Sells....But Who's Buying?) doesn't help solidify its presence as a top notch record.\n\nHowever, despite all of the negative critics and the poor ratings, this is one of Megadeth's most underrated and best records. Dave Mustaine enters the studio having replaced fusion guitarist Chris Poland with a classically trained guitarist since the age of six. A man by the name of Jeff Young. Another roster change was made when Gar Samuelson was fired for apparent substance abuse and replaced by his drum tech Chuck Behler. \n\nWith the new line-up and the creative juices flowing, Dave Mustaine wrote some of Megadeth's greatest songs for this record. From the opening track, the instrumental \"Into the Lungs of Hell\" which features fast-paced, palm muted riffs and improvised soloing, to the closing track written about music censorship \"Hook In Mouth\", the album delivers a rollercoaster ride of emotion. The album also features a cover of The Sex Pistols song \"Anarchy In The U.K.\" which provides a nice break from the serious thrash of songs before and after the cover.\n\nOne of the more notable songs on the record, and perhaps one of Megadeth's best songs \"In My Darkest Hour\" showcases over 6 minutes of the perfect blend of emotion and thrash. This song was written for fallen Metallica bassist and friend of Dave's, Cliff Burton (R.I.P.). \"In My Darkest Hour\" deserves to be considered an elite track with the likes of \"Hangar 18\", \"Symphony Of Destruction\", and their MTV hit \"Peace Sells\". However due to poor initial reception of the record, the song is vastly over looked.\n\nHowever with the 2004 remasters done by Dave Mustaine, the record can polish some of the rough patches that diminished the quality and initial appreciation. The record provides many great songs and is a lost classic. With all that said, this is a must have for any fan of thrash. I gave the album an 85 because of its production. Even with the 2004 remasters, some of the tracks had to be altered. Which means leaving the original tracks in their current (and sub-par produced) state.\n\nFavorite Track: In My Darkest Hour\nLeast Favorite: Into The Lungs of Hell (a top notch track, however it is too short!)\n",
        "\nEveryone knows the story of Dave Mustaines unceremonious ousting from Metallica right before recording their debut. And most could understand the feelings of Dave Mustaine at this time: anger, frustration, rage, passion, hostility, the list goes on. So it comes as no surprise that Megadeth\u2019s debut, \u201cKilling is My Business\u2026..And Business is Good!\u201d, contains a hostile edge throughout. \n\nWith \u201cKilling is My Business\u2026..And Business is Good!\u201d Megadeth embarked on a journey that over time lead them to become top dog of the metal community. However, on this we still have young, excited, possibly unfocused, musicians. Those qualities result in a brew of primal, raging thrash, but not the best material they would make in their career.\n\nAlso, Dave Mustaines vocals, never his strongest asset, sound amateurish at best. Latter on it developed into a sarcastic sneer, but at this point it\u2019s still just a whine. However he provides a very solid rhythm and lead guitar role, and while not the refined style of later work, it works very good on this album. \n\nWhat about the rest of the band? Well, Dave Ellefson\u2019s bass work is solid on \u201cKilling is My Business\u2026..And Business is Good!\u201d, but just like the rest of the band, it\u2019s a pretty raw offering from him. Chris Poland provides a solid, but largely unspectacular, performance on guitar. And lastly is drummer Gar Samuelson, who provides, as it seems all the members did, a solid, yet unspectacular performance. \n\nAs for the material on \u201cKilling is My Business\u2026..And Business is Good!\u201d, its exactly what you would expect from Megadeth, just a lot rawer. There is a lot of undeveloped songs present, and it has very little virtuosity emphasis on later albums. But the upside of the this lack of emphasis on technical skill lets the raw anger drive this album. As far as for highlights of \u201cKilling is My Business\u2026..And Business is Good!\u201d, there are the opener \u201cLast Rites/Loved to Death\u201d, \u201cSkull Beneath the Skin\u201d, and \u201cMechanix\u201d. Most of the other songs, while not necessarily lacking, are just kind of there. Also, the Nancy Sinatra cover in \u201cThese Boots\u201d is barely more than a joke, and the edited version on the remastered edition is negligible.\n\nOverall \u201cKilling is My Business\u2026..And Business is Good!\u201d is a solid, but largely unspectacular album. And for those who must compare it to Metallicas debut, \u201cKill \u2018Em All\u201d, they were no doubt ahead of them, however we must remember that Dave Mustaine largely helped make that album too. So for fans of thrash this is an essential release, despite its shortcomings.\n",
        "\nAfter a successful album in The System Has Failed, Megadeth comes back with a strong single off of their highly-anticipated album United Abominations. \"Gears of War\" is an electrifying song straight from the start. The introduction begins with a bone-chilling guitar entrance, and then comes the hard, chugging guitar riffs. Then you hear the chant, \"Gears of War\". The song's lyrics are very reminiscent of the video games content and reflect the mood perfectly.\n\nDave Mustaine's vocals fit perfectly with the tone of the song. Mustaine and Glen Drover both also deliver a great guitar solo towards the end of the track. The drumming by Shawn Drover is also very entertaining. It's not too fast, but not too slow. It's a great single off of the upcoming album and I think Megadeth will definitely make an impact with this track. Long Live Megadeth!\n",
        "\nAs most of you know, at one time Megadeth was a huge band amongst metal heads. One of the supposed Big 4 of Thrash they were hailed as. The released monumental albums such as Peace Sells\u2026But Who's Buying and Rust in Peace. But then, suddenly the band's ideals changed. In 1992 the band released Countdown to Extinction. It went double platinum and hit #2 in the US charts. With the music chart's singing its siren song, main man Dave Mustaine vowed to hit coveted #1 spot. No matter what the cost\u2026As result, the thrashy edge that was found on Rust in Peace and its predeccessors began to disappear. By 1999's Risk, it had disappeared entirely. And the band had not achieved a #1 spot in the charts. Whoops. Rather than rolling around in the prestige they had anticipated, Megadeth instead had only succeeded in alienating their fans and forgetting their roots, where they came from. Going by what fans will tell you, sales, what Mustaine will tell you, or what nearly anybody else would tell you, Risk is most definitely an awful, awful album. Easily a 1 right? \n\n\nWell, not quite\u2026\n\n\nSure, the band had pretty much abandoned metal in every way, shape, and form. Even more so than the legendary Metallica. There are no technical riffs to be found. There is no shredding. The heaviest song on the album, Prince of Darkness, would have been labelled as a ballad if it appeared on Rust in Peace or Peace Sells. So why rate Risk as a metal album? Why compare it to past Megadeth albums? Way back when I first heard this, like many, I detested it and the path that Megadeth had taken. But that was awhile ago, and since then I've softened up, and given other genres of rock music a chance. Unsurprisingly, when I came back to this album, I enjoyed it a hell of a lot more than I did before. Since then, I've come to the realization that Risk is a great album. Not the band's best of course, but still great.\n\n\nRisk will appeal more to the fans of modern rock than that of metal. The music is a lot mellower than anything the band has done, past or present. With that said, the album starts off with a harder edge. The first 4 tracks include some of the album's roughest, fastest moments. Crush Em in particular is one of the album's best songs. I seem to be alone on this when I say that Crush Em is a superb song. The chorus, the lyrics, the riffs, everything stands out. Then again, that could be just a personal bias, as Crush Em was my first Megadeth song. Anyways, after three heavy hitters; Insomnia, Prince of Darkness, and Crush Em, the album moves into a more accessible, mellow section. It is here that songs such as I'll Be There for You, Wanderlust, and Ecstasy prove to be standout tracks. Despite being softer cuts, they are very energetic and they are part of the reason why they are so memorable. Another element that contributes to the excellence of these songs is the emotion that they show. Though it is pretty cheesy, (especially the cringe worthy spoken part in the middle, meh), the song I'll Be There for You drips with emotional lyrics and inspiring, happy sounding vocals and riffs. Provided that you give it the chance, the song will get you into a good mood. This is where Risk truly shines; with simple, laidback tracks such as this. \n\n\nAs the band is no longer focused on pumping out intense riff after intense riff, solo after solo, Megadeth was forced to look for something new to spearhead their music. The band turned to Dave's singing. Though the vocals are a love it or hate it affair, I must say, I really enjoyed them here. With more vocal responsibilities, Mustaine not only doesn't cave in under pressure, he delivers. With the singing in the forefront, songs such I'll Be There for You or Crush Em are suddenly much more interesting. Particularly during the choruses is when the vocals stand out the most. If you dislike the vocals on other Megadeth albums, Risk won't do anything to change your opinion. For those who do enjoy Dave's singing, Risk will be a treat to listen to, as it is often the centrepiece of the song.\n\n\nRisk is a very big departure from Megadeth's familiar sound. Even the band themselves realized this, as they attempted to return to a more metal influenced sound on their next album. For this reason, Risk drew bad reviews from, well, everybody. Everyone's got their own opinion on the record, but if you're asking me, I'd respond by telling you to keep an open mind while listening. Don't expect it to cater to your thrash metal needs, as it contains very little, if any elements from their days as a state of the art metal band. Rather, the album is a very good modern rock album, which definitely appeals more to the casual rock fan. Not the band's finest album, but not terrible either. \n(Originally written for Sputnikmusic)\n",
        "\nWhile this is not quite as good as the first two Megadeth albums, it still beats the pants off of most everything that followed. Dave Mustaine could still write killer riffs, vicious leads, and some of the nastiest and most sarcastic lyrics (\"Liar\" and \"Hook In Mouth\" come to mind immediately) out there; Dave Ellefson still was cranking out some badass bass work with sharp tone that didn't just follow a mindless 8th-note pattern into the ground or follow the guitars. This, for me anyway, was the last gasp of Megadeth as a vital and powerful band in the international metal scene. \n\nNew recruits Jeff Young and Chuck Behler did a competent job, but ultimately were not as inspired as their predecessors, Chris Poland and Gar Samuelson. Young's leads were chaotic and scattershot, not cohesive or terribly memorable, and Behler's drumming was unimaginative. A shame, because the booming drum sound really dominates and deserved a better drum performance. They hold back this album from really killing in the long run. \n\nThere are still some magnificent moments on this album nonetheless, such as opener \"Into The Lungs Of Hell\", an excellent instrumental; the moody and creepy tandem of \"Mary Jane\" and \"In My Darkest Hour\"; the thrash/stomp monster, \"Hook In Mouth\"; the scalding \"Liar\". But the cover of \"Anarchy in the UK\" is weak and entirely too fast and comes off as weaker and more foo-foo than the original, a right nut-kicker of a song to this day even nearly 20 years after the fact. Even Steve Jones' appearance on this song is tacit and perfunctory at best. You can tell that the drugs and drinking were taking effect at long last and it was making the music suffer. \n\nPaul Lani's production favors the drums, as mentioned, and while this is good, the guitars are thin in comparison. The bass still sounds good, razor-sharp and clean like vintage Chris Squire, though, and this is a plus in a world where the 4-string wrangler is usually buried beneath the guitars. Mustaine himself is in fine form vocally, his customary high-pitched squawk/snarl approach not changing at all as he rattles off his barbed lyrics with contempt and vitriol. But still, this album comes off as not as fiendishly creative and energetic as the first two in the long run; I can detect a tiredness and ennui creeping in beneath the surface. Perhaps they were realizing that Metallica had outdone them in the popularity/influence sweepstakes and the seeds of their selling out were starting to bloom...\n\nEverything that follows this LP, as mentioned, is weak and unworthy of the Megadeth name. Don't bother with anything after this one, the last gasp of the \"true\" Megadeth.\n",
        "\nMegadeth became one of the most powerful thrash bands in the 1980's and early 1990's after they released a barrage of successful records including \"Peace Sells...But Whose Buying?\" and the masterful \"Rust In Peace,\" yet the album placed between these two masterpieces is the most forgotten and underrated of Megadeth's career. Many people forget about \"So Far, So Good...So What!\" because it followed these two important albums, yet I consider it the best release out of Megadeth's first four records. The year was 1988 and Megadeth's need to make some metal was combined with high dosages of testosterone to create an album that had balls the size of Jupiter; that LP was \"So Far, So Good...So What!\"\n\nIn terms of the music, this is a straight up thrash record with some nice hints of speed metal and melody. If there's one thing that Megadeth did different on this album, it was the added quantity of melody and technicality. \"Mary Jane,\" \"Set The World Afire,\" and \"Liar\" have some semi-melodic thrash riffs that make them stand out from the standard thrash song. \"502\" is a relentless burst of technical thrash as Dave Mustaine and Jeff Young hit a storm of notes during the song's chorus. \"Mary Jane\" also falls under the complex category because of the various riffs Mustaine and Young sway in and out of. Bands that are looking to cover a non-metal song should take Megadeth's cover of \"Anarchy In The UK\" as a prime model; Megadeth takes the Sex Pistols classic and warps into a tornado of speed and thrash riffs with some incredible leads.\n\nLyrically and vocally speaking, this is one of Megadeth's best efforts. Mustaine takes a stab at censorship on \"Hook In Mouth\" by mocking its flaws and procedures, yet he manages to sound both intelligent and angry. Mustaine's suicidal ode to the late Metallica bassist Cliff Burton on \"In My Darkest Hour\" is one of the most famed metal lyrics because of its dark mood and depressive lyrics. \"Mary Jane\" appears to be about weed at hindsight, but it's actually a tale about witchcraft. Dave Mustaine certainly isn't the best singer in the metal world, but his voice is perfect for this album. Dave's raspy voice slices right into the heart of these songs with an aggressive and hostile tone. His voice can get rather humorous at times, but he does a great allaround job singing on \"So Far, So Good...So What!\"\n\nThere is some controversy about this LP because it mainly consists of material that was left out of the first Megadeth records. \"Set The World Afire\" is rumored to be the first song Dave Mustaine wrote after he was ejected from Metallica. \"Into The Lungs Of Hell,\" \"Mary Jane\" and \"Hook In Mouth\" were also written well before this recording, yet they are all the strong songs and undisputed Megadeth classics.\n\nI personally think \"So Far, So Good...So What!\" is one Megadeth's best efforts. Everything that defines Megadeth's musicianship is present and it won't let you down. \"So Far, So Good...So What!\" may not be the most recognized Megadeth release, but it's certainly one of their best. Pick this one up! \n\nThis review was written for: http://www.Thrashpit.com\n",
        "\nI don\u2019t consider this Megadeth\u2019s most classic album, but it\u2019s damn near close. With the addition of Marty Friedman on lead guitar, Megadeth became pretty much the most talented and most technical thrash band of their time. Rust in Peace is easily among the genre\u2019s fastest, heaviest, and most intricate offerings and pretty much an undisputed example of thrash metal virtuosity at its finest. \n\nNaturally, the guitar work is the highlight of this album. The riffing is fast and intricate, as is the songwriting. Some of the band\u2019s most complex passages are included here and definitely some of their heaviest rhythm work. Guitar solos are frequent and unbelievable. Every one is beautifully crafted and masterfully written. The Mustaine/Friedman tag team is the band\u2019s most complementary duo, their lead styles mixing incredibly well. And guitar solos are definitely frequent. \u201cHanger 18\u201d has something along the lines of eleven individual solos by itself. The guitar work is indeed amazing, but benefits greatly from killer drumming and bass throughout. Great fills throughout for the drums and the bass gets a lot of rhythmic highlights. A solid performance from both. \n\nThe songwriting is in top form here as well. Lyrics are awesome, song construction is brilliant, and tempos are dynamic. No two songs have the same feel, a bit of a rarity among thrash metal. Mustaine\u2019s vocals aren\u2019t going to blow you away, but his snarl is welcome here, especially considering the lyrical subject matter. The anti-political sentiment expressed on previous albums culminates to its fullest here and the result is quite memorable and surprisingly topical even today, though the lyrics don\u2019t dwell on the subject for the whole album. The songs are just as varied, most notably the entirely bass driven \u201cDawn Patrol.\u201d Some don\u2019t like its inclusion, but it definitely fits the mood of the album, if its not an outstanding track in and of itself. \n\nOverall, we have another solid album by one of thrash\u2019s greatest contributors. This album\u2019s lineup would go on to become the band\u2019s longest lived, though not necessarily the most consistent. Regardless, this album is amazing. Pretty much an essential listen. \n\nClassics: Holy Wars/The Punishment Due, Hanger 18, Take No Prisoners, Lucretia, Rust in Peace/Polaris\n",
        "\nMost Megadeth fans are introduced to the band either through their earliest works or through their early 90\u2019s material. In either case, they are usually forewarned by their knowing brethren to stay away from anything released afterwards. Such was my experience, and the reason that The World Needs a Hero (henceforth TWNAH) was the last Megadeth album to enter my collection. But as it turns out, TWNAH is not an album to fear and avoid; rather, it is a return to the melodic heavy metal style of Youthanasia spiced with the mainstream touches of Cryptic Writings and after the experimental disaster that was Risk, it\u2019s more than welcome. Those expecting a thrash album are going to be disappointed (aren\u2019t we always?), but those that enjoyed their mid-90\u2019s sound will find TWNAH a weaker but comparable addition to that era in the \u2018Deth discography.\n\nThe return of heavy metal is the album\u2019s key strength. Though Dave\u2019s vocals keep with the more melodic emphasis of their later years, there is an unspoken shift from vocal-oriented songs back to riff-oriented ones and the entire album just has a better feel because of it. Tracks like \u201cDisconnect,\u201d \u201cRecipe for Hate\u2026Warhorse\u201d (the ellipses return!), and \u201cDread and the Fugitive Mind\u201d represent the heavier bulk of the album: catchy, forceful heavy metal, and it\u2019s good to see the band step up to the plate to deliver it to us. Jimmy Degrasso brings back the double bass beats. Dave Ellefson delivers the strong low end counter melodies just like he used to (\u201cRecipe for Hate\u201d is a throwback to Rust in Piece-era glory). And Dave Mustaine and new enlist Al Pitrelli (from Savatage, whose style is similar to the melodic shred of Marty Friedman) overpopulate the album with poignant lead guitar, to no complaint from me. Mustaine\u2019s leadwork traditionally takes the backseat to his hired gun, but on TWNAH, it\u2019s clear that he has improved almost to the point of equality with Pitrelli. His vocal performance is less consistent, but his melodic singing continues to improve. Certain songs, particularly \u201cBurning Bridges\u201d and the excellent \u201cLosing My Senses,\u201d take the album\u2019 melodic facet to the forefront. I prefer the balance of melody and general heaviness that Youthanasia displayed so prominently, but these tracks never degenerate into Risk territory, with one exception.\n\n\u201cPromises\u201d deserves mention as one of the unexpected diversions in sound that is sure to polarize listeners. As a string-laden ballad, it\u2019s inclusion on a Megadeth album is curious and, for a lot of people, blasphemous. But I defend it: while not as potent as \u201cA Tout Le Monde,\u201d this song is surprisingly touching and a good display of Mustaine\u2019s willingness to try something different every once in awhile. It is also Al Pitrelli\u2019s sole shared writing credit. Good for him.\n\nOn the weaker end of the songwriting spectrum we have \u201c1000 Times Goodbye,\u201d which in addition to being lyrically impotent, is quite dragged out and repeatedly interrupted by spoken interjections. \u201cSilent Scorn\u201d is a brief little acoustic instrumental with lead guitar over it. If there wasn\u2019t trumpet parts (!) to it, it would kind of sound like a reject from Testament\u2019s The New Order. Kinda pointless, really. \u201cReturn to Hanger,\u201d despite being the only song to have legitimate thrash sections on the album, is a sequel to the classic \u201cHanger 18,\u201d borrowing heavily from the riffs, vocal lines, and general musical/lyrical arrangement of its older brother. As such, it just begs to be compared to the original, which it cannot hope to live up to. Finally, closer \u201cWhen\u201d takes forever to get going (over three minutes of vacuous intro precede the song proper), though it\u2019s a decent albeit longwinded song when it does eventually kick in. There\u2019s also a bonus track \u201cComing Home\u201d on the Japanese version that might as well be a lost Ozzy ballad. Trust me on this one, you can live without it.\n\nIt\u2019d like it more if there were actually fucking thrash songs on it (duh), but as one of the many younger metalheads who discovered Megadeth through their early/mid 90\u2019s output, I can\u2019t help but enjoy the majority of this album anyway. The naysayers will continue to say their \u2018nay,\u2019 but don\u2019t let that discourage you from giving it a shot, especially if TWNAH sounds like it might be up your alley.\n\nHighlights: \u201cRecipe for Hate\u2026Warhorse,\u201d \u201cLosing My Senses,\u201d \u201cDread and the Fugitive Mind\u201d\n",
        "\nA risk is defined as a colossal change or gamble that may lead to great fortune or disastrous results. If there's one band that adopts this definition the most, it's gotta be Megadeth. Back in the 1990's, Megadeth became a daring band by changing their musical style and by making metal that appealed to both the mainstream and metalheads, yet everything seemed to be okay until the band decided to ditch metal and play modern rock. Back in 1999, Dave Mustaine was willing to gamble Megadeth's credibility in exchange for mainstream success, and it turned out to be a fatal error. In a band that always seemed to have luck on their side, Megadeth took a chance with \"Risk\" and they ended up on the losing end of their own bargain.\n\nThe overall consensus of this record is that alternative rock has taken over Megadeth. Everything that was once metal has been flushed away into darkness and Megadeth switched over to the alternative mainstream, and it really sucks. The tracks are simple and soft, there is hardly any riff changes, and all the songs have repetitive choruses and modern guitar tones. The songs are so catchy and poppy that it almost drove me insane. I can't emphasis of how many times these horrible choruses are repeated! The simplistic \"Crush 'Em\" is probably the worst track from this standpoint and it could easily appeal to any mallcore kid because of the chorus that repeats for three fourths of the song; it's almost like the entire track is the fucking chorus! \"The Doctor Is Calling\" is hardly bearable because Dave doesn't stop singing the chorus. Most of the other songs fall under this category of being way too poppy and repetitive.\n\nIt was pretty easy to tell that Megadeth was drifting away from metal on \"Cryptic Writings,\" but at least that had some good Megadeth, vocals and solos, but all of these are gone on \"Risk.\" The guitars are tuned in a way in which they sound identical to an alternative rock band. There is nothing enjoyable about the riffs, it's all just repetitive radio friendly rock that mainstream kiddies would blow their loads to. One of the most disappointing attributes of this album is the solo effort. Even though \"Risk\" has guitar legends like Dave Mustaine and Marty Friedman, the solos are plain and unsophisticated. The solo on \"Insomnia\" has Friedman sluggishly playing a few notes and then simply stopping; none of the solos are epic or awesome like the leads on \"Tornado Of Souls\" or \"Holy Wars,\" they instead sound simple and heartless.\n\nOut of all twelve tracks on \"Risk,\" only two stand out from this pile of fecal matter. \"Prince Of Darkness\" is the only track from this album that sounds remotely metal. It has a nice heavy riff and Mustaine's vocals make it sound somewhat evil, yet it's just okay at best. I'm not sure why, but I find \"I'll Be There\" to be one of the album's better songs. It has mellow bass lines and a catchy chorus, yet it sounds somewhat different from the rest of the tracks. With that being said, all the other songs are poor pieces of garbage that have no redeeming qualities whatsoever.\n\nIt seemed that hell froze over during this time. The band that was known for making classic thrash albums like \"Rust In Piece\" and \"Peace Sells...But Whose Buying?\" had finally dissolved into a shitty mainstream band. Even from a sellout standpoint, \"Risk\" back fired and it bit Megadeth right in the ass. Not only did Megadeth fans hate it, the sales they aimed so high for just plopped right down in front of them and the LP ended up being a flop. Hell, doesn't even do any of these songs live (you might hear \"Prince Of Darkness\" if you're lucky, but even that's pushing it). \"Risk\" fits right in with \"Load\" and \"Roots\" as one of the most disliked and scorned records of our time. Add this one to the shit list; this album sucks. \n\nThis review was written for: http://www.Thrashpit.com\n",
        "\nWe have a mess of a greatest hits album. Without any knowledge of the whole Megadeth forum fiasco, it\u2019s still a mess. \n\nThis was made to revive interest in the band for their comeback and maybe introduce their music to new fans, but fails due to its lack of early material. They overlook their strongest material in favor of a balanced attack from each album, which for this band doesn\u2019t work! Why? Because Megadeth made their initial fan-base through their early thrashier material and this almost but not completely feels like it skims over that era. Another problem is that the tracks are not in chronological order, which due to the myriad of themes and styles of their work makes this feel a bit choppy.\n\nAll that said, this does give you a flavour from each album, good or not so good. Also none of this material is bad per se, but it could have been stronger.\n\nOverall, \u201cBack to the Start\u201d is understandably hated by fans, but for those slightly curious to Megadeth this is an okay starting point. However people who really want to get into them should start with \u201cKilling is my Business...and Business Is Good\u201d and work their way up the albums.\n",
        "\nIf there was a time period in Megadeth's history that totally redefined the band, it was the 1990's. During the 1990's, Megadeth released a collection of ground breaking albums, changed their sound, and had a consistent lineup; Megadeth also received some mainstream success when their 1992 record \"Countdown To Extinction\" reached the number two slot on the Billboard Charts! Before Megadeth began slipping with \"Risk,\" Dave Mustaine and crew recorded an album that launched a turning point in the band's career; that album was \"Youthanasia.\"\n\nThe main focus on \"Countdown To Extinction\" was the easier song structure, the lesser emphasis on riffing, and the overall chorus catchiness. To sum it up, a majority of Megadeth's thrash influence was gone and the band was now playing a vintage heavy metal style, and that's where \"Youthanasia\" comes in. \"Countdown To Extinction\" was the first record of this new sound, but \"Youthanasia\" is where they perfected it.\n\nInstead of the somewhat sloppy guitar playing and drumming on \"Countdown To Extinction,\" \"Youthanasia\" has musical work that flows like a stream. The riffing and the drumming have both slowed down a bit, but they compliment each other perfectly. \"Reckoning Day\" is the most suitable example of this because of the strong rhythm section. Mustaine and guitarist Marty Friedman play a smooth mid paced riff while bassist David Ellefson matches Nick Menza's simple, yet steady drum patterns. The solos here aren't as crazy and fast as previous Megadeth efforts, but they do fit well and match the tone of the music. When a song sounds slow or depressing, like \"A Tout Le Monde,\" the leads are simpler and epic, but when a track is heavier and has faster riffing, like \"Train Of Consequences,\" the solos are technical and swift. The riffs are common to \"Countdown To Extinction\" in the sense that they sound more traditional then thrash. The riff on the title track sounds almost identical to something stripped out of a Black Sabbath album. \"The Killing Road\" is probably the only track that could be considered somewhat thrash because of the steady riff, but don't expect anything similar to \"Rust In Peace!\"\n\n\"The Killing Road,\" \"Elysian Fields,\" and \"Reckoning Day\" are defiantly the prime cuts from this album. As previously stated, \"Reckoning Day\" has a fantastic rhythm field along with some great vocals. \"The Killing Road\" is my personal favorite song from this album because it has this thrashy riff that makes it sound unique from the pack of traditional metal songs and Mustaine has some really great vocals too. \"Elysian Fields\" has a delightfully memorable chorus, good riffing, and it even has a freakin harmonica solo! I find every song on \"Youthanasia\" to be fantastic, but these three stand out to me the most.\n\nInstead of lyrics about occultism and dark imagery, the lyrics on \"Youthanasia\" are focused around different subjects. There are a ton of lyrical topics here; everything from depression, to incest, to nuclear war, and even gambling. \"A Tout Le Monde\" is probably the most well known song from this album because of its suicidal lyrics. The title track is an interesting tidbit about the problems youths face, such as drugs and violence. The famous \"We've been hung out to dry \" line inspired the controversial artwork and it basically sums up the song's content.\n\nIf you do plan to buy a copy of \"Youthanasia,\" try to seek out the 2004 reissue. Not only is this version of the album completely remastered, it contains a series of amazing bonus tracks. The two demo tracks of \"A Tout Le Monde\" and \"New World Order\" sound great. The demo of \"A Tout Le Monde\" is extended in time length, has a different chorus and added backing vocals. The demo of \"New World Order\" sounds quite similar to the original version, but it does have some minor changes not in the actual track. The instrumental \"Absolution\" is a nice soft rocker with an interlude that hardcore Megadeth fans will recognize immediately. These bonus tracks are great and I highly suggest you buy the reissue to get them.\n\nI've listened to the entire Megadeth catalog countless times, and \"Youthanasia\" is my favorite by far. This record rules in every possible way. \"Youthanasia\" might not be as influential as \"Peace Sells...But Whose Buying\" or \"Rust In Peace,\" but it does rank among one of the best releases of this timeless band. \n\nThis review was written for: http://www.Thrashpit.com\n",
        "\nSome may laude this as being a monumental comeback, others may condemn it as being a complete waste of CD space, but I prefer to let the music do the talking. One of the things that truly helps to separate this album from the rather unsuccessful resurrection attempt that was \u201cThe World Needs a Hero\u201d is the one time return of original axe man Chris Poland. His influence, combined with a more healthy set of riffs and a more rational take on political influences help put this album up there with better works such as \u201cCountdown to Extinction\u201d and \u201cYouthanasia\u201d.\n\nChris Poland\u2019s soloing style has truly evolved since he left the MegaDeth fold in the late 80s. I\u2019ve delved into some of his solo work and it is highly Jeff Beck influenced, which I regard as a positive. We see a good deal of that influence present in his lead work here, as there is a strong amount of attention to giving every note an almost vocal quality and to methodically place the shred lines where they will have the most punch. Highlights in the soloing department can be found on \u201cDie Dead Enough\u201d, \u201cKick the Chair\u201d and \u201cBack in the Day\u201d.\n\nIn the riff department, we actually have a solid collection of gems, though they are not quite the masterpieces that we saw out of Mustaine in the 80s. \u201cBack in the Day\u201d has a strong set of inspired guitar lines, many of them suggesting a quasi-power metal approach rather than the thrashing efforts of the past. The intro to \u201cDie Dead Enough\u201d sounds like it was partially borrowed from Hanger 18, the rest is pretty much mid-tempo riffing similar to work on Youthanasia. \u201cKick the Chair\u201d is the only song that crosses into thrash territory, although I would have liked it if they had ratcheted up the tempo a bit more, and gone for broke on the double bass drum in a few sections. \u201cBlackmail the Universe\u201d and \u201cTears in a Vial\u201d both have some solid moments on the riff department, though sometimes they are drowned out by the vocals, keyboards, and the news broadcast sounds.\n\nHowever, we have some songs that just don\u2019t qualify as being up to the MegaDeth standard and sound like weaker moments from \u201cCryptic Writings\u201d and the last album. \u201cMy Kingdom Come\u201d starts off with a nice single note driving line, but keeps it going a bit too long. After the first half of the song, things pick up a bit for the solo, but by then most people would probably lose interest and that slow as hell line comes right back. \u201cThe Scorpion\u201d has some good ideas, though they are a bit under-developed and the song tends to drag a bit. \u201cOf Mice and Men\u201d has a stupid sounding vocal intro that is right out of the \u201cCryptic Writings\u201d dumper, and what follows is catchy but way too repetitious. The rest of the album is too rock and not enough metal, or pointless interludes that don\u2019t really go anywhere.\n\nOn the lyrical end, UltraBoris pretty much covered the problems with the news broadcast sections. But I would also like to point out that although Dave Mustaine has still not proven himself to be very apt at articulating political opinions (something that Maiden has proven to be the best at), he has evolved from the rambling moonbat that he was one previous works. The world issues that are presented in this album are not the fault of one man, but a product of an entirely self-contradictory system, one that seeks to be a humanitarian leader and yet simultaneously compromises with or makes sacrifices for evil men and governments. Bill Clinton is as much, if not more to blame as Bush for the mess that currently exists in the Middle East. His presentation of the facts may not be lyrically savvy, but at least now they aren\u2019t hypocritical.\n\nIn conclusion, this is not a great comeback, but it is not a complete throwaway. I recommend this to fans of Youthanasia and Countdown, but I also recommend getting a second hand copy of it as I can\u2019t justify paying full price for an album that only has 6 truly great songs, though many of the other songs do have some excellent lead breaks in them.\n",
        "\nI\u2019ve always been very impressed with this album, even from the very first listen. Something about it just makes it instantly accessible, perhaps more so than any other Megadeth release. And while it never garnered the same attention as Peace Sells before it or Rust in Peace after it, it has all the classic elements that let it stand just as tall as those two albums, if not taller.\n\nSFSGSW is my favorite Megadeth album, primarily because of the strength of the individual songs. The album lacks the general consistency of mood on Peace Sells and Rust in Peace, but every track is a classic in its own right. Few Megadeth songs hit as hard as the instrumental opener, \u201cInto the Lungs of Hell.\u201d The overlapping clean and distorted tones for the intro create an otherworldly tone and a great atmosphere, one that soon spirals into the chaos of the driving speed riffing and killer lead guitar. The album doesn\u2019t let up from there. Powerful and technical riffs, Megadeth\u2019s most predominant appeal, are the only riffs to be found here. If you prefer watered down groove rhythms or power chord abuse look elsewhere, as this album won\u2019t cater to your needs. Everything about the guitars kill on this album, especially the lead. Mustaine\u2019s soloing keeps getting better and more technical without losing a sense of melody, evident on just about every song here.\n\nThere\u2019s plenty of variety on the album as well. Several songs are straight up thrash numbers, such as \u201cSet the World Afire\u201d and the manic \u201c502.\u201d The Sex Pistols cover \u201cAnarchy in the UK\u201d is a prime example of metalification of classic punk. \u201cIn My Darkest Hour\u201d provides a mellower edge reminiscent of \u201cLooking Down the Cross.\u201d \u201cMary Jane\u201d and \u201cLiar\u201d kick ass in the mid-paced department. Basically, there\u2019s no filler here. It\u2019s all powerful, memorable, thrash fucking metal.\n\nI have no issues with the original release, but Dave Mustaine\u2019s need to re-master all the band\u2019s back catalogue really fucked up the reincarnation of this one. Killing is my Business got the celebrity treatment for the re-master, so why didn\u2019t this one? The new mix erases the raw quality of the original to make room for a cleaner more modern sound. The vocals sound worse for some reason and some minor aspects were changed, most notably the creative car stereo effect in the middle of \u201c502,\u201d for some reason horribly botched on the re-release.\n\nIf you can find it, hunt down the original release. It\u2019s free of the problems of the re-issue. Either way, I highly recommend this album to any metal fan willing to hear its glory.\n",
        "\nI used to be inclined to give this album the backseat among Megadeth\u2019s classic albums, but after listening to it again for this review, it seems I\u2019d truly forgotten how great this album really is. Taking the essential elements that Killing is my Business established and polishing them to near perfection, Peace Sells is one of the best overall displays of Megadeth\u2019s skill in songwriting, technical flair, and intense, high-speed metal destruction.\n\nThe album hits hard immediately with the killer track \u201cWake Up Dead.\u201d It\u2019s a prime example of Megadeth\u2019s increased instrumental skill since their last album. All the riffs are heavy, original, and very easy to headbang to. Guitar solos are frequent and virtuosic. Drumming is pounding and precise. Bass guitar is poignant and incredibly effective. Lyrics are dark and foreboding, as are Dave\u2019s vocals. And that\u2019s just the first track off this album. Every song after gets the same professional treatment. Some feature magnificent clean riffs, but most rely off of intricate, skull-crushing, distorted rhythms. A lot of the band\u2019s most memorable riffs, leads, and lyrics appear on this album. The riff halfway through \u201cWake Up Dead,\u201d the bass line throughout \u201cPeace Sells,\u201d the extended intro of \u201cGood Mourning/Black Friday,\u201d all the stuff of legends.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not just the music that\u2019s spot on. The album just sounds cool. Far from being overproduced, the mix adds to the incredibly dark atmosphere already created by instruments. Dark indeed is the atmosphere, also added to by the lyrics and vocals. Dave Mustaine is criticized as being a sub-par vocalist, but his signature snarl adds an unprecedented amount of necessary evil to every track. The only time this isn\u2019t the case is on the cover \u201cI Ain\u2019t Superstitious.\u201d Here his \u2018singing\u2019 actually sounds pretty good, however raspy. A lot of people don\u2019t like the way this song fits into the album, but it\u2019s just a fun, cool mixture of blues and thrash to change up the pace. It\u2019s a lot more well done than the blues thrash on Violent Playground\u2019s so-called \u201cThrashin\u2019 Blues\u201d LP anyway. As for the lyrics on the album, they\u2019re as dark as the music, with Dave beginning to express his political agenda a bit. Other topics hit on are black magic, Russian roulette, and mass slaughter.\n\nThis album is arguably Megadeth\u2019s best release, though that can be argued about any of their first four albums. Regardless of personal preference, Peace Sells is a welcome addition to any metalhead\u2019s collection and a timeless masterwork as far as lyrics, music, and complexity go.\n",
        "\nFinally, Mustaine\u2019s monster is properly unleashed on this eight-song terror that offered a slightly more technical countermeasure to his former bandmates\u2019 \u201cRide The Lightning\u201d album. With rising interest in heavy metal happening during this period, \u201cPeace Sells\u2026But Who\u2019s Buying\u201d is a record that was in the right place at the right time for a group that would be settling down to record albums for that glowing stack of records on the corner of Hollywood and Vine for a good long while. Megadeth\u2019s brand of speed metal was a bit leaner than Metallica\u2019s and much of the time, The General was meaner as well. \n\nCheck out the appropriately wicked, standout cut \u201cThe Conjuring\u201d for all the proof you need that Megadeth \u201986 was a plunge face first into the dark side of musical ambition. Featuring one of Mustaine\u2019s most compelling early arrangements, this track made metal mathematic, burning intensely with an appropriate amount of evil reflective of the one-time black magic dabbling frontman. MTV leaped all over \u201cPeace Sells\u201d, making David Ellefson\u2019s bass line immortal as part of their MTV News theme, inserting the busy riff highly conspicuously into the piece. On \u201cDevils Island\u201d, the group step back into \u201cKilling\u2026\u201d mode, with Gar Samuelson\u2019s snappy snare providing the perfect backdrop for Mustaine and fellow axe-ripper Chris Poland. \n\nBoth \u201cBlack Friday\u201d with it\u2019s relentless hammering and \u201cMy Last Words\u201d display Megadeth focusing on getting the job done with power, stamina and dexterity, while \u201cBad Omen\u201d comes off as this record\u2019s hidden gem, it\u2019s cold, wicked vibe being the product of an slow building torrent and Ellefson\u2019s spidery bass work. Here, in the early stages of The General\u2019s master battle plan, it\u2019s looking as if someone might have made a mistake by putting Mustaine on a bus home from New York. But there would be even more major battles ahead for this nuclear-powered metal war machine. \"Peace Sells...\" stands as Megadeth's first major victory in a metal war that is raging still today.\n",
        "\nThis was one of my earliest MegaDeth purchases, and also one of my most frugal ones at that, as I would have had to buy 7 different soundtracks/compilations in order to get them all. People call this Mustaine's cash grabber, seeing as I saved a ton of cash by getting it, I'm going to refer to it as his cash-saver.\n\nThere isn't a bad song on here, and to state for the record, I hate the fucking sex pistols. I'm sorry, I was a pretty steady punk fan in the early 90s, but I never got into the noise these guys put out. \"Problems\" is probably the weakest of the tracks on here, but it's alot of fun and Dave's vocals keep it interesting.\n\nThere are alot of fond memories attached to the individual songs on here. I remember a few weeks ago watching \"Bill and Ted's Bogus Journey\" with my band's bassist, and remembering the classic MegaDeth song that played when they were sent to hell by Bill's hot yet flaky stepmom. Not to mention the fun yet often ridiculed film version of \"Super Mario Brothers\", and the high speed thrasher \"Breaking Point\". Great leads on that one by the way. I remember \"Shocker\" scaring the hell out of me, although \"No More Mr. Nice Guy\" is probably the least scary song on here. And the most musically intricate song on the Beavis and Butthead experience \"99 ways to die\". Love those classical guitar fills on that one, not to mention the unforgettable main riff. They're remake of \"Paranoid\", which is on probably one of the weakest Black Sabbath tributes I've ever heard, is par for the course, although I did like Marty Friedman's more technically extravagant solo.\n\nHowever, my all time favorite track on here is \"Diadems\", by well over a mile I might add. It's one of the slower songs on here, but it has an awesome quiet intro that reminds me a tiny bit of Dokken actually. DemonKnight, the movie it appeared on, is in my top 5 favorite horror/action movies of all time, not to mention the top notch soundtrack (minus the goofy Pantera song).\n\nI was frosted beyond measure to find out that this CD has been taken out of print, because these songs will be extremely difficult to get a hold of, if not impossible in the case of some. Most of the movies that they appeared on were not very successful in their time, although \"Shocker\" has achieved a sort of cult status amongst horror movie fans. If you can find either on Ebay, or some other second hand website or store, it would be well worth the money.\n",
        "\nI want to get this out of the way first: Countdown to Extinction is a letdown.\n\nIn Dave\u2019s heyday Megadeth was great, which is why it\u2019s all the more difficult to listen to an album released by them which is so watered down. This isn\u2019t about the clean production, because that\u2019s hardly bothersome. I\u2019m not even talking about Megadeth \u201cselling out\u201d or its radio-friendly tendencies here; Mustaine didn\u2019t \u201csell out\u201d until the late nineties, and 1994\u2019s Youthanasia was Megadeth\u2019s most radio-friendly album at the time (although this still did better than Youthanasia on the charts). And lemme tell ya: Youthanasia is easily better than this. Even if Youthanasia wouldn\u2019t have been as much of a natural and logical progression from Rust In Peace than this was (and it would\u2019ve been harder to accept by the diehard \u2018Deth fans), it is nowhere near as uneven or forgettable as this.\n\nIf the only \u2018Deth song you\u2019ve heard is Symphony of Destruction, it\u2019s hard to imagine why this is such a letdown. I know I found it hard to imagine; After all, Rust In Peace had imaginative riffs to spare, scores of beautiful solos and is just a beautiful album all \u2018round and Symphony was a simple yet effective track\u2026 so, why are a quarter of the tracks here both exorbitantly simple and bland? For those who have listened to this album, I am of course talking about This Was My Life, Foreclosure of a Dream, Countdown to Extinction and Captive Honour (although to be fair, Captive Honour has a catchy chorus, I\u2019ll give it that). I\u2019ve listened to this album time and time again and I don\u2019t have to have the album playing every time I want to evaluate it, yet I had to use fucking Wikipedia just to remember these tracks, that\u2019s how forgettable they are. Altogether these songs are as basic as all shit and lack the crunch that any one of the good songs have. To top it all off, if I was held hostage by a group of terrorists, had a gun pointed at my head and had to memorize the choruses of these four songs in under five minutes, I\u2019d only be able to remember the lines \u201cForeclosure of a dream\u201d and \u201cCaptive honour, ain\u2019t no honour\u201d before having my brains blown out. That\u2019s pretty much all I can remember from these: Not even three lines from four different choruses. It may seem selfish to blame the album for my forgetfulness, but keep in mind that I\u2019ve listened to this album more times than I care to count and I\u2019ve owned it for at least a year now.\n\nFurther, some of these tracks are so dull that it\u2019s disheartening just listening to how hard the boys are trying NOT to go ballistic with their guitars and drums just for the sake of trying to achieve radio airplay. I\u2019m aware that Megadeth were trying to progress, but this was only the second album with Friedman, yet it sounds like any schlub could have played these notes... or at least, most of them. The Friedman/Mustaine combo had only lasted for one album before this one, and dammit, that\u2019s a fucking crime if there ever was one.\n\nFurthermore, Dave: I love you man, in fact I idolize you, but when it comes to Psychotron and High Speed Dirt\u2026 just stick to your usual subject matter. Pretty please? Really folks, you could be the last person on planet Earth stuck in a hangar one hundred miles away from the nearest oasis, and listening to these tracks would still be embarrassing. Don\u2019t get me wrong, these tracks aren\u2019t necessarily bad, they\u2019re just\u2026 Eeeungh. That\u2019s the best word I could use to sum these up: Eeeungh. It\u2019s also odd how upbeat these tracks are considering the demeanor of the others.\n\nHowever, take all of these qualms out of the equation, and you\u2019ve got yourself some very tight tracks. The aforementioned Symphony of Destruction has both catchy verses and a chorus, but are both catchy in completely different ways, and this would have to be the best example of a Megadeth song in which its simplicity and slower pace work to its strengths. We\u2019re all familiar with Megadeth\u2019s precision and mind-blowing technicality along with their overall attitude and subject matter, and we know how well this works with the speed of their earlier material. Remove the speed but retain everything else, and you\u2019re left with Symphony, which is the type of song that every mediocre track on this album should have been in order to have made Countdown the true logical progression from RIP that it\u2019s usually made out to be. Skin O\u2019 My Teeth, Architecture of Aggression and Sweating Bullets follow the same basic pattern but have varying degrees of speed. Naturally the opening track, Skin O\u2019 My Teeth, is the fastest, while Sweating Bullets is placed near the middle of the album and is slower. Make no mistake, it all works well.\n\nThe album closer, Ashes In Your Mouth, is the longest track here and is easily my favorite of the album. Chalk it up to my fondness for the more thrashy type of metal (which this album usually doesn\u2019t try to be) or for its speed or for whatever, but I cannot accurately describe, in objective terms, why this is better than the good tracks on this album. If I could hazard a guess though, I\u2019d say it\u2019s because after all of the bullshit tracks here, this arrives like a shining beacon of awesomeness and reminds us of all the good tracks on this album as well as \u2018Deth classics from the distant past and make us forget about the monotonousness of the others. Even on its own, it\u2019s a great thrash song. Again: Make no mistake, this definitely works, and if this album had ended one track earlier it would\u2019ve been a big miss.\n\nOverall, if your Megadeth collection isn\u2019t quite complete yet (save for the Risk and Cryptic Writings albums), then skip this one and stock up on the good shit before coming back to this. The reason this gets a 60 is because despite its downfalls, it doesn\u2019t deserve any less than the equivalent of a three-star rating. After all, it IS Megadeth. However, I cannot in good conscience give it any more than that. It\u2019s a C-grade album; If you\u2019re looking to build a metal collection, you wouldn\u2019t start here. If you\u2019ve got a hankerin\u2019 for some Megadeth, then you\u2019d be interested in this\u2026 but be warned, you won\u2019t be blown away by any means.\n",
        "\nAt the beginning of the 80's, thrash metal was in its infancy, and it showed in the debuts of all the major players. Kill 'Em All was primitive. Show No Mercy sounds nothing like anything Slayer would go on to do. Even Bonded by Blood, though superior to its successors aggression-wise, lacked the complexity of their later albums. But Megadeth was different. When Killing is my Business finally hit the scene mid-1985, it showed the band just a hint shy of their creative peak and forged enough momentum to last them through four classic albums. The first of these, KimB still stands as a model album and displays a combination of technique and intensity that few other bands have yet to match. \n\nThe first (and generally the last) word when discussing Megadeth among their peers is technique. The band had it in droves and displayed it thoroughly. Don't bore me with your H-team. In 1985, the most effective guitar tag team in metal was Dave Mustaine and Chris Poland. Even if you don't mention the solos (which are numerous and fantastic), you could laud the insanity of their rhythm playing for decades. \"Loved to Deth\" was still ahead of its time, even as late as '85, for the complexity of its arrangement as well as the furious technicality of its riffs (played a few bpms faster than one would believe possible for their intricacy). Plus the album opens with that chilling variation of Bach's Fugue in D. A thrash album with a piano intro. Brilliant, I say. And even when it's not double-time all-the-time (the snare that most of the modern thrash bands fall into; that this is the only competent way to thrash aggressively), the band performs at the same level. \"Chosen Ones,\" \"The Skull Beneath the Skin,\" and the title track all feature the skull-busting beats of Gar Samuelson and the mighty bass work of Dave Ellefson, as well as with said shredding from Mustaine and Poland. \n\nBut the other integral element of this album, that which makes it so compelling to this date, is the sonic intensity. Fueled by Mustaine's rage, this album is aggressive and scathing even when it's being melodic or suspenseful. While Dave's fangs would soon be dripping with politcal sarcasm, here they reek only of venom and bile. Whether he's playing the lover scorned, the sniper assassin, the bystander to the crucifixtion of Christ, or even the more humerous roles of lustful gas station attendant and holy pilgrim, his signature snarl constantly hints at unspoken invective towards his former bandmates. This is pissed-off in stereo, and it fuels some of the finest thrash songs ever written. \n\nWhether you're new to the band or a seasoned rattlehead, it's hard to keep still with this album blasting through your speakers. And its still but a glimpse at what is to follow. Rattle your goddamn head.\n",
        "\n\u201cYouthanasia\u201d has been criticized by many as being commercial and bland. Truth is - it\u2019s neither! It's every bit as good as \u201cCountdown to Extinction\u201d and better. \u201cYouthanasia\u201d is built on a solid power metal foundation (not Rhapsody style, Power the way it should be done!) and has that distinct Megadeth style to it too. Mustaine did have competition with Metallica but with this release, Mustaine opts for a power metal base rather than the modern rock one of Metallica. Thank goodness for that.\n\nThe band has progressed in songwriting. Now instead of writing riff-oriented, heavy as hell material that they used to earlier, the band has progressed to a more traditional metal sound that's emotional and catchy. Countdown to Extinction was the first step in this direction and this is the next. They have slowed down the pace of Countdown and brought in more melody which works well and is probably the most they can take this sound to. Cryptic Writings was a letdown and didn't push forward this sound further but the band has returned to this sound with \u201cThe System Has Failed\u201d. \u201cTSHF\u201d is heavier and faster than \u201cYouthanasia\u201d and therefore goes back to \u201cCountdown\u201d style of metal. This album in its own right is a classic and should have been an inspiration for power metal bands but is sadly, not.\n\nMusically, the entire group is solid as ever. Menza has always been a monster at the drum kit and now this album and \u201cCountdown\u201d showed his more rhythmic style that flows well with the music on display here. Dave Eleffson is as good as he ever was on earlier releases. Mustaine now writes very very catchy riffs that one is bound not to forget and Marty puts up some excellent solos. As a singer, Mustaine furthers the melodic voice he acquired on \u201cRust in Peace\u201d initially and developed on \u201cCountdown\u201d. Though his new voice would fully mature on \u201cCryptic Writings\u201d (even if it was a musical letdown), he sings very well on this one as well. Megadeth plays tight, melodic, emotional and catchy power metal on this album that no-one else has ever replicated in metal history.\n\nLyrically, the band deals with topics such as Gambling, Suicide and such. The band has matured lyrically as well deviating further from the occultism of \u201cPeace Sells\u201d. Mustaine perfectly transpires the message which he wishes to give through his lyrics. A Tout Le Monde's video was banned from MTV on charges of it talking about suicide. There are many Mustaine classics (lyrics) here such as \u201cTrain of Consequences and the emotional \u201cA Tout Le Monde\u201d.\n\nOn A Song Level, everything here's awesome and there are a few average numbers as well \u201cReckoning Day\u201d is up-beat and would appeal even to a thrash fan. \u201cTrain of Consequence\u2019s\u201d has a great riff and carries a superb sense of melody thought. \u201cAddicted to Chaos\u201d has a memorable and instantly catchy chorus besides nice leads. \u201cA Tout Le Monde\u201d is a very emotional ballad with a well executed French chorus and solo. \u201cElysian Fields\u201d is a very strange song with a nice chorus but that \"ah-ah-ah\" the band does in the background is surely strange. \u201cThe Killing Road\u201d is short, melodic and well done. \u201cBlood of Heroes\u201d is the catchiest song on here with a perfectly written chorus and riffs and also an excellent solo. \u201cFamily Tree\u201d is a strange song which I put under the average section. The title track is slow and heavy, it gets a bit boring but it\u2019s mainly average. Both \u201cI Thought I Knew It All\u201d and \u201cBlack Curtains\u201d are very enjoyable to hear as they're both catchy as nice. \u201cVictory\u201d has Mustaine combine all the song titles he can into a song and it and he does a good job of it! At first I didn't like this song but now its one of my favorites, it features nice guitar harmonies and a nice chorus with that awesome solo perfectly fitting the song. \n\nIn conclusion, a solid metal release by Megadeth. It\u2019s often remembered as one of their weak record but \u201cYouthanasia\u201d is better than \u201cCountdown\u201d and \u201cKIMB\u201d and much better than \u201cCryptic Writings\u201d and \u201cRisk\u201d.

        "\nThis album and all of the albums following it are seen to be a black mark in Megadeth's career by many people. People even compare it to things as bad as Metallica's Black Album or even Load but listen up - this isn't Groove Metal like the Black Album or Modern Rock like Load, it sure isn't thrash that Megadeth played in the past but this is pure heavy metal that pays homage to the early days of Maiden and in particular Priest. Let\u2019s check out the early heavy metal that Priest pioneered with Killing Machine or Screaming for Vengeance. Catchy - Check, Heavy - Check, Excellent Leads - Check, Good Vocals - Well, check (surprise!). \n\nYes, Dave does further the power metal touch he acquired on Rust in Peace both vocally and musically and dismantles a lot of thrash. The album is simplified, catchy, melodic and most importantly emotional. There are brilliant solos and several catchy choruses splashed all over the album and its heavy enough to keep any heavy metal fan happy. There is thrash here and there especially on the tracks Ashes in Your Mouth, Architecture of Aggression and Skin O' My Teeth but overall the album relies a lot on emotional and catchy pure heavy metal. People seem to have a common misconception that catchy is poppy and you just have to play really heavy to be metal but this is truly a misconception as heavy metal is supposed to be catchy as the best heavy metal that which was pioneered by Maiden, Priest and W.A.S.P. is catchy as hell.\n\nHeavy metal CAN appeal to radio too as Priest's hit singles have shown and therefore I bear no grudge against this album selling a lot or Symphony Of Destruction which many underplay as radio-friendly and even though Symphony has a very simple riffset, its darn heavy, has good vocals and that solo in the mid-section is pure class. Rust In Peace gave the mainstream a glimpse of Megadeth and this album (and song - Symphony Of Destruction) very well catapulted them into the mainstream which means that Deth would naturally be abused by metal fans but this very record has many heavy metal classics on it such as the aforementioned Symphony Of Destruction, This Was My Life, Architecture Of Aggression The title track, Captive Honor and the title track.\n\nSkin O' My Teeth is one of the faster and thrashier moments of the album and is extremely powerful and catchy, Dave's vocals here are just alright though and sometimes downright annoying in the chorus. Next Symphony of Destruction is as I mentioned simple riff-wise but heavy and extremely catchy with some really rough vocals by Dave which only he seems to be capable of, watch out for that solo. Architecture of Aggression is heavier and more of a thrash cut and that intro would really make you think you\u2019re up for something good. Yes, the song is good and it also has some well-thought out lyrics about war tactics and even has a very catchy chorus. Foreclosure of a Dream is a slower song and is basically Youthanasia/Power Metal, a pretty enjoyable song but not really up to the standards the album is really capable of. Sweating Bullets has some nice riffs and lunatic lyrics which Dave also shows well in his vocals. This Was My Life is one of the albums classics \u2013 heavy riffing, very nice vocals by Dave and extremely catchy chorus which co-ordinate with each other so well that it\u2019s more or less a perfect song. Next is the title track which is slow and has another very catchy chorus and cool lyrics and solos ending up as a total classic. High Speed Dirt is a mediocre song with fast riffs and good melody but altogether doesn\u2019t make you pay real attention to it. Psychotron has strange lyrics and though there\u2019s heavy riffing here and a pretty catchy chorus \u2013 even it\u2019s nothing to bother about.\n\nCaptive Honour follows and let me tell you \u2013 even if it has those judge and gangster voices it\u2019s a total classic! You know why? Dave\u2019s vocals are very emotional here, the guitar riffing is awesome, extremely catchy chorus and that solo section in the near end is just totally rules. The song builds up layer by layer perfectly and is in my opinion the albums best song. Ashes In Your Mouth is the ending thrasher and would surely appeal to even a thrash purist, its aggressive and Mustaine\u2019s sneering and Menza\u2019s perfect drumming really makes it a classic. The especially brilliant part is when Mustaine says \u201cIf your fighting to live/Its okay to die \u2013 Welcome to tomorrow!\u201d Pure class and an awesome way to end the album.\n\nBuy this album if you want emotional, catchy heavy metal but if you expect thrash like the olden days \u2013 stay away. This album is built perfectly for metal fans in general and should remain in your CD player for quite some time like me.\n",
        "\nThere has been a lot of discussion on how \"live\" Megadeth's first official live release 'Rude Awakening' really is. Of course, there must have been some polishing in the studio here and there, but if you listen really well, you can hear some off-key backing vocals and the lead vocals of Dave Mustaine himself are awfully off-key here and there also. Mustaine has never been a really good singer anyway, so I wasn't really expecting that either. If you listen really closely (headphones are always a good tool to do so), you can here some of those little nuance mistakes. Those kind of mistakes, that almost no listenere hears, but that can really annoy you if you're a musician listening to your own stuff.\n\nIs that meant as a kind of criticism? No, not in any way. Those little mistakes are in my humble opinion always the things that give live albums a certain charm. A lot of people think the same about live albums with an average sound quality also, but I don't count myself to those people. Luckily, the sound quality on 'Rude Awakening' is about as good as it gets; every instrument is heard pretty clearly and mixed in the right way (Al Pitrelli's guitar could be just a little bit louder at some points in the beginning though) and the thing in its entirity is mixed loud enough to do some decent headbanging on!\n\nOn to the song selection then. Figured that the recordings for 'Rude Awakening' were made during the tour in support of the 2001 release 'World Needs A Hero', it didn't really surprise me that, though the mediocre level of that album, 4 songs off of that album were included. However, 'Return To Hangar' and '1000 Times Goodbye' (luckily without those dumb quotes that actress makes on the album!) are the highlights of that album, so you won't hear me complain. Apart from those tracks, the song selection is great! The fact that the album contains three songs from 'Youthanasia' kind of surprised me, but apart from 'Skin O' My Teeth', basically every classic song is included on this album. From 'Mechanix' to 'Trust' and from 'Peace Sells' to 'Hangar 18', they're all there! And luckily, the dreadful 'Risk' is skipped completely! Two pleasant surprises for me personally were 'Devil's Island' and the breathtaking 'Ashes In Your Mouth'.\n\nThe way the songs are performed also deserves some compliments. As I've stated, I'm not too fond about Dave Mustaine's vocals at all and of course the lineup with Marty Friedman and Nick Menza is the lineup I would have prefered a live album with, but Al Pitrelli is a fabulous guitarist (of course! Why else would he be in Savatage?) and Jimmy DeGrasso is probably better than his predecessor from the previous lineup. The band performs the classic tracks just the way they're supposed to sound (although the backing vocals are a little weak here and there) and there are even some nice extra adds to the songs. There are some parts that speed up during the guitar solo of 'Hangar 18' (you'll have to listen to understand what I mean) and one of my personal favorites, 'She-Wolf', has a very cool extended solo section. Including a very cool drum solo by Jimmy DeGrasso.\n\nMustaine doesn't talk to his audience to often, but in my humble opinion, Mustaine is one of those people you have making music than talking, because making music is something he is definitely great at. Though 'Rude Awakening' probably wasn't the CD or DVD many fans were waiting for, it's a live album that is definitely worth checking out! Maybe one day, there will be an official live album with Marty Friedman and Nick Menza on it. Or maybe with the new lineup, with the Dover brothers and Jimmy MacDonough, that lineup definitely rocks live! Until then, we'll have to do it with this perfectly fine live recording.\n",
        "\nA lot has been said about 'Cryptic Writings', both positive and negative, but a fact is, that after the balance between Rock and Heavy Metal, that made 'Countdown To Extinction' such an awesome album, went to Rock a bit too much with 1994's 'Youthanasia'. Not that 'Youthanasia' was a bad album, but the fact that it lacks that sharp edge, makes that I hardly listen to that album anymore. On 'Cryptic Writings', Megadeth, and singer/guitarist Dave Mustaine in particular, tried to get back a large share of Metal in the music again, which makes 'Cryptic Writings' an album that has that special balance again. In fact, stylistically the album doesn't even differ that much from 'Countdown To Extinction'. To illustrate how much I like the album, together with 'Rust In Peace' and 'Countdown To Extinction', 'Cryptic Writings' forms my personal Megadeth top 3.\n\nIn the typical Megadeth-tradition, the album has a really, really strong opener. 'Trust' is a very good song, probably even one of the best songs that Dave Mustaine and Marty Friedman have ever written together. The lyrics are quite sensitive and the music builds up very nicely. Not really a typical opener, but who gives a damn? One of the most catchiest choruses the band has ever made and a short, but very strong guitar solo by Marty Friedman round off this great song.\n\nIt took me some time to get used to 'Almost Honest', but once I got used to it, I realised that 'Almost Honest' is actually not a bad song at all! The lyrics are pretty much comparable to those of 'Trust', the subject is the same, and just like 'Trust', 'Almost Honest' has some very nice work on the backing vocals.\n\nNext up is 'Use The Man', which I consider one of Megadeth's best ever songs. The acoustic verses and Dave Mustaine's typical dangerous low voice create a perfect atmosphere and a nice step towards the great chorus of the song. A nice surprise is the heavy guitar riff underneath Marty Friedman's great solo, which is based on the same key as the verses, just played more \"Metal\". Some nice headbanging to be done here.\n\n'Mastermind' is a hideous song with one of the most ridiculous choruses the band has ever produced. However, the song is followed up by a nice surprise; 'The Disintegrators' is a very nice Heavy Metal song which reminds me of 'Poison Was The Cure' from 'Rust In Peace' a lot. This song just hasn't got that pointless bass intro and rocks right from the beginning.\n\nAfter that, the album declines a bit. 'I'll Get Even', 'Sin' and 'Have Cool, Will Travel' aren't bad songs and actually have some nice riffs, but lack in conviction. Apart from that 'Sin' and 'Have Cool, Will Travel' sound rather forced in heaviness, just like these songs had to be written in order to make the album sound a little heavier. Nothing to impressive there. However, not this entire part of the album is not too impressive, 'A Secret Place' is a great, slightly experimental song. The intro riff is really powerful and so is the rest of the song. Unlike many other songs on the album, 'A Secret Place' doesn't sound like it's built around its chorus. The song flows quite nicely and the chorus doesn't stand out as much in the way that it doesn't get more accent than the rest of the song. Impressive!\n\nAfter 'Have Cool, Will Travel', the album suddenly becomes very Metal! 'She-Wolf' is probably as Heavy Metal as it gets and has one of Dave Mustaine's best ever guitar solos and has a chorus that won't let go of your mind for a long, long time. In fact, at the moment I am writing this review, I am in a period that I constantly find myself playing that song over and over again. In the same Heavy Metal tradition, 'Vortex' has this really euphoric Heavy Metal riff starting off the song and throughout the song, you can hear some very nice guitar and vocal melodies. Another pleasant surprise!\n\nClosing off the album in style is 'FFF', of which the intro slightly reminds me of Metallica's 'Motorbreath' (Dave Mustaine might want to kill me because of this comparison) and which is another euphoric Metal track. Those last three tracks have something in common, it is pretty obvious that those songs were written in a time that the band was feeling very comfortable, that can just be heard in the euphoria and the \"looseness\" in which the songs are played. In any way, 'She-Wolf', 'Vortex' and 'FFF' form a nice and Metal way to close off the album!\n\nMaybe the tension between the band members is the reason that the middle part of this album doesn't sound that consistent. Out of the liner notes in the booklet of the re-release of 'Cryptic Writings', I also understood that the band's manager at the time, a certain Bud Prager, was a pain in the asses of the band. However, I find 'Cryptic Writings' a very good release which should be heard by anyone who is into solid, traditional Metal!\n",
        "\nI'm a member of the Megadeth message boards, and I am there quite often (my post count is a testament to this). When the webmaster and Dave announced that we would vote for the songs, everyone was excited, after all, we all knew that Dave wanted to do the right thing instead of releasing another Capitol Punishment. Boy were we wrong or what?!\n\nI have no problems with the music. None at all. I like every single track, some more than others (IE A Tout Le Monde...I really can't stand it that much anymore). I was happy to see Prince of Darkness included, I liked the song, but after that, this isn't a review on the music, because we all know it's great. This review is a rant.\n\nWhat the hell man?! Many songs had more than 2,000 votes and didn't make it, IE Take No Prisoners, Good Mourning Black Friday, TORNADO OF SOULS!!!! Instead, we get songs that were not voted on as much, or the singles, because all the idiots voted for the singles. And it would have been a much better deal if this would have been a double album, or a live album even, because the material here doesn't really do Megadeth's 20 years justice. We all know the songs, we want more. And the DVD is nothing to shit at either, it's just a bunch of footage from the Risk tour, which in itself was horrid because Marty was getting ready to leave Megadeth and those are some of his worst performances ever. Don't even bother buying this unless you want a copy of Kill the King, which is a great song.\n",
        "\nThe result of a months long survey of Megadeth forum users to decide which tracks to include on a greatest hits album. The way votes were recorded, however, says a lot about how poor this disc is. Each album was given its own poll on the forums and the tracks with the highest overall votecount were recorded. If the fans could have their way, the best of Megadeth would include most of \"Peace Sells...But Who's Buying?\", \"Rust In Peace\" and a few tracks from the rest. I consider \"Killing Is My Business...And Business Is Good\" and \"So Far So Good... So What!\" to be far more deserving of the passing mention they get here. The rest is really crap when compared to the '85-91 so call 'filler' material (like \"Take No Prinsoners\", not included here.) For a band with an already vast back-catalogue and already existing compilations still in print, it must be asked for whom this album was really compiled?\n\nSales figures for \"The System Has Failed\" indicated that, while Megadeth has a strong following today, it is not a band creating new fans with its latest releases. A greatest hits such as this, designed to lure in new fans, is therefore missing its mark. The song selection is highly unoriginal and so on the same token there are no old tricks to lure long time fans into a purchase by including one or two temping additions. For exampleI would have loved for Dave to do what Anthrax did with \"The Greater of Two Evils\" and re-record the classic Megadeth tunes with his new band, who are an amazing fit for Megadeth live (or even record another live album).\n\nBut since he didn't, this review really only functions to criticise the way this album was marketed and decided upon: under the guise of being for the fans of Megadeth on their official forums, it ends up not for new fans, not for old fans and is therefore totally and utterly redundant.\n",
        "\nMustaine has an undeniable talent for music, even though Megadeth's last albuns are quite regular he's a great musician. But in the last few years (or decade ?) he's showing to the fans another talent, to make us waste our money on shitty records (Risk pops in your head, right ?) or useless compilations (Why release something like 'Still Alive.. and Well?' ?), and now he present the fans again with: 'Megadeth's Greatest Hits: Back to the Start'.\n\nThe album starts off wrong, the name 'back to the start' should mean something like, songs from the first albums, classics such as 'rattlehead', 'set the world afire', 'devil's island', etc.. but no, the tracklist here features probably the most overrated songs of the band, something to MTV-freaks to buy. Even the classics on the album are very familiar to all the fans, yes.. 'Holy Wars', In My Darkest Hour' and 'Hangar 18' are good examples, in fact, these three songs you can find in 3 or more Megadeth albums, so.. buy the studio albums instead.\n\nThe only reason for a fan to buy this, is if you want to own all Megadeth discography, besides that there's nothing new here and you'll not want spend money to hear 'Prince of Darkness' again.\n\nBy the way, the name of the album should be: 'Still Alive.. and DEFINITELY not Well !'\n",
        "\nSo this is it - another Best Of compilation from Megadeth. The catch? This time the tracks were selected based on fan votes from Megadeth\u2019s official forums. You\u2019d think that leaving a compilation track list up to the fans would be the best possible way to get a good compilation album, but unfortunately, they even managed to fail at that. There is a reason it\u2019s called \u201cBest Of\u201d and not \u201cMediocre collection\u201d.\n\nYeah, you get a couple of awesome classics such as Holy Wars, In My Darkest Hour, Hangar 18, A Tout Le Monde and Wake Up Dead\u2026but when it boils down to it, what else is there? There are seventeen tracks on this compilation and I can name at least ten that I\u2019d like to see replaced with songs that are more deserving of recognition. Instead of delving into the days of when Megadeth actually meant something and wrote songs that even the test of time couldn\u2019t dilapidate, the fans have chosen to take the contemporary road \u2013 a path that does not even come close to representing the best eras of this band. What happened to the underappreciated classics, like Hook in Mouth, Into the Lungs of Hell, Rattlehead and Take No fucking Prisoners? A man\u2019s Megadeth compilation is not complete without Take No Prisoners, no matter how many classics you put on it.\n\nPrince of Darkness, Kill the King, Dread and the Fugitive Mind, Trust, Angry Again\u2026how many people gave or give a damn about these songs? This is like a hamburger without the meat. Please don\u2019t put anymore money into Mustaine\u2019s pocket and fueling his oversized ego by purchasing this piss poor release. All of you asshats who voted on this track list suck at life.\n",
        "\nSo imagine this. You'rethe frontman of an old metal band that has just released a quite average album. You have your ego and wallet to placate, but don't want to put in any actual effort into anything. So, you decide that it'd be a pretty good idea to wash your integrity further down the drain by releasing your third \"best of\" compilation in three years. And, the result, is of course, shitty.\n\nYes, this is Megadeth's third \"best of\" in five years, which is bad enough in itself. To further insult us, the metal consumer, Mustaine must have thought that it'd be a pretty good idea to not only keep on releasing these pieces of shit, but to also include a nearly identical tracklisting to one of the aforementioned best hits. I mean, at least Capital Punishment: The Megadeth Years had two new songs. This has nothing. This is a rehash of Capital Punishment with four extra songs or so added on and a few of the other ones taken away to make this album appear more \"back to the roots\". This is, in essence, bullshit.\n\nSo basically, this is in fact a complete waste of time and money. Not only does it follow in the past proud Megadeth \"best hits\" train of shitty song selection, but its also completely unoriginal in its song selection too. Good job and congratulations on this one, Dave.\n",
        "\nFirst of all before I start this review, I\u2019d like to say this album isn\u2019t too thrashy and isn\u2019t an R. I. P 2.Anyone who expects that is coming in for another disappointment. Here is my view though, I think if Megadeth made let\u2019s say, 100 Rust in Pieces then that would just bring down the brilliance and utter beauty of the original! So Deth move on to a more mainstream though still pretty much heavy and entertaining sound, this doesn\u2019t make me unhappy (even though I liked their thrash more)! I don\u2019t find anything wrong with this album. There\u2019s a lot of diversity here and its more straight-up metal than anything Deth have done. You just have to be open-minded to know how good it is, it has its low points but come on, most albums are that way! This applies to all kinds of metal whether New or old. St. Anger was pretty bad though I didn't want to compare it with any of their other albums cause that was its true worth! Surely, Deth don\u2019t deserve the same fate. Anyway, I\u2019ll move on to the music:-\n\nBlackmail the universe is a good heavy number that has some news-headliner things in the background. I am not really a fan of these kinds of things but the riffing here is pretty good and goes along with the words spoken by the announcer. Mustaine's vocals aren't exactly top notch but are pretty bearable, a bit too melodic for this kind of heavy riffing and sometimes I cant hear his voice (maybe drowned in the guitar rush?) but besides that the song is pretty good. Next is Die Dead Enough, and I don\u2019t know why the heck people hate this song so much cause I found it to be catchy, nicely melodic and it also has some good solo's. Dave\u2019s vox get annoying sometimes but are pretty good. I don\u2019t like \u201cI, I, I\" chant. \n\nNext is Kick the Chair which would qualify as the best in this album, its heavy and Mustaine\u2019s vocals are aggressive on this one, some good riffing present here. The Scorpion is a very quirky, strange kind of song but it grows on you the more you listen to it. Dave\u2019s vocals are bad here but the guitars are still good. Tears in a vial is up next and is pretty boring and un-memorable though the melody is ok, the songs stretched too much and is a very passable tune. I know Jack is a needles little interlude that is far too short and the CD could well have done without it (What was Dave thinking?). Back in The Day gets the CD rolling again, the song is heavy and has a really good tune to it, and the lyrics are glorifying metal, something like Manowar or the likes to show their power metal now. \n\nSomething that I'm not is a not-too impressive mediocre number on the CD, Nothing too impressive here and the lyrics are somewhat unconnected. Truth be told picks up and it\u2019s a heavy tune that reeks of Rust in Piece (well ok, not THAT much), there\u2019s heavy riffing here and some good guitar work. Dave\u2019s vox are angry and I love the line \"Hells open for business now!\u201d the song though is a bit long but nonetheless stands as another impressive song. Of Mice and Men sounds classic, really nice song on display here (surely no.2). I don\u2019t know why people hate this song because it\u2019s extremely catchy and has some good guitar work and a great solo. Dave\u2019s vocals take the melodic edge here but they are pleasurable to listen to, the lyrics are very nicely structured out. \n\nShadow of Deth is another needless interlude. It features some good guitar work but just ends up boring the listener; they could have used those riffs on another song instead. My Kingdom provides the finishing touch to the album and is a mediocre song but all in all a good ending to a enjoyable album.\n\nSo, that concludes this review. The System Has Failed is a good album, but only to the open minded. A new direction and a varied album for Megadeth and this possibly could be the last (judging Mustaine doesn't go back on his words!).\n",
        "\nAs a big Megadeth fan, I still ponder as to what Dave Mustaine was thinking creating Risk, which has as much in common with alternative music as it does heavy metal. Gone are even the slight traces of heavy metal that were present between Youthanasia and Cryptic Writings. The music is more simplified than ever, mainly because this is the first Megadeth album that contains average guitar riffage. Let me also state I have no objection to rock music, just that Dave Mustaine must have released this album either under pressure to appease the softer musical tastes of Marty Friedman or just to create music with a partial Megadeth sound that can appeal to the current trends in the music industry. Either way I say rather confidently that Megadeth is not the greatest at writing this style of music. \n\nPrince of Darkness turns into a decent track with a somewhat enjoyable metal riff 4:40 into the song with a trademark metal solo after putting up with Mustaine's attempt at turning Megadeth into bland rock music. Enter The Arena is basically an intro for the more popular hit Crush Em and has an OK riff(which is pretty mediocre in my books). The chorus is quite catchy but it has the same problem as pretty well all the songs of this album. Lack of even decent guitar riffage. I'm not sure if its because the lack of incredible guitarwork I'm accustomed to but it also seems that there is not nearly enough lead guitar throughout this album. Breadline follows the clean verse, distorted alternative chorus which they have done much, much better on previous albums. The Doctor is Calling starts with a clean guitar reminscent of ONE(what the heck Dave?) with a weird effect and turns into a slow/midpace hard rock number where he doesn't seem to shut up about hearing the Doctor Calling. A notable solo that kicks ass but its too little too late at this point to revive the once metal juggernaut known as Megadeth. \n\nAt this point I'm just too drained and discouraged to go through the rest of the songs. If you are interested in an album where Mustaine's vocals and lyrics are front in the center as opposed to his incredible guitar prowess from previous albums, then this album could very well be for you. Even the songs on The System has Failed with Risk influence are more interesting than this. If you are a true Megadeth fan you own this regardless of its disappointment. I would recommend avoiding this album entirely if you have no interest in rock music whatsoever. Even for a catchy rock album I still find this only passable.\n",
        "\nI love Megadeth. One of my all-time favorite bands. I don't understand what the hell this is about. I know the Japanese CD market sucks, full of piracy and all, but this is just very redundant. The songs are just Cryptic Writings songs with extra guitars and no vocals. The extra guitars aren't even all that great! It's just a whole bunch of nonsense. It would have been a much better deal if it was more than just Cryptic Writings material, AND extended the songs to include new solos and what not. The possibilities could have been greater, but what can you do?\n\nAnyhow, the songs themselves sound almost like on the record. Obviously, if you don't like Cryptic, this ain't for ya. It's pretty boring though, and for 20 minutes, you begin to think that it was a waste of time putting this in your CD player when you could have slipped in your copy of Cryptic Writings and listen to the real song. Pretty lame.\n",
        "\nI\u2019ve never really been a fan of Megadeth\u2019s middle age stuff (read: after Rust In Peace). That stuff was easy to dismiss after just a few listens \u2013 records should have more to them than just some inspiring Marty Friedman solos. The System Has Failed kicked back from the far side of the grave, slaying most of the previous albums \u2013 still it\u2019s not that good. I mean I listen to the album, thinking this song isn\u2019t that great, pressing forward and still I like it. Dave Mustaine has recovered some of his old forms, still keeping the melodic edge the later albums have been filled with.\n\nDave Mustaine always has been known for/good at masking pop song with a thrash outfit. Now that outfit crackles and the structural skeleton surfaces a few too many times. Die Dead Enough seems to have been shortened in order to fit single length and the four last verses of Back in the Day is pure theft. That melody is stolen (or \u201cborrowed\u201d) from Uriah Heep\u2019s \u201cLady in Black\u201d. The intro to My Kingdom Come is so close to Virgin Steele\u2019s \u201cI Will Come for You\u201d that Dave probably has to pay them royalties\u2026 The song writing just isn\u2019t on top; most songs are no more than decent. The news broadcasts are just desperate attempts to hide this flaw but they don\u2019t really make anything better. Extinction camps for spoken parts should be arranged.\n\nWe all know that Dave\u2019s become a sell-out, although he refuses the thought by saying \u201cI didn\u2019t cut my hair\u201d. He went from riff thick thrash to great thrash to pop and now to power metal. He sings about Lars Ulrich selling out, oh the irony. There was a time when Dave stated that no respectable hard rock band ever used keyboards. Now he\u2019s doing exactly that. The System Has Failed is filled with keyboard loops, samplings and other stupid sound effects. Personally I don\u2019t have any problems with the keyboards it\u2019s the other stuff that bothers me.\n\nIn his attempt to pay back the debts to his label Mustaine even incorporated a banjo on this album \u2013 which was supposed to be a thrash recording. Who\u2019d think that? It works out rather well though, as it\u2019s pretty much inaudible. I mean both the banjo and the thrash. Actually Tad Morose makes thrashier music than Megadeth nowadays. No matter what, The System Has Failed is an incredible improvement after the few most recent abortions.\n\nThe thrash has become power metal, the melodies are the basis, harmonies are where riffs used to hang around. Marty Friedman is gone. Back is Poland who does a good job, but both he and Dave seem to have forgotten about riffs. There\u2019s one intro riff to Blackmail the Universe, but they use it throughout the song \u2013 and it\u2019s not that good. Fact is, that\u2019s the only good part of that song. I don\u2019t think the number of riffs ever been so low before. Of course leads and solos are great, the way the guitars harmonize with the music is great too, something that never happened before. Still this is Megadeth \u2013 we want riffs. Dave said that Metallica would run out of his riffs. He was right. Now he\u2019s not far away from doing so himself. There are more riffs in one song of the Last Rites demo than on this entire album.\n\nFlashiness has won over quality. I don\u2019t mean wankery, but it\u2019s not that way. It\u2019s more like solos, leads, repeat with extended tones \u2013 making them gleam somehow. Before I would\u2019ve said Megadeth \u2013 good guitars = suck. That\u2019s changed. The melody is a competitor for the attention and the vocals have improved. According to Dave himself it\u2019s because he wasn\u2019t singing for two years, not even in church. That was supposed to strengthen his voice. Personally I don\u2019t know if the improvement should be accredited to resting or the mixing and sound effects. At least his voice is far from its former annoying standards, he hits more notes than ever before and has more power. Lacks the anger, though. But no Megadeth without some jenka dance, two steps forward, and one step back. On Blackmail the Universe Dave sets a new low-mark for vocals. Holy shit, it\u2019s that bad.\n\nIt\u2019s sad that most songs start out great \u2013 or at least promising, and then nothing more (positive) happens. Scorpion starts interestingly with a riff and then ends the same way, with some annoying ticking clock. The bridges and transitions are painfully apparent; they don\u2019t have the flow they\u2019re supposed to have. Being influenced by your earlier albums is allowed, but Dave, don\u2019t exaggerate. Most of the stuff that isn\u2019t taken from other bands was originally on Youthantasia, Cryptic Writings and The World Needs a Hero. But really, anyone will find twelve catchy, easily digested songs on first listen.\n\nOn the other hand one will also find a much slower Megadeth than history awarded us with. There\u2019s much plodding and pure crap. Actually I think this album could\u2019ve been edited down to an EP \u2013 but that wouldn\u2019t have rendered enough money I suppose. Without the news broadcasts, without Blackmail the Universe, the pointless 40 seconds long, plodding, useless rubbish with sound effects that is I Know Jack, the dying-after-the-intro, dead boring Of Mice and Men, the prayer that is Shadow of Deth and My Kingdom Come that never ends\u2026 An EP would\u2019ve had higher quality, and a playing length that better fitted said quality! \n\nBut The System Has Failed was still a pleasant surprise after Megadeth\u2019s recent albums. For the first time Dave isn\u2019t following Metallica, although he still dwells in the radio song land. But Vic is back, and that\u2019s all that matters! My only real problem is that this album is in fact not too good, still I spin it every now and then - with notable pleasure. It's easy music folks, and it's Megadeth. Sure, without thrash, anger or riffs, but Megadeth.\n",
        "\nOkay, I've come to the conclusion that this album is not a flop by any means, but neither is it the amazing comeback I was so excited about. The only truly phenomenal moment is the decisive charge forward of Mustaine energies and intelligence that starts us off. \"Blackmail the Universe\" crosses multiple terrains of past albums. Guitars primed and razor sharp to a degree not felt since the raw and crippling sounds of \"So Far, So Good... So What!\". Wrapped up tightly in a \"Holy Wars...\" structure and perfected with Chris Poland's confident, trademark solos bringing you right back to the \"Peace Sells...\" days. It's inspiring to say the least.\n\nBut the brief moment of glory is not shared by the rest of the album's runtime. Our only other heavy track comes in the form of \"Kick the Chair\", which bridges the gap from \"Countdown to Extinction\" finding its way to the angry edge of earlier albums, with its rapid back to back solos reminiscent of \u201cHanger 18\u201d. The rest of the album hasn\u2019t quite got this feel down, but should be generally accessible to anybody with a liking for any album after the barrier breaking \u201cRust in Peace\u201d. They bridge the vibrant signature sounds of yore with styling that feeds off some up-to-date sources but without going as far as watering down or taking over the Mustaine powerhouse.\n\nThe album carries with it a slew of backend missteps, in the form of two wholly irritating songs and two directionless interludes. \u201cOf Mice and Men\u201d is built upon its chorus, which is not good when it reaches down to the lowest cringe worthy depths of modernized harmonies. A miniscule solo is unable to glue this shoddy job together at all. Along with \u201cMy Kingdom\u201d, the album ends with hurried and vacuous arrangements. The two interludes are terminally pointless, and even though \u201cShadow of Deth\u201d threatens to go somewhere interesting, it just can\u2019t be arsed to.\n\nNothing near a \u201cRust in Peace 2\u201d, but it does have its special qualities and wraps up Megadeth\u2019s career as a whole, even though it is just Dave with (bar Chris Poland) a band of new unknowns. Long term fans of the band will find something to enjoy here, though anybody who didn\u2019t like anything Dave and co. released into the 90s will once more be disappointed, no matter with what he puts out these days it seems.\n",
        "\nCountdown To Extinction is my third Megadeth purchase, and an eight dollar purchase, at that. I bought their Capitol Punishment album shortly after it came out, figuring I probably wouldn't buy another Megadeth album. It was loaded with tracks from the mediocre Cryptic Writings, however, and wasn't really that good. Then, having been convinced that Peace Sells... But Who's Buying was the band's best work, I bought it, only to find that the title track was the only real standout. Having been somewhat disappointed with Megadeth, I didn't figure I'd buy anything else from them, but I saw this album at a used record store, and I figured, what the hell, it's only eight bucks...\n\nI'd hafta say this is my favourite Megadeth album of the three. It's not as fast as Peace Sells, which may be a bad thing for people into thrash, but overall, I think it's a better album, as the songs are catchier and more memorable.\n\nThe album starts off with a pretty fast track in Skin O' My Teeth, and then goes into the megahit Symphony of Destruction. While I liked this song the first time I heard it, after hearing it several times on radio, at hockey games, etc, it's lost some of its appeal. Its fairly simplistic, and while the verses are easy to memorize, they're nothing too profound.\n\nThe next two tracks are nothing memorable. Architecture of Agression is a decent thrashy piece, but nothing to write home about. Foreclosure of a Dream has a stupid accoustic intro, and while the song evenutally picks up the pace, it's nothing special either.\n\nThe middle of the album, however, is what makes it worth buying. Fifth track Sweating Bullets is, in my opinion, Dave Mustaine's greatest composition. As displayed on earlier songs like Peace Sells, Mustaine employs what I refer to as the \"Call And Answer\" lyric technique, where one line asks a question or makes a statement, and the next line answers it, if you will. This song, a tale of a schizoprenic psychopath, is perhaps the best example of \"Call And Answer\" lyrics I've ever heard, and it's got a pretty cool bridge/chorus too. Definitely my fav Megadeth song.\n\nThe next few tracks, This Was My Life, (a great \"Hey, why don't I murder my girlfriend?\" song) Countdown To Extinction, and High Speed Dirt are all great songs, and while the ninth and tenth tracks Psychotron (stupidest Mustaine lyrics I've ever heard) and Captive Honour (a failed experiment using voices of a judge, or something) are pretty lame, it ends on a high note with the thrasher Ashes In Your Mouth.\n\nOverall, I'd say that Countdown To Extinction is well above average. I'd give it ten percent for every dollar I paid for it. (Plus a couple bonus points; sales tax, ya know?)\n",
        "\nBy now most reviewers have probably discovered that Cryptic Writings, when released, was a far cry from anything this band has produced beforehand. The thrash/speed metal stylings are pretty well abolished here. Instead we are treated with more mid-tempo, melodic heavy metal riffs and as stated before more than a fair share of memorable choruses that could get consistent radio rotation without forgetting the guitar solo's.\n\nDespite much of the negative reaction towards this album I still believe that whether Mustaine doesn't need to write thrash metal to release great albums. Youthanasia was is the perfect example and Cryptic Writings is as well(even though it is a step down). What you get is some songs with great heavy metal riffs/arena rock choruses (trust, mastermind), the emotional ballads(use the man) and the occassional ass kicker with at least some thrash appeal(disintegrators, she-wolf) \n\nDave Mustaine's vocals are one aspect I think has improved over time. He can still do the aggressive vocals but he has shown he can certainly hold a note. The music at times leaves something to be desired on some intro's and choruses but overall Mustaine comes up with some great main metal riffs even if they aren't played really fast. It could be argued whether this album is metal or a hard rock album at times. Perhaps a mixture of the two? The guitar solo's are there, not in full force but still shred. The album seems a bit too experimental into the uninteresting territory that will soon follow with Risk but fortunately there was enough riffage to redeem it. There are also preferrable tracks but overall its still rather consistent.\n\nI would advise that you give this album a fair listen and not judge by what fellow reviewers think. Its usual to dismiss this album but realistically it has enough riffage to call it a great album despite being their weakest to date. \n\nFavorites : Trust, Almost Honest, The Disintegrators, A Secret Place\n",
        "\n\"Peace Sells... But Who's Buying?\" A classic of thrash metal of course, and a legendary sophomore from one of the biggest thrash bands, back in the day when they were truly Thrash with a capital T. With some of the heaviest riffs they ever did, they rage away furiously, and the remaster sounds absolutely devastating - now I haven't heard the original, but since Dave wasted all their production cash on heroin and other fun substances, I can't imagine it sounds too good. But whatever, the one I've got sounds brilliant.\n\nThe fast, heavy and generally quite technical riff-style of classic Megadeth is ever present, and combined with alot of melodic elements infused perfectly into the riffs, this turns into a thrash album which doesn't sound very much like anything else, and is definitely a must-have for any thrasher.\nSongs like \"The Conjuring\", for example, have riffs that fit into the thrash category, but that are very technical and melodic. That one and \"Bad Omen\" especially have very jumpy and unusual riffs that are executed very well.\n\nOpening tack \"Wake Up Dead\" is pretty interesting as well, with a whole bunch of catchy riffs and quite few vocal parts.\n\nThe most standard thrash song on here is \"Black Friday\", which is also one of the best Megadeth songs ever. Mainly single-note riffs demolish everything here, combined with the odd but lethal vocals in classic early Mustaine style. Top that off with the crazy soloing of Mustaine/Poland and you have one hell of a thrasher. \"Devil's Island\" with it's galloping riffs is also in a more standard thrash vein, but rages away excellently just as well.\n\nFor other highlights, we have of course the classic \"Peace Sells\", with it's quite simplistic but oh so fucking catchy beginning - the lyrics are as classic as it gets, and with hard-hitting midpaced power chords the song is fit for headbanging. Then Dave does another of those classic Megadeth-styled fast and difficult melodic riffs building the song up to a climax and an excellent finish.\n\nAnd then of course, we mustn't forget the closer \"My Last Words\". The clean guitar and bass intro build up a very nice atmosphere, and goes into another one of Megadeth's best songs. The main riff is about as cool as that of \"Tornado of Souls\". It's technical, but unlike the technical shit of prog bands, this is also fucking cool and catchy. Combined with more simple power chords during the fast paced verses we have an awesome set of riffs backed up by excellent driving bass work and insanely catchy, dramatic vocals.\nThe atmosphere builds more with every second, feeling as the main character (or whatever you wanna call it) in the song gets closer to dying from a thrilling game of russian roulette. The song is later perfected into the dark, sinister breakdown (\"Does anybody play!?\") and the amazing riff/solo section that follows it. Probably the best Megadeth song ever. It's either this or \"Tornado of Souls\".\n\n\n\nBut there really isn't a bad song on here. Dave Mustaine and Megadeth had their very own brand of thrash metal, and he's always done his thing, which he needs respect for. And since he doesn't really follow any standards and does what he wants, a few moments here and there sound a bit \"off\", but he quickly redeems himself constantly, and all in all, this is an essential thrash masterpiece, though most of you probably know this already.\n",
        "\nFirstly, Megadeth (and Dave as it were), are basically god to me. So, while I like pretty much anything Megadeth, I'm also damned picky. Biased as this may be, as a Megadeth fan, I know what I'm talking about (at least for the most part).\n\nWhile we'd all like to see another Rust In Peace, we might as well all shut-up and get over the fact that RIP has already happened, no member of any band likes writing the same crap over and over again, they have to grow a little. Unfortunately, Megadeth's growing came in tumor form with Risk (even though I like some of that disk), and let's face it, World Needs A Hero didn't cut it either. \n\nThe System Has Failed, however, was a bit more than I expected, and about as good as I had hoped for. Finally, Dave is heard snarling through a couple songs, most notably, Kick The Chair, which thunders by all too quickly with...(could it be??)... RIP-style riffing! Actual Thrash Metal songs pop up through the course of the album, including Blackmail the Universe (although the voice-over story therein lasts too long for my tastes), Back In The Day, and the interludey I Know Jack has decent riffing. These tracks could have come from an album linking RIP and CTE.\n\nThe Scorpion (my favorite track here), Die Dead Enough, Tears In A Vial, and Something That I'm Not could've come from Youthanasia. Especially considering how many unreleased (on full-length albums) tracks exist from that era (including Crown of Worms & New World Order). Plus, they'd fit nicely onto that disk. \n\nOf Mice And Men & Truth Be Told are alright, if relatively unnoticable tracks. Almost like they're filler drifting from CTE on through Cryptic Writings. Shadow Of Deth and My Kingdom Come seem like leftovers from TWNAH, and while I like SOD (um, the song just mentioned, not the band--although Scott Ian and company are entertaining, too) for it's overall sound, I feel a tad cheated that it's just a fuckin Psalm from the bible rather than a wholly new song.\n\nOverall, it's better than the last two releases, and as close as I think we're gonna get to a full length album containing a sound similar to Hidden Treasures (which is just below RIP as my favorite release from Megadeth). So it's supposed to be the last Megadeth? Dave could've ended it with something worse. Much much worse. This is the best since CW, containing some surprise riffing and energy (and snarling!!) going way back to RIP. Megadeth, Anthrax, OverKill fans and fans of more \"traditional\" metal should at least give it a listen. Unlike Suktallica, or Larstallica, or whatever the hell Metallica should really be called, Dave has at least proven that he has the ability to write heavy music without coming off with looking retarded or like he's trying too damn hard. \"So in anger with you???!!\" I can't believe I used to like that shitty band!\n",
        "\nIt's been said that people need to stop expecting Dave to put out another thrash masterpiece and accept his streamlined metal for what it is, and I fully agree. This album actually has a few great modern heavy metal songs on it--but there's no real thrash to be found. Those days are gone and are not coming back.\n\nWe start off with \"Blackmail the Universe,\" which tries earnestly to be thrashy (or at least some kind of heavy...), but stumbles over on it self from the moment that fake newscast comes on. The idea of Air Force One being shot down by a stinger missile is amusing enough, but come on. The whole thing's kinda lame. Anyway. Next we have \"Die Dead Enough,\" which I, personally, really enjoy. Not extremely heavy, but you can't look at it that way. Like I said, those days are long gone. This is a catchy, mid-tempo metal song with some nice, bouncy breaks (\"Ayee-ayee-ayy...\") and an awesome chorus. The next cut, \"Kick the Chair,\" is the thrashiest we get here, but... it's not thrash. It\u2019s fun, though\u2013chorus get\u2019s your energy going. This track shows again that Dave can still write catchy tunes, and work wonders with simple riffs.\n\n\"The Scorpion\" is another highlight... mid-tempo, not old-school in any manner, and yet, again, catchy as fuck. The buzzing riff played on the high-E string leads into some cool organ/pizzicato-string keyboard work, which somehow reminds me of something Fate would have done (intro to \"The Oath\"?). Dave's lyrical ability has been struggling for a while now (See: \"Psychotron\"), but the melodrama you see in the verses and the hostility heard in the chorus make for a good time. Again, the fake newscasts at the end are silly, but ha... \"...went berserk with a 12-gauge shotgun...\" Yes. \n\n\"Tears in a Vial\" is another one of Dave's whiny \"failed relationship\" songs, but they never really bothered me. Half-thumbs up to this one, it\u2019s catchy. \"I Know Jack\" is simply the first of two pointless segues. \"Back in the Day\" once again teases us by coming mouth-wateringly close to thrashiness, only to promptly back off into wank. Decent song nevertheless, the change-up at about 1:55 gives way to galloping guitar work and lyrical praise of the old-school. Vocals here are fun. The lyrics in this song kinda alienate the younger fans like myself though. I guess I \"wouldn't understand\".\n\nOh boy... then we come to \"Something That I'm Not\". Kill me. Awful groove metal, and the lyrics are annoying. I mean--I hate Lars Ulrich just as much as the next guy, but PLEASE, Dave. Stop fucking whining about it. I find no redeeming qualities in this song. Upon first listen of \u2018System\u2019, \"Something That I'm Not\" is where I truly started to lose faith in the album. Moving on... with \"Truth Be Told\" we have a clean intro passage, which is kinda nice, nothing objectionable here. Then at about 2:55 (\"...'til death do us part...\"), the song builds, and you know something good\u2019s coming... but... what's this? What the hell is this? This riff is completely empty, not heavy at all, though it wants to be. The lyrics don\u2019t flow, and the group vocals (\"TRUTH BE TOLD\"), which once kicked our ass in such songs of mass destruction as \"Take No Prisoners,\" now feel silly and overused. Blah blah, repeat steps 1-2, then at the 3-minute mark we have a little chuggity-chiggity break which would be okay if it wasn't so... pointless. That's followed by some less-than-heavy riffing and decent soloing. Then at about 3:11, things start to speed up, we've got a basic thrash beat and some less-that-inspired speed riffing. Then the song's over. Okay. Next? \"Of Mice and Men\". Something good could have been done with this chorus. Unfortunately, it doesn't really go anywhere. As for the lyrics, I.... don't want to hear Dave's life story... AGAIN. Chalk it up to his ego I guess. The chorus should have been so good, but those damned vocal effects makes it hard to listen to, and it just... doesn't fit in with the song. The underlying riff during the chorus is all over the place and has no sense of coherence, it really feels like a cop-out--that riff could not have been hard to write, but it sounds complex if you're not really analyzing it. Other than that... well, there is nothing else. Skip. \"Shadow of Deth\"\u2013the second of two pointless segues. As for the closer, \"My Kingdom\"... I don't really know what to say. There's nothing exceedingly BAD about it, but there's nothing GOOD about it, either. Boring, slow, uninspired, it's all been done. Kinda makes me think of TWNAH. And then... that's it.\n\nSo there you have it, I guess. Upon hearing \"Kick the Chair\" for the first time on the Deth website, long before TSHF was released, I thought maybe Dave was going to make an earnest return to at least TRYING to sound heavy. But no. We get another feeble attempt to preserve his waning relevancy and to feed his ego. But hey... as much as I'm complaining, I honestly like a few of the songs on here. And those highlights would be: \"Die Dead Enough,\" \"Kick the Chair,\" and \"The Scorpion\". Those tracks have managed to stay in my playlist rotation for the time being, but the whole rest of the album just does nothing for me.\n",
        "\nMustaine has stated that The System Has Failed will infact be the last album he writes to bear the \"Megadeth\" name... and when you look at it, it's a fitting final chapter for the band. He has created an album which essentially covers the mid-section of Megadeth's career. No, this is not a thrash album, so don't expect to hear gems like \"Good Mourning / Black Friday part 2\" on here. However, many songs on TSHF sound like they could have easily been on either Countdown to Extinction, Youthanasia, and yes, even Rust in Peace. \n\nWhat seperates this album from it's predecesor, The World Needs A Hero, is that none of the new songs sound forced. Dave's music for the first time in about a decade comes off as unihibited. The mid-paced, slower songs on this album (Countdown and Youthanasia esque) have catchy melodies and riffs. Dave's lyrics sound like they have purpose this time around, and in some cases, the music rages on in ways we haven't seen since Rust in Peace. \n\nWhat prevents this album from being a total sucess is that Mustaine for some reason can't give everyone too much of a good thing. The killer cuts here are : Blackmail the Universe (Rust in Peace era shredder, awesome double kick), Die Dead Enough (A nicely done Youthanasia esque ballad), Kick the Chair (Reminds me a LOT of Take No Prisioners, with awesome lyrics to boot), Tears in a Vial (sweet sounding ballad, with some nice solo work and speed metal outro), Back in the Day (Fast paced song with cool shredding and double kick outro), and Truth Be Told (Starts off slow and melodic, but the last half of the song is a pure Rust in Peace shred fest). Aside from these songs though the rest of the album is meh. No bad tracks, but nothing else stand out. Songs like The Scorpion, Something That I'm Not, Of Mice and Men, and even the album closer My Kingdom Come, all have quality and catchy riffs, but they come of as kind of stagnant. You feel as if these songs should go into a speed break, but instead keep the same tempo throughout. In some cases there is a speed break, but it never lasts long enough for you to totally get into it. \n\nThe two interlude songs, I know Jack, and Shadow of Deth both are cool, and have nice riffs, but they end to early. The latter, Shadow of Deth is the Shadow of Death prayer spoken by Vic Rattlehead, which is then followed by a sweet sounding solo... however the song then transitions into the final track, and never really establishes itself. Had Mustaine developed both I Know Jack and Shadow of Death into full length songs with lyrics, they would have been awesome.\n\nBut all in all, this album provides a not perfect, but fitting closure to Megadeths' career. If you are a fan of Megadeth's catalog up to and Including Youthanasia (as am I), you will most likely enjoy this album. Just don't buy it expecting Rust in Peace part 2, for dissapointment will surely follow (despite that fact that the album does have it's thrash moments). Pehaps thinking of this album as Countdown to Extinction Part 2 is more appropriate, seeing as it is the best Megadeth album, since then.\n",
        "\nThis is a fantastic home video. Its chalk full of behind the scenes action as well as countless one on one interviews with both the band members as well as producer Max Norman. This was released at a time when Megadeth was still at the heap of their popularity and had an enormous fan base of die hard metal heads as well as the newer mainstream type fans who were turned on to the band by the Countdown album. Some of the highlights on this video include the step by step construction of a studio that was actually used to record the Youthanasia album. Also there are several scenes of the band rehearsing live in the studio. Black Curtains is played to perfection! Also, there is footage of the band doing a professional style photo shoot in New York. The concept of the album cover is explained, as is the way the children that appear to be hanging from the clothes line were photographed. \nThis video is truly an interesting in depth look at a succesfull Metal bands inception and creation, following right on through to the completion of an exceptional album. One of the highlights for me with this video was the fact that Dave Mustaine, who has such a bad reputation for being a controlling tyrant, is actually portrayed as a humble and comical kind of guy. Focusing primarily on the music, Dave's ego is put aside and he treats everyone in this video with the utmost respect. \nAnother great thing about the timing of this project, was that Dave was not using drugs at the time and it really shows. There are no manic moments, nor are there any multi-personality traits that appear to be present.\nAnyone who has seen Metallica's \"A year and a half in the life of Metallica\", and enjoyed that video, will absolutely love this video. By comparing these two video's, you'll see the difference between Dave's vision and his genius as a musician as oppose to Metallica's alliance with a producer that basically controlled the entire process of their recording. This video only validates the opinion that Dave Mustaine is an \"Einstein\" in the realm of music and his genius simply cannot be denied.\nThis video is well worth purchasing, and is a must for all Megadeth fans!\n",
        "\nReleased following the double live album of the same name, Megadeth's 'Rude Awakening' DVD does what the double CD does so well: feature a legendary thrash band in top form. You can't tell by simply watching Dave Mustaine play that he was having arm trouble, which led to Megadeth's demise soon after the double CD release. The setlist is for many a Megadeth fan to enjoy, as material from all of Megadeth's albums are found here, except for 'Risk'. (\"Angry Again,\" from the 'Hidden Treasures' disc, is contained in the extra features, along with four other 'Deth classics).\nAs mentioned before, the band is in top form here. The highlight of the disc is Jimmy Degrasso's drum solo in \"She-Wolf,\" with guitar solos from Dave Mustaine and Al Pitrelli bookending the drum solos. \"Trust,\" \"Dread & The Fugitive Mind,\" \"In My Darkest Hour,\" \"Sweating Bullets,\" and the disc closing \"Holy Wars... The Punishment Due\" are strong points as well. There are also several songs from their last studio album featured here as well, and \"1000 Times Goodbye,\" thankfully, does not include the annoying chick. As for Mustaine talking to the crowd, there is very little of it to be found here, as Megadeth proudly lets the music do the talking.\n\nSound and video quality is a different story, though. The video, when played back on a computer DVD-ROM drive, looks grainy and pixilated at times, with only a few glimpses of any clarity. And the sound is sometimes distorted and not really crystal clear, during the concert itself. The sound quality, in my opinion, is actually clearer on the CD than the DVD. However, the special feature, \"Megadeth On Megadeth\", is a joy to both watch and hear, in terms of both sound and image quality. Whether the quality is improved on a regular (television) DVD setup is uncertain. \nAlso featured is a write-up by Metal Edge editor-in-chief Paul Gargano. And, as mentioned earlier, the \"Underground Show\" contains five bonus Megadeth songs performed live, but in black and white.\n\nThis is an excellent DVD to purchase if you are looking for a great live performance from a truly great thrash metal band. Just don't let the somewhat lackluster video quality get to you.\n\n\nOriginally written for http://www.metal-reviews.com\n",
        "\nMetallica had just become the most popular metal band on the planet with the release of the Black album, and after two years of touring, went on hiatus. Megadeth was starting to gain momentum in popularity, in fact, almost to Metallica's level with the release of Countdown To Extinction. But unlike the Black Album, Countdown was more commercial sounding without too many of the \"pop-rock\" tendencies. After Metallica went on hiatus before releasing Load, Megadeth was in position to become just as popular as Metallica. They had also released two songs that appeared on soundtrack, and eventually on the Hidden Treasures EP (\"99 Ways To Die\" and \"Angry Again\") that gave fans hope that the band was \"returning\" to the greatness of the Rust In Peace album. Then came Youthanasia, released in the fall of 1994. And instead of thrashing out with the songs on here, they focused more on good songwriting than being hellbent of writing mosh-driven rhythm.\n\nBasically, this album is much more commercial sounding than any of the albums from Rust In Peace and before, but it sounds commercial without sounding like a blatant sellout or cashgrab, as another reviewer said. The songwriting is still very good, and at this point in their career, Dave Mustaine and Marty Friedman are still one of the top guitar duos in the metal business. While you won't find a lot of riffs in the thrash mold like a lot of chug riffs and stutters, there is still a lot of attention to the lead work. And what excellent lead work it is.\n\nThe highlights: In my opinion, almost every song is a highlight in some way, but \"Blood Of Heroes\", \"Addicted To Chaos\", and \"Reckoning Day\" take the spots as the top songs here. These songs have good steady rhythm provided by Dave Ellefson and Nick Menza, as well as top-of-the-shelf lead work from Friedman and Mustaine. \"A Tout Le Monde\" is Megadeth's first ballad since \"In My Darkest Hour\" (from So Far So Good So What!) and is definitely no \"Nothing Else Matters\". Not weak sounding, and not accompanied by a string section, just the band themselves playing a well written song to a chorus that happens to be in French, just like the title of the song. A strong ballad indeed. \"Victory\" is a tribute to the band's career, with the lyrics showcasing the band's past and containing many of Megadeth's classic songs throughout the lyrics. This is a blueprint to how a good power metal song should be written. A very strong ending to the album! \"Blood Of Heroes\" and \"Family Tree\" sound similar, but are strong, especially when dealing with maintaining a consistent head-moving rhythm throughout. \"Train Of Consequences\" is a nasty sounding song, especially with the chorus, and there is a very good stutter-effect sounding riff that opens the song. \"Elysian Fields\" - BANG THAT HEAD, SON, this is one of the heaviest songs offered here. The title track and \"I Thought I Knew It All\" are also good, and while they sound like radio hits, they are still well-written.\n\nThe lowlights: It's hard to find a reason for me to put this album down, but basically all I'll say is that this is not as ripping and thrashing as Rust In Peace. But then, what else is? What other thrash band, by anyone, has come close to the godliness of that album? It's hard as hell to find. This is not a thrash album by any means, but I'm not complaining.\n\nWho this album's for: Fans of any of the thrash Big Four. Power metal fans will also enjoy this album, as this album is a blueprint on how to write a good power metal album. Hell, even a casual Megadeth fan will find much to enjoy about this. Just as long as they are not expecting Rust In Peace Part 2, this should definitely suffice.\n\nThe bottom line: This is an album that belongs in any collection, especially fans of Megadeth or metal in general. There is good songwriting on here, and the guitar playing on here is still top of the line. Unfortunately, it does go downhill from here until Megadeth makes a semi-comeback with The World Needs A Hero.\n",
        "\nIf you've read my Peace Sells... But Who's Buying? review, you may recall that I said that I felt that record was their best. I'd like to say right now that I'm not entirely sure what was going on in my head at the time, but that I can now say that I was wrong. That's not to say that Peace Sells isn't damn good, because it has some killer songs like the title track, \"My Last Words\", and \"Good Mourning/Black Friday\", but for all it's quality and charm, it can't beat this sparkly wall-o'-thrash Rust in Peace. This album is one of the most melodic thrash records that I have ever heard, everything scintillating hi-fidelity and most of the riffage emphatically light and blitzkrieging, even the trademark Bay Area crunch bits coming off as nimbler than even their more progressive rivals, although the trade-off being that they seem quite a bit less heavy.\n\nThere really aren't many albums out there like this to my ears, just this strangely virtuosic melodic speed, Marty and Dave not necessarily playing more complex than others, but perhaps simply playing more thought-out music at high speeds, because even the shredding when it comes it usually hooked to soaring harmony leads (and when, they cut like knives), Indian flavours, and jazz-based noodling that bust out unpredictably but generally with a modicum of logic. Perhaps my favourite lead on the album comes on \"Lucretia\", because it's so slow and drawn out despite the speed of the riffery in the background, a good minute and a half of amazing soloing stuffed into a highly underwritten track until the whole thing seems fit to burst like an overheated pizza pop, yet mysteriously stays a whole perfectly. In fact, many of the riffs sound like solos because they're so note-dense and often so lead-based, which just leads to this feeling of a veritable symphony of guitars. Not only that, but on tracks like \"Five Magicks\" they seem to cram thoughtful solos intro every available space, and with Friedman's touch it works perfectly.\n\nIn addition, the band has a secret weapon in Dave Ellefson, because whether or not he's the most technically adept player out there (I wouldn't know) his sound is lovely. The intro to \"Poison Was the Cure\" is simple, but I just love that warm, full bass line, unhurried and tight as the guitars solo around him slowly build before introducing a great, fast drum and superbusy riff, pointedly showing you kids how to build a mood. Furthermore, when he's given a chance to do a solo spot he's magic, his little \"Take No Prisoners\" bass run being a beautiful piece of business.\n\nYea and verily, the songs (and more importantly here, the riffs) are top-notch, each song section virtually independent of the whole, \"Hanger 18\" lyrical section a brief intro to the shredding solo-fest on the back-half, \"Take No Prisoners\" exhibiting a shoddy first verse before morphing into a near perfect thrash assault as annoying melodies are exchanged for a short multiple-solo break as segue to a completely different and infinitely superior second verse. It's funny that the sprawling \"Holy Wars...The Punishment Due\", despite it's abrupt shift at the midway point feels more cohesive than say, \"Five Magicks\" which rambles off into a half-dozen sections that hit and miss with equal frequency.\n\n\"Tornado of Souls\" is the only real conventional song on here when all's told, the other candidate \"The Dawn Patrol\", a highly abbreviated bass with Dave's strange English accent, being so far out of the headspace of any other thrash act, hell metal act, that it becomes worthless to compare it to anything else. There is something about this very strangeness that makes RiP such an enduring album, something more being the sheer riffing genius of the thing of course.\n\nTo be fair, I've got some problems with this. The tracks are really underwritten, a verse or two before more breakdowns (I swear they fit Dream Theater's six-minute \"Metropolis\" break into thirty seconds on some of these tracks), some of the song structures here being more than worthy of getting some more writing time, an example being \"Poison Was the Cure\" which could've used either another two-verses of equal length or a re-read of the existing ones. There aren't enough choruses here either, the only one with a significant one (outside of \"Rust in Peace...Polaris\") \"Tornado of Souls\" having such a great one that it hurts that we only get to hear it twice. Also, there is still some goofiness apparent in the monster voice on \"Five Magicks\" (seriously, it's like a Steel Attack record or something) and the stupid backing vocals (and ending refrain) on \"Take No Prisoners\" that make me want to curse the 80's in general (did someone say the disc came out in 1990? Quiet, you). Oh yeah, and \"The Dawn Patrol\" despite having a truly awesome title, seems rather pointless.\n\nHowever, despite some issues and reservations I have, or rather because every time I hear something incredible on this record (roughly every five seconds) like the chunked-up version of the main \"Holy Wars\" riff in the back half of the song or the spiralling descending chorus riff on \"Rust in Peace\" (seriously, it's such a visual riff that one can almost see the bombs dropping) or any hundred other sporadic, unique, and wonderful nuances, I find it in my heart to forgive them for all of those mistakes.\n\nStand-Outs: \u201cLucretia\u201d, \u201cHoly Wars\u2026The Punishment Due\u201d, \u201cTornado of Souls\u201d\n",
        "\nDamn it, Dave. Stop. Quit. Die. Do something. The horse has disintegrated into fine dust, and you must stop beating it. For the good of all in the world... GIVE UP.\n\nThis isn't really a horribly terrible album, but it is pretty fucking bad, and when one considers which band released it, it is just an absolute outrage. We've got far more shitty interludes than in every album up to this point, and far less triumphant riffage. Look at all the damn entire-songs that are just long drivel passages, like I Know Jack and Shadow of Death... random shit that isn't really considerable as \"song\" material. \n\nWe've also got stupid groove stuff like \"Something I'm Not\", which is Craptic Writings sewage... dumbass fast stuff with absolutely no punch like Kick the Chair, which tries oh-so-hard to be Peace Sells but really isn't even Youthanasia. Note to Clansman: the Virgin Steele intro to \"My Kingdom Come\" is \"I will Come For You\". This is no \"I will Come For You\". This is just a lot of \"Sweating Bullets\"-style riffage turned even lamer, with one cool riff section highlighted by an awful-sounding solo. Remember when Megadeth had lots of cool riff sections AND cool solos?\n\nThe only really truly memorable highlight of this album is the middle of Back in the Day, which is very good, except for the sneaking suspicion I get that it could've been completely amazing, in that Hanging in the Balance sense of the word. The rest of the album hints at that too, at times, but oh is the execution missing completely!! See \"Of Mice and Men\", the beginning - that modulation of the main melody sounds like it'll turn into something awesome, but it just keeps plodding along... and plodding along... it breaks into one quick fast section, but even that is no good. Then that multiple-layered vocal chorus section. Too many effects, too much fluff, not anywhere near enough substance.\n\nTears in a Vial has a decent under-verse riff, and some horrible overmelodic chorus parts. Seriously, Mustaine has no intention to be thrash, but if he just got his act together, he'd be damn good power metal. See \"Youthanasia\" for example... this is no Youthanasia, unfortunately. There isn't the over-the-top 80s chorusage of Blood of Heroes to be found here - it's as though Mustaine wrote down the first melody that came to mind, regardless of how mediocre it was. \n\nOh and one final note... the fake news report at the beginning is the DUMBEST shit I have ever heard. Defcon 3 is barely above Defcon 4, and Defcon 4 is \"all is well\". If the president were missing, it would be at least Defcon 2. Oh and how many asshole buzzwords can you use? Stinger missile, rogue terrorists, sleeper cell, etc... and finally, if the president's whereabouts are unknown, he's not assumed missing... he IS missing.\n\nThis album sucks... fucking disappointing, simply because every once in a while a great idea comes through, but damn is it quickly buried in the noise. Get yourself some Rust in Peace, and be happy. Avoid this crap.\n",
        "\nMegadeth's comeback album after going through many problems. First off, Mustaine has finally achieved what he's been trying to do since he got kicked out of Metallica; put out better music than them. Metallica's comeback was obviously utter crap. The System Has Failed may not be the best thing in metal, but at least it's listenable and pretty good in many parts. Also, it's not thrash, but it is much better than anything they've put out since younthanasia. In fact, I find this one a tad better.\n\nOpening track Blackmail the Universe has a couple of good riffs and chugs along. Heaviest opening track since Trust back in 1997. Die Dead Enough reminds me of Devil's Island in the beginning but then turns into a mediocre song that could fit on Cryptic Writings or Youthanasia. Kick The Chair is a return to the days of old, mainly Rust In Peace, and it's damn good. But it would seem to fit as a B-side for anything off that album. The Scorpion is a bit like a power metal song in the intro but then becomes slow and boring. Tears in a Vial is another boring song. I Know Jack is alright, and seems to have a build up of some sort, but again doesnt rip and tear like it should and then out of nowhere it just ends.??? Back in the Day is a better song than the previous few, and picks up a bit. This song would probably be better had it had a better main riff, instead of those high notes. Something I'm Not reminds me of Rust in Peace again, but still doesnt have that energy RIP has. Truth Be Told almost got me into it, but then the verse came and completly turned me off. Too damn slow! The build up to the chorus was nice and for a second sounded alright, but it was mediocre, then back to that really dumb verse. Of Mice and Men is again a disapointment. Shadow Of Deth sounds like Dave was trying to make a cliche power metal song, and it sounds stupid. My Kingdom Come sounded repetitive and should have definitly ripped. But alas, it didnt.\n\nOnce again, the \"this album's gonna be a return to the old days\" BS is there. It's sad that the once great thrash bands cannot make anything good anymore. The \"top 4\" (Metallica, Megadeth, Slayer, Anthrax) all disapoint with each release. This is still better than the recent catalouge the band has released. It has all the ingredients for a good metal album, but they're not mixed well, or at least as well as they should. I'd say get this album only because there's decent stuff here. But don't expect to be headbanging like crazy.\n",
        "\nI don't know what influenced Dave Mustaine and company to create Rust In Peace. Easily one of the most incredible thrash albums I have ever heard but I could go for a slice of it. After the less successful So Far So Good... Megadeth really needed to deliver an outstanding album which they achieved easily. Despite all the hype over this album I still don't consider this album overrated. Its that good. One thing noticable other than the intricate guitarwork is that this isn't the heaviest thrash metal album you will ever hear. This melodic edge to thrash metal might not appease most but they easily make up for this with the amazing guitarwork. Dave Mustaine's vocals are also weak(although I enjoy them immensely) from a metal standpoint but he writes some incredible lyrics and music to make up for this. Which brings us to the other critical aspect to the albums success. The lead guitar of arguably one of the best lead guitarists on the planet Marty Friedman. One thing that propels Megadeth above the zounds of other thrash acts is the barrage of outstanding solo's Special mention to Dave Ellefson for his excellent basslines which is a privilege to hear in great metal music. \n\nRarely have I seen such a display of such great rhythm and lead guitarwork as with Rust in Peace. From the massive speed riffing of Holy Wars to the insane guitar solo's of Hangar 18 this album is full of excellent music. Megadeth's ability to create songs that sound very different musically is another strong point. Each song is unique and different that is next to never repetitive. I could drag on about how 95% of their riffs are excellent but its an album that needs to be heard to appreciate. With the exception for the short bass passage which is still great each of the songs are outstanding. Its a shame Megadeth was never able to recapture this genius on later albums. I am still grateful that they released Rust In Peace. An undisputed thrash metal classic which I would recommend to anyone interested in Megadeth or metal in general. A must own metal album if I've ever seen one. \n\nFavorite Tracks: Literally all of them but if I were to pick. Holy Wars, Hangar 18, Tornado of Souls\n",
        "\nThis is not the return to Rust in Peace that was hoped and maybe even expected by some. It's not even thrash, though it has some thrash moments. I can catch a good riff here and there on most songs, but so many times a song slows down too much when I expect it to burst in my face. I'm trying to pin down what exactly annoys me so much about this album and it looks like the choruses are a strong contender. The vocals aren't aggressive at all and Mustaine is trying way too hard to be catchy here, even overdubbing the vocals, which comes too often at the detriment of the riffing. A good example of that would be 'The Scorpion': good riffing and soloing entertwined with annoying choruses. I don't remember the riffs ever stopping for the vocals on good metal albums - give me some old Kreator over this any day. Too often a song really gets its thing going on and all of a sudden you wonder \"Where did the riffs go? This was about to be good.\" Every song has its faster parts and better parts, but only 'Kick the Chair' and maybe 'Blackmail the Universe' don't leave anything to be desired. I mean, isn't that \"truth be told\" part annoying? Am I listening to a shitty pop song all of a sudden? What are all these over-produced vocal effects? Those are questions I don't want to be asking myself when listening to a Megadeth record. I'm not crazy about the \"I'm on the news\" thing he's got going on either. I love good production as much as the next guy, but let's not go out of our way to ruin otherwise fine parts. \n\nIt seems that I've been dwelling on the shortcomings of the album for a while, and I wouldn't want to leave the impression that it's a bad album - it's not, but it doesn't seem to know what it wants to be. Rust in Peace here, Youthanasia there, or something else entirely? What it is is a blend of good riffs, blazing solos, disappointing slow-downs, a few satisfying songs: 'Kick the Chair', 'Blackmail the Universe', 'Back in the Day', 'Tears in a VIal', some solid ones and others that could have been much better easily - just edit off the few annoying parts.\n",
        "\nAs nearly all of us know, Megadeth seemed to have been going through some problems recently. For one thing, their last 3 albums ranged from average to terrible. Marty Friedman left the band; Dave Mustaine had some weird arm problem. The future looked bleak for the former excellent thrash bands. But out of nowhere, came this quite good comeback album.\n\nFirstly, this is not a thrash or speed album. There are a couple of thrash/speed songs on it, but the majority of it is power, in the vein of Youthanasia. As Youthansia ruled, this does too. The lead guitar is excellent, courtesy of Chris Poland, the drumming is solid, and the riffs are for the most part, great. Poland is no Marty Friedman, but he is very good and his solos are usually well done. The only main problem is Mustaine's vocals; they are pretty bad when he tries to sing melodically.\n\nThe highlights include: The opener, Blackmail the Universe has some great riffs. The vocals during the chorus are a little crappy, but the song contains some of the coolest riffs on the album. Kick the Chair is the best song, with amazing riffs and an incredibly great and genious solo. Catchy vocals too. The Scorpion has superb lead guitar, Tears in a Vial has more cool riffs with another great solo, though you have to wait till the end to get to them, and My Kingdom Come is another excellent song, though the repetition of riffs gets a little annoying.\n\nSome of the worse tracks are Truth Be Told, which is a pretty bad ballad, though it picks up at the end and adds some more good riffs in. Of Mice and Men begins with a very annoying vocal performance by Mustaine, and generic riffs. Once again, it picks up near the end, but Mustaine's vocals during the chorus completely suck.\n\nIn total, this is a very comeback album. Its not as good as any of the \"glory days\" albums (Killing to Youthanasia) , but the band seems to be in the right direction again. Riffs are usually good, solos are good, everything's looking up. Some Megadeth fans might be annoyed by the lack of thrash, but if you enjoyed Youthansia, you'll most likely enjoy this.\n",
        "\nMegadeth's debut is one of those albums that could have been absoloutely amazing... if the production had been better. The songwriting on this album is incredible, and a taste of Dave's songwriting talents which would develop on later albums. This is Megadeth at their least structured, and what comes out is a good melodic thrash album.\n\nThere are only a couple of problems with this album. The first, is, as already mentioned, the production. While it is nowhere near the atrocity of production known as St. Anger, it could use some work. The lead guitar can be unclear at times, and the rhythm guitar's volume is way too low. The drums could also do with getting their volume lowered. With all these production problems, and because many of the songs sound the same, the songs tend to blur into each other. Dave Mustaine's vocals at this point are also pretty annoying, but luckily they get better in later albums.\n\nThe highlights are the title trach which has a great chorus that is very fun to sing along with. Mechanix is a faster and better version of the Four Horsemen, although Dave's vocals are especially annoying on that track. Rattlehead also has some kickass riffs, and is a nice little thrash track. Looking Down on the Cross is the best song here, and has some excellent lead guitar and great riffs. The other songs are good, though nothing special, with the exception of the cover of These Boots, which pretty much sucks. I mean, the guitar is good, but Mustaine's vocals are as annoying as ever, and all those beeps in the song get pretty damn annoying.\n\nWell, there we have it. This is not Megadeth's best release, and they definitely do get better as time goes on, but for a debut it is pretty damn good and has some excellent songs to its name. A must buy for all Megadeth fans and all thrash fans should at least download it.\n",
        "\nMegadeth's debut album Killing Is My Business...and Business is Good is a fairly decent album, but it suffers from poor production and too many versions. This album has three versions and it confused the hell out of me when I tried to write the tracklisting down for this after I had copied it. Maybe I'm just an idiot, but it gave me a headache, and I believe I still ended up writing the damned thing down wrong. \n\nAnyway, KIMB shows Megadeth in their rawest form, arguably. Mustaine's vocals are still the same as they are on later releases, but they are somehow stuck in Reverb Land. Poor production pushes his vocals to the background(though they never were that prominent in the first place, at least strength-wise). \n\nEvery song on here is pretty much straightforward thrash, and I believe right after this album Megadeth started experimenting more and further stylizing their sound. Peace Sells is somewhat similar to this, but there are further touches on that that aren't found here. The riffing is still jarring, intense, and very quick, and the overall technicality is still very impressive, but it's hard to enjoy it so much when all the aspects of the music are so jumbled together and not crisp and individual. \n\nThe drumming and bass are still super-tight as well. I really don't see why Metallica and Slayer are praised so much. It just seems to me that Megadeth just has the whole package musically, whereas Metallica and Slayer have some glaring faults that have always needed sprucing up. I will give you the fact that both Hetfield and Tony Araya(or whoever the Slayer vocalist is) are stronger singers than Mustaine, but one doesn't necessarily need a 'good' voice to be well-liked in metal....just a highly distinctive one that has its own personality and energy to it. \n\nWell, I've pretty much touched base on everything. Just pick up this album, if not only for the fact that it's a debut album. IMO, debut albums should be pondered and appreciated in a parallel fashion as people are when they are 'debuted' into the world.\n",
        "\nUpon the opening of Skin o' My Teeth, I was under the impression that Megadeth were possibly staying with their thrash roots but eventually figured this is far from the case. The traces of thrash metal are still on this album but essentially heavy metal is a more accurate description. Songs like Symphony of Destruction with a punishing heavy metal riffage and surprisingly Dave Mustaine has made more of an attempt to sing this time around and the guitar melodies are a bit catchier in an accessible manner. I for one applaud Mustaine for giving an added dimension to CTE's sound but despite a very good musical performance it just doesn't quite feel up to par with classic metal releases like Peace Sells or Rust In Peace. Less thrash(as stated before), simplified melodies but not to the point of being watered down at all. They would continue in this path until it finally ends up biting them in the *ss! (See Risk)\n\nAfter Symphony of Destruction, Architecture of Aggression kicks your ass with some quality heavy/thrash metal with Mustaine attempting to sing again in the chorus. Mixed success, the solo's once again didnt feel as amazing as older material. Foreclosure of a Dream is a love it or hate it track. On this track you see an excellent acoustic arpeggio with one of the better guitar solo's of the album with some of Mustaine's more memorable vocal performances. Sweating Bullets is just kick ass. Regardless of Mustaine's lyrics/vocals on this being a little cuckoo(which Dave handles quite well), the riff at 2 minutes is pure thrash and one of the best on this album. Quite simply put this song is a riff-fest if there was any on this album. Pretty decent guitar solo as well. This was My Life is a great track but not particularly memorable. High Speed Dirt is another one of CTE's more kick ass songs. Great riffs, guitar solo = YEA!!!. Captive Honour overall (lyrically, vocally, instrumentally) is one of the most interesting and solid tracks on here. Ashes in Your Mouth is an excellent way to end this album. One of the better intro riffs and arguably best guitar solo on this album! One of the heavier, progressive and more memorable cuts this album has to offer.\n\n\nSadly I also tend to concur with many fellow reviewers who feel this album in part was Dave Mustaine's answer to The Black Album. I don't see the need for this competition. I'm not here to criticize but Mustaine never needed to compete with Hetfield. Any non-corrupted Metallica fan or regular music fan will tell you album sales mean nothing to determine the best music. (britney over megadeth)? This was one of the last real good Megadeth albums that were able to maintain its patent Megadeth edge while holding a certain degree of accessibility and catchiness never seen before in thrash. I applaud Mustaine for trying new things (even incorporating a part of female vocals) which contributed to making this an impressive release but it wont ever surpass megadeth's 80's classic albums imho! Still an essential Megadeth album and a pretty good starting point for Megadeth.\n",
        "\nMegadeth's 2001 \"The World Needs A Hero\" was not the \"Rust In Peace 2\" many hyped it up to be before its release. However, it is a solid metal album, and somehwat of a throwback for the band.\n\nThe album opens with \"Disconnect\"- a song with a decent riff, and a memorable solo. The title track comes next. Although musically weaker than the opener, it does have some catchy drumming and I like the lyrics. \"MotoPsycho\" comes next. This was the album's radio single, and you can tell the song was made for radio airplay: it's short and not the most incredibly heavy, musically or lyrically, song that Megadeth has released. While many regard this song as crap, I think the songs catchiness is undeniable, and a catchy song is a good song in my opinion, regardless how corny it maybe. And it still is heavier than 98 percent pof what is played on the radio anyway. Next, \"1000 Time Goodbye\" plays. A song about breaking up- both uninteresting lyrically and musically; a good song to skip. \"Burning Bridges\" folows- not a bad song... and not a good one either. \"Promises\" is Dave's attempt at a ballad that seems to come on every album after \"Countdown\". Not a terrible song, quite memorable actually. It just clashes with the expected Megadeth style though, which may irritate some. \n\nThe second Half of the CD picks up the heaviness a little, and the songs are a bit better. \"Recipe for Hate... Warhorse\" follows. A pretty good song overall, with nice heavy riffs and good soloing again. Killer bass line as well. Next is \"Losing My Senses\". At first, I didn't like this song at all, but after a few listens, the chorus is tolerable and I have grown to like it a little. \"Dread and The Fugitive Mind\" is arguably the standout track on this album. Excellent soloing, riffs, drumming, and lyrics. Unfortanately for this album as a whole, the song was previously released on \"Capitol Punishment\", so it is kind of old news for most. The instrumental, \"Silent Scorn\", has a great, dark and gloomy atmosphere in it, whch leads into \"Return to Hangar\". If this song just had a different title, I think it would be much more liked, as the music is top notch and heavy, but just falls short of \"Hangar 18\". \"When\" closes the album. I honestly hate dthis song up until this week, when I started listing to the end of the song. While the beginning is boring as hell and will cause many just to skip the track altogether, the ending of it picks up the pace and isn't so bad afterall.\n\n\"The World Needs a Hero\" is a decent collection of modernized (and albeit, watered down) thrash metal. It is far from being a \"Triumphant return to Thrash\" that some have heralded it to be, but on the other side, this album is also not as bad as some make it out to be.\n",
        "\nUnfortunately, Megadeth eventually softened their abrasive, bluesy thrash and molded it into metallic rock on this release. It probably should be thought of as Megadeth's Metallica album, because, overall, this isn't a thrash release, but a heavy metal one. Hell, I'm even hard-pressed to call this album metal, as the majority of it sounds like smoky alternative rock. At least we can all rest assured in the fact that it DOES get worse than this. Risk should be called Megadeth's St. Anger, but it's probably even classier and more metal than Metallica's latest offering. The way I see it--at least they didn't stoop so low as to make a COUNTRY record!!! Yeah, Risk is allegedly techno-pop bullshit and other forms of musical aberrations, but anything on there is better than country.\n\nNow, back to the album at hand---yes, I suppose you could say Megadeth 'sold out' with Cryptic Writings, but I hate using that term, especially when there is some decent riffage to contradict the sell-out. Modern rock bands don't usually solo, at least not with the speed and intensity that Megadeth does, so that gives merit to this release and allows metalheads and Megadeth fans to say \"Eh, Cryptic Writings is ok\" or \"Cryptic Writings is mediocre\" instead of \"Man, this shit sucks!\" \n\nNow, I've noticed that the average rating for this album is 61%, but I'll conjecture that the pure shock that fans and metalheads experienced helped them to give it a lower score. I can rest easy in my assumption that these poor ratings are intelligently supported as well.\n\nWhat's particularly interesting about Cryptic Writings is that Dave Mustaine seems particularly well-suited to this type of music, a kind that leans heavily toward alternative rock like I've mentioned earlier. Perhaps he fits this niche better. His vocal nuances and the overall sound of this CD is cryptic,even, and makes for a mildly intoxicating listen. Tracks like Trust and Use the Man have inspiring acoustic guitar harmonies and just the way Mustaine sounds is captivating. It's highly comparable to 'Egyptian riffs' in the overall vagueness of the description.\n\nAlthough Megadeth aren't groove metal, they certainly pulled a Pantera this time around. Why, you ask? Well, because there is one thrash gem that sticks out above the rest. It's no other than The Disintegrators. It's not particularly heavy or abrasive, but it's fast, and will make you say \"What the hell?\" Keep in mind that Megadeth have never been known for their heaviness in the first place;replacing a thick, crushing guitar sound with a thin, trebly sound. Heh, they're like thrash's Immolation. What they have been known for is their speed, and that's what they do best.\n\nOverall, this album is highly forgettable and boring. One of the songs even has the calypso-tinged sound of Jimmy Buffett. The whole thing just ISN'T what Megadeth is/should be about and I'm ashamed that it was made. Well, I suppose the guitarist may have had weakened arms and wrists and the entire band was generally worn out and decided to take it easy, but I think they should've just taken more time to get themselves together and released something half-interesting and thrashy.\n\nTool takes all the fucking time in the world to put out new albums. Hell, Aenima came out in 1996 and Lateralus came out in like 2001 or 2002. Why can't more bands be more liberal like that? \n\nThis album is good if you're in the mood for something dreamy and light(when something heavy and particularly fast would give you a splitting headache, when you've been working all day, etc.), but most of the time I doubt metalheads will want to listen to this. I don't see why the foreign exchange student that was staying at my house for a week thinks this album and Megadeth's Hidden Treasures are Megadeth's best. How can he not note the tremendous difference between it and say Rust in Peace? One good thing I can say about this release is that there's not a shitty cover song.\n",
        "\nGod, this review needed a fucking rewrite. So here's a rewrite.\n\nI\u2019ve always had a real soft-spot for Megadeth. I think it has something to do with my undying affection for the underdog. In spite of being one of the biggest bands in metal history (sales-wise they\u2019ve gotta be in the top 10) they are always being compared to the incomparable, and it just doesn\u2019t seem fair. Whether or not you love/loved Metallica, they are the biggest metal band in the history of popular music and by light-years. Sales mean approximately shit-all when you\u2019re talking about music, but Dave Mustaine\u2019s undying urge to compete with \u2018Tallica is a hallmark of the Megadeth catalogue. Thus Dave is the underdog, and in his hopeless guerrilla war against Metallica there have been precious few wins. Megadeth has been better than temporally adjacent Metallica on certain albums (or songs, or riffs), but never more successful.\n\nMegadeth opened up shop early in the thrash game, but rather than be a baby Metallica Dave began consistently pumping out good to fucking great records that showcased a virtuosity and verve that made them the musician\u2019s choice of the subgenre. On this record, Peace Sells... But Who\u2019s Buying?, this sound is still going through growing pains. It is fast and tricky, but some of these songs come off as half-baked or generic (in that way that only Megadeth songs are generic). The technical play is often rather rockscrabble and some of the songs have transitions that are simply bafflingly wrongheaded. The nuts and bolts of the mine cart aren\u2019t screwed in very tightly, and Dave\u2019s mind is one hell of a treacherous road to travel down in such a rickety contraption. But damn if it isn\u2019t a charming ride, and a ride with squarely classic moments that are as good or better than anything else released in \u201886, probably THE watershed year for thrash. And that my friends, is a damn good sign.\n\nConsider the Grade A riffing on \u201cMy Last Words\u201d, the gleefully desperate performance by Mustaine, the power-thrash ride out, the lengthy and memorable solo by Chris Poland... Dave had a real feel for how to write quality thrash back in the day, and it says something that he still retained that touch well into the 90s. On the other end of the album \u201cWake Up Dead\u201d is a perfect intro to the record. It isn\u2019t even that the song is that well thought-out, its just such a great intro when considered as an album opener. The thing begins with a 02:30 riffstorm (really no other word would be correct) before a very brief surge of virtually inaudible mewling indicates that this thing isn\u2019t actually an instrumental before surging into a bloody excellent solo and yep, more fucking riffs.\n\n\u201cThe Conjuring\u201d finds Dave trying on one of his ever present over-the-top characters (he\u2019s really one of the few vocalists in metal who goes so far as to do accents during songs) during the intro before giving us a surprisingly smooth solo/riff barrage before finally switching gears into a scrap-metal KIMB riff, before dropping into a sick groove for the chorus, back into a spiky thrash riff and then, more killer headspinning groove-thrash. Every time you think know where Dave is going he goes somewhere else, all the while branding it with an echo-heavy distorted lyric that drips with demon wax.\n\nI use \u201cThe Conjuring\u201d as an example of how this album refuses to do what you expect of it. I mean, few if any thrash bands had attempted the almost danceable bass-hook on the front half of \u201cPeace Sells\u201d and few would even after. But that isn\u2019t because it didn\u2019t work. It\u2019s more likely because they couldn\u2019t pull it off. Dave Mustaine has always had a little Alice Cooper in his blood and even hardcore thrashers were willing to follow him as he spun his fiendishly creative and punk-drenched little manifesto because he was so damned entertaining doing it. I don\u2019t discount Dave Ellefson\u2019s gift in this area either; he is certainly one of the most versatile bassists in the thrash game and the fact that he could actually inject a bit of funk into Megadeth on this track and make it into one of the best-loved intros in all of metal is an accomplishment of no little merit. And hell, thank Chris Poland for those police-siren lead fills that give the song more edge than it might\u2019ve otherwise possessed.\n\nFor all the creativity Peace Sells has, it is riven through with filler. We\u2019re looking specifically at \u201cBad Omen\u201d and \u201cDevil\u2019s Island\u201d here, both pretty uninspired and derivative thrash that might\u2019ve turned heads back in \u201884 but are now swallowed whole by the five good-to-classic songs around it and the incredible surplus of thrash glory outside of the album. It isn\u2019t that they\u2019re bad (\u201cBad Omen\u201d is actually quite good, with its \u201cGates of Babylon\u201d-like verse riff), its more that they have been completely obscured by the rest of the album and there\u2019s really no reason to trouble your brain to recall them. And kindly ignore the hideous \u201cI Ain\u2019t Superstitious\u201d which, in spite of a fun vocal performance, is one for the refuse pile. Why was Megadeth always so terrible at covers anyway?\n\nPeace Sells is also scarred by heaviness-robbing overly trebly production (like Rust in Peace), poor mixing (Dave\u2019s voice is way too low), and a somewhat frequent occurrence of what I\u2019ll call \u201cchickenscratch guitar\u201d which refers to the way the guitars are sometimes too raw and have a tendency to poke and prod at the ears. Dave\u2019s yowling cat-in-heat vocals are also quite underdeveloped here, which is sometimes good (\u201cPAINT THE DEVIL ON THE WALL!\u201d) and sometimes... not.\n\nAll in all, well worth getting but certainly bearing the marks of a band that hasn\u2019t quite gotten their shit together yet. For every classy moment (gore-soaked epic \u201cGood Mourning/Black Friday\u201d) you get an amateurish mistake. In the end, Peace Sells... But Who\u2019s Buying? makes up for its short-comings in hapless charm, devil-may-care attitude, and oh yeah, neckwrecking riffs. Good shit in my book, but there would be better stuff to come.\n\nStand-Outs: \u201cPeace Sells\u201d, \u201cMy Last Words\u201d, \u201cGood Mourning/Black Friday\u201d\n",
        "\nOn one hand, the Time: The Beginning / Use the Man medley is nice, though I did buy it solely because I was hoping for a live version of Time: The End (the track list didn't specify which Time it was). Dave, if by some chance you are reading this: Time: The End should have a live version! And it should be done like the live version of She-Wolf on Rude Awakening! But anyway... The live version of The Conjuring was nice also, though I'm really not that big a fan of that song. But it's nice to have another live song, y'know?\n\nOn the other hand, I already paid for most of these songs. All the songs except for those two (or three, depending on how you view medleys) were previously released on Rude Awakening and The World Needs a Hero. So I essentially paid full CD price for two (or three, as above) songs. Yeah, they were nice, but put together they were not worth that much.\n\nI would only recommend buying this if...\n\n-You really, really want to hear those songs live and don't have KaZaA.\n-You don't want to bother with The World Needs a Hero and Rude Awakening, and you're just going to settle for Still Alive and Well instead.\n-You are collecting Megadeth albums for some reason.\n-You are desperate to give Dave Mustaine and Sanctuary Records money.\n\nPersonally, I regret wasting my money on it. Your results may vary.\n",
        "\nUps - A very nice combination of rock and electronica.\nDowns - Where's Megadeth?\n\nAlright, on one hand, I'm a hardcore fan of Megadeth, especially their old stuff. I got this album without having heard anything about it, or even having heard of it, this being long ago when I was first getting into Megadeth. I simply saw it at the store, said \"ooh, Megadeth!\" (or something to that effect) and shelled out my fifteen bucks. Got home, popped it into my CD player, and was soon mourning the loss of my fifteen bucks, which could have been better spent completing my Pink Floyd collection. I listened to it a few more times, but shelved it more or less permanently by the end of the week.\n\nNow, fast forward two years or so. After being introduced to the DDR machine at the local arcade, I am beginning to take an interest in electronica. But wait - where am I to find such music? They do not appear to sell these artists' work at any of the local music stores! Alas! And other such cheesy exclamations! When somehow - I honestly don't remember exactly how - I got the idea of listening to Risk again... and this time without skipping straight to Time: The End. And I must admit - my first impression of it was flawed. This is not a bad album. It is simply not a Megadeth album, which is what I had been hoping for.\n\nNow I realize that Insomnia is an extremely heavy song, despite the fact that the synths completely drown out the guitars. Prince of Darkness is definitely not the best song on there but not the worst, either... though it completely deviates from the electronic theme. Enter the Arena still sucks in my eyes, since a snippet of a live recording doesn't really qualify as a song. Crush 'Em - how do I put this eloquently - blows. I'm sorry, but it just blows completely. Breadline is a pretty good song, though it hardly sounds like Megadeth. The Doctor is Calling is also good, though it seems a bit too long. I'll Be There sounds like it should have been in the trailer for a shameless \"chick flick\" instead of on a Megadeth album, of all things. Wanderlust is good, especially since it's about Clint Eastwood, and that's good for a few bonus points. Ecstasy... well, it's interesting, but the idea of a girl who dreams about sleeping with Dave Mustaine hardly seems like good song fodder. I'm not sure how I feel about Seven, on one hand it's one of the few songs with riffs, on the other the lyrics suck beyond belief. The Time songs are definitely the high point, my opinion hasn't changed on that. Time: The Beginning is wicked as purely acoustic songs go, and I must have spent more time listening to Time: The End than the rest of the album combined the first time around, and I've played it quite a few times since I started to Risk listening again.\n\nAll in all...\nIf you want pure Speed Metal, don't bother. The only Speed Metal song on here is Time: The End, and cool as it is, it's not worth buying the whole album just for this song, since you'll probably hate the rest of it.\nIf you like hard, non-metal rock and/or electronica, GET THIS ALBUM NOW. You will not regret it.\nIf you are a big fan of Heavy Metal and also like electronica, find Astral Techno Metal on mp3.com once it's working again, as they do a much better job of mixing the two. But in the meantime, buy this album.\n",
        "\nThis is Megadeth's first ever released collection of songs, and it still remains to be their fastest, most brutally heavy material even to this date. The songs on the demo would eventually evolve into the ones that are found on the debut album, \"Killing is My Business...And Business Is Good!\". \n\nOn to the music, \"Last Rites\" opens up this show up with a \"morbid church\" sounding piano intro. Very haunting, I wish it was longer than 45 seconds. This is probably one of the best intro pieces in metal, because it actually goes somewhere and is not just ambient noise for 2 minutes. \n\nNext is \"Loved to Deth\". An incredibly fast riff gradually builds up and Mustaine's surprisingly brutal scream opens up the song. The verse is VERY fast and would be headbangable if the production didn't lick goat sac. The main riff is decent at best, but at least it is thrashy and fast, so that is a definite plus. Mustin'es vocals are pretty damn whiny, but then again, they never really changed until \"Countdown to Extinction\" and reached an all time low on \"Rust In Peace\" (except \"Dawn Patrol\", of couse!). Back to the song, the solo is pretty insane, and is mainly just scales, but once again, at least it is fast. The song thrashes right until the end, no lame fade out endings here! \n\nThe infamous \"Mechanix\" follows, and the slow intro part is missing. It's better like this. The famous riff opens the song, it sound a bit faster than was performed on \"Killing...\". The lyrics are lame, but the riffs in this thrash classic easily make up for them. The production on this seems to be a bit cohereant than on \"Loved to Deth\". The next cool riff ends the second chorus, and one of the coolest parts in all of metal comes in at 2:07, that transition is just great! This has got to be one of the best thrash songs of all time, that ending solo is much better than the one on \"Loved to Deth\" and actually seems to follow an appealing pattern.\n\nClosing the demo is \"Skull Beneath the Skin\", and the intro is much slower than the previous songs. The first riff is really cool, and has that build-up feel to it. There is a solo very shortly into the song, which is cool in itself and leads to a completly owning riff. At this point, the song really speeds the fuck up and gets heads banging with its abrupt riff changes. The riffs on this song are fucking INCREDIBLE. Halfway through, the guitar stops for 2 seconds, leaving the bass alone, then rips right back into the kickass riffs. Mustaine's voice is still shitty, but one could say it suits the aggression of the music very well. A \"Mechanix\"- styled solo closes the show with a bang. \n\nWhy didn't Megadeth play this fast and brutally on their debut album? Although the production is shit, the riffs and the speed are so damn enjoyable. Very hard to find, so just download it and hear Megadeth at their loudest, fastest and most brutal.\n",
        "\nYes, it's short, but Last Rites is a very important landmark in thrash history. Before this, most bands were still playing at a moderately galloping pace. This showed the world that you can play FAST and still be good. And play fast they did. The songs at hand are around 260 bpm each!\n\nThe Mechanix is the ultimate highlight. Clocking in at just under four minutes, this song just completely rushes at you with these lightning-fast riffs. This is what thrash is made of - uncompromising brutality and speed but also an eye for melody. This is faster and more brutal than the version featured on Metallica's No Life 'Til Leather demo and later Kill 'Em All. The other highlight would be Skull Beneath The Skin. That main riffset just screams \"Anthrax!\" This has a lot of good riffs and some above-average basswork, particularly in that creepy middle section. As good as this is, the band would soon get even better...\n",
        "\nAfter the abortion that we have come to know as Risk, it was painfully evident that Megadeth could not get any worse (we hoped!). Thankfully, they didn't. They came back with a hard rocking album that sounded a bit like the Countdown to Extinction days. The songs are much heavier and more Megadeth styles than those on either Cryptic Writings or Risk. The guitar work is nowhere near as technical as say, Rust In Peace, but that's a high plateau to be able to match. Great riffs are present throughout the whole album. \n\nDisconnect opens the album with a killer riff then into a great chorus for a nice start to the album. The World Needs a Hero is full of more good riffs and an interesting chorus (very catchy) which is semi-ruined by the annoying as fuck voice-over parts. Moto Psycho is probably the catchiest song Megadeth has ever written but it's also very good (and very underrated for what it is). 1000 Times Goodbye is my favourite song on the album because it does what Mustaine has done with other songs in the past (Wake Up Dead, Mechanix, Holy Wars) and that is it completly changes directions halfway through the song. The phone calls kinda suck, so just listen to the live version from Rude Awakening (which fucing ROCKS). Burning Bridges is another decent song. Nothing too special, the intro guitar is pretty cool and the verse is decent. Promises sucks, recycled Risk material. Recipe for Hate...Warhorse is the heaviest song on the album and another one that would fit perfectly on Countdown. Mustaine's vocals also sound pretty good on this one. Losing My Senses is not great by any means. Just another back-catalog Megadeth song. The last 4 songs on the album are fucking killer. Dread and the Fugitive mind has a wicked chorus that is so easy to sing to and Silent Scorn is a great acoustic break that sounds like your joining the goddamn army. Return to Hangar is also amazing, a second part to Hangar 18 from Rust In Peace. Not quite as orgasmic as the original, but still very good. The album closes with When, with has a very famillar riff *cough*Call of Ktulu*cough* to open and Mustaine ranting about something. However, this rant manages to sound good and turns into a half cover of Diamond Head's Am I Evil. A very good comeback for Deth, and unless we are subject to a mircale, the last Megadeth album.\n\nDisconnect - 9/10\nThe World Needs a Hero - 8/10\nMoto Psycho - 8.5/10\n1000 Times Goodbye - 9.5/10\nBurning Bridges - 8/10\nPromises - 5/10\nRecipe for Hate...Warhorse - 8.5/10\nLosing My Senses - 6.5/10\nDread and the Fugitive Mind - 8.5/10\nSilent Scorn - 9/10\nReturn to Hangar - 9/10\nWhen - 8/10\n\nNo perfect songs on the album, but still very solid.\n",
        "\nNote - This is an edit of my previous review. I didn't think that it truly did it justice.\n\nThis is probably my favourite live album ever released. Period. There are 24 songs of Megadeth goodness contained here spanning their entire career (minus Risk, thankfully). Dave has managed to pick the best songs off each of the Deth albums are put them all together on a flawless live performance in which each of the band members are given an oppertunity to shine at various points in the show. As the other review said, Dave doesn't speak with the crown much, but his little speech before \"Mechanix\" is amusing and showcases his giant ego. This is where each of the songs came from - \n\nKilling is My Business...And Business is Good! - Mechanix is performed perfectly musically. The vocals sound a tad like a whine, but otherwise perfect. Probably the most headbangable song on the whole album and one of my favourite thrash songs ever, period.\n\nPeace Sells...But Who's Buying? - Wake Up Dead, Devil's Island and Peace Sells were taken from this. All 3 are performed perfectly. The chorus in Peace Sells, where the crowd sings is especially cool, a large improvement over the album version where Mustaine sounds whiny. Wake Up Dead is another Deth classic and probably the most energetic song on here. Devil's Island is my favourite from \"Peace Sells\" and maintains it's title on here.\n\nSo Far...So Good...So What! - In My Darkest Hour is one of my favourite Megadeth songs of all time and this live performance definetly does it justice. The part at the end (which is at the beginning on the album version) is simply orgasmic. Hook In Mouth is one of the thrashier songs and another true headbanger. \n\nRust In Peace - Yes...the best Megadeth album. Hangar 18, Tornado of Souls and Holy Wars were taken from this. Holy Wars and Tornado of Souls are my two favourite Deth songs and are done perfectly. The ending to Holy Wars was a treat as well. Hangar 18 has excellent soloing by Pitrelli and Mustaine and turns into a duel for the last 2 minutes (which on the DVD, I feel Mustaine wins!)\n\nCountdown to Extinction - Sweating Bullets is great with just the guitar and Dave singing during the verses. Many of these songs are a bit different from their respective album versions, but it is always much better. Symphony of Destruction is a Deth staple and is performed with the excellence that we all come to expect, the post-solo part is really neat as well. Ashes in Your Mouth is good, but not one of my favourite songs as the riffs are not up to par with the rest of the album.\n\nYouthanasia - Train of Consequences, A Tout Le Monde and Reckoning Day are all done flawlessly. Honourable Mention to Train of Consequences for the cool intro, as well as Mustaine for sounding like Louie Armstrong during A Tout Le Monde. \n\nCryptic Writings - A very misunderstood album. Trust is a great song with an excellent buildup which reminds one of \"Enter Sandman\" .She Wolf is done in a strange way, but still very appealing in which the band members really get to show off during the long instrumental break. Almost Honest has a really cool riff and a catchy chorus, but the USA!! USA!!! is fucking lame at the beginning. \n\nKill the King and Angry Again were both on \"Greatest Hits\" albums and were previously unreleased. Kill the King has a machine gun drum beat and the chorus is fucking addictive as hell. Angry Again has a neat chorus with a killer main riff. \n\nThe World Needs a Hero - Return to Hangar, Dread and the Fugitive Mind, 1000 Times Goodbye are all great songs that made up for the shittiness of Risk. The latter is much better without the annoying as hell phone calls. It would have been nice to see \"Disconnect\" on here as well. Return to Hangar is just as great as the original, in my opinion and is performed back to back with it, which makes it all the more cool. \n\nEvery metal fan should own this. It takes the best aspects of an already essental band and puts them all onto one album. Truly incredible.\n",
        "\nWhile Megadeth hung on to existence mainly because of front man Dave Mustaine, Rude Awakening spans most of Deths entire historic career. Dave rarly speaks with the crowd...actually is there even a crowd present? It sure doesn't sound like it, or much of one for that matter. The songs are all portrayed flawlessly, and I can't even begin to ponder on how much better it would have been if Nick Menza was still in the band. Oh well off that topic now, deth left out every song from Risk as more of a testament to their more heavy material, and to their fans. The production is very clear and crisp and the band is very tight. Al Pitrelli plays Friedmans solos nearly note for note and that in itself is reason enough to buy this mammoth 2 cd live disc set. What an accomplishment it must be to know your playing some of the most acclaimed heavy metal solos of all time. Mustaine and Co picked some of Megadeth's most classic songs in their illustrious career. Rude Awakening is good but could have been better and had abit more energy, but seriously how could you go wrong with a live megadeth album. This is still one of the mst killer live albums ive ever heard. If you like straight up great quality, slaughing heavy metal at it's finest live...you need Rude Awakening. \n\nThe whole album is great\n",
        "\nCountdown to Extinction was released in 1992 after Deth's most acclaimed album Rust In Peace that struck the thrash world by force. Megadeth's next album \"Countdown\" saw the band take more of a Rockish/Commercial Metal turn not nessesarily for the worst. Bands need to keep doing new things, because who really wants to hear the same album constantly from a band? Bands need new direction or a change of light, thus Countdown came into play with megadeth's less thrashy side. There are many excellent tracks on here which rarly get any attention like Skin O' My Teeth, Architecture of Aggression, Foreclosure of a Dream, Psychotron, Captive Honour not to mention others. This album has flawless production, and they obviously spent plenty of time in the studio perfecting each and every track. Although alot of Deth fan's point out that this is where the band started their rain down the drain song and career wise, I strongly disagree because this is still excellent heavy metal music. No matter how commercial this may be I still love this to peices. . The superb musicianship is still here with Menza, Friedman, Mustaine, and Ellefson. Easily their best line up to date they storm through a firery inferno of songs that are bound to make anyone think. Eventhing is in the right place on here, and the cd clocks in at 47:26. Oh man i remember the good old days back in high school where i used to crack this in my car stereo ah those were the days. All the tracks are highly memorable, and oh yeah Max Norman Produces this album. Dave Mustaine tries alot of new singing styles with this album as well (see Sweating Bullets and Captive Honour). This sees the band experimenting alittle bit which really causes no harm to the listener because this is still classic deth. The solos are still shreddinly good, as well as the bass and everything else for that matter. This album basically got me into Megadeth and Metal itself for that matter. So i think many metal fans owe their metal addictions to this album.\nEnjoy Countdown to Extinction.\n\nBest Tracks:Skin O' My Teeth, Architecture of Aggression, Foreclosure of a Dream, Sweatign Bullets, Countdown to Extinction, Psychotron, Ashes in Your Mouth, Captive Honour\n",
        "\nThis is Megadeth's first home video, and features every video clip they had made up until and including the Rust in Peace era. David Ellefson and Dave Mustaine introduce every clip, speaking of how they made it, and what their thoughts were about them. They are really funny guys.\n\nPeace Sells: GREAT fucking video. The live shots were filmed at L'amour in Brooklyn ( \\m/ ) spliced with political footage and such. I like the part with the kid in the Slayer shirt and his father.\n\nWake Up Dead: genius idea for a song. It really captures the spirit and chaos of a metal show. The whole cage idea was great, and they SHOULD'VE used that as their regular stage set.\n\nIn My Darkest Hour: this was the clip that was featured on Decline of Western Civilization 2. It really exposed Megadeth to a larger crowd outside the thrash metal underground. Dave and David make fun of some guy with multicolored hair and two fat chicks who were featured in the movie. It is hilarious.\n\nAnarchy In The Uk: the video is not bad, it's pretty enjoyable. The song itself is only okay.\n\nDave then introduces Marty Friedman and Nick Menza. They talk about how hot it was on the set of the Holy Wars clip. Then they play that clip.\n\nThe last clip they play is of Hangar 18. The band talks about the creature EFX and how the budget was pretty big.\n\nStop downloading pirated Megadeth mpegs and buy this home video!!!\n",
        "\nLet me start by saying I adore this disc. At the time the original episode aired, I was a HUGE 'deth fanboy. I watched it every time they repeated it and taped it onto VHS.\n\nThe BTM focuses on Dave Mustaine, because after all, he is the main man in Megadeth. The story of his beginnings, through his rise and fall, his drug abuse, and the highs and lows of his career is so compelling. You are drawn in and you want to know more.\n\nThe episode was not meant to parody Dave's drug use. I thought they portrayed it in a rather grim way. When they go over the fact that he actually died in 1993, I felt goosebumps all over my body. That's how grim it is.\n\nVH1 goes into every nook and cranny of Megadeth's history that you can possibly go in an hour and 15 minutes. You feel like you know the bandmembers and you feel for Dave.\n\nNow, for the extra features. The discography is completely worthless unless you are totally new to the band (but why would you own this dvd if you weren't a fan?). There is about 5 minutes or so of extra interviews, and there is a pretty humorous story that Chris Poland tells. The video for Moto Psycho is decent. I don't think it ever got airplay on MTV or VH1 though.\n\nEven if you are only a casual fan, you will enjoy the DVD. It's captivating, and almost movie-like.\n",
        "\nI can't think of another rating for this album coz like the title sez, this cd is the best of the best band.\n\nOkay, now, there are few things fans bash Dave Mustaine about. But they are needless bashings. First, the fans said that Dave was trying to be a sell-out with releasing a best of CD. NO, he wasn't trying to be a sell-out, he was sick and tired of Capitol Records to make him release what they want him to release, and Dave wanted to go through his direction not the record label's. So, he released a Best Of so that he could be through with Capitol Records quickly and give the fans a better album. So, if fans bash Dave without knowing the truth, shame on them!! The guy just wanted to please the fans...\n\nSecond, people are whining about the song selectin. Now, I love Tornado of Souls but the track listing was NOT up to Megadeth. It's something Capitol Records did, the own the copyright to every song on that album, and they chose what BECAME hits, accept it or not, the songs on this album were the hits, they cannot choose what every fan likes. I wish this CD included \"Wake Up Dead\" but it's ok...I don't whine for that.\n\nThis CD deserves a 100, because like I've typed above, there's nothing wrong with it. Classic Megadeth songs plus two new great songs. I love them both. And Capitol Punishment is a great title. This sure is a great CD and the world needs Megadeth back!!\n",
        "\nI bought this CD back in May 2001, before The World Needs a Hero came out. It was my first Megadeth CD. I initially loved all of the radio hits, especially the classic Symphony of Destruction. However, I soon got sick of it and threw it to the side of my CD collection. A few months later, after I started high school, I picked it up and threw it in my CD player. I loved the older songs now, with all the aggression they have. Afetr listening to this, I started to become a full-blown metalhead. And that is how i was introduced to metal and Megadeth.\n\nOverall, this album is perfect for someone just starting out listening to Megadeth. They'll like the softer, latter-day Megadeth at first, and the album seems to ease them into the heavier, thrashier stuff. The tracklisting is great. It is missing a few good songs though (Wake Up Dead, Tornado of Souls). The new 2 tracks are worth buying this album, even if you already have all of the Megadeth stuff already. Both songs are incredibly awesome, Kill the King is Fast and Heavy, with some nice drum work. Dread and the Fugitive Mind has some interesting lyrics, and I absolutely love the solos. It's what makes this song (and Megadeth in my opinion) special,\n",
        "\nThis DVD was very memorable to me in all the years I have listened and watch Megadeth. It was great how they started the set with a newer song (Dread and the Fugitive Mind) and then ended it all with a classic (Holy Wars). Listed below is a rundown of the highlighted tracks on the DVD:\n\n\n1. Dread And The Fugitive Mind: Very hyper and upbeat. The song kind of welcomed the newbies to Megadeth nicely. \n\n2. Kill The King: This song wasn't featured on the DVD but is in the special features section. It kept the newbies on their feet.\n\n3. Wake Up Dead: The energy of this song had me grabbing my strat from my room and playing along. The lighting that was featured on top of the Marshall stacks went well with the bridge riffs. I think they were using Black Widow Lights. The transition into In My Darkest Hour caught me off guard. Just the way I like it.\n\n4. In My Darkest Hour: When Al is playing the verse riffs by himself, Dave stands at the mic and sings his heart out. He uses his hand motions to show the feeling in this song (i.e \"Now as I die for you...\" he slashes his fingers across his throat.) I this song was composed in memory of Cliff Burton.\n\n5. Angry Again: This song is in the DVD Special Features Section.\n\n6. She-Wolf: This song was THE song to introduce the new members of Megadeth. Al and Dave have MEGA fun with the outro and really let loose with the harmony lines. Jimmy D also gets in on the fun when he throws in a very impressive drum solo; but not too impressive (Menza still has him by the balls!!). This is the best track on the DVD. After you watch this one, you'll be searching back to watch how amazing it was again.\n\n7. Reckoning Day: Al Pitrelli shows that he can handle one of Marty's tougher solos with ease. \n\n8. Devil's Island: Intense when it came to the breakdown and bridges. The intro faired highly well with the crowd.\n\n9. Train Of Consequences: This song is in the Special Features section of the DVD.\n\n10. A Tout Le Monde: Also wasn't in the DVD footage. Takes its place in the \nspecial features section. This performance cooled everyone down and really set the mood when Al played the intro solo. Dave still has the charisma and takes the song to high grounds when he sings it. Very impressive performance. One of the best I have ever seen for this song.\n\n11. Burning Bridges: Another newbie reminder. The chorus is unforgettable live.\n\n12. Hangar 18: The instant classic that should have won a grammy over Metallica's \"Enter Sandman\". Both Al and Dave take the trading solo phase with ease.\n\n13. Return To Hangar: Perfect song to follow, Dave and Al keep the E.T.s moving and the harmony lines set up Al to shred on the solo bending backwards with ease.\n\n14. Hook In Mouth: Dave forces tons of attitude on this track. He still shows us what he has when it comes to shredding.\n\n15. Almost Honest: Located in the DVD special features section.\n\n16. 1000 Times Goodbye: More emotions from Dave and suprisingly from the rest of the members. They handle this song like they have been playing it to people for years.\n\n17. Mechanix: Dave starts this track - \"There are two ways you can hear this next song. There's are way...and there's their way. For those of you that think this is their way, this song is called...\"Mechanix\"! Dave pumps MEGA attitude towards Metallica and goes into the 4 Horsemen-esqe riffs. This, by far, was the 2nd most energetic track, next to She-Wolf.\n\n18. Tornado Of Souls: Dave handles the sweeps in the beginning with perfection and never lets this song drag.\n\n19. Ashes In Your Mouth: Crazy headbanging glory in this track.\n\n20. Sweating Bullets: Dave once again steps into his bi polar suit and gets the crowd in on how crazy he is. More hand motions and jumping around show you how truely he is really feeling it.\n\n21. Trust: Once again, Dave lets his emotions run wild and the harmonic acoustic part flooded the audience with serenity.\n\n22. Symphony Of Destruction: The intro where Dave introduces every band member but himself is very unselfish on his part. The new longer intro and bridge/outro was amazing. \n\n23. Peace Sells: Another classic that Al handled well. The solo for this song came out smoothly and Dave still has the vocals to go with it.\n\n24. Holy Wars: Very good live rendition. Dave and Al both did tremendous guitar work. \n\nThe outro song to the DVD is Silent Scorn off of the new album \"The World Needs a Hero\". \n\nThe only thing wrong with the way this DVD was edited, was the fast cut scence when moving in to the next song. In some cases, the lights would go out and Megadeth would begin the next song's intro before the lights came back on! Other than that, this is the superb DVD for any thrash metal fan.This will be an instant classic someday.\n",
        "\nThis \"old hat re-hash of old popular songs\" side of this CD won't get a review here. It holds no worth to me or anyone to mention how great \"Hanger 18\" is at this point as we all know what those old records sound like. (Though I will complain that too many new songs and too few old songs were selected to be on this compilation.)\n\nNow for the two newies and best material Megadeth has worked on for years...\n\nA)Kill the King\n\nNice double kick drums and healthy guitar lead this one. Not thrashy, more like something GOOD off Countdown to Extinction. It's got a mother of a mix too. Something that could have called for a rebirth but did not.\n\nB)Dread and the Fugitive Mind\n\nBest Megadumb track in years. So good Dave bothered to release it on two records in a row with only slight remixing being the difference in recording. This song has killer lyrics, a neat beat and everything Megadeth ever promised. VERY worth it.\n\nIt's too bad \"The World Needs a Hero\" didn't live up to the hype these two songs created. In fact, it sucked and these ruled.\n\nOh well - download these songs as if you are a metalhead you should own all of the originals anyway.\n",
        "\nThe World Needs A Hero (TWNAH for the rest of this review) was released on a rabid Megadeth fanbase in 2001. Now why were those fans rabid? After the overblown split with Capitol and the release of Risk, many a 'Deth fan salivated at the kind of music a pissed-off Dave Mustaine might conjure up for his next release. Add to that the fact that Marty Friedman had left the band to pursue \"softer\" music, and the recipe seemed to be set for a bonecrushing return for the Megadeth boys. \n\nThis, of course, was not exactly what happened.\n\nFirst off, every Megadeth fan in existance wanted and expected a rehashing of Rust In Peace. This was not a valid expectation, no matter how many people bitched about Risk and Cryptic Writings. Evolution, people. Progression. Say what you want about the band, they have at least learned to evolve and progress. Back to the album.\n\nTWNAH starts off with Disconnect, a personal favorite reminiscient of Youthanasia's more mellower metal tracks.\n\nNext up is TWNAH the song. Another good one, and a great Megadeth tune in that it makes use of the attitude from one Dave Mustaine. Proof that great songs can be made using simple guitar riffs.\n\nMoto Psycho is #3, and this one is not one of the better ones. Yeah, it sounds like a great bunch of riffage, but there are really only one or two riffs that just get rehashed throughout the entire song. A direct contrast to TWNAH, where that actually worked well. Also, the lyrics and subject matter are a bit silly after the first listen.\n\n1000 Times Goodbye is another example of turning Dave's attitude into song. Not as good as TWNAH again, but much better than Moto Psycho. Yes, more relatively uncomplicated riffwork, but on a whole it fits the song again.\n\nBurning Bridges is next, and this one is not very good. The song would have been perfect on Risk, and that about sums that up! The biggest problem is that Dave's vocals seem a bit forced during the chorus.\n\nPromises is a great song. Maybe not a great Megadeth song, but definitely a great song on its own. The lyrics are moving, the musicianship is excellent, and the song itself is great to listen to.\n\nRecipe For Hate...Warhorse is one of the finest tracks on the album, and one of the best Megadeth tracks since Train Of Consequences. The guitar work in the second half of the song is just superb, and reminiscient of what Megadeth fans had been expecting the whole CD to sound like.\n\nLoosing My Senses is just weird. Forget this song, it just doesn't work.\n\nDread And The Fugitive Mind. One word: filler. Not a bad song, but we'd heard it already guys.\n\nSilent Scorn is the latest instrumental from Megadeth. Even with the weird horn accompaniment, the song is catchy and great to listen to (and play on guitar!). Megadeth has proven able to write this kind of music, and Dave needs to do mroe of this in the future.\n\nReturn To Hangar. At first I thought this was a cheap attempt to get fans of old-school Megadeth to buy the album, but after hearing it I realized that the song was a great piece of work. Had the whole album been composed of songs along the lines or Recipe... and Return To Hangar, this album would have been recieved much better by fans. The lead guitar tradeoffs between Pitrelli and Mustaine are excellent and bring back memories of Rust In Peace's soloing.\n\nWhen finishes out the album, and is Megadeth's longest song ever (ok, not counting the remix of Symphony!). It starts out alright, although Dave's vocals could have been better here. Once the distortion kicks in life gets a little better. Not too much, because you're distracted from the quality of the song by the obvious nod to Diamond Head's Am I Evil? \n\nAll in all, a decent release. For shits and giggles, lets compare TWNAH and Metallica's Load/Re-Load debacle. TWNAH is a decent Megadeth album. This is its strong point; it's clearly recognizable as a Megadeth release. The Loads, on the other hand, great hard rock albums. The difference is that in this case, they aren't good Metallica CDs. On this point Mustaine and Co. score a point, they have maintained their image and \"essence\" if you will regardless of the iteration of their music that one might hear. Metallica, on the other hand, evolved a little too much.\n\nSumming up, there's a lot of good Megadeth material on this one. The only problem is that there's not a lot of GREAT Megadeth material on this one. However, the one clue that the album wasn't going to be a total load of crap is found in the credits...Dave Mustaine was the sole author for nearly all of the tracks. For thos of you not paying attention, there was at least one co-author on nearly all of Risk's tracks. You do the math.\n",
        "\nThis is another album that gets a bad rap in the metal scene because for the most part is so different from anything else the band has done in the past. It's hard to deny that Cryptic Writings is definitely different from Megadeth's previous albums, it's still packed full of some nice songs.\n\nThe opener \"Trust\" seems to owe a fair bit to Metallica's \"Enter Sandman\", you can pretty much sing the entire \"Enter Sandman\" lyrics over it and it wont sound out of place at all. Still it's a decent song, a nice catchy, midpaced rocker. Infact most of this album rarely does reach a \"breakneck\" speed, \"The Disintegrators\" and \"FFF\" are both pretty fast offerings, and \"She-Wolf\" waters down the intro to Metallica's thrash \"Disposable Heroes\" and puts down a very catchy heavy metal song. There is some experimentation here, \"Mastermind\" and \"Secret Place\" (again owing to the Black Album sound), are very fresh sounding and quite cool in places. \"Almost Honest\" and \"I'll Get Even\" are pretty much AOR rock songs, whilst they're not particularly bad they're still nothing to get excited over. The album does have weaker points, particularly \"Have Cool, Will Travel\", the use of the harmonica is a very nice idea but the main riff in it just isn't that inspired. On another plus side, the sampling of the Searchers' 60s hit \"Needles And Pins\" works well giving the subject of Dave's heroin-warning tune \"Use the Man\" which plods along nicely with the rest of the album.\n\nAll in all this definitely a 90s hard rock album, and it's easy to see why people get a little shocked/turned off by it when they hear it, but to me it's still a decent record of some intelligent and well thought out experimental rock with a few rougher edges. Nice work.\n",
        "\nThis is not as bad as some may think...actually it's pretty good. Mustaine and his team (the best, with Friedman and Menza) made some pretty decent versions and released some of their best original songs, some of them just B-sides from other singles, and made a really precious hidden treasure to be discovered by any worthy Megadeth or metal fan...\n\nThere are some good covers over here. Worth checking out. \"No More Mr. Nice Guy\" is a three piece band played song (they still didn't had Friedman, and they were looking for another guitar player...) from Alice Cooper. A really 80ish song but with some catchy riffs and a contagious rhythm. \"Paranoid\" is the more than well deserved tribute to the masters of heavy metal (you know who they are...). Well, everybody had played Black Sabbath's songs, so this was Megadeth's turn, and although not being bad, it stayed too sticked to the original version, but in this one drummer Nick Menza just didn't wanted to stop play...he just didn't (hear it...). \"Problems\" is the black sheep on this record. It's just what Megadeth just shouldn't have played. I mean, \"Anarchy\" was good, but another Sex Pistols cover??? Give me a break!! Plz... This one it's not even enough to put you headbanging...this is pure punk...ARGGGHH!!\n\nThen he have the brilliant original Megadeth's songs like the fast and edge cutting \"Breakpoint\", the thick and crunchy \"Go to Hell\" with a great guitar tone...\"Angry Again\" is an excellent song, very melodic and still managing to have some cool riffs. \"99 Ways to Die\" kicks some severe ass being probably one of the best songs in here along with \"Diadems\", a brilliant song with some of the best Mustaine riffs ever. A song that could have been in the \"Youthanasia\" album very easily.\n\nThis probably was a money grabber, I can't deny it, but I also cannot deny that the quality of Mustaine's work is superb (except some of the covers...) in here. This was what he can now regard as the farewell gift of the real metallish Megadeth to their fans before they started jumping into more commercial battlegrounds...\n\nWorthy item to get...No doubt about it. Try to get this one instead of \"The World Needs a Hero\" or even \"Cryptic Writings\". Well I think I don't have to say anything about \"Risk\" in comparison to this...\n",
        "\nWhen Dave Mustaine started Megadeth and released Killing Is My Business\u2026 he wanted it to make it better than Metallica, specifically what they did on their debut Kill \u2018Em All. In some places Mustaine succeeded and in other places he didn\u2019t. I think the most obvious aspect where Megadeth surpasses Metallica is the musicianship in the band members. Sure, Metallica had a great bassist in Cliff Burton (R.I.P.) and James Hetfield was respectable in the riff department, but Gar Samuelson (R.I.P.) blows away Lar$ Ulrich behind the kit, and Chris Poland is a hell of a lot better than Kirk Hammett. Of course, Dave Ellefson and Mustaine are no slouches themselves. This higher level of playing ability is really noticeable on this release, especially in the drumming. While Lar$ was far from his worst on Kill \u2018Em, the precision and sheer speed of Samuelson really overshadows him. Mustaine wanted this to be faster than Metallica and he definitely succeeded in that. Samuelson was the perfect person for the job as he fills the songs with a lot of double bass and fast fills. Just listen to \u201cSkull Beneath The Skin\u201d and the title track to get a good indication of the speed on here. \n\nHowever, where the thrashing speed of this disc is definitely a highlight, it\u2019s also a bit of a detriment. While containing some quality riffs, compared to Metallica, or even early Slayer, the riffs aren\u2019t as structured or as memorable. The riffs are by no means bad but since Mustaine wanted this to go head to head with Kill \u2018Em All, this is one place where he failed. Even though Mustaine doesn\u2019t have the best singing voice, he sounds so much better than Hetfield did on Kill \u2018Em All. Hetfield was just horrible on there and Mustaine sounds brilliant compared to him. Where Mustaine lacks in actual singing ability he makes up for with clever phrasing and vocals that go along with the music very well. The leads from both Poland and Mustaine are also well done as they both have distinct styles that compliment the speedy music well.\n\nHighlights of this CD for me are \u201cRattlehead\u201d, which is perfect for head-banging, as it was meant to be, as well as the title track which speeds along at a fast pace and contains very good use of doubled vocals. \u201cMechanix\u201d, Megadeth\u2019s rendition of \u201cThe Four Horseman\u201d, is also well done but not quite as progressive or as structured as \u201cThe Four Horsemen\u201d. However, I do think this is the best indication of Samuelson vs. Lar$. Try and picture Samuelson playing on \u201cThe Four Horsemen\u201d instead of Lar$. You should hear how a really great song could have been even better.\n\nSo when all is said and done, did Mustaine defeat James and friends? It\u2019s hard to say. As Boris mentioned in his review, this was released two years after Kill \u2018Em All and Metal in general had changed a lot in those two years, but if you ignore that fact, I would say both CD\u2019s are equally enjoyable: Kill \u2018Em All has better riffs and song writing, but Killing Is My Business\u2026 has better musicianship and more head-banging goodness. I\u2019d say both CD\u2019s are equally enjoyable but for different reasons and should be a part of everyone\u2019s Thrash collection. On a side note, if you haven\u2019t bought this yet, pick up the remaster. The sound is much improved and you get some interesting demo versions of three songs.\n\nSong Highlights: Last Rites/Loved To Death, Killing Is My Business... And Business Is Good, The Skull Beneath The Skin, Rattlehead, and Mechanix.\n",
        "\nWell what happened here? This album is SHALLOW. Yeah, there are a few good (but simple) riffs. But there aren't enough of them. This is standard verse-chorus-verse metal, and I'm not a fan of formulaic rock. In fact, I own ZERO rock albums. I have some jazz, some classical, some world music, some prog rock, but no standard \"rock-n-roll.\" You know why? Because I don't enjoy verse-chorus-verse song structures (unless the music (RIFFS) located within that structure is intense enough to make me forget about the shallowness). But no. There are some good riffs here and there, but this album seems like an attempt (albeit a competent attempt) to sell out. You know, alter the style of music you do to gain more fans and more money? Of course, Dave was dumbing his music down considerably since Countdown, but this is really simple and really boring.\n\nI liked this album the first few times I heard it, but the more I listened to it, the more I realized how boring it was. Trust, Almost Honest, Use The Man, Secret Place, yadda yadda yadda. Once you got familiar with the few good riffs contained within, thats it. What you hear is what you get. There's little here to discover in repeated listens. \n\nIf you enjoy shallow music, than this is pretty up to par. I'd rather be forced to listen to this than say, Limp Bizkit, or 90s era Metallica. Heck, there are even a handful of tracks that I still listen to on mp3 every now and then... She-Wolf and Disintegrators. Both are fast-paced galloping tunes that kick up the intensity of the album. If all the songs on here were this good, I'd have given this album a 70! But nah, there's a whole lot of filler encompassing these 2.\n",
        "\nMegadeth found a little bit of their former selves on this work. They\u2019ve returned with a metal album, a reasonable album, not brilliant, but really much better than that \u201cShould have never seen the light of day\u201d or should I say \u201cShould have been butchered to death at birth\u201d album \u201cRisk\u201d\u2026\nThis album was the obvious Mustaine effort to try to get his fans back after that abortion that someday someone has called \u201cRisk\u201d. This album is a mixture of the agressivity of \u201cPeace Sells\u2026\u201dwith the more commercial sense of making metal of \u201cCryptic Writings\u201d and the spirit of an elder Megadeth already reaching their mid thirties\u2026 It\u2019s not bad, but those songs really could\u2019ve got more faster at sometimes and those riffs should\u2019ve been stricken with more feeling and thickness on those guitars. All the band members were at their best at this that would be (and we don\u2019t really know that for sure yet\u2026) their last originals record. New boy from Savatage, Al Pitrelli shredded some really fine solos on this one, and he\u2019s good, no doubt he\u2019s a whiz but\u2026that place is and always will be Friedman\u2019s place. Dave Mustaine, once more made a good job, trying to create, as usual, those inverted chords and riffs that no one else in this fucking earth can play, except for the lead guitarist, and DAMN IT you got to admire someone that\u2019s always trying to put other guitarists in the front of their sound devices for more than two hours in a row, just to learn how to play that fuckin riff\u2026Great! The rhythm basis is also irreprehensible. Jimmy De Grasso strikes the leathers as hard as he can until he\u2019s completely dead for a day\u2026and David Ellefson, the veteran, made his bass really have some presence on this record.\n\nIt has some good songs like \u201cDisconnect\u201d, \u201c1000 Times Goodbye\u201d, \u201cRecipe for Hate\u2026Warhorse\u201d, the sequel to \u201cHangar 18\u201d: \u201cReturn to Hangar 18\u201d with a rhythm basis being similar to the former song but not as heavy as the original, too bad!, and the fantastic closer \u201cWhen\u201d, a really pure metal song\u2026\nStuff like \u201cMoto Psycho\u201d, \u201cBurning Bridges\u201d is not that bad, just some attempts to gain some mainstream attention that weren\u2019t essential in this one. But\u2026we know that everyone makes mistakes\u2026Megadeth in the last years became no exception. I\u2019ll just say their names and nothing more: \u201cPromises\u201d, \u201cSilent Scorn\u201d and \u201cLosing My Senses\u201d.\n\nWell even if you are a Megadeth fan or just one of those guys that doesn\u2019t know jack shit about what metal really is, this album can be an interesting experience for all of you\u2026but if you don\u2019t know Megadeth\u2019s real potential I suggest that before you approach this one, you try to get your hands on \u201cYouthanasia\u201d, \u201cCountdown to Extinction\u201d or \u201cRust in Peace\u201d. Well\u2026if you need comparison\u2026I could say that compare \u201cThe World Needs a Hero\u201d to one of the three albums I\u2019ve cited before, is like compare horse shit to strawberry cake\u2026More, I just cant say about it\u2026\n",
        "\nI hate it when bands re-release material to fulfill contractual obligations, and this cd is one of the worst examples of this. It does have two new songs, but the rest of the album is split between live songs we already heard on Rude Awakening and songs from the sub-par The World Needs a Hero. Both of these are best reviewed n their respective original albums, so I'll focus on the new songs. \n\nTime/Use the Man showcases the rarely-heard acoustic skills of Dave Mustaine. Time was one of the bright spots on Risk, and it translates well to a live setting. Use the Man was the third single from Cryptic Writings and has been a concert mainstay ever since, and this rendition is solid. Also, the acoustic tone on this little medley is simply beautiful.\n\nThe Conjuring is my favorite song played during the 2001 tour that wasn't included on Rude Awakening, and I am happy to finally have a professionally-recorded copy of it. The instruments sound great on this one, though Dave's voice seems a bit strained, but overall this track is a worthy inclusion.\n\nThe bottom line, though, is that buying this release means paying 12-15 bucks for two songs. Only get it if you are a Megadeth completist or if you have particular affections for the new songs.\n",
        "\nI don't believe anyone listened to this cd objectively. Everyone has come to expect instant classics from Megadeth and complex thrash that boggles the mind, but when listening to this one, you have to throw off all that nostalgia and remember what year it is and how old Mustaine and co. are. It's not 1990 and we ain't gonna see another Rust In Peace so just forget about it. Megadeth as a total thrash band is gone. Marty is gone, and so is Nick. I'm sorry to say that as well, but truth be told, Mustaine is still one of the premier songwriters in the metal world. \n\nMy standpoint when I first stuck this in my player was that if it's better than Risk, I'll be happy. Well, it was obvious about 3 seconds in that it was better. Disconnect is one of the better tunes on this cd, and is a well structured Countdown To Extinction sounding song, but more modernized. The title track is somewhat disappointing, weak sounding, though there are a couple decent riffs there. Moto Psycho is annoying to say the least, and was more than likely written for radio play. 1000 Times Goodbye, well...I think this was more of a farewell to the good old days of thrash when Megadeth ruled the kingdom. Burning Bridges is without a doubt the cd's best track. It has a more So Far So Good So What feel about it, especially with the guitar harmonies in the chorus, much more thrash than anything they've done in years. Recipe For Hate/Warhorse is a little on the strange side, sounds like it was meant to be played about 10 times faster. Losing My Senses is a Risk song, must've missed that one when mixing it down or something. Dread And The Fugitive Mind is something different from Megadeth, although that double bass thing near the end is a little too much like One...Return To Hangar is blaspheme, and When, well it seems like Dave liked Am I Evil? so much that he'd cover it...but then he got the brilliant Idea to rename it and take credit...oops!\n\nAll in all this is still a solid album by a more than solid band. We all know they're capable of so much more, but until Dave decides he can wield the axe again, we'll be left salivating for more...\n",
        "\nSo Megadeth claim to have returned to their thrash sound on this cd. Well to be blunt, they lied, for the most part. This cd isn't a total bomb like Risk, but its still not that good. A lot of tracks on this cd were originally penned for Capitol Punishment, before that cd became a best-of. They should have remained in the vault and not added to this cd. \n\nThe songs on here aren't that thrashy, but decently heavy. Al Pitrelli does shred a few good solos on here. The drumming is pretty good, but nothing that really makes Jimmy stand out, aside from the song burning bridges. The vocals...well its Dave Mustaine, so what are you expecting? The cd opens with the track Disconnect and its an ok song. The title track comes up next and is pretty dumb. \"the white house is calling. tell them i'll call back\" The stupid little \"phone calls\" that take place in this song make me cringe. What do we have next, well thats Moto Psycho. Think Metallica 1991 radio single and you have the jist of this song. 1000 times Goodbye is next and I can't stand this song. Its just so dumb, like the title track. There is all these samples of a girl saying things like \"we're through\" or \"there was another guy\" or some stupid bullshit like that. So unless Dave just got divorced, this song is about something in the distant past. Not only that, but this isn't what I want to hear megadeth singing about. Burning Bridges is next and the way it starts, this cd is looking very bleak. Then after like 2 minutes, it picks up with a good solo and some cool drumming. Now if only the WHOLE song was similar to this or if most of the cd could be like this, it would be much better. Promises is next and oh my, this is it. A full out whiny ballad that is just screaming RADIO SINGLE. If you've made it this far, just make sure you hit the skip button before you have to hear anything from promises. The next few songs are filler, again with some decent parts in them, but not enough to sustain the whole song. Then we get to a little intro to return to hanger, which features trumpets. WTF?! Ah the much heralded song Return to Hanger, which is a basically a sequel to hanger 18. This song didn't need a sequel. Its an ok song and much better than when Metallica did a sequel to Unforgiven, but still, just leave your legacy of rust in peace alone!! The cd ends with a 9 minute song called When. It has some clear Metallica/Diamond Head rip offs on here, but I don't even listen to this song. It takes a good 3-4 minutes to actually get going and by then I've already given up. If I want to listen to a 9 minute song called When, I'll pop on Opeth.\n\nOverall, this cd is NOT a return to the bands early sound. It has a few decent tracks and a few moments that stand out, but in the end, its not enough to bring the old fans back. Get rid of the ballads and dumb songs, pump up the speed and it would have been better. Though I will give credit for the cover art, its fucking cool! If your a die-hard megadeth fan, then you should probably have this, but if not, don't waste your time. I know I will be trying to sell this cd very soon.\n",
        "\nIt's no secret that this album was a weak attempt by Megadeth. For starters, nearly half of the album consists of old, rehashed material from Megadeth's earliest days gigging in small clubs. Of course, I'm talking about songs like: Into the Lungs of Hell, Hook in Mouth, Mary Jane, and Set the World Afire. If the fact that Dave Mustaine (A regular song writing machine) used so many tracks that originally didn't make the cut on their previous albums doesn't tell you that he was burnt out from drugs and touring, a few of the songs that he did write for the album should. I've always thought of a studio album as being an outlet for the best material that a band can manage to write and perform. With that said, the majority of the track \"502\" is made up of one of the worst choruses of all time, a few foolish samples, and a drum solo (If you can even call it that) that honestly leaves me confused. Now that I think of it, picking apart the song \"502\" isn't at all necessary because the lyrics to the song are posted on this site. With that in mind, all that really needs to be said now is that those same lyrics speak for themselves. The track \"Liar\" is another mystery to me. This is the kind of song that a band puts on a demo. ...And even then the song would only be included because of the severe lack of better ones. For someone considered to be as socially aware and quick witted as Dave Mustaine was thought to be around this time period, I'm surprised that he even had the nerve to put this song in. To begin with, I'm not very wild about using space on an album simply to make fun of a former band member for stealing equipment. It's just not in good taste in my opinion. Yes, it's arguable that Dave Mustaine and his larger than life \"Take no Shit!\" attitude could (And possibly still can) cleanly pull of a song of that nature. But the lyrics that he wrote for this song certainly don't do him and his attitude any justice. Most of these lyrics are the kind of things that people scream out of car windows at each other on a freeway. The only difference from this and screaming out a window is that when Dave Mustaine sings his version, it's much harder to understand. As long as I'm on the topic of uninspired music, I might as well say a thing or two about Megadeth's cover of \"Anarchy in the UK. To begin with, none of the members of the band even wanted to cover this song. So far with the theme of this album, obvious lack of caring on yet another track doesn't do any good to anyone. I'll be honest when i say that I've never liked this song. But for what Megadeth (The two Dave's in this instance) are capable of doing in that \"rebellion\" sound of metal, they obviously decided to sit this one out. When I listen to this song, I don't hear a hint of anyone screaming for justice or trying to break free from the cycles of society. Especially not in the fashion that Megadeth showed the world on the album Peace Sells... But Who's Buying? What I'm hearing is four musicians going through the motions on the music and vocals of the original song, and adding in new components that really can't even dent the bland performance that has already set the tone. On top of all that, they decided to get an original member of the Sex Pistols to sing backup vocals. My views on covers songs probably shouldn't be discussed here, but why the hell would you want to make this song sound more like the original? Especially the vocal aspect of it. Vocals are one of the great things that Dave Mustaine has always been able to alter however he wants, making the song more meaningful and more of an interesting cover.\n\nAnother of the many flaws that plague this album is the lack of musical chemistry between the band members. I'm not at all opposed to musicians bringing their own (or finding a new) unique sound to the table and spreading all around in the music. It usually makes things more interesting and has proven to work very well in a lot of metal bands. However, this generally safe approach doesn't work very well on this album. My best guess as to why this is, is that a constant sound never really surfaces. By constant sound, I mean one general and basic sound that can be played on alot with no real surprise. What's nice about this constant sound or familiar atmosphere is that the band can introduce it, abandon it to venture off into other different sounds to explore with, and then easily jump right back into that base of sound that was already established. (The band Death does used that concept very well on a few of their albums) The lack of chemistry probably wouldn't be such a problem if Jeff Young didn't have such an odd guitar style. Whenever he plays a solo on the album, it seems that when he finishes the band has gone off into new territory making it feel like an awkward jump has just been made; Like Young's solos act as a bridge of some sort. If that was the case, he did a pretty bad job of preparing and composing those solos in my opinion. It's hard to judge Dave Mustaine on his riff and solo composition since such a large portion of them were created years before this album came out. (I'm assuming that he had progressed skill wise in those years) The ones that he did write seem to suite the general feel of the song pretty well. Nothing special, but nothing horrible. David Ellefson really doesn't have much presence at all on this album. It's hard to say if that's a good or bad thing. But for the sake of what it sounds like already with two guitarists on completely different pages, I'm going to guess that it's not an issue. An interesting subject that comes up on this album is Chuck Behler, the drummer. I constantly read about people complaining that he underplayed, and is largely responsible for the messy sound of the album. Brace yourself, but I think his drumming is one of the few logical and musically fitting aspects of this album. If he would have tried to break out and make any kind of a presence felt for a noticeable part of the album, the entire thing would have completely crashed and burned in my opinion. Percussion is the backbone of any metal band. If he would have strayed off and played anything other than the basic sturdy beats that he chose, it would have been under thought music played in a chaotic manner. Morbid Angel has showed the world several times what that sounds like. \n\nFor all the bitching that I just did, anyone reading this is probably wondering why I didn't give the album an awful rating percentage. Through all the shit and disappointment, there are some things that I like about this album. The album has almost no unity, but if you take it song by song, each one isn't really terrible and can actually work well with listening to compliment a specific mood. And sure, Dave Mustaine chose to use some older tracks. It's noticeable that these tracks are old and a little out of date for what was accomplished on the previous two albums. But I've grown to accept that. It's kind of nice to hear another round of the semi-raw thrash with Dave Mustaine's twist. This music doesn't really have that pre-warn-new aggressive sound that the first two albums had, but the simplistic and fun nature of the music is still there. I had to look pretty deep past the obvious flaws of this album to find that music that I love. This is one of those albums that really can only be enjoyed to its fullest by a Megadeth fan that knows the band's catalogue in and out. Knowing what they were probably capable of isn't a nice thought, but this is what they turned out and I guess it's OK.\n",
        "\nThere really isn't anything spectacular to mention about this demo... Mustaine had wanted to form the \"fastest band in the world\", and maybe he succeeded (after all, Mechanix is pretty fucking fast around 260 beats per minute), but more importantly this just sounds fucking VICIOUS. More so than Killing is my Business, which suffered badly from the production.\n\nHere, apparently they managed to jack themselves up nicely for the songwriting sessions (ever notice that Dave's songwriting is always better when he's abusing substances??) and then sober up enough to operate a 4-track recorder correctly.\n\nThe highlight... Skull Beneath the Skin. Man, that fucking riffset. Holy pwnage. If you like the debut album (and who doesn't??) then you will like this one even more!! The remaster of the debut has these songs as bonus tracks, but one should hunt around a bit for Rattlehead, which was never part of the official demo but was recorded in the same session and floats about as well.\n\nFuck yeah, this thing rips your face off - did I mention that? It's similar to Overkill's Feel the Fire demo (Feb '84) in terms of sheer viciousness and general guitar tone, and came out about 3 months later... another good comparison is Exodus's Turk Street demo (June '84 I think) - this one definitely deserves to be mentioned with all those other classics of early thrash metal.\n",
        "\nFollowing Killing is My Business..., Megadeth made a record that was tenfold its superior. Mustaine addresses some of the problems with the first one here, fixes them, and takes a huge leap in terms of songwriting, as huge as (dare I say it) Metallica did when they released Ride the Lightning. The insanely fast tempos from the debut still abound on this one, but they are complemented by slower sections, some very melodic and tasty leads, and some excellent clean guitar (see Mustaine's instrumental, Good Mourning).\n\nOf course, you can't have classic thrash without speed, and the boys deliver here, with astounding results. Some of the riffs on this record are just mindblowing: they're not as technical (generally speaking) as most of the stuff on Rust in Peace, but they're raw as fuck and have a hell of a groove. The leads are as stunning as always, with Mustaine's blisteringly fast pyrofretnics pairing up nicely with Poland's fluid, fusiony style. One of the tunes that illustrates this combo most effectively is the anthemic title track: Poland and Mustaine sear the joint with excellent fills, in what is quite simply some of the most exciting guitar playing to ever grace a metal record. Personally speaking, I prefer this guitar attack to the Rust in Peace era slightly. The rhythm section of Gars and Ellefson is also very good, even though the drums are a bit buried in the mix and the bass has a slightly ridiculous sound: it's very loud. Mustaine's vocals, as always, are a bit of an aquired taste: either you like em or you don't. His snarling, growling delivery on the record is very effective tohugh, even if it's almost unintelligible.\n\nHighlights are Good Mourning/Black Friday, Wake Up Dead, Peace Sells, My Last Words, Bad Omen, hell the whole album. From the incredibly scatching eastern-tinged leads in the opener, to the tapped frenzy that comprises most of Devil's Island, to the insanely fast, Maidenish glory of My Last Words, there isn't a bad moment on this album. I've heard quite a few people complain about the cover of Willie Dixon on the record, but it's extremely fun to listen to: I mean, a thrash band doing blues should be enough to pique your curiosity.\n\nI think it's amazing the way Megadeth and Metallica carved up the world of technical thrash between them: everything we still hear today is basically descended directly from them, with new bands shamelessly aping their style, or mixing it with others. While Megadeth have had a very, very inconsistent career, this record (and Rust in peace) more than justify their fame and the respect they command in the metal community. Highest possible recommendation.\n",
        "\nThis is where Megadeth really keel over and fuck themselves. They try to sound modern and 90s-ish. And the worst part is, they succeed! The killer melodies that had marked their previous albums are for the most part gone, and only evident in a very few songs. Trust and She-Wolf come immediately to mind.\n\nThe rest of the songs tend to range from boring to very boring - the songwriting definitely drops several notches, and sometimes reeks of late 90s post-grunge modern rock. Witness \"I'll Get Even\", \"Have Cool will Travel\" and \"Use the Man\" for examples of hideous boringness. Even Trust has that Godawful middle section that totally ruins the song, and Almost Honest is built to be a 1997 radio hit, meaning that it is by definition complete crap.\n\nOh, and FFF has a riff from Motorbreath, so while on the last album Mustaine was paying tribute to Sean Harris, here he's ripping off Hugh Tanner!! \n\nThis is Megadeth's black album, really - where they totally stepped on the trends of the day, putting out an album that did not sound out of place for the AOR of its time, just a bit more distorted. Again, there are some decent songs, but it's really not worth the hunting and pecking.\n",
        "\nNo, Megadeth doesn't do much thrash on this album. Nonetheless, it's still an excellent album. It's also just about their catchiest - they manage to write memorable songs without sounding too much like a sellout. They sound more like 80s metal than anything else at times, with the overt, singalong choruses, but if anyone wants to tell me that THAT was \"in\" in 1994, I will force you to listen to the first Korn album until you die of a brain hemorrhage.\n\nSongs worth hearing are the opener, Reckoning Day, also the nicely done ballad A Tout le Monde, and some of the aforementioned nice choruses: Blood of Heroes, Elysian Fields, and Addicted to Chaos. The album contains some really well-done lead guitar - more fitting with the songs than on the previous Megadeth album, and just as shred-happy as Mustaine and Friedman have ever been.\n\nSpecial mention goes to the last song: Victory, in which Mustaine runs through the career of Megadeth, putting in as many song titles as he can. The highlight of the song is the guitar solo. It's a tribute to none other than THE PRINCE!! (Diamond Head), which Metallica with Mustaine covered way back in 1982. A lot of people don't really notice it, but the underlying melody is the same.\n\nYes, this album is worth getting - it's power metal at its finest. For 1994, when heavy metal was at a definite low point, one is hard pressed to find better metal albums.\n",
        "\nMustaine really wanted to create something that stood up to The Black Album as a heavy metal legend. Fortunately, he failed. The album only sold like 6 million copies, and it rocks far harder than Selloutica's nineties efforts ever could.\n\nHowever, the songwriting was really simplified a few notches on this album. There are flashes of awesome lead guitar here and there, but the melodies aren't quite as integrated with the riffs as they were on previous albums. As opposed to combining the two, most songs seem to be based simply on two or three riffs, with the leads thrown in seemingly as a necessary afterthought.\n\nThat said, this may be Megadeth's catchiest album - Sweating Bullets, Symphony of Destruction, High Speed Dirt, and others are just too fun to easily let go. In the vein of Laaz Rockit's \"Know Your Enemy\", this is one of those albums that can be memorised after three or four listens.\n\nSome of the weaker tracks are Foreclosure of a Dream and the title track, which all start out soft and build up, in a generally conventional and altogether boring manner - this seems to be where Mustaine wanted a radio hit, and if I recall correctly, he got it with a few tracks here. But the songs aren't exactly interesting. Also, Captive Honour has that silly intro that I can do without.\n\nThe best song on here: Ashes in Your Mouth. This is a well-developed thrash classic (of course it's hidden at the very end of the album) that could have been on Rust in Peace. It's got some killer riffs, and the lead work is very nice, as it complements the underlying riff changes in the middle quite well. \n\nOverall, a decent album - definitely not at all bad, just a bit too polished and commercial at times.\n",
        "\nThis is, as many people seem to note, Megadeth's finest hour. The guitar combination of Mustaine and Friedman are together for the first time, and each puts out probably the finest performance of their respective careers. There are absolutely no weak spots on this album (except one song), and it combines riffs and lead guitar in a way that few albums do.\n\nHighlights - Tornado of Souls is almost Megadeth's finest song, coming in second to no slouch - My Last Words. The ideals are similar, though the solo isn't quite as overwhelmingly Blackmore-like. Still, it owns you, me, and everyone's grandmother. It maintains a combination of melody and intensity that can be found on few albums (Painkiller comes to mind). The seemingly endless guitar duel at the end of Hangar 18 is also a favourite (as is that schweet power-metal intro riff), as is the little acoustic interlude in Holy Wars which then leads into a real bludgeoner of a riffset. On a different note, Poison Was the Cure is an all-out thrasher, as is the second half of The Punishment Due, where it really picks up with that break riff and the soloing, and Polaris also totally bludgeons one over the head with several choice riffs, including - again, the main break - just guitars, and man do Megadeth know how to get that right. (Oh yes, I should mention that on Take No Prisoners, it's a bass break.)\n\nWeak points - well, I've never really seen the point of Dawn Patrol. Other than that, this album is insanely effective. The highlight of Megadeth's career - this is what their previous three albums were leading up to. Five Magics starts off like Hook in Mouth from the last LP, then goes into a little interlude, before busting open again with insane amounts of heavy fucking metal. There's so much going on in here, and even about 12 years and one worn out tape after I first heard this album, I'm still impressed.\n",
        "\nThis is where Megadeth really got their shit together. This album manages to be both hyper-brutal at times, while some of the melodic leads rival Judas Priest and Iron Maiden, especially during the last song.\n\nThere are some pretty standard thrashers here: Wake Up Dead, and Devil's Island are two good examples. Both are nicely developed, and have some well-done riffs, much more so than the previous Deth album. The Conjuring is also in this vein.\n\nPeace Sells is a pretty interesting song - it's a bass-driven midpaced headbanging number with only one overt time change, but it's still catchy as Hell. Black Friday and Bad Omen are both insanely fast thrashers - they're both only around 180bpm but have that quadruple-time (!) single note riff to drive the music along.\n\nThe two songs that must really be noted are My Last Words and Good Mourning - both show off the flashy guitar work that Dave Mustaine was capable of. Good Mourning is a nice little intro to Black Friday (I have this album on tape, so I'm not 100% sure where Good Mourning ends and Black Friday starts, but it's a really cool melodic build-up intro - I think it starts right after the fast solo over the first heavy riff, the really catchy 3 note one that is why we're noting Good Mourning). \n\nMy Last Words is the best song Megadeth has ever done, beating out Tornado of Souls by a small margin. It's similar to \"Looking Down the Cross\" in general, but the lead guitar work is absolutely incredible. It's more a speed metal song than an all-out thrasher - it would actually not be all that out of place on the Painkiller album! This thing is just complete fucking ownage - you!! You're next to die!!\n\nThere's one throwaway track - the cover of I Ain't Superstitious, but that's what skip buttons are for (unless you have it on tape, in which case you are forced to suffer.) Most people tend to remember this album for the insane brutality, but the lead guitar work must also be mentioned - the two together are what make this album so good.\n"
