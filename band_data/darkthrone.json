        "\nWhen you think Darkthrone, you think of the Unholy Trinity. It's not a bad thing - the influence those three records have had on the metal and punk underground is inestimable, from sound and style to production and visual aesthetics. And of course, many of us also consider Panzerfaust a sort of \"honorable mention,\" equal to the big three in quality and merely separated from them by time and visuals.\n\nGenerally at this point the band is seen as hitting a lull, their next few albums having neither the singular black focus of the previous few nor the revelrous headbanging energy of the later material. I'd say, though, that Total Death is just as good as those records that came before it. Listen at midnight, gazing either at our moon or at Charon on the cover, to understand why.\n\nIt is, to be sure, a more primitive record. This was a tendency beginning to emerge in the band's work already; A Blaze in the Northern Sky and Under a Funeral Moon still retained some of the compositional complexity from the band's death metal days, while Transilvanian Hunger and the aforementioned Panzerfaust stripped the sound down more and more. This leaves nothing for Total Death to grasp onto except the fiercest, most foul corners of the band's style.\n\nSome of the riffs, especially on \"Blackwinged,\" do bring back an OSDM sound, with their chunky low-end power chords and chromatic tremolo leads. Elsewhere, though, songs like \"Gather for Attack on the Pearly Gates\" and \"Ravnajuv\" are all icy black metal with melodies to rival \"Natassja in Eternal Sleep\" or \"En vind av sorg.\" Carrying each track through are Nocturno Culto's most bitter howls, the sound of pure evil channeled through a ruptured larynx.\n\nI'd be remiss not to mention that many of these songs feature lyrics by co-conspirators, much in the same way that Varg Vikernes had written lyrics to several previous Darkthrone tracks. Though the oft-mythologized \"Black Circle\" has been discussed to death, it is valuable to remember that for a time this was a fairly close-knit cadre of like-minded musicians, committed to the true black metal underground. This collaborative spirit serves as an excellent reminder of this history, and it benefits the songs greatly.\n\nThe back of the CD case says it best: \"Darkthrone plays Unholy Black Metal Exclusively - The Envy of Loosers (sic) We Piss On.\" Total Death is still the envy of pissed-on losers and fourth-rate imitators today.\n",
        "\nI don't hear much talk about this era in Darkthrone's history. It's not divisive like the crust and speed metal-inflected material to follow nor as iconic as the early black metal, and it doesn't \"weed out the posers\" as well as the early death or more recent doom. And indeed Hate Them is perhaps less memorable than a lot of the band's material - still, it's a document of a point in the band's history that is worth paying attention to.\n\nThe brief electronic intro and the slow, plodding riff that follows is a surprising entry point to a Darkthrone disc. Even their other late-BM-era releases tend to start with the energy ratcheted a bit higher. I actually wish the band had kept the energy this measured and reserved for the whole song; the more traditional black metal sounds in the back half of the track aren't bad, but for the first time the band does seem a little bored with the style.\n\nIt follows then that this is where we start to hear the development of the punk and speed metal influences that would soon characterize the band's sound. The earliest seconds of \"Det svartner n\u00e5\" sound like any number of tracks from Circle the Wagons or The Cult Is Alive, despite this album's much earlier release date.\n\nThese themes carry throughout the album. It's at its strongest when the riffs are boiled down to the basics, and its weakest when they play it a little too safe with the second-wave black metal riffs. Even the brief section alternating 4/4 and 5/4 bars in \"Fucked Up and Ready to Die\" fails to grip me, largely because of the substandard riff quality from the band who arguably defined the \"traditional black metal riff.\"\n\nThe record does have one notable high point, though, in \"Striving for a Piece of Lucifer\". The riffs here are still simplistic, but the straight-BM style comes across well and the band sounds completely invested in it, especially as the alternating fast and slow sections allow them to explore their most energetic and atmospheric sounds at once. It's moments like these that recapture the glory of early Darkthrone while looking toward the future as well. I said at the top of this review that Hate Them is less memorable than the rest of the band's catalog and I stand by that. But it's still worth a listen, because it's still fucking Darkthrone.\n",
        "\nNorwegian blackened heavy metal legends Darkthrone are back with their newest offering.\n\nDesolate riffs bring the album in with a desert-rock vibe before crisp traditional heavy metal riffs cascade forth on a wave of rolling drum beats, continuing the monolith of old school worship we saw invoked on \u201cArctic Thunder\u201d and \u201cOld Star\u201d. Blending those 70s rock touches with the more doom-laden version of Darkthrone that recent years have offered and a touch of speed metal, this is certainly going to be among the bands more anthemic material. The opening song is certainly a memorable start to the record, a call to arms that will perhaps subliminally send most English headbangers to their local HMV to pick up the new record. The production on the album has that quality that the new wave of British heavy metal seemed to encapsulate that is rarely mimicked correctly, wherein the mid-range frequencies give the music a certain drive and allow the low and high ends to fall into rank with a certain sharpness. While production is not my forte, it certainly works gloriously in delivering this heavy metal vision of Darkthrone in pure style.\n\nIn true Darkthrone fashion, Nocturno Culto\u2019s ferocious and yet primal riffing drives a blend of most metal subgenera into a complex yet easily digestible force of unwavering might while Fenriz\u2019s busy yet hard-hitting drum work complements them beautifully. This duo clearly have not lost their unique dynamic and when the vocals add that snarling sleaze, the complete Darkthrone package comes into full focus and hits with stoic strength. There is an ultimately brooding quality the builds especially in the middle tracks, with big fuzz-ridden bass lines dominating the mix only for the crash of cymbals and diabolically demonic vocals to build upon as the guitar takes a back seat but is not lost. A punishing and yet absorbable listen from the off that will warrant many revisits to catch every nuance and subtlety that this mischievous duo have planted throughout. The lead work, as usual, is sporadic but complementary without being at all obnoxious. With all of the epic nature of Cirith Ungol and Manilla Road, the brooding venomous riffs of Celtic Frost and then a clean slate of originality provided by Darkthrone\u2019s ultimately incomparable approach to writing songs, this record does have that modern classic feel, without feeling modern. A dichotomy only Fenriz and N. Culto could achieve so magnificently.\n\nIn each of the 5 songs, we see a slightly different direction that returns to the core of the album, almost like an anthology. The same root is present in their heavy, doom, black metal blend but the execution on each song features a marvellous amount of diversity from the more fuzzy bass driven \u201cHate Cloak\u201d to the more typically anthemic numbers later on. Anyone who thinks Darkthrone might run short of killer ideas will unarguably be proven wrong once again. The barbaric and yet progressive contrast of the album is indeed a fascinating one, something of a throwback to Fenriz\u2019s love of Uriah Heep is undoubtedly worn on their sleeves here. But of course Darkthrone do not do rip-offs, they invoke the spirits of old in their way, on their terms which is never a disappointment. While perhaps \u201cOld Star\u201d is the most energetic of their recent releases (and my personal favourite), that is not to say this album is less valuable in any way. The energy is vastly different, but anyone who knows an iota about Darkthrone should know we never get the same record twice, something that only demands even more respect for this unwieldy duo of tyrants.\n\nEpic and bold yet viciously brooding with contempt, there is an astonishing maturity in this album that goes back to the early days of heavy metal. An offering on the altar of metal that will satisfy all of the old school maniacs out there seeking an old-meets-new experience that only Darkthrone can provide in their one-of-a-kind way. Eternal Hails, bang or be banged and for the love of Satan, send back my stamps!\n\nWritten for www.nattskog.wordpress.com\n",
        "\nThose who know Darkthrone know that the (un)likeable duo hasn't given a damn about trends or demarcations in genres in the last twenty years, and likewise whether fans like their music or not. When I think of the black metal punk album trilogy consisting of F.O.A.D., Dark Thrones And Black Flags and Circle The Wagons, I can't really enjoy it even in retrospect, but much more the three follow-ups, which convinced me much more. Especially the super epic \u2018Leave No Cross Unturned\u2019 from The Underground Resistance I still find mega cool, pure Celtic Frost worship.\n\nThe new album Eternal Hails... on the other hand makes it a bit more difficult for me to be completely enthusiastic from the start. On one hand, this is due to the sound, which comes across very diffuse and mushy and initially made me wonder if this is only the case with the promo, but no, the regular CD also sounds like that. Another proof of how much Nocturno Culto and Fenriz shit on any trend and do their thing.\n\nBut not only the sound takes some getting used to, also the songs have it in them. The two have probably relaxed very often in the lockdown and let it go pretty quiet, because with the pace that is offered here, Darkthrone rush \u0336Go\u0336\u0336d\u0336 Satan knows nothing. Eternal Hails... is a pretty doomy affair and so tribute is paid here especially to bands like Black Sabbath, Trouble or Saint Vitus. But also, the usual Celtic Frost homage is incorporated here and there, but rather in slow motion. \u2018Wake Of The Awakened\u2019 would be the number one tip for it. The gentlemen get a bit more hectic here in what concerns the tempo of the song but also only in parts reminds us that we are here to relax. Also, the playing time of the songs is strikingly long. Each song lasts at least 7 (or over!) minutes, so nothing for people who don't like long songs. With \u2018Voyage To A North Pole Adrift\u2019 (what a cool song title!!!) Darkthrone offer us an incredibly bulky song, where you expect that it will pick up speed at any time only to be disappointed at the end. But that's what makes this song, this tension that it spreads, only to be completely different than expected. Last but not least, we get to enjoy some 70s rock meets Black Sabbath in the usual Darkthrone ambience with \u2018Lost Arcane City of Uppakra\u2019, which ends the album with slightly psychedelic tones. Here is where Darkthrone have then still managed to really surprise me!!!\n\nWhat is the conclusion now, you might ask? Well, that's not so easy to say. I think that with Eternal Hails... Darkthrone will have a hard time winning new fans, but the way I see it, they can safely do without them. I also think that the album will have some fans scratch their heads because it has become a not so accessible piece of music. But and this is my humble opinion, if you deal with the 19th studio work of the band more intensively, you will definitely find access to the album and also learn to appreciate it. At least that's how I feel. Although it does not come close to the old albums (that will also be very difficult) and my favorite album Panzerfaust remains forever unsurpassed, it is also not a disappointment. I think everyone has to listen to the album to make up his own mind about it and make a judgement.\n\nRating: 8,5 out of 10\n",
        "\nBlack metal with both its overall sound and its overall production is something I feel like I respect more than I enjoy. While I love raw production, I generally favor a more crisp and forward sound when it comes to the music I listen to. I like Darkthrone quite a bit more than their contemporaries of the era simply because they tend to lean more towards my tastes, bias be damned. There's something surprisingly approachable about Eternal Hails...... that I have to give it a lot of credit for, and I mean that not so much in a way that it's weak or tame, but rather that the overall sound (Maybe because of its clarity and volume not killing my ears) is almost sonically welcoming to one who typically doesn't listen to much second wave black metal. I'll admit that I haven't listened to Darkthrone aside from A Blaze in the Northern Sky, but I quite enjoyed that effort.\n\nRight off the bat, I think I should address that the album is generally somewhat mid-paced and isn't all too technical. I find this to be a blessing and a curse. On one hand, it feels very much like old school heavy metal, which I can find a bit of personal nostalgia for in the sound. On the other hand, it leaves me wanting something more, it leaves me expecting. I tend to listen to music with a bit more technicality and engagement, so maybe it's more of a me thing. I don't feel like it's a me thing, but I could always be wrong. If nothing else, if you gave me A Blaze in the Northern Sky and Eternal Hails...... and I hadn't known of them or when they came out, you very well could convince me that they came out one after they other. I don't think the members of Darkthrone have lost their talent over the years whatsoever, even if Eternal Hails...... feels ever so slightly safer. Is this a bad thing? Not particularly, but I remember A Blaze in the Northern Sky wowing me a bit more. Then again, this was before I had listened to the likes of Anaal Nathrakh, Endon, etc., so I've probably gotten a bit more numb to the abrasiveness of black metal. Even then, this doesn't feel abrasive whatsoever, though I guess that  is  something I quite like about it. The black metal conventions I don't care for (Particularly in regards to the production and mixing) have been thrown out, while the the conventions I like are still here.\n\nThe production and mixing are surprisingly solid. Sure, it's a 2021 album, but I feel like the production of black metal albums tend to stay so primitive by choice, deciding to have purposefully inferior production out of principle, rather than having clearer production as a result of the times. Since I don't listen to much Darkthrone, I can't really comment on their progression. However, I've always felt like they've had clearer production than their peers, though that's never come at the cost of what their music or sound has stood for, which is something I can both respect and appreciate. There's evidently some compression, with the dynamic range being decently good, but the fact that it doesn't succumb to going for loudness makes this feel like a stylistic choice that works well and sounds nice, rather than being something that makes one's ears bleed. In fact, everything feels a bit quiet in the mix, and while some things feel a bit quieter than they should at certain points on the record, I can't say it's anything that kills the album, a song, or even one individual element for me. The one complaint I'd say here is that the volume on each part of the drumkit isn't  quite  what it needs to be, but I can get over that well enough.\n\nThe guitars sound pretty good, with there being something surprisingly pleasant about the sound. There's a scratchiness to them that very much feels like what you'd expect from black metal, but the heavy metal-inspired melodies really help to elevate the sound. The drums are a tad quiet, with the snare sounding quite compressed and not all  too  natural, but that's a stylistic decision that makes sense with the overall sound. I wish certain parts of the kit were louder, but that's one of the worst things I can say about the record. The bass astonished me with just how audible it was not just for a metal record, but for a black metal record. It's still quieter than the bass is in most of the records I review or enjoy, sure, but everything is. It's slightly tough to make out, but it fills out a part of the mix that the vocals and guitars don't fall under, particularly since the guitars aren't any sort of downtuned or -core bullshit. If it's something you listen for, you'll like that much.\n\nI don't have all  too  much to say about the songs because I enjoyed them all but didn't find many stand-out moments or anything to make them truly distinct from one another. The one exception to this is \"Voyage to a North Pole Adrift\", which leans into the melodic and heavy metal sides a bit more than the other tracks, even having a nice melodic solo thrown in there. The reason I have the album rated so high is because it feels like a consistent package of stuff I quite enjoyed, especially for a black metal album. It's not something I'll find myself going back to, but it doesn't have to be. It's pretty damn good, and that's what matters. If you're not huge on conventional black metal but want to get into it, I'd say that Eternal Hails...... is a surprisingly good starting point.\n\nSongs To Recommend: \"Voyage to a North Pole Adrift\" (If I had to choose one from all of them)\nSongs To Avoid: N/A\n",
        "\nDarkthrone has long been one of my favorite bands on Earth for a number of reasons, one of which is that you never know quite what they're going to put out next, and their unwillingness to constrain themselves into a particular niche these last 30+ years has kept them strangely refreshing. Granted, there are 'blocks' in the Norwegians' catalogue which all conform to particular ideals, and I'd say that their most recent three-album run of Arctic Thunder, Old Star and Eternal Hails... has been attempt to bridge back to the rudimentary black metal aesthetics that not only defined their most popular career phase, but impacted an entire genre that now numbers several generations. And yet they retain some of the speed, doom, heavy metal and punk diversions that they've been exploring on the way to get back here.\n\nEternal Hails... makes an interesting contrast to Old Star, because while that was quite a bold and well produced effort among their discography, this album seeks to repress that, quash the band back to their primitive roots, to smoosh together a lot of their varied styles into a recording that sounds like they could have just hashed it all out on a Friday night. The rhythm guitar tone has a very Hellhammer feel to it, if cleaned up a bit, and then they combine this with the tinny, raw drums and some heavily effected and just barbaric vocals circa Nocturno Culto. The perfect example of all this is \"Hate Cloak\", one of my favorite tunes on the album with its super-simple central doom riff that yet still feels like the aforementioned 80s precursor to the black metal genre. Another I really enjoyed was \"Wake of the Awakened\", which has a faster pace and sounds like a mashup of stuff you'd hear on Old Star and The Underground Resistance, an extremely basic riff that propels forward and then zones out into something more haunting and doomed. Or what about that mesmeric, atmospheric melody deep in the \"Lost Arcane City of Uppakra\"?\n\nYou really feel as if you've stumbled across some lost demo recording as you experience this, and though not every track hits the same, it's quite hypnotic overall, which was my first impression. This duo keeps on reinventing itself, on a lot of their albums they manage to sound like a band which has just discovered dingy, extreme metal for the first time and these are the initial thoughts that they've laid out after learning a few chord and beats. And that is what makes Darkthrone so uniquely special, they can put out a new record that sounds even more primitive than their formative death metal Soulside Journey and still kick ass, because of the sheer magnitude of their authenticity. Eternal Hails... is the rare album that blows me away by NOT blowing me away, but just letting me recount my own early teenage delvings into heavy metal with a frizzy mullet, a Kramer Striker, and a 10-watt amplifier in my parents' basement, the drums thundering away purely in my imagination. Its raw imagination transfused into evil sounding, neolithic heavy/doom/black/whatthefuckever metal.\n\nNo, it's not a crown jewel in their catalogue, in fact I'd rank it among their less impactful works, but its still important, because even as I might try to marginalize it against my favorites like A Blaze in the Northern Sky, Transilvanian Hunger, or Dark Thrones and Black Flags, I'm still transported to a place that this band and few others can take me, to the very core of why I love all this metal to begin with, and that's why it's ultimately just another victory for a team with one of winningest records in my CD collection.\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nThis next sentence is stereotypical to be sure: one needs to put this album into proper context before imposing any form of evaluation on it. Told you. If this were judged from the point of view of a deathmetaller for example then it would surely come across as entirely irrelevant in that the album is made up of drawn out, basic patterns that don't ever seem to be worried about how one-dimensional they are. Another black metal band like Emperor or Blut Aus Nord will likely offer the black metal outsider enough from a purely technical point of view to keep them busy and interested despite being in unfamiliar territory, while this here would go to waste if it were judged by criteria that apply to those other forms of metal.\n\nThe music sounds purposely flat. It almost sounds like the metal music that would exude out of individuals that dwell in mountains somewhere or whatever barren type environment with a prevalence of natural phenomena like a constant wind current; like one big force perpetually moving in one direction; rather than a warmer, more complex setting animated with fauna acting as separate singularities moving individually in their own pattern. The cover art is very intentionally black and white and so that concept is mirrored in the music. The verse on 'I en Hall med Flesk og Mj\u00f8d' is basically made up of one strummed power chord on repeat. There is far \"worse\" out there in terms of minimalism, and this might seem quite active and kinetic in comparison with some of the drone/industrial or doomdeath stuff available. \n\nIt does appear the motivation behind the band though was to translate a form of permanence, like an inevitably repetitive cycle of life with the parts looping over and over. There's a gloom that sets in from that alone, independently from the very nature of the material, which, well, isn't the sunniest. What transpires most limpidly here is that cohabitation of sadness with outright hostility. It sounds like Darkthrone are pouring out their souls, but at the same time want you to keep away. There's terrible uncertainty (Track 4, or the beehive sounding second-last track), or at least a sense of darkness and hiddenness at the core of it, like the music is hinting at something perverse but never fully uncovered.\n\nIs it pretentious ? All black metal is overly theatrical as a rule, but real value can be extracted out of this stuff because there's real drive behind the parts, and believe it or not actual musicianship behind the composition, and although the chord progressions aren't revolutionary, there wasn't a ton of that sort of music back in 1994. It's well made for what it is. Its flaws are obvious to all. It may not be life-changing but there's something about that cold, lonely void that is quite intriguing. Mournful and monochromatic, bleak and acrimonious. This stuff will not get you laid.\n",
        "\nI have to be honest, I was sorely disappointed by the first single \"Hate Cloak\" when I first listened to it. I surely wasn't expecting anything like Panzerfaust or Transilvanian Hunger but I guess I wasn't ready for a song with a doom/stoner-ish vibe all over. However, after a few more days and listens I would always catch myself humming Hate Cloak and that's when I noticed that I was actually really enjoying that track. Soon after, the new single \"His Masters Voice\" came out and not long after the whole album was released and I was instantly hooked.\n\nThe one thing that becomes quite apparent as one listens to Eternal Hails...... is that there is a HUGE Celtic Frost and Black Sabbath influence, which, in fact, goes along perfectly with what's written on the CD back inlay: \"Epic Black Heavy Metal\". I dare saying that this is possibly Darkthrone's 'most metal' album. The band did intend to sound like an 80's metal band and they accomplished that with flying colors, especially if we take into account the analog/vintage sound and the fact that there are many heavy/traditional doom metal parts.\n\nAt the same, it's clear that this album was an attempt to at least tap into the band's more black metal roots. Not in the sense of trying to sound like a true black metal album like A Blaze... or T. Hunger but in the sense that some parts do resemble a bit of Ravishing Grimness and Plaguewielder, with that strong Celtic Frost vibe mentioned in the beginning. This is specially evident in the songs \"Wake of the Awakened\" (impossible not to headbang to this song) and \"Lost Arcane City of Uppakra\", not surprisingly the standout tracks of the album, in my humble opinion.\n\nI find it surprising that a lot of people disliked this album because it's a really SOLID metal album. It's retro, diverse and heavy, put together in a way that only Darkthrone can do. Hell, halfway in the last song (the aforementioned \"Lost Arcane...\") the duo Fenriz/Nocturno Culto even grant the listener with a heavy, doomy, atmospheric (almost sludgy) part with fucking keyboards! In my opinion that was genius and totally unexpected, truly a great way to close the album. I guess my only gripe with Eternal Hails...... is that, although over 41 minutes long, it feels really short and leaves the listener longing for more. In any case, for me one of the highlights of 2021 for sure!\n",
        "\nThe black metal elements of the band are clearly here in rudimentary form, but hearing Darkthrone try their hand at death metal and not fold was a pleasant surprise. I'd always been a fan of their black metal stuff, even when they fused it with crust punk or heavy metal later in their career, but I'd never given this debut a try. \n\nFirst off, Darkthrone has always had the ability to craft a song. There are numerous instrumental passages on here that range from 30 seconds to a few minutes of just riff-drum fill-riff-drum fill but they all sound great and they flow very smoothly between each other. The band even works in clever and memorable bass licks (something rather rare for death metal, excluding \"Hammer Smashed Face\") like in the intro of the standout \"Iconoclasm Sweeps Cappdocia\" or around the 1:20 mark of \"Neptune Towers,\" a song that also features tons of different riffs and a phenomenal solo. But really, Darkthrone has so many different ideas they cycle through here, it makes me wonder what direction the band would have gone in if they had stayed death. The band routinely shuffles from riff to riff to riff in these wandering, but controlled, instrumental passages that work as interludes between the brutal vocal leads.\n\nThe guitar tone here is refreshing as well. It sounds absolutely incredible on every single song, probably the best part of this album. The mysterious Zephyrous sounds fantastic, and writes just one great riff after another, and they just keep coming song after song. The riffs sync up nicely with the drumming on \"Sempiternal Sepulchrality,\" another highlight on the album. The pause around the 3:05 mark is another example of Darkthrone's wits as songwriters: they just know what to do, when to do it, and precisely how to execute it. The drum fills add a lot behind the pummeling, brutal, and HEAVY riffing, even if they aren't the most technical drum performances of all time, they work with the song. This is another thing Darkthrone understands: not every song needs to showcase the virtuosity of every band member. It's okay for some instruments to take a backseat to bring out the strengths in another. I think they do this perfectly with the emphasis on the icy, laser-like guitar riffing that totally drives this album, and the bass works to support the riffs, not outshine them.\n\nThe last thing to mention, Nocturno Culto's vocals sound SICK. He doesn't go fully into the growl, and it's not impossible to make it out what he's saying, but his voice just sounds cold, menacing, and distant- but not due to poor mixing, due to him performing from another realm. The title track is a good example, especially during the first half, where his voice sounds guttural and primal. The brutal style he employs surely influenced death metal frontmen like Corpsegrinder or Ross Dolan, and it complements the instrumentation perfectly. His vocal performance is the icing on the cake for me, and even if the band never really deviates from their formula across most of this album, the results are more than enough to satisfy. The only drawback of this album is knowing that Darkthrone became a better black metal band than they were as a death metal band, but they still lay a great template down on their debut. Something tells me Darkthrone would have been just as successful had they stayed in death metal instead of switching over and revolutionizing black metal.\n",
        "\nIt just cannot be better. A don't-give-a-****-about-anybody legendary band Darkthrone just didn't give a **** again and they just did what they wanted to. Result? One of the best albums of their career.\n\nYes, we can discuss that they are not a pure black metal band anymore, but is it actually true? Well, not at all. Eternal Hails is THE pure black metal album as now the duo went to the old school black metal territory, which existed before the 2nd Norwegian black metal wave, meaning it's black metal with strong heavy metal and doom metal influences. With this sorted out, let's talk about Eternal Hails in detail.\n\nAs this is a heavily riff-based album, the sound quality and style become the most important elements and I have to say that Fenriz' experimentation so paid off. The rawness, the pure brutality, the natural sound of the instruments is something that you just do not hear in today's metal anymore. In the times when traditional metal albums sound as if were created in a PC or played by robots, like my favorite example Megadeth's Dystopia (which is basically unlistenable for me), Darkthrone shows the middle finger producing the sound I would name the \"vast space's empty cold grimness\"\n\nAfter a beginning consisting of the short arpeggiated F#m chord an uncompromising black metal tempest begins with aggresive tremolo guitars which feel like ocean waves destroying everything in front of them and competing against each other which one will be quicker and hit harder. Walls are being destroyed, cities are being crushed to the ground, churches are being lit on fire. Basically every song is like an orchestrated earthquake. With such heavy guitars the ground is shaking and while listening you constantly feel as if you were in the middle of a crash of two fully-loaded trucks. But it is not only about this perspective, because Eternal Hails is also heavily focused on doom metal. Every song contains moments when guitars sound like a 100 ton hammer slowly falling on a big steel anvil, for example like the ending of His Master's Voice or Hate Cloak, which are masterfully crafted songs. Often, after Nocturno's bestial riffing, all of a sudden everything fades out creating a moment for an atmospheric and intimate session like the ending of the last song The Lost Arcane City of Uppakra, which surprises with a synthetizer playing the melody - the best possible ending of the album. On the other hand there are many beautiful heavy metal sections like those in Wake of the Awakened. Though forget the traditional heavy metal, this is dirty and impure blackened heavy metal.\n\nWhen it comes to me, I hardly like all songs when it comes to full albums, but Eternal Hails is different. I love every single song on the album. However if I should choose my favorite, it would be Voyage to A North Pole Adrift. A Plaguewielder-resembling song with many different moods, tempos, styles and a short but nicely put guitar solo. After a slower beginning the song becomes a grisly tornado of powerchords, 7th and augmented chords which rip apart everything like the claws of grizzly. Especially, when the riff which gives a foundation for the upcoming solo begins, it is like a massive tiger running out of his cover to get his terryified victim which stood frozen from fear. Nocturno Culto's vocals even here-and-there remind of his inhuman vocals of Panzerfaust in this song. In my opinion this is the album's highlight. \n\nIf I was supposed to compare this album to their previous ones, I would say Eternal Hails a mixture of Panzerfaust and Plaguewielder. From Panzerfaust it borrows heavy riffs of blackened doom and from Plaguewielder it takes the experimentation, the long lasting songs and also even the style of riffing.\n\nDarkthrone has grown up. After their a bit childlish punk period, which I consider pretty flat and empty (and boring), Darkthrone began to create much more serious metal. Artic Thunder, while a bit characterless, was a step to a right direction and Old Star just confirmed the quality rising trend with a very good songwriting and a fresh feeling. But even the great Old Star just was not perfect. It just missed the moment of a surprise, something new and different. As if Darkthrone knew it, felt it and this realisation resulted in Eternal Hails, which undoubtely is a metal perfection. Darkthrone created a magnum opus, a monumental masterpiece of the black metal genre that will stand the test of time like their biggest classics. And it will do so not because of fast tremolo picking and shrieking, but because it is different, it is courageous and masterfully written. Every riff here has its own purpose and importance, every riff has its own unique place and if you removed even a single one, the whole structure would fall apart.\n\nThe back of the case says EPIC BLACK HEAVY METAL and boy, what an epic black heavy metal Eternal Hails indeed is.\n\nIt just could not be any better.\n\n10/10\n",
        "\n\"Panzerfaust\" gets underrated in comparison to the previous three albums of Darkthrone. Many listeners talk about the so-called \"unholy trinity\" of 1992-1994, but it was actually the tetralogy of 1992-1995. Some call \"Panzerfaust\" too Celtic-Frost-ish, but it isn't influenced by Celtic Frost as much as the next album of the band, which is called \"Total Death\". Darkthrone had quite an amount of the CF influences on \"A Blaze in the Northern Sky\" and \"Under a Funeral Moon\". \"Panzerfaust\" unites Celtic-Frost-ish stuff with the Norwegian style similarly to those works.\n\nThe likes of \"En vind av sorg\" and \"Hans siste vinter\" are examples of classical black metal, based on tremolo riffing and blast beat drumming. These tracks sound dark, evil and tragic, they resemble the material of \"Transilvanian Hunger\". The likes of \"Triumphant Gleam\", \"The Hordes of Nebulah\" and \"Beholding the Throne of Might\" are highly influenced by Celtic Frost. The opening riff of \"Triumphant Gleam\" even sounds pretty similar to the one of \"The Usurper\" by the Swiss band. The starting riff of \"Beholding the Throne of Might\" sounds almost like the main riff of the famous Darkthrone composition, which is called \"In the Shadow of the Horns\", while it is quite Celtic-Frost-ish itself. \n\nOn the last compositions of \"Panzerfaust\" Darkthrone brings something completely new. \"Quintessence\" is a slow, brutal and catchy track. Some riffs there are borrowed from \"Noregsgard\" by Storm, the folk/viking metal band of Fenriz and Satyr. \"Quintessence\" sounds rough and heavy. It's a highly memorable composition, a specific one in the context of the Darkthrone oeuvre. The lyrics of \"Quintessence\" was written by Varg Vikernes and that's easily a one of the best texts in black metal. It's so profound and prideful, it fits the measured and heavy music of the composition perfectly. Here're the most memorable lines:\n\n\"Five million christians on a ride towards us\nOh, I slaughtered the bunch with one single hit (with my spear)\nFive million women so alone in the night\nOh, I had them all satisfied profusely (every night by myself)\"\n\n\"No single book were behelden by me\nOh, no question I cannot do answer\nOnly one single lamp do show me this way\nAnd that is the eye of Satan\"\n\nThe conclusion comes with \"Sn\u00f8 og granskog (Utferd)\", which is a folk/ambient track. For Darkthrone it's very uncommon to have such stuff, but in that period of time Fenriz was quite obsessed with folk music. Apart from the already mentioned Storm, Fenriz had his own folk/viking metal project, called Isengard. \"Sn\u00f8 og granskog (Utferd)\" sounds hypnotic and fits a role of an outro well. The vocals are spoken by Fenriz there. Nocturno Culto sings on the other tracks, while his performance on \"Panzerfaust\" is another specific thing about the album. Nocturno's screaming is lower than usually, it features more expression and sounds brutal. Maybe it's an attempt to recreate the style of Thomas Fischer. Anyway, such manner sounds great with the material of particularly this album.\n\nSo, \"Panzerfaust\" has its distinctive features, but, actually, it can be said about each album of the 1992-1995 period. It was classical Darkthrone. After that there will be more significant changes in the style of the duo. \"Total Death\" will be a full-loaded tribute to Celtic Frost, it will present the first signs of black'n'roll in the sound of Darkthrone. There will be only more such things in the future. Yet \"Panzerfaust\" is that dark, cold and grim, as the three previous works, and it's a great conclusion to the classical era of the band. Yes, \"Panzerfaust\" has some quotations, but an overall appearance of the album is special enough, while the work remains black metal to the core and it's fair to put it in the same niche with \"A Blaze in the Northern Sky\", \"Under a Funeral Moon\" and \"Transilvanian Hunger\".\n",
        "\nDarkthrone should require no introduction at this point. The band\u2019s storied catalogue spans 3 decades full of works that have consistently gone against the grain in terms of what was expected from them. From death metal, to the legendary \u201cUnholy Trinity\u201d, to crust punk, they\u2019ve always done whatever they wanted without any care for trends and what was popular. The 2010\u2019s saw the band indulge in music that inspired them, showing us their passion for heavy metal of old, with albums like The Underground Resistance and Arctic Thunder. Eternal Hails...... (I am not putting the ellipses again) is a continuation of the band\u2019s exploration of old school sounds, this time those of doom metal.\n\nLike with most of the duo\u2019s releases over the past decade, there are plenty of moments that bring to mind legends that were a great influence on the band, such as Celtic Frost and Black Sabbath, the latter of which being more prevalent here. \u201cHate Cloak\u201d for example is pure doom bliss, with its slow-as-molasses riffing and hefty chugs pushing it forward throughout its 10 minute runtime. That being said, the black metal we all know and love is still present as seen in \u201cHis Master\u2019s Voice\u201d, an energetic blackened doom opener that perfectly sets the tone for the rest of the album with the tremolo riffing at the start being offset by the slower second half of the song. It\u2019s stuff like that that shows that Darkthrone have become masters of their craft and can make a song that while having clear influences is still undoubtedly theirs.\n\nThe production is another one of the album\u2019s main strengths, with its organic instruments sounding raw yet powerful. The guitars sound hefty while the bass adds more texture and provides an excellent low end that serves to enhance the record\u2019s atmosphere. While the bass drum does sound a bit too quiet for my liking, the mixing is still quite good, with everything else being audible at all times.\n\nFor how enjoyable this album is, it\u2019s not exactly flawless. There\u2019s precisely one track that didn\u2019t quite stick the landing for me, \u201cWake of the Awakened\u201d, which just passed without leaving too much of an impression. It\u2019s not a bad track, just not as good as the rest. Every song here serves a purpose and has its own standout moments, like the epic feel of \"Voyage to a North Pole Adrift\", or the atmospheric outro of \"Lost Arcane City of Uppakra\". \"Wake of the Awakened\" is more of an all-rounder, and as a result lacks the same impact.\n\nEternal Hails, like the albums that preceded it, is a love letter to the old school. It wears its influences proudly on its sleeve while still undeniably being a Darkthrone album. Their attitude is what truly makes this album, and the ones that came before, as good as it is. Some people might like it, and others might not. But Fenriz and Nocturno Culto have never really cared for the opinions of others, and their career is a testament to their resilience and desire to make the music they want. For that alone they\u2019ve my eternal respect and admiration, and I cannot wait to see where their whims take us next. \n\nHighlights: His Master\u2019s Voice, Hate Cloak, Voyage to A North Pole Adrift\n",
        "\n\"Transilvanian Hunger\" is considered by many as opus magnum of Darkthrone. It made the band an ultimate blueprint of black metal. Darkthrone switched to black metal on \"A Blaze in the Northern Sky\", but that album had some rudiments of death metal. Its follow-up, \"Under a Funeral Moon\", had a solid amount of the first wave black metal influences. Then there came \"Transilvanian Hunger\", where Darkthrone elaborated a pure Norwegian style.\n\nThe recording process of \"Transilvanian Hunger\" took place at the end of 1993, after the infamous Varg vs Euronymous events and the following legal issues. Fenriz handled all instruments after a period of isolation from the scene. No surprise, that the album became that grim. \"Transilvanian Hunger\" is raw, which makes the music darker and more authentic. The material is monotonous and oppressive. It's dynamical, as there's an almost permanent sequence of blast beats through the whole work. The melodies are performed majorly with the characteristic Norwegian tremolo riffing. The vocal style is trademark for Nocturno Culto, reserved, monotonous and raspy.\n\nThe music is minimalistic. It's interesting, how the band, which had initially been interested in playing technical stuff, realized itself better with the simplistic music. It just worked better. The raw and monotonous material of \"Transilvanian Hunger\" creates a haunting atmosphere. The music is powerful and hypnotic, it brings tons of raw energy without losing meditative qualities. Compositions are very similar in relation to each other, but all of them are memorable, thus it's easy to differ a one from another. Every track sounds obscure and evil as hell. On few occasions there are primitive guitar solos, there are few episodes with blast beats being changed by something else, yet generally there's nothing, but a thick and disturbing wall of raw sound, which brings an impenetrable darkness.\n\nIn terms of a concept \"Transilvanian Hunger\" deals with Anti-Christianity and Traditionalism, often using Satan as a symbol. Anti-Christian ideas were crucial for the Norwegian scene, while Satanism became a one of the most common Anti-Christian ideas, because it had always been seen by society as the most obvious antipode to Christianity. The lyrics features dark metaphors, which represent the atmosphere of the album properly. The lines \"So pure... So cold\" in the chorus of the title composition became a slogan of the album for a reason. \"Transilvanian Hunger\" is a majestic black metal monument, which casts an immense shadow over the World black metal scene, where many other demonic spawns continue to breed aligning to the great archetype.\n",
        "\nYes, it is true. The integrity and passion of Darkthrone cannot be doubted. \"Eternal Hails......\" represents their 19th studio album, Fenriz can sing every single track of every metal demo of the seventies and eighties by heart (presumably even of those demos that were never recorded) and the repeatedly flaunted, by objective standards flawed sound of their records also speaks a clear, anti-commercial language. \"Eternal Hails\" (I'll leave out the stupid dots from now on) also doesn't give a damn about modern sound technology. The five tracks appear unpolished and honest. In terms of production, they fit quite seamlessly into the discography of comrades Fenriz and Nocturno Culto.\n\nAnd yes, it's also true: Darkthrone have proven that they can successfully tread different compositional paths. One cannot argue about the force and class of \"Transilvanian Hunger\", the grandiose flow of the songs of \"Ravishing Grimness\" refuses to lose luster, the spontaneity and simplicity of the tracks of \"The Cult Is Alive\" is still a joy 15 years later. But for some time now, Darkthrone have not remembered their own class. Instead, they seem to find fulfilment in a new role. The band stages itself as the preservers of \"true metal\". The aim seems to be to include as many cross-references as possible to semi-legendary or even non-legendary bands in the songs. The result is a boring number like \"Hate Cloak\". Well, thank you, my ears would have been better off investing the nine minutes of their lives elsewhere.\n\nBecause no, it's not true: the reputation, the fame and the radiance of Darkthrone is not based on sluggish, dragging along in doom \"tempo\", overlong songs and certainly not on spherical sounds. If you like the tired, not very energetic beginning of \"Voyage to a Northpole Adrift\", your heart might have fluttered when you looked into an empty football stadium in the last few months. And it's not just the first tacts of this piece that leave me perplexed. Apart from the one or other acceptable speed part, this track, just like \"Hate Cloak\", makes it painfully clear that a friend of mine was not wrong when he described the music on \"Eternal Hails\" as a big nothing. Sure, individual parts of \"Voyage...\" are quite catchy, but a coherent overall picture does not emerge for me. Most sections are going nowhere and leave no impact. Maybe there are trace elements of Sabbath, Frost, Manilla Road or whoever to find, but who likes to identify them one by one when they are hidden in boring tracks? Nobody.\n\nBecause yes, in the end it's true: no one, not even the most ardent follower of the Norwegian duo will tattoo the words \"Eternal Hails\" on their soul (not to mention the stupid dots). Either it already says \"Transilvanian Hunger\", \"Panzerfaust\" or, for my sake, \"A Blaze in the Northern Sky\" - or the soul simply remains unsullied. There is - and this is of course too few - exactly one song that I really like. \u201eWake of the Awakened\u201c sounds like a forgotten leftover from \u201eRavishing Grimness\u201c. Great guitar lines let the song flow very well. The title has an energetic fundament, it does not lack different parts and moods and shows that the raw vocals ask for rather aggressive, speedy tracks.\n\nFinally, yes, it is true: a lot of bands find their point of orientation in the eighties and usually that\u2019s acceptable. The eighties, the golden eighties, my God! (By the way, I want to be young again, just for one week. Is this possible?) But Darkthrone seem to be on a quasi-religious mission in order to make us familiar with all (old) facets of metal. I am sorry, I don\u2019t request for a higher sense in music, I just want to hear tones that trigger something in me. Fenriz can play the well appreciated metal professor and he can be a great artist \u2013 however, he cannot fill both roles simultaneously. Darkthrone should no longer produce records with the strangest sounds they can create, but focus on the songs again, keeping them compact, impulsive and straight. Their weird side can be covered by the artworks \u2013 the one of \u201eEternal Hails\u201c looks fantastic, However, I hope the 20th album will be much better.\n",
        "\nThe legendary nordic duo, Fenriz and Nocturno Culto, return yet again with another release pulled from the darkest depths of space. Eternal Hails.... is Darkthrone's nineteenth album to date. It captures the raw essence of true heavy metal distilled in a way that is distinctly Darkthrone's own. It is both very different from all of their other releases, yet vaguely similar. Its easy to say that the duo have found their distinct style and can apply it to what ever genre they want it seems.\n\nDarkthrone have traversed across many genres. Starting with straight death metal, later going into black metal which is what they're most famous for. Soon, after growing tired of creating the same black metal sound, Fenriz and Nocturno Culto decided to diverge into other genres that spoke to them and influenced what they do today. Things like crust punk, doom metal, speed metal, thrash, and many other genres of heavy metal and hard rock.\n\nBack in 2013, they released their first pure heavy metal album The Underground Resistance, it was from here that they decided to continue their love affair with the old school sounds that was the very foundation of black metal and all of the other metal genres we're aware of today. Their sound, while familiar, was a long off shoot from where they've started. Later on, they released albums like Arctic Thunder and Old Star, which incorporated their darker more gothic aesthetic, especially Old Star, what with its heavy Candlemass influence.\n\nFinally, Eternal Hails.... is in my opinion a combination of everything that they've released to date. While still sticking with the old school heavy metal influence with the riff heavy style with the production sounding like it was lifted right off of a dusty old record. It sits somewhere in between lo-fi and hi-fi. Bands from the 70s would've killed for a sound like this. Fenriz's drumming is phenomenal on the album. The timing is perfect mixing in a lot of old style hard rock and metal style drum beats. Nocturno of course, killing it with the riffs as usual. This has always been one of the strongest points of Darkthrone and its their guitar work. This album is filled with riffs that will probably never leave your head. They're not only just catchy, but they're dark, cold, but if there's one thing that's lacking from their previous releases its their aggression. But that's okay. A man can't stay angry for ever, and while that may reflect in their music, it doesn't draw away from what they had to begin with and that's pure talent.\n\nYou can tell they had a lot of fun recording this album. Especially since they brought in some things that one would think they'd never hear on a Darkthrone album, and it's a synthesizer. They've decided to bring in a moog synth on the later half of the album, and boy does it add to the retro feel this entire album has. Knowing how peculiar Fenriz can be with his metal, especially when it comes to what kind of music Darkthrone makes, synths have been off of the table for the longest time. But, I suppose with age comes experimentation and they've really nailed the use of it. Its used very sparingly, only for an ambient, psychedelic and space alien like passage towards the end of the fifth track, and best track off the album in my opinion, Lost Arcane City of Uppakra.\n\nFor new and old metal heads alike this album is a certified head banger. This is a very solid album that I thoroughly enjoyed from front to back and was very excited to hear once it was announced. While I do admit its not as high energy as the rest of the albums, it still fits with the rest of Darkthrone's catalog and a must listen for those who worship the old school such as my self.\n\nOriginally written by me here: http://www.runicreviews.com/2021/07/darkthrone-eternal-hails.html\n",
        "\nThe evolution of an artist's sound has been synonymous with the biggest music performers out there. And while some metal bands have changed their sounds to heralds of disapproval and dissatisfaction, others have successfully designed an evolving process of fresh music each time they decide to record new material. And with their 19th studio album, the almighty Darkthrone are back, challenging their technical abilities and evolving their sonic prowess once again. The masters of the unholy trinity need no introduction to any black metal enthusiast nor to any metal fan for that matter. With this awaited return, the band seeks to hail for eternity as they present another DIY unbothered record, this time submerged with an extra layer of ominous doom and epic gloom. \n\nWith the first glance directed towards the cover art, your mind is bound to imagine fractions of tangible musical notes looming from the painting; the location depicted in the art resembles the entrance of a cave, though it's not your typical caveman dwelling, rather a shelter for a space-like horizon with a rock decorated ocean at its surface point, alongside shiny stars and a lunar planet suspended in the atmosphere. The art work contains a haunting similarities with the band's 1996 Total Death, to the point where it feels like Eternal Hails\u2019 cover is the prequel to the latter but music wise, given Darkthrone\u2019s growing maturity with each release, obviously that's not the case. The album cover can be conveniently regarded as a metaphorical representation to the music unfolded within the record. The rugged gate of this seemingly secret cosmic chamber symbolizes the music's cavernous riffs, a tavern of slowly brewing pungent beer pouring mercilessly down on the listener. The stone rigged sea mirrors the organic old school Darkthrone production on top of the epic moments translated in the songs' diversified and extended compositional sections. As for the celestial bodies hanging up in the nocturnal sky, they represent the black energy and fascinating obscurity that this duo always possessed.\n\nHis Masters Voice takes a few seconds to rightfully kick in before opening the album with a black n' roll based riff, pumping the blood in your vein and making you wish concerts and mosh pits were back in business. It then slowly simmers down to a blackened doom oriented groove with simplistic yet effective drum fills. Wake of the Wakened transmits the same blackened speed metal hype that the opener launched. The single Hate Cloak, as was stated by Fenriz, is the slowest song on the record, paying homage the most to the doom metal roots the drummer adores. For a 9 minute doom driven song, it stays fairly dynamic with its tempo changes, riff variations and dense atmosphere. A notable piece to talk about is the hypnotic hook that starts and ends the track Voyage to a Northpole Adrift, its evil note progression gives off an addictive sound to replay, sending me a very welcomed blend of eastern metal and Satyricon vibes. Had the band's direction in the sound been more oriented between 2nd wave and modern black metal, then this hooky riff could have been interpreted differently. Instead, they rode this riff into doomy Darkthrone transitioning territory. Although I personally would have loved to hear that different interpretation, it would have looked a bit heterogeneous in comparison with the rest of the songs. \n\nOne key factor highlighting the record's enjoyable experience is the plethora of catchy riffs that participate in a movement of ebb and flow in each track and fight each other for first place. Nocturno Culto wrote enough iconic riffs to create a triple album, but then decided to cram them all up in five headbanging beasts of a record in true Darkthrone fashion. I have to also give credit to Fenriz\u2019s subtle and clever drum beat shifts with the beginning of each new riff or tempo, making each section smoother. The record carries more complexity to dissect and analyze than a mere doom metal record. Obviously the essence behind Eternal Hails is doom, but the duo also incorporates elements of black metal and thrash metal. They even added some bold experimental approaches at the end of the album closer Lost Arcane City Of Uppakra, giving the album an extra layer of epic space bliss and mythical foggy sense that the duo were certainly aiming to expose. Moreover, the primary blueprint to the songs is taking a handful of riffs and building the rest of the music around it. I\u2019ve probably used the word riff for the umpteenth time now, but that\u2019s exactly the best way to talk about the majority of Darkthrone albums; the essential with this band has always been established on a pyramid of riffage symphony over powerfully hit devolving drum patterns. And that\u2019s definitely not a bad thing, this technique has worked tremendously in the past, and it\u2019s still flourishing in the present and it will quite possibly succeed in the future as well. \n\nIt\u2019s undoubtedly clear upon experiencing Eternal Hails that its inspiration of musical composition emerges from the doom laden Black Sabbath 70s era, as well as from the mid to early 80s extreme metal experimentation, with the likes of Celtic Frost riffing, Candlemass epic prominence and 1st black metal wave wickedness coming first to mind. A humbly numbered tracklist of lengthy songs have been dominating Darkthrone\u2019s newest releases, and there is no exception here. The tracks charge between 5 to 10 minutes of heavy riff variation and straightforward mostly slow and consistently strong drum pounding with black metal Cronos inspired vocal snarling and roaring. To those out here looking for Transilvanian Hunger version 2.0 or any 90s classic Darkthrone black metal era album, then this record isn\u2019t really for you but I do encourage you to give it a chance. And to those of you that are regularly interested with the Norwegian duo\u2019s evolution over the years, then you\u2019re in for a delightful new experience, especially if you\u2019re a doom metal fan. It\u2019s been 30 years since Darkthrone\u2019s Soulside Journey death metal debut and from that historical point onwards, the band are continually expanding their sound, coming up with new ideas, elevating their musicianship and implementing more influences to their legendary career. And they\u2019ve done it all with a signature sound that can never be replicated. \n\nFFO: Celtic Frost, Candlemass, Black Sabbath, Bathory, Venom \nOriginally published on HeadbangersHaven.com\n",
        "\nBeing the second full-length album of Darkthrone, \"A Blaze in the Northern Sky\" is known as the first black metal album of the band and thus the first Norwegian black metal full-length album. Of course, it's more of a formality, as black metal was utterly underground in Norway of the early 90s and there were some significant demos, rehearsals and live releases before \"A Blaze in the Northern Sky\". Obviously, Darkthrone wasn't the first Norwegian black metal band, but still growing to the full-length format was an important thing for the scene. Actually, Darkthrone didn't instantly switch to pure black metal, they were constantly going to this, from a one album to another, and eventually \"Transilvanian Hunger\" became black metal to the core. Anyway, \"A Blaze in the Northern Sky\" is an essential black metal work even despite the fact of possessing some death metal rudiments.\n\nSo, Darkthrone went from the self-proclaimed \"techno death metal\" to raw and primitive music. They weren't obsessed with displaying high skills anymore. They were obsessed with the dark aesthetics and atmosphere of black metal, and they represented those convincingly. In terms of a concept \"A Blaze in the Northern Sky\" is the same simple. The lyrics demonstrates different abstract stuff on the Satanic thematics. The artwork is the same dark and minimalistic as the music and the lyrics. With all these features Darkthrone quickly became a one of the main black metal blueprints. \n\nCompositions of \"A Blaze in the Northern Sky\" have narrative structures opposed to the traditional verse-chorus model. Themes change like events in stories, the main themes repeat from time to time. The tempo is variable. The impetuous parts alternate with the ritualistic ones. Every composition has characteristic black metal tremolo riffs. Blast beats explode in culminations. The vocals are characteristic black metal screaming.\n\nYet, of course, \"A Blaze in the Northern Sky\" features influences of the first wave black metal. Celtic Frost has always been a major influence for Darkthrone. The model of alternating fast parts with slow ones was vastly popularized exactly by Celtic Frost. The Norwegians upgraded this move. Fast parts became walls of sound constructed with tremolo riffs and blast beats. Slow parts became darker. The Norwegian style is more monotonous than the first wave one. The most Celtic Frost alike stuff can be found on \"Kathaarian Life Code\" and \"In the Shadow of the Horns\".\n\n\"Kathaarian Life Code\" defines black metal perfectly. It starts with obscure ambience, ritualistic chanting, pretentious evil groaning, it sounds possessed. Then there goes the typical fast and hateful black metal passage with tremolo riffing and blast beats. In the main part of the composition there's an alternation of catchy mid-paced parts in vein of Celtic Frost with low-paced ritualistic ones. At the ending of the track the music explodes again. \"Kathaarian Life Code\" is monotonous and dark. The mentioned features became firmly associated with black metal.\n\nDespite being a piece of classical black metal, \"A Blaze in the Northern Sky\" is diverse enough. The ending of \"In the Shadow of the Horns\", for example, features acoustic melodies placed over the raw distortion. Every track has guitar solos, energetic and/or melodical ones. The lead guitar is important on the title track, \"The Pagan Winter\" and especially on \"Paragon Belial\". There're a lot of leads and solos on those compositions, but they don't make the music overmelodic, they strengthen the dark atmosphere instead of that. \"Where Cold Winds Blow\" has expressive vocal parts, which isn't much common for the reserved style of Nocturno Culto.\n\n\"A Blaze in the Northern Sky\" is a cult album for a reason. It was innovative and it became a one of those works, which forged black metal standards. Ironically, in its times the album was a countercultural manifest, it was opposed to the trendy metal of the 90s and to the Christian regime of Norway, while today it is placed in museums in the country. After all, \"A Blaze in the Northern Sky\" highly influenced extreme music, black metal in particular. What's more important it remains convincingly dark even nowadays.\n",
        "\nSo, the new Darkthrone album. Well, we are all already experienced and we do not all regard this release as black metal. Of course, we all know that \"Eternal Hails......\" is \"just metal\". If you are not in the know, then Nocturno Culto recently stated in an interview with Revolver Magazine (June 25, 2021) that \"people don't regard us as black metal anymore, I guess. I think black metal is a very overused term \u2013 it has lost its power. I think it's all metal and the one thing that you can call black metal these days is probably our sound. Basically we just play metal.\" \n\nIn all appearances, Nocturno Culto is talking here about the term, not the genre itself. So, what he is saying is not the same as \"black metal is dead\" as Ulver stated in \"Black Metal: Beyond the Darkness\" (Black Dog Publishing, London, 2012, p. 170). Everything was simple there: if Ulver can no longer play black metal or they are not interested in playing black metal, it doesn't mean at all that \"black metal is dead.\" While Nocturno Culto is right that \"black metal is a very overused term,\" it is obvious enough to every black metal veteran who sees what black metal has become today compared to the \"good old days\". But in contrast to Ulver, Darkthrone don't deny black metal, they just don't play it. \n\nThus, \"Eternal Hails......\" is \"just metal\", and this recording perfectly reflects what Darkthrone are capable of today. Let's analyze what is going on this album. \n\nFirst of all, we cannot but agree with another statement by Nocturno Culto that \"this album probably isn't the easiest album.\" Right, the first reaction to \"Eternal Hails......\" is denial. Almost rejection. As the album unfolds, you start to think that Darkthrone decided to just play everything that smacks of old schoolness, and without breaking a sweat. Meaning, in this work you suspect not fatigue, but laziness. Sometimes it is really unclear whether they play this way on purpose to imitate another era of extreme music, or they just blew everything off, did not get their riffs into shape. And you would like to hope that this is just a retro imitation. \n\nLikewise, it's clear from the beginning that the riffs on this album have a trademark imprint, yes, many of them are truly Darkthronish, some vague echoes of \"Panzerfaust\" sound constantly. Of course, not in pure form. About the same as on Metallica's latest album, \"Hardwired... to Self-Destruct\", you can sometimes make out passages in the vein of their classic \"Master of Puppets\" album. But if Darkthrone wanted to make their own \"Hardwired...\", then they had to abandon this riff after riff hodgepodge. \n\nThe point is that \"Eternal Hails......\" features an abundance of riffs \u2013 old school, Darkthronish, haunting, catchy, groovy, piercing, and who knows which else. Yes, they do not come into conflict with each other, but generally speaking, in their sequence, they represent a kind of medley / potpourri, rather than careful coherence. The riff transitions are often unexpected and abrupt, and no less often, riffs are replaced by others through the guitar fade out and pause stage \u2013 well, this is actually how beginner musicians do when they don't know how to glue their riffs together, but again, most likely, Darkthrone just took an old-school style of songwriting as model. For example, note that drum part often includes fills on toms during a quiescent guitar \u2013 this is a hard rock trick. \n\nAnyway, as a result of the abundance of riffs and their awkward changes within songs, it looks like Darkthrone are just jamming: everything is going well for a while, but now they are tired of playing one or another riff, or it turned out to be out of place, so they switch to a new riff... Well, most likely, this is how albums were once recorded, but today not everyone is ready to appreciate this attitude immediately. And perhaps, this is an artistic criticism of the modern fashion for contrived sophistication in songwriting. Maybe. \n\nProduction-wise, it could be argued about Nocturno Culto's statement that \"the one thing that you can call black metal these days is probably our sound.\" Although \"Eternal Hails......\" boasts a fairly clean production, yes, the album is recorded really well, it is an old-school recording again, not at all black metal-ish. The sound is rather low, in addition, cavernous \u2013 most of all it is noticeable in the vocal parts. You can hear the guitar laying a little behind the drums, and this is a little strange. Furthermore, like most of the old albums, \"Eternal Hails......\" has only one rhythm guitar on it, right, one harsh guitar and a sullen grunting bass. But the recording doesn't feel \"empty\", the sound is pretty dense. Well, Darkthrone demonstrate to modern black metal bands that \"heaviness\" doesn't come from massive guitars alone, because this album can be called anything but soft. Ah, next time they will teach us a lesson and probably put bass and drums on one channel and guitar on the other (listen to the classic \"The Sound of Silence\" by Simon & Garfunkel). \n\nAnd you can really feel the old schoolness in the guitar sound. This is not black metal again, this is Black Sabbath. Listen, for example, to the riff in \"His Master's Voice\" at 0:56 (1:48) \u2013 strumming across all strings, a typical black metal manoeuvre, is used here, but the mildly distorted guitar (almost no fizzy tone) does not generate the usual black metal atmospheric effect, and as a result you can hear just the clattering of the strings. That is, it could be black metal, but... well, it is just metal / rock. The same thing is in \"Wake of the Awakened\": the second part of the riff, starting at 0:58, is tremolo picking on multiple strings at the same time, but due to the slightly overdriven guitar, there is no onrushing shrillness here, while, again, this riff is 100% black metal-ish. The next example comes from \"Voyage to a North Pole Adrift\": the lack of distortion is especially felt in the second riff, at 1:22, when the chord continues to sound after picking for a while \u2013 it's not black metal at all, it's some kind of rock or something else. Right, Black Sabbath. \n\nAs for the second guitar, it comes in only occasionally, mainly for solos and licks: the minimalist solo in \"Hate Cloak\" at the very beginning, at 2:40, and the last one at 6:11 \u2013 a barely audible solo in the background, touching and piercing; we can also mention the beginning of \"Voyage to a North Pole Adrift\", also there is a solo here at 6:56. But this is not to say that the solos are old school, they are more or less modern, while the keyboards (the finale of \"His Master's Voice\", the middle of \"Wake of the Awakened\", the finale of \"Lost Arcane City of Uppakra\") \u2013 yes, this, of course, is the embodiment of the old schoolness. \n\nThe drums are incredibly alive. This is \"blast from the past\" again, now you can get such a drum sound maybe by recording an album in a rehearsal room \u2013 no triggers, no samples, no digital cut 'n' paste, no plugins. The snare drum is dry, not sonorous at all, while the toms, on the contrary, are rumbling, while the kick has a very specific sound, somewhat dull. And in its turn double bass drumming is practically inaudible, it can be somehow made out in the finale of \"Voyage to a North Pole Adrift\" \u2013 probably, it was shyly drowned in the mix so as not to violate the old school canons. \n\nAnd a few words about the songs themselves. The first \"His Master's Voice\" seems to be very dynamic, it's some kind of tribute to NWOBHM, only at the end a doom metal passage suddenly appears. Well, this is a very Darkthronish passage, but upon first listening to the album it seems completely out of place, as if it was glued on for some unknown reason. \"Hate Cloak\" consists mostly of proto-doom metal riffs \u00e0 la Black Sabbath and riffs in the vein of Celtic Frost or even Hellhammer. The third song \"Wake of the Awakened\" is perhaps the most interesting, well, because it is the most black metal-ish, with tremolo-picked riffs. Doom metal manifests itself only with a riff at 2:24, but in general there is a jumble of riffs here, you can even catch a typical early thrash metal riff at 4:30. \n\n\"Voyage to a North Pole Adrift\" as a whole, is also a vivacious song, but here this riff-jumble is beginning to get boring, the abundance of riffs seems to be an unstructured heap. On the other hand, this composition contains perhaps the best riff on the album \u2013 the closing riff at 8:00. This plucking riff, turning into a lick, sounds very atmospheric, well, it can be described as a power metal riff, performed in a black metal manner and presented with a rock sound. The last \"Lost Arcane City of Uppakra\" also amazes with the final passage \u2013 it sounds very grotesque and beautiful, although, in fact, it is psychedelic rock. A very delicate hi-hat, ticking away from 4:21, is an indicator of high recording quality. \n\nWell, when you listen to \"Eternal Hails......\" for the second time, for the third time, and so on, anger gradually changes to a phase of mercy. The whole album is just a pleasure to listen to. Just as a metal work. As music without frills and pretensions. As a sequence of \"cool riffs\". At least as an \"acoustical perfume\", when you are busy with something else: you can switch your attention to the music at any moment, praise an innocent riff taken out of context, and continue to do your own thing. \n\nSummary. The motto of \"Eternal Hails......\" is Fenriz's words: \"Five heavy dinosaurs looking in wonder and bewilderment at the stars.\" Five songs \u2013 five dinosaurs, yes, those dinosaurs are Darkthrone themselves. Huge in their authority and clumsy in their old schoolness, they look at the modern world from their cave-studio and do not want to keep up with the times. Darkthrone want to show with this album that they are not like everyone else, that they are Darkthrone. But this trick only worked because they are Darkthrone. If another band, especially a beginner band, recorded such material, it is doubtful that they would have received the honors and fame. On \"Eternal Hails......\", the focus is on old schoolness, and not on music as such. \n\nThe Metal Observer\n",
        "\nDarkthrone's recent albums may never be as great as the Unholy Trilogy, but they are still fascinating to look at. Their last album \"Old Star\" was decent, but felt lacking when compared to \"Arctic Thunder\". Now that the band has released their latest work \"Eternal Hails......\", I can safely say that after numerous listens, this is their best album in a long time. Not only is the instrumentation on par with their early albums, but it also has its own unique style that sets it apart in the latest releases.\n\nLet's start off with the instruments. This album goes for a black/doom metal style similar to \"Old Star\", but it works better than the previous album. To see what I mean, let's look at the first track \"His Master's Voice\". The guitars play a good mix of black and doom riffs, but there are times where it leans towards either black metal or doom metal, and each riff it plays sounds excellent to both genres. The drums also have a simple beat to it, but it works well in maintaining the tempo of each portion of the track. The bass is also audible, and adds in a great foundation in the track. All of these instruments are combined to create a gloomy and raw atmosphere, especially with the more amateur and unpolished production. Other great instrumentals are from the tracks \"Hate Cloak\" and \"Voyage to a North Pole Adrift\". The instrumentals in \"Wake of the Awakened\" are slightly weak with the doom parts overshadowing the black parts and vice versa, but otherwise, the instruments are great overall.\n\nThe vocals are also good. Nocturno Culto's vocals have some shrieks that resemble those of the early black metal albums, but are weakened for a better flow with the black/doom style, and it works well. Take the track \"Voyage to a North Pole Adrift\" for example, where the instruments go for a more epic and atmospheric tone. This fits well to the vocals, where Culto's shrieks give him a more powerful personality and adds in some strength in the descriptions of the voyage. Fenriz also has some good backing vocals, but his screams can get repetitive at times, especially in the track \"Lost Arcane City of Uppakra\" where he didn't put much effort in the vocals. Despite some missteps with the backing vocals, Culto still provides some strong vocals that flow well to the instruments.\n\nThe lyrics are also decent. I didn't really feel much with the lyrics in \"Old Star\", but here, they've been improved a lot. For example, in the track \"Wake of the Awakened\", this verse quotes:\n\nDecapitate\u2005sympathy\nCannot muster the outreach\nDeny the helping\u2005hands\nWake of the awakened\n\nThis verse talks about killing sympathy to deny some poor people help. The lyrics are written in a depressing tone, so it gives the action a very disturbing feel. This is also fitting to the instrumentals and vocals. While the instrumentals are still weak, the track has a much faster tempo that works well enough to maintain some consistency, and Culto's shrieks sound more brutal. This enhances the lyrics into feeling more harsh and cold. The lyrics are written well with its bleak tone, and it is further executed with the instrumentals and vocals.\n\n\"Old Star\" may have been a bit of a disappointment, but it feels like the band has stepped up their game with this album. The instrumentals execute the black/doom metal style better, the vocals are more stronger, and the lyrics are more poetic. Despite some weak moments, \"Eternal Hails......\" is a whole lot better than the previous release, and I highly recommend this album to anyone who wants a good black/doom metal album.\n",
        "\nDarkthrone became a living legend with its black metal albums of the 90s. However, acknowledging the fact, that Darkthrone was among those bands, which were forging black metal, members of Darkthrone obviously had grown up on a bit different music in comparison to their own works. Generally, they remain fans of traditional metal. They grew up on the likes of Venom, Black Sabbath and early Celtic Frost. Any surprise, that Darkthrone got rid of classical black metal sound already about 20 years ago?\n\nDarkthrone has a pretty diverse discography, although it still gets associated with black metal by many casuals. During last 10 years or so the band has been providing different variations on the subject of traditional metal. \"Old Star\" was a piece of heavy/doom metal with some Celtic Frost features and barely recognizable elements of the classical black metal sound. Exactly the same thing can be said about \"Eternal Hails......\". Differences between these albums are minimal.\n\nThe best things about \"Eternal Hails......\" are its sound and aesthetics. The music is raw, but the rawness is moderate and pleasant, not a noisy one. It transports a listener directly to the 70s and 80s. The music is filled with vibes of Black Sabbath and traditional doom metal of the 80s, in vein of Pentagram or early Saint Vitus. The trademark atonal Celtic Frost riffing is presented mostly on the speed-ups with punkish rhythm section, but some slow parts also resemble CF.\n\nSo, the album sounds like another tribute to the old school metal. \"Eternal Hails......\" is made majorly for the hardcore fans of such sound and can be lost among other tributes to the traditional metal, but it won't, because it's Darkthrone. The band itself remained recognizable mainly because of the vocals by Nocturno Culto. The melodies are drowned in some sort of phlegm. On the one hand, \"Eternal Hails......\" brings great aesthetics, on the other hand, the music is always trying to go to the background. \"Eternal Hails......\" isn't really catchy and memorable.\n\nIf you want some drive, go and listen to \"The Cult Is Alive\" or \"F.O.A.D.\", or at least to \"The Underground Resistance\". Years will always catch you and flame in your eyes can't fiercely burn forever. Today Fenriz and Nocturno are aged craftsmen. The album features just a couple of highlights. On \"Wake of the Awakened\" there's a dark passage with slow rhythm section, black metal riffing and background ritual keyboards. At the ending of \"Lost Arcane City of Uppakra\", again with slow rhythm section, there're heavy and gloomy doom metal riffs with beautiful psychedelic keyboards.\n",
        "\n(Former) Unholy Black Metal Heroes Darkthrone published their 18th (!!!) Studio Album in June 2021. \nDarkthrone albums are always a big surprise. You never really know, what you are going to get. But for me, the result was always at least satisfying. Nevertheless, I am very happy, that they abandoned the punk elements in Arctic Thunder (one of the best 'new' Darkthrone releases, by the way). While albums like F.O.A.D were not bad by any means, they felt kind of 'unnatural' to me.\n\nAnother major change since Arctic Thunder is, that Fenriz' quit singing completely. Again, an ingredient that was surely not bad, but that definelty is not missing. Fenriz' singing was always reminiscent of great operatic metal singers (e.g Bruce Dickinson, Michael Kiske) and that is where the problem was. It somehow did not feel right and would be so much better if one of the above mentioned would sing it. So, on Arctic Thunder, they stripped singing down to Nocturno Culto's guttural finesse. Of course, he is far from being a good singer, but his voice just fits perfectly for Darkthrone. \n\nAfter Arctic Thunder, Darkthrone evolved in a pseudo doom metal style on Old Star, with very obvious hints at black metal and thrash metal. In my opinion, that was a perfect fusion and showed the duo in all their strength. Fenriz noted in an interview prior to the release of Eternal Hails...... that they would further explore the doom metal side and Nocturno Culto even requested his followers to \"expect the unexpected\". So, what kind of album does Eternal Hails...... turns out to be?\n\nFirst of all, Nocturno Culto was not completely wrong, the album feels different to prior releases and comes with a \"new\" vibe. But in fact, there are no new elements to be found. Any stylistic elements used in the music, are nothing new to the experienced Darkthrone listener. \n\nBut why does it sound so different then?\nOn the one hand, the tempo is slow, very slow, this atmosphere makes Darkthrone sound as dark and evil as they have not sounded in a quite long time. That is not the cold icy atmosphere from their unholy trinity albums, it is more like pure hopefulness. The (amazingly beautiful, yet disturbing) cover shows a desolated, icy cave on Pluto and that is exactly the feeling you get from the songs. Being abandoned, far from mankind, far from earth, being left alone in space and time. Certainly, not an album for each and every day. \n\nIn the first listens, all songs seemed good, entertaining, yet far from amazing. \nExcept for the album's closer Lost Arcane City of Uppakra. Fenriz' second composition on the album turns out to be one of the best songs ever written by Darkthrone. Starting with the usual doom mode, it evolves in a faster pseudo-new wave of British heavy metal song. But it is the ending, which makes this song stand out. The entire second half is a slow doom-black metal celebration with spoken words and synthesizers in the mannor of Burzum. Additionally, Fenriz' lyrics for the song might well be the best he had ever written. A tale about an isolated tribe, that stayed true to their rituals and their religion. A tribe that openly declares war against the church and Christians. Musically, and lyrically, the closest to black metal Darkthrone have been since Panzerfaust (yet, without blast beats). Also, this might just be the unexpected new element one was looking for. \nThe other songs however were not so catchy. But they grow\u2026 and how they do. \nIn retrospective, I must admit that I could not comprehend these compositions first. But the amount of amazing melodies those guys hit in these extra long songs -when they reveal themselves to the listener- is simply outstanding. \n\nThe musicianship needs time to unfold before your ears, too. But once you notice those short intelligent bass drum fills or the hidden guitar melodies, you can do nothing but admire those masters in music. Somehow in this album everything fits together. It needs a little too much time until the penny drops, but you surely get your rewards. \n\n\nThe production resembles the last releases. Far from being clean, but clear enough to actually hear all instruments. It sounds a little less thick than Old Star though, the blurry guitar walls are not as oppressing as they used to be. But it clearly is exactly the way Fenriz and Culto wanted it. It fits the album and adds brilliantly to the aforementioned atmosphere. \n\nOf course, this plays in another league than Blaze in a northern sky. But only musically. Perhaps I would even go as far and call this Darkthrone\u2019s best. \nBut I don\u2019t like those ridiculous compares. \nFor every listener, do yourself the favour, and give this album the time it needs!\n\nRating:\n\nSongwriting: 90%\nProduction: 85%\nMusicianship: 90%\nLyrics: 90% \n\nTotal: 89%\n",
        "\nI've never listened to Darkthrone properly before, I may have spun Panzerfaust and A Blaze In The Northern Sky once, but other than that, my familiarity with the band is seldom. However, when this single was released earlier today, I decided to listen to it, and honestly Hate Cloak is better than I'd expected it to be. First of all, despite the lo-fi black metal production, the EQ isn't ear-piercingly high-heavy like most black metal is, so this song is actually quite warming to the ears, it makes the song flow better in my opinion, and honestly it still encapsulates the hateful and sludgy feel well enough. The first 4 minutes of the song is fairly slow-paced, with some kickass riffs and vocals that, once again, took me by surprise, as they are more of the likes of Celtic Frost, rather than your typical black metal shriek, which further improves the song. Then, the track breaks, and it turns into a bouncy, crushing semi-breakdown, filled with chugging and echoed grunts. This is probably the highlight of the song, it's still in-your-face and pissed off, but more laid-back.\n\nThe best thing about Hate Cloak is how original it is compared to the black metal subgenre in general. It is still black metal, but it's much slower; there aren't any blast beats, and as I previously mentioned, the production and vocals aren't overly obnoxious just for the sake of being edgy. The song has this sludgy and catchy feeling, which makes it surprisingly accessible, but there are still a lot of black metal elements, they're just annulled in their prominence. There are even some eerie synths at about 6 minutes in. The drums are quite simple, but I think that they hold the rhythm together well, and virtually all of the guitar riffs are cohesive and powerful, some of the riffs are also melodic, which I like as it's a diversion from the constant droning and chugging, it also shows that Fenriz's and Nocturno's songwriting is diverse and creative. Although I do think that the song could be a bit shorter considering its content and the lack of soloing, but Hate Cloak is a very good song that I'm sure fans of Darkthrone as well as newcomers like myself will enjoy. If the other songs on Eternal Hails follow a similar fashion, it will undoubtedly be a great album.\n",
        "\nIn my last two reviews, I've covered \"A Blaze in the Northern Sky\" and \"Under a Funeral Moon\". Both of those albums were highly influential to the black metal scene at the time and have some of Darkthrone's best songs to date. It seems that Darkthrone couldn't top those albums, but in 1994, the band surprised us yet again with \"Transilvanian Hunger\". TH is part of the classic Norwegian black metal albums from 1994 along with Mayhem's \"De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas\", Burzum's \"Hvis Lyset Tar Oss\", and Emperor's \"In the Nightside Eclipse\", and it's easy to see why. While TH has an unconventional sound, there is a beauty hidden in it.\n\nOne huge different from this album compared to the others is the instruments and production. ABITNS and UAFM had plenty of distortion, especially from the guitars, but there was still some sort of clean production mixed in them. With \"Transilvanian Hunger\", however, there's no clean production to be found anywhere. This is evident in the first track \"Transilvanian Hunger\", where the listener is immediately confronted by guitar riffs that are so loud and messy that it's kinda hard to tell the riffs apart from each other. The drums are also downgraded to soft beats and loud banging that is mainly hidden by the guitars. The bass is pretty much unheard of, and like ABITNS, the guitars are having to create the foundation for the tracks. This seems like a bad idea on paper, but when executed, you get some cold riffs that have a certain melody in them, and the drums beat in a coherent pattern that sets the tempo of the track well. All of these instruments are combine to create an atmosphere of coldness, sadness, and hatred, and it sounds great. Other tracks that execute this well are \"Slottet i det fjerne\", \"I en hall med flesk og mj\u00f8d\", and \"En \u00e5s i dype skogen\". TH remains Darkthrone's most raw and unfiltered project to date, and the execution of it sounds fantastic.\n\nAnother great thing about the album is the vocals. As per usual, Nocturno Culto does the main vocals on this track, and like the instrumentals, his vocals are downgraded, but in a good way. To see what I mean, let's look at the second track \"Over fjell og gjennom torner\". The song is only 2 minutes and 30 seconds long, but Culto fits in some great vocals in the track. His voice contains nothing but shrieks and growls, and he sounds genuinely furious on the track, and it makes the lyrics he speaks sound all the more creepy. Not only that, but they also flow very well to the track's more epic tone. In some of the more punk-influenced tracks like \"I en hall med flesk og mj\u00f8d\", Culto has a certain energy in his voice that further enhances the anxiety-driven instruments. While the vocals are a bit weaker compared to the previous two albums, Culto still maintains the signature agonizing vocals that he is well known for.\n\nBut by far the biggest change of this album is the lyrics. Unlike ABITNS and UAFM, only two tracks on this album have the lyrics in English, and that's \"Transilvanian Hunger\" and \"As Flittermice as Satans Spys\". All the other tracks have the lyrics in Norwegian, but that doesn't stop the lyrics from being good. For example, in the track \"Skald av Satans sol\", this verse quotes:\n\nI'm standing under a cold wind. The roof eases from the flight of angels\nI drink from the Man's Cold, Pale light and pay homage to Satan's sun\nA Cruel Evil seeps in and fills body and soul\nA heaven of Daudinger Torture and Hatred\n\nThis verse translates to someone drinking and paying homage to Satan. When you translate the lyrics, you get some really dark and disturbing themes of religion and hatred, and they are well written and descriptive enough to paint a brutal picture. What makes them even more effective is the execution, as the distorted production and shrieking vocals give the lyrical contents a more cold and harsh tone. Even if you don't understand Norwegian, you can still hear some crazy stories in the English-driven tracks, and they are magnificent.\n\nJust when you thought ABITNS and UAFM couldn't get anymore raw, TH blows them out of the water. The instrumentals sound more brutal and cold than ever, the vocals are more feral and harsh-sounding, and the Norwegian lyrics make the stories told more obscure and underground. \"Transilvanian Hunger\" may not be for everyone due to its unconventional sound, but if you're willing to put up the unfiltered distortion, I recommend you take a look at Darkthrone's most abrasive piece in their Unholy Trinity.\n",
        "\nAfter the critical success of \"A Blaze in the Northern Sky\", the band had nowhere to go but up. In 1993, Darkthrone would release another black metal album called \"Under a Funeral Moon\". At that point, black metal was going through a peak in terms of their controversies in 1993-1994, especially with the murder of Euronymous and the church burnings going on in Norway. Some would argue that UAFM is the weakest album of their \"Unholy Trinity\" and that it was made to exploit the controversies going on with black metal at the time. I would argue otherwise, as while ABITNS and TH are excellent albums on their own, UAFM is the best album in terms of instrumentals and songwriting.\n\nOne great improvement from the previous album would be the instruments. ABITNS has some great instruments, but it did had a couple of death metal moments blended in it. Well if ABITNS isn't considered \"true\" black metal, then UAFM no doubtedly does. The guitar riffs sound more distorted and have a more cold tone in them than in the previous album. The drums also have a more inconsistent beat pattern, as there are more fast and chaotic beats while having the slower moments sound more doom-like and technical. The bass is also more audible than in ABITNS, and it provides the foundation of the tracks well. All of this is combined to create an atmosphere that's more colder and harsher than in the previous album. One of the best instrumentals on this album would be in \"Inn i de dype skogers favn\". The guitars play some brutal, yet catchy riffs that provide an enraging atmosphere. The drums also beat in a slightly more coherent pattern, and the snares on that track have more echo in them. I especially like the part near the end, where the instruments slow down and get more broken as they get slower and slower, creating the feeling that someone is truly dying. Other great highlights would be in \"Unholy Black Metal\", \"Summer of the Diabolical Holocaust\", and \"Crossing the Triangle of Flames\". The instrumentals on this album are near perfect, and remain some of Darkthrone's best works to date.\n\nAnother excellent part about the album is the vocals. Nocturno Culto continues doing the main vocals on this album, and he actually outdid himself with this one. Culto's vocals sound even more painful than in ABITNS, as the high shrieks sound more grueling and angry. Furthermore, his vocals flow to the chaotic instruments more smoothly, and it further executes the raging atmosphere. One good example of this would be in \"To Walk the Infernal Fields\". The track's more grand and epic atmosphere fits perfectly to Culto's chants and shrieks. His vocals are also more smooth on that track, and his words are more understandable than in most other tracks, which is a surprise since most other black metal vocalists practically make the words indecisive without the lyrics sheet. You wouldn't think that Culto would improve his vocals from the previous album, but his vocals ended up sounding better in the end.\n\nEven the lyrics are incredible. ABITNS had some great lyrics too, but UAFM takes them on a whole new level. For example, in \"Crossing the Triangle of Flames\", this verse quotes:\n\nI am the wolf in the darkest scene\nPhantasms sweep my role\nI am Lucifer, I bring you light and pride\n\nThis verse talks about Culto being Lucifer disguised as a wolf to terrorize people into joining his religion. The lyrics have an uneasy tone in them, and that tone is presented a lot on this album, and it works well. Not only that, but the tone is enhanced by the slower and technical instruments and the agonizing screams of Culto. This gives the tone of the lyrics a more scary tone. Also going back to \"Inn i de dype skogers favn\", the song is the only one in the album to have the lyrics in Norwegian, which translate to a road in the dark mountains. These translated lyrics show off some dark and disturbing imagery, which are only further executed by the harsh instruments. The lyrics may have some weak moments occasionally, but for the rest of them, they are just as good, if not better, as ABITNS.\n\nDarkthrone's previous album was already great and influential, but it would be UAFM that took things to a whole new level. The instruments are more brutal and cold than before, the vocals are more emotional and hateful, and the lyrics still retain plenty of poetic lines. People may not view this album as highly as the others, but \"Under a Funeral Moon\" still remains one of their most important album and their magnum opus. If you're looking for some harsh and cold black metal, \"Under a Funeral Moon\" is the album for you.\n",
        "\nThe year was 1992. Black metal was truly starting to become the genre it is with bands like Immortal and Burzum releasing groundbreaking albums that set a certain standard for the new genre. But during this time, there came a band named Darkthrone. They were originally a death metal band that released a decent death metal album named \"Soulside Journey\" just a year ago, and now they were going to experiment with this new genre with their next album titled \"A Blaze in the Northern Sky\" with the help of Euronymous from Mayhem. It just seemed silly at first, especially since a lot of black metalheads at the time hated death metal, and thought that Darkthrone was gonna make the genre another trendy commercial sellout. It wasn't until the album actually released, however, that it blew people's minds, and got them the respect they truly deserve.\n\nSo what made \"A Blaze in the Northern Sky\" so special? Well one fantastic thing about the album was its instruments and production. Now distortion wasn't something new in black metal. Most black metal albums at that time were using it as a standard. However, none of them at that time used it in the way Darkthrone did. Starting with the track \"Kathaarian Life Code\", it begins with some deep growling with a slow beating drum playing in the background. This sets in the dark and creepy atmosphere, and it won't be until the rest of the instruments kick in that the sound truly shines. The guitars play some really cold and harsh riffs, and its brutal sound is executed further with its high distortion. The drums also have diverse beat patterns that ranges from fast and chaotic to slow and technical. The bass is also virtually unheard of in the final mix, so the guitars are having to do most of the bass-work, and its more rhythmic composition lays a good foundation to most of the tracks. Highlights of the instruments would be \"Kathaarian Life Code\", \"In the Shadow of the Horns\", and \"The Pagan Winter\", since they execute the distorted and cold atmosphere the best. The instrumentals on this album utilize the distortion brilliantly, and the guitars would provide some cold and brutal riffs that would revolutionize black metal.\n\nThe instruments may be great, but another great thing about the album would be the vocals. Nocturno Culto would do the main vocals on this album, and man does he absolutely kill it here. His voice has the high shrieks of most other black metal albums at the time, but he includes some harshness in them, so his personality is more abrasive and enraged. A good example of this would be in the track \"In the Shadow of the Horns\". The track's slower and more technical coldness is perfect to Nocturno Culto's chanting shrieks. He also enhances the atmosphere even further, as his shrieks have a genuine grating and hoarse tone in them that give the instruments a more raw sound to it. Fenriz would also do some vocals for the intro/outro and some of the spoken word portions of the tracks. Fenriz crazy growling in the intro/outro sounds bestial and fitting to the dark atmosphere, and his spoken word portions have chants that sound epic and fit well to the epic stories he talks about. While I do slightly prefer the vocals on their next album \"Under a Funeral Moon\", Culto and Fenriz's vocals are still excellent and set the stage for the bitter atmosphere of the tracks.\n\nEven the lyrics are a step up from many other black metal releases at the time. Most other black metal releases mainly had Satanism as the lyrical themes. Darkthrone would deal with similar themes, but they took a different approach to them. For example, this verse in \"Where Cold Winds Blow\" quotes:\n\nWhere cold winds blow I (was) laid to rest\nI can not reach my rusty weapons\nThe blood and sword that guided my path\nFor they drowned in the sands of wisdom\n\nThis verse talks about a guy dying from a brutal blizzard. The lyrics would then go into more details about the guy deteriorating as the winter takes over him. I especially liked this line:\n\nThere are only two paths - the mind or the sword\nAnd the mind was open like the sights in a dream\nBut the sword was like a stone around my neck\n\nThese poetic lyrics are found throughout the album, and they are beautifully written. Not only that, but the vocals and instruments only enhance them. With the painful shrieks of Culto's vocals and the raw distortion of the instruments, the lyrics are given a more bitter tone and make the stories sound more severe. The lyrics on this album are amazing, and still remain one of Darkthrone's greatest lyrics in their entire discography.\n\nPeople didn't expect Darkthrone to release something like this, and the band was able to subvert their expectations extremely well. ABITNS would set the bar even higher in black metal with its distorted instruments, agonizing vocals, and elegant lyrics. Their next two albums, \"Under a Funeral Moon\" and \"Transilvanian Hunger\", would go one to expand the ideas of ABITNS and stand out on their own with their own styles, but as it stands, \"A Blaze in the Northern Sky\" still remains one of the most influential black metal albums of all time.\n",
        "\nAfter hearing people praising this album year after year I find it necessary to point out a few cons with this release. I get what they where aiming for: 100% Black metal, nothing less, nothing more. Fair enough, but to purposly lower your creative and technical skills to sound like something Bathory did way better in the mid 80s in 1992 is to me a recipe for failure. Because that's what they are doing here. They took out all the technicalities of \"A blaze...\" and went on protest against \"contemporary metal\" which their second album still had some vibes from. The difference is that with \"A blaze...\" they actually managed to create something new to the table, it was an unexpected and fast turn to the blacker side of music and they showed every inch of confidence while doing it. Here on the other hand, everything except the guitar sound is stripped down.\n\nNocturno Culto's vocals sound held back, as if he doesn't want to use all the air in his lungs. Sure, they sound creepy, but evil? Nah. I'll give them credit for songs such as \"Natassja in Eternal Sleep\" since the guitar do sound evil there as well as \"Summer of the Diabolical Holocaust\" which has a lot of strength in it and some variation in the songwriting. People usually talk about the \"coldness\" of this album, and sure; it ain't sunshine to put it mildly. But the guitar is without punch and is feeble sounding. The bass though has a lot of fuzz which is one of the few things I appreciate here. This for me is actually a step away from both its predecessor and successor. Everything just comes off really stale here and the songwriting is actually really uninspired, repetetive and monotonous. Some would say it's the point of black metal; I disagree to a certain extent.\n\nAs for the drums; Fenriz stripped down the drum-kit and only used the floor tom I have read to \"make it sound huge\". Well, agree to disagree again. Don't get me wrong, Fenriz is an excellent drummer and I enjoy his playing here but the minimalism that shrouds this album just makes it weak in my opinion. Talented guys who purposely go lesser than they should in order to prove something is never a good idea to me.\n\nBut the weak link is actually Zephyrous, who is the only guitarist on this album since Nocturno plays bass here. There's nothing wrong with his technical skills, but the songs he has written (Unholy Black Metal and Inn i de Dype Skogers Favn) must be some of the most boring tracks I've heard in black metal. The verse riff is actually just the same riff as the opening of the title track, only here he starts off with a power chord on the 7th fret instead of an open E chord (The latter sounds much cooler) and they only consists of two riffs anyway who are nothing special at all, just sounds like filler to me.\n\nThe ending of the album is actually pretty good, one of the better tracks. It has this feeling of momentum and finally builds up to a crescendo to where it slows down with an open minor chord keeping a slow pace while it fades out to the sound of a bell. So all in all: I don't mean the album completely sucks, but it is a mediocre album that happened to be released in 1993; the year Norwegian Black Metal reached its pinnacle. Had this been released later in the 90s or the 2000s for that matter, I think people wouldn't have taken it serious.\n",
        "\nDarkthrone's debut album is a difficult one to review. Opinions on it vary, and it tends to be under-appreciated and over-praised in equal measure. Some people dismiss it as another generic Scandinavian death metal record by a band that hadn't realised it\u2019s true calling. Others see it as a long-lost, mind-bending masterpiece and as the highlight of the band's career. I don\u2019t subscribe to either position. Objectively, \"Soulside Journey\" was a Scandinavian death metal album recorded at Studio Sunlight in 1991. A statement like that carries all sorts of assumptions that require clarification: this record has nothing in common with the likes of Entombed and Dismember. There are no crust-inspired riffs, no gravelly guitar sounds, none of the two-beat drumming style that characterises the early Swedish death metal sound. This is different.\n\nThis record fits a niche that I will call 'Scandinavian progressive death metal'. There are a handful of other recordings that would qualify for inclusion alongside it; the At the Gates demo and debut LP, \"Nespithe\" by Demilich and \"Cyclones of Insanity\" by Crypt of Kerberos. None of these bands sound particularly similar to each other, but they all share a technically advanced, rhythmically complex, left-field vision, and they all sound sufficiently different to the American bands. This kind of music is less about songs, more the combination of atmosphere, fluidity and precision. The common thread for these records is the shimmering song-structures and obscure melodies that suspend the listener in a state of unreality. \"Soulside Journey\" was the first of these records to be released and so Darkthrone were already ahead of the curve.\n\nBut we can't treat this album as if it was recorded by a random Scandinavian death metal band. It can't be divorced from the context of what would happen next. Listening to \"Soulside Journey\" reveals elements of Darkthrone\u2019s sound that demonstrate why they were best placed to raise the bar for extreme metal (as they would do on \"A Blaze in the Northern Sky\"). \"Soulside Journey\" is no prototype. Darkthrone had perfected what they wanted to achieve. The musicianship is so precise, the composition beautifully constructed. The riffs are sharp, the transitions are tight, but there is enough 'slack' to allow the grooves to breathe. As a piece of technical, progressive death metal \"Soulside Journey\" is near perfect.\n\nUndeniably, the four guys in this band were gifted young musicians. Gylve is the standout and the driving force. He is an astonishing drummer. His fluidity, confidence and touch are something that very few death metal drummers can match. His fills are incredible, he flirts with jazzier styles occasionally, and there is an innate 'cool' in everything he plays. You get the impression that he could play almost anything he wants and still be able to bring it back to a tough, solid beat. Comparisons with Dave Lombardo might be stretching things a bit, but I see similarities in his natural musical aptitude. A quick listen to \"Cromlech\" is enough to show you everything he is capable of as a drummer. The production on his drums is incredible, each drum sounds deep and weighty and the cymbals sound even better. This is one of the best metal drum performances you\u2019ll hear.\n\nThe other musicians are less charismatic but skilled enough to keep up with him. Ted Skjellum's leads are good (such as on the title track), but most of the guitar playing involves slithering through narrow passages before emerging into grand open areas where slower riffs catch the listener's attention. My favourite example is \"Sunrise Over Locus Mortis\" with its amazing break into the bellowed vocal of the song's title. The best riff on the album is the beginning of \"Sempiternal Sepulchrality\". This is one of those moments that heaves out from the abyss. Darkthrone would take these grand moments to the next level on \"A Blaze of the Northern Sky\" where they would gain additional emotive power. Skjellum is above average for a death metal vocalist, but there is little to distinguish him from many others doing the same thing. This would change on the next album.\n\n\"Soulside Journey\" is a progressive death metal landmark that somehow falls short of classic status, by inches. The only problem is the lack of emotional resonance, which isn't helped by the hollowed-out guitar tone. The band sounds detached, a little indifferent. There isn\u2019t much anger or catharsis going on. There is enough atmosphere to prevent it from sounding soulless, but the songs can fade into the background without sustained concentration. At the Gates would solve this problem on \"Gardens of Grief\" through Tomas Lindberg's elite death metal vocals and lyrics. Demilich would take the opposite approach on \u201cNespithe\u201d and make an art-form out of plaintive indifference. On \u201cSoulside Journey\u201d, Darkthrone fell between these two camps and didn\u2019t quite manage either. They would need to find a spark from somewhere to take them to the next level. We all know what happened next.\n",
        "\n\"A Blaze in the Northern Sky\" is a seminal moment in music history and one of the best extreme metal albums ever made. You already know this, so let's skip the stuff about what happened next and focus on how metal reached this juncture in the first place. You can tell this record is special even before you hear it. The clues are in the artwork, the cryptic song-titles, the strange photos of the band members, the pseudonyms. Were the guys making this music even human? Everything about this record feels different to everything that came before. I actually heard it soon after it was released. An older friend was discovering more extreme stuff whilst I was working my way through thrash and industrial metal. I was far too young to appreciate the music on here, but the imagery and the overall \u2018feel\u2019 left a deep impression. Back then, this seemed like a doorway into another world. It still does.\n\nThe title of the album was a confident statement, but even Darkthrone will be surprised by the long-lasting, global appeal of this album. The success of \u201cA Blaze in the Northern Sky\u201d makes perfect sense in retrospect. This is not a bunch of talent-less kids mucking about. Darkthrone were one of the most musically advanced death metal bands in Scandinavia at the time, as \"Soulside Journey\" showed. The band's evolution from their debut album to this one is devastating to behold. My guess is that Darkthrone were conscious of the 'second album slump' that affects most death metal bands, whereby a band\u2019s second album is a less potent version of the first. Darkthrone were not going to fall into this trap. They took evasive action, aborted their \"Goatlord\" sessions and changed their approach. The resulting album was certainly the greatest follow-up ever released by a death metal band.\n\nAt heart, this is still the same band as the one that recorded \u201cSoulside Journey\u201d. It is the same four individuals using the same band name and the same logo. Darkthrone\u2019s second album might seem like an intentional musical regression, but this is not the clean break that some claim it to be. Darkthrone\u2019s trick is to use their impeccable technique and musical ability to achieve a different sound. The best moments of \"Soulside Journey\" were those massive atmospheric breakdowns such as at the beginning of \"Sempiternal Sepulchrality\". Sections like that are re-imagined and taken to the next level on this album (3:32 of \"Paragon Belial\", 2:10 of the title track). \u201cA Blaze in the Northern Sky\u201d was the bleeding edge of extreme metal progression at the time. The opener is a ten-minute, multi-part epic named \"Kathaarian Life Code\". This was far more daring and otherworldly than anything on their debut. Other Peaceville bands were trying equivalent experiments in 1992; My Dying Bride recorded an audacious string-led epic (\"Symphonaire Infernus et Spera Empyrium\"), At the Gates took nightmarish death metal complexity to new levels on their debut album. Darkthrone were one of several talented bands taking extreme metal to new heights.\n\nOf course, Darkthrone reached these heights by returning to influences from the past. For all its merits, \"Soulside Journey\" was essentially a dead end. The main problem was the lack of passion and cathartic power. Darkthrone knew it. The answer to their conundrum would be found in old bands like Venom, Hellhammer, Celtic Frost and Bathory. Those bands tapped into an emotional space that Darkthrone lacked. What the band needed to do was to bring back some malice and mystery into their sound. They succeeded. Whereas Ted Skjellum was a decent death metal vocalist, Nocturno Culto was a devastating demonic medium from beyond the grave. Whereas Gylve Nagell was an exceptional, jazz-leaning death metal drummer, Fenriz was a whirlwind of endless stamina and relentless power. Darkthrone also took the epic ideas that all those old bands had (\"Triumph of Death\", \"At War with Satan\", \"Enter the Eternal Fire\", etc) and pushed them further. Drawing influence from these rickety old bands would have been easy for a band as musically adept as Darkthrone. Never has a metal band galvanised the past so effectively whilst blazing a path to the future.\n\nPerhaps the ultimate testament to \u201cA Blaze in the Northern Sky\u201d is the fact that it spelled the end for death metal\u2019s golden age. As one of the genre\u2019s unheralded progressive trailblazers, Darkthrone had progressed so far in such a short space of time that they effectively made the genre redundant. Darkthrone didn\u2019t achieve this single-handedly, but their second album is the best reference point for anyone wanting to understand what happened. Of course, this record is a necessity for anyone who appreciates metal and extreme music in any form, but you already knew that.\n",
        "\n\"Goatlord\" is weird. You could call it 'the lost Darkthrone album' if you wanted to be generous. This isn't really an album at all though, more an old rehearsal session with vocals recorded a few years later. The session known as \"Goatlord\" was due to be the band's second album after \"Soulside Journey\". As everyone knows, Darkthrone switched their musical approach and released \"A Blaze in the Northern Sky\" instead, consigning this session to the dustbin of history (for a few years). This all happened in a relatively short space of time, the band recorded three albums' worth of material in under two years. Darkthrone's musical talent was always obvious but they also had creative energy to burn, enough to scrap an entire album.\n\nIn 1994, Fenriz added some vocals to the existing instrumental recordings. The band then released it two years later, just after \u201cTotal Death\u201d. It is odd that something as messy and impure as \"Goatlord\" ever came out at all, considering how preoccupied Darkthrone were with aesthetic purity. Fenriz has stated that they released it just to have a record out there, presumably when the creative juices were drying up. Darkthrone had become metal legends by this point and they had little to prove to anyone. To their credit, they put some effort into making this. The packaging and artwork are among the band's best. It feels more like a release for the fans than a label filler.\n\nMusically it sounds like \"Soulside Journey\". Darkthrone were aiming for more of the same when they recorded this, perhaps with more obvious Celtic Frost influences (such as the beginning of \"The Grimness of which Shepherds Mourn\"). The big difference between this and the debut album is the production. As a demo, \"Goatlord\" is much rougher and grittier. In some ways I prefer this sound. \"Soulside Journey\" might have sounded unstoppable with a guitar tone like this. The drums sound hard and punchy, if not as smooth as on the debut. Hearing technically advanced death metal with a rough, rehearsal-type production is refreshing. The bass is more audible this time around too. The raw, clear sound gives a sense of the song-writing architecture. You can distinguish the skeleton behind the songs. \n\nThe vocals don\u2019t work quite as well. These were mainly done by Fenriz who can't match Nocturno Culto's power and dexterity. The vocals are mixed much louder than they are on standard death metal records, which was probably intentional. There are also some wailing 'female' vocals (apparently done by Fenriz using a vocal effect). Some of the lyrics will seem familiar too because they are used elsewhere on \"Under a Funeral Moon\" (\"In my darkest fantasy, I am free\" being the most obvious example). Primarily, the vocals push \"Goatlord\" closer to Celtic Frost than it would otherwise sound, and \"To Mega Therion\" in particular.\n\n\"Goatlord\" works surprisingly well. I have listened to it a bunch of times over the years and it always captures my interest. There are some good songs here too. The best and most famous is \"Green Cave Float\" which starts with a merciless riff and some menacing first-person declarations (the D\u00f8dheimsgard version of this song is also worth hearing). There are moments of brilliance in the other songs too; check out the eerie slow section of \"As Desertshadows\" for instance, and \u201c(Birth of Evil) Virgin Sin\u201d has some masterful drumming. This is Darkthrone, and their off-cuts are better than most bands\u2019 best material.\n\nThis record is not essential listening. It is an uneven and patchy record and the vocals can be irritating. It doesn\u2019t match either \u201cSoulside Journey\u201d or \"A Blaze in the Northern Sky\" on any level. Nonetheless, it is well worth hearing if you like Darkthrone, Celtic Frost and gritty old death metal. There isn\u2019t really anything else that sounds like \u201cGoatlord\u201d, and that is what makes it interesting.\n",
        "\nI may be crucified for this. How dare I give a bad rating to this cult black metal album?\nWell, at first, I like most of Darkthrone's albums: A Blaze In The Northern Sky, my favourite being Panzerfaust, or Ravishing Grimness. In the most recent Darkthrone\u2019s black'n'roll period, Circle the Wagons rises as their most impressive album in the decade. Darkthrone really deserve their status as one of the most influencial Norvegian band ever but this album does not.\n\nUnder a Funeral Moon was the first Darkthrone album I listened to, shortly followed by Transilvanian Hunger. I discovered black metal twenty years ago and I knew Darkthrone was the cult band you had to listen to. So I spinned this album dozens of times, trying to persuade myself I was enjoying it. The fact is: I was not enjoying Under a Funeral Moon.\n\nI can't deny that this album possesses a grim and dark tone, which fitted very well in the 90s. But the overall sound is rather bland, even with a high volume it never managed to impress the listener as the production is really weak. Guitars, on one hand, sound good with a very sharp tone, simple yet hypnotic riffing. On the other hand, the bass lines are almost non-existent (non-hearable) and never achieved to sublime the guitars work. The drums are distant, quite sloppy with very simple and repetitive patterns. Nocturno Culto did a good job, his vocals have nothing special but he has a unique signature and you recognize him very easily. The vocals sound good and do not take precedence over music, which is appreciable with this low intrumentation output. So this album is all about the guitars work and vocals, with a low production and repetitive riffs. Actually Under a Funeral Moon sounds like other Darkthrone albums, so where is the problem?\n\nIt just brought nothing to black metal. Songs on A Blaze In The Northern Sky are more memorable, with a better songwriting, the production being almost the same. So why Under a Funeral Moon is that praised? Maybe it was just released at the perfect time and got more recognition. The same applies for Transilvanian Hunger, which is a little better and then the band only changed its direction with Panzerfaust. Under a Funeral Moon is not as good as the previous and following albums, never overshadowing them.\n\nBack on this album concrete content, the title track and Unholy Black Metal are the real downsides as they are mostly uninspired with very little variation and are the songs in which the drums patterns are the least impressive. The best song on this album is To Walk the Infernal Fields and sounds like Bathory\u2019s Enter the Eternal Fire. I\u2019m certain Fenriz and Nocturno Culto listened to a lot of Bathory before being Darkthrone and before writing music, but first Bathory\u2019s black metal albums were released ten years before.\n\nI don't know if people who praise this album nowadays still like it or just remember the first time they listened to it and consider it as a memory of the 90s black metal. But I can't imagine a neophyte in black metal could be able to listen to this record now and feel the same as when it was released. I know this album inspired hundreds of bands, just look at the amount of covers you can find. This album was lucky to get so much hype where A Blaze in the Northern Sky deserved much, much more.\n\nAs stated before, maybe you have to praise this album to be considered as an honorable metalhead but after all, black metal is about the freedom of mind and speech, so today am I the blasphemer among the blasphemers?\n",
        "\nStraight to the point. DARKTHRONE is a band with no introduction needed. With a lot of obstacles throughout their existence, concerning band members going missing or accusation about far right ideologies somewhere in mid 90s, they never quit and finally, in 2019, the two geniuses Nocturno Culto and Fenriz, gave us the band\u2019s 18th full length album, \u201cOld Star\u201d.\n\nThe band has played Death Metal in their first album, they turned to Black Metal under the influence of Euronymous back then (something that happened to many other bands of the genre back in the early 90s), again they change to Punk/Crust \u201csomething\u201d, Quorthon being a presence into all their albums (except \u201cPanzerfaust\u201d which is the most CELTIC FROST-ish album and here), we have an aspect of the band, which they might have been preparing some time ago, so they could give it to us in its full glory now.\n\nThe album has 6 songs, something in which we are already used to, going from 4:30 to 7:30 minutes long but without being boring, as the songs have changes with the proper knowledge on where and how. When the song \u201cThe Hardship of the Scots\u201d was released, I said that it was a perfect mix of CELTIC FROST with IRON MAIDEN and NWOBHM. Having listened to the whole album now, I can surely say that this is true without having any remorse and I must say I am really glad about it! It is well known, that all the musicians \u201cup there\u201d back in the old days were big IRON MAIDEN fans and here, our favorite duo is not afraid to show it.\n\nNow to the moments where they play \u0392lack \u039cetal. What could we say? Classic \u201cmelodies\u201d that we are familiar with from this band and every fan is expecting from them. While Nocturno Culto is \u201cspitting\u201d those lyrics and with Fenriz with no vocals in this album, I believe we have kind of a return to the \u201cPlaguewielder\u201d days and maybe with a touch of \u201cRavishing Grimness\u201d. As for the drums, I cannot say much. Even though we don\u2019t have any blast beats from them anymore, it doesn\u2019t mean that a song cannot be a Black Metal one by just playing a straight 4/4 beat. At least that is how it is in my ears. I might be wrong or it might be what I wanted to hear. And I did!\n\nOverall, it is a classic DARKTHRONE album. A classic of their most recent era. I make it clear because the most classic period is already known and it is of a different time. Speaking for myself, I am not disappointed from what I listened to, but everyone can judge for their own. Have a good time with it. We will need something \u201ccold\u201d during the heat we are expecting here in Greece this summer!\n\nOriginally written for and published by The Gallery web magazine: https://www.thegallery.gr/en/darkthrone-old-star-2/\n",
        "\nNot much needs to be said in introduction of Darkthrone, and certainly, when one looks at the tracklist of \u201cThe Wind of 666 Black Hearts\u201d we have a list of familiar names. And while the instrumentation is familiar to anyone who\u2019s listened to \u201cUnder a Funeral Moon\u201d and \u201cA Blaze in the Northern Sky,\u201d there are a number of ideas on the recordings here that would be either entirely scrapped, rearranged, or simply reimagined before those albums were recorded. The production here is, well, almost non-existent, but what can certainly be said for the sound on this recording is that the presence of clanking, rumbling bass that splits clearly through the chainsaw guitar work and lack of vocal adds something very new to the listening experience here, not present on the albums on which these tracks ultimately landed.\n\nAnd indeed, it is truly interesting to hear the ideas of some of these songs being worked out \u2013 \u201cThe Pagan Winter,\u201d one of my favorite Darkthrone tracks, is possessed here of a more death metal sensibility that is mainly the result of the percussion, and while I much prefer the version that appears on \u201cA Blaze\u2026,\u201d a more violent than atmospheric quality to the song is revealed on its incarnation here. \u201cKathaarian Life Code\u201d retains a bit more of Darkthrone\u2019s death metal mentality as it is performed on these rehearsals as well, the more Autopsy-esque aspects of that song showing through more clearly than they do on the icy black metal monolith that \u201cA Blaze in the Northern Sky\u201d would become \u2013 it shows how much the vocal style did to mask the death metal undercurrents of the songwriting on that release. This is certainly not the case for every song, however \u2013 \u201cIn the Shadow of the Horns\u201d essentially sounds like a rough, jammed version of exactly what appears on its full-length version, as well as \u201cUnder a Funeral Moon,\u201d which is \u2013 down to the vocal cadences \u2013 essentially nothing more than a demo of the song; there is very little difference from what appears on the full-length aside from tighter performances (and, well, the feedback that suddenly slits your ears about a quarter of the way into this recording\u2026).\n\nIn short, the listener\u2019s interest will vary depending on their interest in the band more generally. While this release is certainly worth listening to for its atmosphere and the \u2013 not raw quality, as that is a staple of Darkthrone\u2019s albums \u2013 transformation that is observable in the band at this moment in its career, and the ways in which one can detect compositions being worked out and thought about at a pivotal moment for the band\u2019s trajectory. Does it need to be two 12\u201d LPs? Probably not. But as far as the Peaceville cash-ins that have been pumped out in recent years, this is one of the more interesting and worthwhile such releases, and well-worth the money if you\u2019re already into the band, and crave the raw energy of demo material.\n\n\n75%\n",
        "\nIn 1994 I remember standing in a music store, holding \u2018A Blaze in the Northern Sky\u2019 and \u2018Under a Funeral Moon\u2019 in my hands, marvelling at the monochromatic album artwork and the mysterious and evocative band portraits on the back. One of Fenriz's roles was \u2018Satan\u2019s poet\u2019. My pre-internet teenage brain went into overdrive. \n\nA lot of water has passed under the bridge since then for Darkthrone. Like a lot of fans, I drifted away as the band turned towards a more 80s cover band/homage act during the 2000s. The mysterious magic and mystery for me was largely gone. \n\nThe philosophy behind this compilation release is a good one. Three long CDs (in my version) of material from across Darkthrone\u2019s career, divided into three loose stylistic disks: black metal, death metal, and the black n roll/punkish material which is generously referred to as \u2018beyond\u2019. The premise is sound, even if it tends to overstate the death metal era of the band, which is essentially pretty brief in comparison with their 'black' and 'beyond' output. At any rate, new listeners are certainly able to get a full taste of the band\u2019s career, and in this sense it fulfils its purpose. \n\nThe reason I \u2013 and probably most people \u2013 purchased this release, though, is for the beautifully presented book that is the cornerstone of the whole release. Like a lot of metal books these days, like Metalion's \u2018The Slayer Mag Diaries\u2019, Necrobutcher's \u2018The Death Archives\u2019 and the Peter Beste photographic publication 'True Norwegian Black Metal', 'Black Death and Beyond' is a treasure of photographs from all eras of the band and without a doubt a glorious work to flick through. It's definitely worth the fairly exorbitant price-tag. \n\nUnfortunately, the same praise can\u2019t be uttered for the text within the book. While it begins with fascinating depth and detail about the circumstances of the band\u2019s beginnings and essentially reads like a biographical history, by halfway it descends into a fairly pathetic and even insulting defence of Darkthrone\u2019s post \u2018Ravishing Grimness\u2019 period, where the band ultimately began to eschew their blackened stylings and moved more into a more punky black n roll style. \n\nA couple of times I had to check that it wasn\u2019t written by someone at Peaceville, as the second half reads like one long promotional diatribe. The endless stream of hyperbole and adulation for fairly rushed and unfocused albums like \u2018The Cult is Alive\u2019 and \u2018FOAD\u2019 moved from odd, to irritating to outright laughable as the pages turned. It is almost paranoid in its rejection of any criticism or notion that the material on these releases isn\u2019t as strong as the black metal albums. \n\nThe writer of the text, apparently one Andrew Zierleyn, pumped full of Darkthrone fanaticism, brashly proclaims: \n\n\u201cIf you aren\u2019t won over by the bone dry d-beats buried beneath that rotten guitar solo, turn back \u2013 there\u2019s no room for you under this \u2018dome of exclusion\u2019\u201d. \n\n\u201c\u2026these self-evident truths seem to have eluded a troubling number of desk-chair experts who grossly mischaracterized and dismissed this diverse effort\u2026 in addition to the ever-present cries that the album is not \u2018Transilvanian Hunger\u2019\u201d. \n\n\u201cWhether this forum dwelling morass of self-styled elite knows it or not, \u2018The Cult is Alive\u2019 is a wrecking ball blow to their credibility as well as the puerile and poser-prone bands they champion.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2026and if you don\u2019t know what the acronym (FOAD) stands for, find the answer online and then take it as an instruction.\u201d\n\nMethinks he doth protest too much. \n\nIt\u2019s one of metal\u2019s accepted truths that much of Dakthrone\u2019s material around this period is weak - or at the very least divisive. Ted and Fenriz themselves admit in the book that they no longer (at that time) rehearsed at all, and that they would literally catch up on a weekend and record all the material that they had without second takes. Naturally, this makes for some hit and miss metal. \n\nInjecting such a pathetic and aggressive defence of some pretty average material by anyone\u2019s standards is not only laughable, it actually impacts the overall quality of the \u2018Black Death and Beyond\u2019 package. The final half of the book is one big masturbatory rah-rah in praise of albums that some people like, some are indifferent to, and many dislike. It feels like the guy is trying to bully people into agreeing to like these albums, and that's not the Darkthrone way. It also coincides with a lack of detail on the actual recording processes, places and people involved, concepts that made up much of the enjoyable first part of the book. Perhaps the writer had no real choice but to tread water with these empty platitudes due to a lack of material. Either way, it's not very pleasant to read. \n\nOverall, 'Black Death and Beyond' is a very good release. Compilations are nowhere near as useful or engaging as the actual albums, of course, but as an overview of a fascinating career, the three disks here are as worthy as any. There is a huge amount of material here, and all bases are covered, whichever eras you personally prefer. \n\nAs for the book: Darkthrone are about unpretentious, self-governed individualism, and like the writer says, they don\u2019t give a fuck what people think. That\u2019s great, but they\u2019re not the sacred cows that the writer seems to think they are. Darkthrone doesn't demand universal love. That's the point. Leave the hyperbolic rhetoric out of the next biographical text, please. Otherwise I'll take my money and FOAD as a preference to more of that crap.\n",
        "\nIt\u2019s difficult to know precisely what Darkthrone have been playing at these last 20 years. \n\nIt\u2019s hard to really pin down why they still exist at all when they have such low expectations of themselves. Fenriz\u2019s insistence that they represent some kind of anti-trend metal movement has become a bridge too far as the decades pass. Methinks he doth protest too much, and quite frankly I\u2019d like some atmosphere back in the tunes. \n\nWhen you consider the fairly impressive musicianship and complexity of \u2018Soulside Journey\u2019, and the stunningly bleak magic that appears on their trilogy, it\u2019s almost impossible to fathom the style of music that they eventually settled into \u2013 and then stuck to! It is one of metal\u2019s enduring mysteries as to why they have spent the past 21 years or so producing albums that eschew any real sense of adventure or danger and instead simply replicate the sound of their various 80s heroes. \n\nI was listening to \u2018Ravishing Grimness\u2019 today, and despite coming out in 1999 it\u2019s really not that distant musically from \u2018Old Star\u2019 with its mid-paced plodding and straight ahead riffage. Which means that Darkthrone are essentially more enthusiastic about this type of run-of-the-mill bland metal over any of their other potential styles of musical expression. \n\n\u2018Old Star\u2019 is an ok album. I don\u2019t dislike it. The production sounds fantastic, with full and weighty guitars and a clear yet earnest drum sound. It\u2019s easy on the ears and the riffs groove along nicely enough. \u2018I Muffle Your Inner Choir\u2019 sounds energised and active in its faster pace, while \u2018Duke of Gloat\u2019 offers some aggression, I guess. \u2018The Hardship of the Scots\u2019 contains quite a few decent riffs tacked together. Everything here sounds pretty good. \n\nThe thing that stands out to me the most about this album though \u2013 apart from the batty song titles and the fact that Nocturno really does sound like Lemmy these days \u2013 is the complete absence of anything remotely sinister or haunting. There is nothing violent, atmospheric or dangerous about anything on this album; it\u2019s all bland bland bland. \n\nThe opening riff from \u2018The Hardship of the Scots\u2019 sounds like an 80s hair metal riff (check it out, it really does), while everything else sounds like a much less inspired, even bored, version of \u2018Morbid Tales\u2019. Except where Celtic Frost were youthful and hungry, \u2018Old Star\u2019 sounds like the six-monthly jam session in Ted\u2019s garage. Which, let's face it, it essentially is. It\u2019s hard to believe that it\u2019s the same band that had the passion to write \u2018Cromlech\u2019, \u2018Kathaarian Life Code\u2019 and \u2018Rust\u2019. \n\nFenriz\u2019s lyrics are always interesting, if a little insistent in their veiled complaints of the scene and what's wrong with us all. Here they\u2019re ok, even if they don\u2019t seem to relate much to their titles. \u2018The Hardship of the Scots\u2019 doesn\u2019t go into a lot of detail regarding current socio-economic conditions in Scotland, put it that way. \n\nWhat surprises me just as much as the direction Darkthrone have taken with their decades long black n roll is that many fans are still awarding the albums very high scores, as if albums like 'Old Star' are borderline classics. Look at the 80% + scores. I\u2019ve even seen 'Old Star' appear in top ten lists for 2019, which is incredible really. \n\nI love Nocturno Culto and Fenriz as much as the next warrior, but while \u2018Old Star\u2019 is a steady and decent ramble, it\u2019s ultimately pretty unexciting and none of these riffs move me at all. The fact that it\u2019s probably their best album since \u2018Hate Them\u2019 speaks volumes about where this band has ended up. These old stars need some new passion, but at this stage I don't think it will ever happen.\n",
        "\nThis short release had preceded the \"F.O.A.D.\" album (2007), on which Darkthrone once again \"changed\" their genre. The title \"New Wave of Black Heavy Metal\" alerted that this time the band's fans would be stuffed with a mixture of black metal and \"true\" NWOBHM (i. e. \"New wave of British heavy metal\"), or \u2013 for simplicity \u2013 heavy metal. Indeed, this is what we hear here, no doubt: black / heavy / speed metal. Well, all this gossip is already in the past, nevertheless, we can try to \"sort the wheat from the chaff.\" \n\nI must say that despite the accusations of \"betrayal\" that were hurled at them, \"good old\" Darkthrone can be recognized in almost every song here. Their signature move since \"Soulside Journey\" \u2013 delaying the chord, followed by a pause \u2013 is actively used in the first song \"Wisdom of the Dead\". It's not so obvious with the riffs, that we hear, however, if most of them in this song were performed in the appropriate manner, we would get (true) black metal, that's for sure. But on the \"NWOBHM\" EP it is what it is, i. e. heavy metal. I mean, \"new wave of black heavy metal\". \n\nThe same trick can be done with the next song, although at first glance there is almost nothing from Darkthrone in this tribute song, and in addition, what a nuisance, disgusting clangorous / clanking bass dominates here. Nonetheless, riffs are essentially \"black metal-ish\". And at 2:09 almost one hundred percent black metal bridge sounds. In \"Hedninger fra Helvete\" Darkthrone's classic rhythmic pattern is used \u2013 a bit punkish, ah, in professional terms, a syncope. \"Bad Attitude\"... oops, it's a cover of a punk song by Testors, almost one to one, uhm, even a disgusting nasal snorts are present. Well, I take it as a banter / mocking and forget about it. \n\nAs for true or pure \"new wave of black heavy metal\", it is clearly distinguishable in the first solo of \"Canadian Metal\" \u2013 black metal and heavy metal are so intertwined here that it is difficult to separate them from each other (while the second solo in this song is just heavy metal). \"Hedninger fra Helvete\" is exclusive for this release, and it is almost completely created in the stated genre \"new wave of black heavy metal\". Even in the rather interesting riff that sounds after a pause, old Darkthrone (which is very close to Burzum here) fall under the \"tyranny\" of heavy metal and completely give up their positions. I hate to say it, but I had the impression that this song was composed in a hurry: there is nothing valuable in it, it is far below \"Wisdom of the Dead\". \n\nSummary. Well, at least this release is interesting to listen to. Except for the last song, of course. For me Darkthrone can be recognized even under a thick layer of heavy metal powder, because they are \"Darkthrone Holy Darkthrone\". It is clear that they were sick of playing the same thing for a long time, so they wanted to somehow diversify the movement of their fingers on the neck of the guitar, hence the birth of such an extravagant genre as \"new wave of black heavy metal\". So if this work is interpreted as an experiment, then it is acceptable.\n",
        "\nAfter 17 albums, you expect a band to change. You just don\u2019t expect them to change as much as Darkthrone has. Death metal, black metal, crust punk, heavy metal, doom, and thrash have all been employed by this amorphous band. Though I'm only extremely familiar with their first album, Soulside Journey, their unholy trinity of albums, Hate Them, and now Old Star those show quite the stylistic change. I'm only slightly familiar with all other releases.\n\nThis album could fit right alongside a Celtic Frost, Hellhammer, or maybe even a Venom release in the mid-to-late 80's without skipping a beat. I'd say this release is even simpler than the prior two bands listed. Every song has this element of hard rock/metal with black metal elements so take your pick. All instruments are working in unison to achieve this goal and achieve they have. It's not my favorite nor my least favorite genre era of Darkthrone, but it could be better. The song writing itself is passable and offers a few tidbits to grab you by the ear, but mostly is rather bland. \"The Duke of Gloat\" is their fastest song, starting right off-the-bat with a faster than normal trod which mixes things up. It's the closest song you'll find here to their older, more famous (infamous?) black metal works. There are some great moments on this album, like the main riff and composition on \"The Hardship of Nords\", but sometimes will repeat itself to death until you become tired of the once-great moment. Fortunately this does not happen too often.\n\nThe guitar is incredibly simple and barbaric. Not slamming barbaric like truer doom or slam, but just rudimentary and standard. Check the opening riff on \"Alp Man\". It has the right chugging riffage and melodious patterns connecting said riffs for what they're trying to accomplish. There are some decently ear-pleasing riffs on \"The Key is Inside the Wall\" and \"The Hardship of Nords\", but basic they are indeed. The genre lane they are trying to be in is so obvious I can't fault them for their basic guitars because if they were more complex or faster they wouldn't quite be hitting that same style they're striving for. Fair enough. The production quality helps the guitars hit that low-fi, analog sounding guitar sound.\n\nThe drums are simple enough to fit the style. So simple it's a little hard to listen to. I attempted to do a drum listen-through but couldn't make it past the second song. The bass is surprisingly audible in the mix. You can almost always distinguish it from the guitar at any given time. It doesn't show off much, but really nothing does on this album. The vocals have the right amount of rasp and strain but still being relatively able to distinguish what he's saying. You can still hear that it's his style but I don't enjoy it all that much. There's a decent echo effect added to the voice that helps the Bathory-like yelling echo through your ears. If you're used to the Unholy Trinity releases, then expect a deeper turn from Fenriz.\n\nIf you're a fan of the band, it's essential listening to hear them as they enter yet another re-imagining of the Darkthrone mythos. For those that are not fans of the band nor fans of the genre on the album, it will be a difficult listen. Not difficult as in it challenges you with new concepts or technicality, but just plain hard to listen to in its relative blandness and sameness.\n\nFavorite tracks:\n-The Hardship of Nords\n-The Key is Inside the Wall\n-Old Star\n\nTechnical skill: 42% Originality: 56% Song writing: 67% Production: 73%\n",
        "\nA true statement as to the ambition of Darkthrone from its beginning, \"A New Dimension\" essentially consists of a single masterful song \u2013 following a rather uninteresting intro track, the nine minute \u201cSnowfall\u201d dominates the runtime, and it's as good a piece of primitive demo-track songwriting as one could hope for. All the instruments are audible in the recording, and thus, the listener is able to appreciate what is going on: a group of young musicians jamming some unholy and unpolished, but outstandingly executed and deeply impassioned, metal. One can imagine a group of patch-vested, leather-jacket-clad long-hairs in the middle of the woods, headbanging along to this song as snow descends, lit only by crackling firelight, a generator humming beneath it all. \n\nIt is this quality of the recording that allows the composition itself to cast its moonlit (and equally dying-jam-space-bulb-lit) aura. While essentially a series of different riffs - only a few repetitions ever appear throughout the runtime - there is a strong sense of progression which allows the song to develop in a fittingly primal fashion. And certainly, a LOT of territory is covered even for nine minutes, with thrash riffs descending into atmospheric, clean-guitar interludes, hammering fills punctuating the transitions and driving many of the faster sections. An undeniable black metal mentality is evident here despite the song overall remaining within Darkthrone\u2019s death metal roots: aside from the sustain-driven clean guitar components of the song, some of the riffs here creep unmistakably towards a tremolo-focused black metal aesthetic \u2013 the ambitiously fast drumming beneath it itching to turn into the blast beats that would come to dominate later Darkthrone tracks like \u201cTransylvanian Hunger\u201d and \u201cEn Vind Av Sorg.\u201d Nonetheless, as is clear from the opening riff that bears more than a passing resemblance to Scream Bloody Gore\u2019s introductory track, the young Norwegians still have a clear focus.\n\nFar from a simple historical artifact, \u201cSnowfall\u201d is honestly one of Darkthrone\u2019s best tracks, its youthful ambition, masterful sense of progression, and memorable riffs a testament to the songwriting capabilities, even during the demo era, that would further develop over time. Undoubtedly, this is essential listening for any fan of the band \u2013 and, I would argue, metal fans in general. It is simply one of those rare occurrences where recording quality, instrumental performance, and songwriting work together to create an incomparably evocative product.\n\n\n\n95%\n",
        "\nIf you get that reference, you're probably rolling your eyes at another one of my 2spicy4us.\n\nBut in all seriousness, people sleep on this album and it's frankly irritating. Is the album naked Celtic Frost worship? Unquestionably. But the thing is, in 1995, Celtic Frost was a memory, and one that ended very very sourly. The one two Cleveland Steamer/Massachusetts Necktie of Into The Pandemonium and Cold Lake fucked up Tom Warrior's trajectory so much he couldn't recover for it for almost decades. But when they were on, you KNEW they were a cornerstone of black metal. Fenriz knew this too, which is why he felt the importance of paying tribute. Besides, it could very well be argued that Darkthrone's \"classic trilogy\" was all naked Bathory worship (particularly Under a Funeral Moon). Hell, it could be argued that's all of black metal. So Darkthrone switched from one idol to another. Nothing wrong with that as long as the results are good.\n\nAnd Panzerfaust's results are damn good. This is unquestionably classic black metal and why Darkthrone doesn't get more four album run credits is beyond me (well, five if you love and include Soulside Journey). Raw, cold, evil and primitive. With these four elements and nothing else, you have have classic black metal. Not too many soul piercing Quorthon solos, but again this is Celtic Frost worship, and most of Warrior's solos were a bit 2nd rate Slayer cat warbling. No skin off my back.\n\nHighlights include opener En Vind Av Sorg, which picks up right where Transilvanian Hunger left off; Triumphant Gleam which is where The Usurper raises its unholy head and doesn't stop glaring; and Quintessence, a blazing northern showstopper that leaves nothing but wintery plains and death for the end credits of Sno Og Granskog to play over.\n\nIf you love black metal, you owe it to yourself to get this. Buy it now!\n",
        "\nIf there ever was an album that represented the very essence of a musical genre, that's surely Darkthrone's \"Transilvanian Hunger\": fourty minutes of oppressive, unrelenting, evil and ice-cold Norwegian black metal, in its purest and most primitive form. Honestly it's not easy to describe by mere words the emotions that this milestone of extreme music is still capable to convey to the listener, even nowadays.\n\nIf you want to approach to old-school black metal, this is the perfect place to start from, and an obliged listen for any extreme metal fan. Transilvanian Hunger's recipe is simple yet effective: the lightspeed-fast tremolo picking of the riffs matches Fenriz's monotonous drumming, consisting in a gloomy soundscape of relentless blast beats, and the combination of the two makes the listener fall in an almost trance-like state. Add to the mix Nocturno Culto's ominous mid-low screams, season with a raw, extremely lo-fi production, that perfectly complements the general mood and the music, yet, at the same time, makes each and every instrument (even the bass!) breathe, and you have one of the genre's most renowned albums ever.\n\nObviously, an album would be nothing without a masterly songwriting, something that isn't missing from Transilvanian Hunger. The most beloved duo of Norwegian musicians of all times graces us with a ton of timeless and classic riffs, from the ice-cold opening title track, to the fantastic and frenzied \"Skald av Satans sol\", to the mystical and gloomy monotony of \"As Flittermice as Satans Spys\". There isn't a single weak track to be found, thus making the quality of the record rock-solid. The atmosphere of the album never lets up even for a second, and atmosphere is indeed one of the primary and most important requirements for a good black metal album, something that \"Transilvanian Hunger\" completely succeeds to attain.\n\nI can assure, from the first to the last minute, you will feel like your soul was being carried to the grim and icy nordlands, and at the end of the journey you will feel melancholic, yet at the same time in perfect communion with nature, in a sort of epiphany of your spirit. This is the magic of Transilvanian Hunger: offering an experience that trascends simple music, to become a real form of arcane poetry, capable of speaking directly to your soul. This is Darkthrone's magnum opus, don't miss it!\n",
        "\n18. In words: eighteen. Here we have Darkthrone's album no. 18 and this alone deserves respect. But even if we do not focus on sheer quantity, it cannot be denied that the unbreakable duo has become a unique unit. Sometimes acting like a chameleon, the band has delivered pretty different approaches throughout the years. \"Ravishing Grimness\" has nothing in common with \"Under a Funeral Moon\" and the overlap of \"Arctic Thunder\" and \"The Cult Is Alive\" is very small, to give just two examples. However, there is one detail that holds their excessive discography together. All albums reflect the spirit of metal and exactly this feature reappears on \"Old Star\". The musicians have come back to a six-songs-configuration and this small number makes each and every song all the more important. \n\nNevertheless, let's start with some words concerning the production. Of course, the times when Fenriz intended to present a sound as ugly as himself are long gone, and, to be honest, this was an impossible mission right from the start (little fiendishness). \"Old Star\" has the appearance a Darkthrone album should have in 2019. It sounds brute and dirty, vigorous and gapless. This makes it easy to enjoy the opener which bursts spontaneously out of the boxes and picks up the strong flow that made songs like \"Burial Bliss\" so irresistible. A less rapid part does not kill the strength of the opening lines which reappear at the end. A great entry, written by Nocturno Culto - and let's face the truth, it would have been great if he had contributed more than just three songs. Why? Well, Fenriz' tracks are weaker, at least in my humble opinion. Maybe he is confused by his own legendary consumption of metal and its different styles. Sometimes a clear line is missing, sometimes there are too many doom influences, sometimes I think they should have shortened his compositions in order to make them more currish and more compact. However, his passion for real metal shimmers through every note and therefore I want to make clear that I am not listening to tiring, lukewarm or insubstantial pieces. Perhaps Fenriz just wanted to give the heavyweight riffs enough space to present themselves in full glory. However, his stable tracks do not blow me away, although some Celtic Frost inspired sections are well implemented.\n\nGiven this situation, it is good to experience that guitarist Culto is on track. While the songs of his companion wallow in relatively slow or mid-paced rhythms, the dude with the over-dimensioned sunglasses has penned the casually titled \"Duke of Gloat\", another fast-paced attack with gripping, audacious guitar leads and a dramatic sequence after the first chorus. Here Darkthrone pay tribute to the old approach of the once groundbreaking Norwegian black metal scene. They do it in a nearly secret manner, but this section sends shivers down my spine. That's one of the reasons why this song and the opener are my favourite tunes, while the closer \"The Key Is Inside the Wall\" marks the best tune of Fenriz. It partly breaks out of the droning-riffs-meet-crude-lines-and-slow-drums-scheme and sounds less dotty without hiding the typical trademarks of the cult drummer.\n\nThe booklet is slightly disappointing. Unlike some of the previous booklets, it is free from funny, crazy or strange information. The only exception is the following statement: \"All work by Fenriz on this album is dedicated to the voice of J.D. Kimball (R.I.P.).\" What kind of omen is this? A battle cry, a warning of danger or a curse? Perhaps our friend from Kolbotn just had too many nightmares during the last months? I don't know, but one thing is certain: those who like honest, muscular and pretty autonomous music with influences from death, black, thrash, doom and traditional metal, should not hesitate to get their copy. \"Old Star\", a full-length that comes to the point directly, is something for them. In terms of quality, it is located between its two direct precursors and is not prone to obvious defects. And compared with many late works of other formations, Darkthrone's number 18 still spreads a very fresh aroma (combined with the rotten stench that this music necessarily carries with it). Nice cocktail.\n",
        "\nFrom the most superficial perspective possible the public conversation surrounding black metal today embodies the same stagnant ridicule the sub-genre has compelled from its inception. Imagery, symbolism, ideology, fidelity all still manage to enshrine the \u2018dangerous\u2019 reputation of a now very widely-splayed and milked genre of music. To the knowing fan, or the overt enthusiast, it is no more frightening than a high cholesterol count. Few bands have mirrored the absurdity of fearsome reaction and zealotry back upon the mainstream music world than Norwegian duo Darkthrone, who\u2019ve managed to serve as a vital and relevant entry point into the world of extreme metal for millions since the early 90\u2019s. Easy-going and often jocular as their presence has been for the last couple of decades the ability to reinvent themselves stylistically, and create massive waves of influence as they do it, is perhaps the most interesting takeaway from their now eighteen full-length sporting discography. Is \u2018Old Star\u2019 a majestic crown-jewel or yet another solid brick-built addition to their towering legacy? Uh, it ain\u2019t bad at all and whatever level of excitement folks will feel for it might depend on any set expectations.\n\nThere are numerous reinventions and a few (admittedly arbitrary) trilogies that allow for some distinction between the eighteen records I\u2019ve taken it upon myself to listen to in preparation for \u2018Old Star\u2019. We\u2019ve gotten one black/heavy metal album from the duo every 2-3 years since 2013 and that\u2019d be the most important reference point for Darkthrone\u2018s sound on this record. The second half of \u2018The Underground Resistance\u2019 (2013) took an ounce of epic heavy metal and made Celtic Frost sludginess out of it and much of \u2018Arctic Thunder\u2019 (2016) followed that thread but found ways to inject more of the bands own personality into their mix of doom, black metal, and what they\u2019d called \u2018slow thrash\u2019 at the time. It might sound reductive to link those two albums together in such a way, especially considering what a strong jolt of riff-driven 80\u2019s metal \u2018Arctic Thunder\u2019 was, but \u2018Old Star\u2019 more or less follows suit and builds upon their broader love of 80\u2019s heavy metal, doom metal and first wave black metal. Just as they\u2019d reached a final point of refinement between punk influenced black n\u2019 roll on \u2018Circle the Wagons\u2019 (2010) so now they appear with some mastery of the blackened heavy metal style that\u2019d kicked off since.\n\nIf it were any other band this\u2019d be an open-and-shut case in terms of comparative influences yet even when (drummer) Fenriz is absolutely clear what their influences were in terms of songwriting there is a three-dimensional shaping of \u2018Old Star\u2019 between songs penned separately and those written together. On one hand we\u2019re graced with Fenriz\u2018 own songs (\u201cHardship of the Scots\u201d, \u201cAlp Man\u201d, \u201cThe Key is Inside the Wall\u201d) which find him writing riffs that\u2019d appear straight from experimental doom n\u2019 thrash records from Sacrilege, Deathmass, and Dream Death (see: \u201cThe Key is Inside the Wall\u201d especially) as often as they pull from less transparent 80\u2019s heavy metal riff ideas. I\u2019ve always considered this style \u2018zombie thrash\u2019, a short-lived post-\u2018Hallows Victim\u2019/\u2019To Mega Therion\u2019 idea from the doom metal scene in Pennsylvania and Maryland that\u2019d died off right around the release of that first Penance album in the early 90\u2019s. On the other hand we have Nocturno Culto\u2018s parts which tend to have a bit more of a technical, non-linear mind with classic and modern black metal guitar techniques put under an \u201984 Celtic Frost microscope. The one point where I see something decidedly less ancient from Fenriz\u2018 hand is probably the black n\u2019 roll breaks in \u201cThe Key is Inside the Wall\u201d but the Kvelertak-esque riffs within could be considered a shot back to their own 2007-2010 era. Their common ground couldn\u2019t be less complicated but the style achieved between them is nigh impossible to replicate outside of the duo.\n\nThe \u2018beats\u2019 of the full listen create an even set of six full wavelengths, normalizing the experience of \u2018Old Star\u2019 into the naturally blended collaboration Darkthrone are known for. There are no incredibly mind-rending epic heavy metal highs as in the previous two records and the incorporation of doom metal pacing and riffs is the trade-off that\u2019ll likely divide the interest of fans. The lazy 80\u2019s arena rock riff that drives the first couple minutes of the first single \u201cThe Hardship of the Scots\u201d is clever in the sense that it is differently engaging than anything previous and has this twinge of \u2018Cold Lake\u2019 filling the space between the heavier Tom G. Warrior moments. The title track fuses early Trouble-esque riffs with what I\u2019d call slow motion \u2018Beyond the Wandering Moon\u2019 to a similar effect where the references feel pulled from taste but they\u2019re undoubtedly unified by the classic Frost feel that has been evident in Darkthrone\u2018s sound since 1992. Were I not such a dedicated fan of groups like Dream Death I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019d \u2018get\u2019 this jog-paced album enough to consider it a passable experience, much less a great one. Do I like it, then?\n\nLooking past 1991 is difficult for me with respect to this band\u2019s legacy because \u2018Soulside Journey\u2019 is absolutely one of my top ten favorite death metal albums of all time. Beyond that point, my own history with Darkthrone fandom hasn\u2019t been a major point of enthusiasm since roughly 1996 as anything beyond \u2018Panzerfaust\u2019 (1995) and the \u2018Goat Lord\u2019 (1996) rehearsal archive has been hit-or-miss. \u2018Sardonic Wrath\u2019 (2004) was a milestone that goes on underrated as it preceded a popular paradigm shift towards a (very influential) set of \u2018back to our roots\u2019 albums from the band which I\u2019d say peaked, again, with \u2018Circle the Wagons\u2019. From that point I\u2019m more in love with Darkthrone\u2018s taste in music, and their championing of classic heavy metal, than I am with their execution of those influences. I\u2019d certainly rated their last two albums just as high as can be expected with this one but I\u2019d never found myself pining for more Darkthrone over the last three years and in some respects Nocturno Culto\u2018s material and presence in Sarke (see: \u2018Viige Urh\u2019) is a more interesting and professional vision compared to \u2018Old Star\u2019. I wouldn\u2019t go as far as to say this style is redundant by way of a direct comparison but I\u2019d almost hoped for more of a shift away from the \u2018easier\u2019 realm of Celtic Frost influences rather than an application of gravity to the style of \u2018Arctic Thunder\u2019. Reductive as that might seem I don\u2019t see this as a low point in Darkthrone\u2018s discography, in fact it is an obvious peak in their exploration of black/heavy metal attuned to the paradoxical \u2018thrash-doom\u2019 hybrid. I\u2019d buy it simply because there aren\u2019t enough albums that provide that riffing tunnel-vision that \u2018Journey Into Mystery\u2019 brought back in the day.\n\nThe messaging is ultimately the right funnel for the experience and plain as day this is an album of riffs, textures, and skin-numbing doom/thrashers. I\u2019m not personally blown away by those riffs but I so appreciate the style of \u2018Old Star\u2019 that I can still give moderately high recommendation of it. It is at the very least a peak in songwriting that tends to happen with every second or third release where the duo have focused on a certain sound. Some greater stylistic goals had to have been met with this very slick and ruddy-edged mid-paced metal record and I\u2019m largely satisfied listening to it. Moderately high recommendation, much higher if you\u2019re an unusually enthused Dream Death fan. For preview I\u2019d recommend \u201cThe Key is Inside the Wall\u201d as the biggest standout for my own tastes and then take a sharp detour towards the sublime doom of \u201cThe Hardship of the Scots\u201d if you hadn\u2019t already worn the track out.\n\nAttribution: https://grizzlybutts.com/2019/06/08/darkthrone-old-star-2019-review/\n",
        "\nWhile Darkthrone's different 'phases' have cultivated individual audiences to themselves, some not too keen on the others, this is one band I've found enjoyable to follow wherever the wind would take them. From the frigid earnestness of their seminal death and black metal records through the nostalgia-tinged, often tongue-in-cheek side treks into punk, thrash, speed and heavy metal, they've always branded each album with their trademark personality, self awareness, and lyrics more clever than they might seem on the surface. I just don't feel as if they've ever failed me in this regard, and still get just as much pleasure listening through The Cult is Alive or Dark Thrones and Black Flags as I do A Blaze in the Northern Sky or Soulside Journey. In fact, I've long considered that they purposefully created their own counter-culture to the now-traditional necro black metal style they themselves were heavily influential upon, and I get a fat kick out of that.\n\nArctic Thunder stumbled for me a bit, not as a 'bad' record, but the first case in recorded memory where I felt some of the catchy nuances were missing, it didn't really string together the sort of personality that their earlier material thrived upon, with a lot of riffs that felt half-formed and just on the edge of catchiness without crossing it. Thankfully Old Star sets them right again, not a record bound for modern classic status, but a thoroughly consistent, enjoyable listen, especially at higher volumes, which sets out on a particular sonic path and then sticks the landing. While a lot of the initial reports and reactions I've read herald this as a 'return to form', meaning the band is back to its 90s black metal roots, I'm going to disagree there. Sure, you could place this back in around 1998 as a natural successor to Total Death and not sense that any major deviation to trajectory, but Old Star is heavily inspired by the classic heavy/doom metal riffing that they played around with on efforts like The Underground Resistance. Perhaps not quite so quirky or melodic, but it's given a more stolid and mighty countenance to create this huge, accessible sound. I'm not implying that you're about to hear Darkthrone cycling every half hour on your local corporate rock radio channel, but this one has a straight to the face, level production that many of its predecessors lack.\n\nEverything sounds phenomenal, from Fenriz' simple, effective rock and roll beats and fills, through the dominant rhythm guitar tone, to Nocturno Culto's timeless, broad rasps and the lowly hovering bass lines, hardly adventurous but giving the rest of the mix just enough weight. I'd point out \"The Hardship of the Scots\" as a poster child for the aesthetic blend here, almost entirely a heavy/doom style track which busts back out into the Norwegians' Hellhammer-inspired churning and bending throughout the bridge. Others like \"Duke of Gloat\" go the opposite route, more or less a pure 90s throwback Darkthrone cut but with that same, formidable production pounding you in the skull. It's also astonishing how the band can still take a set of fairly stock, predictable riff patterns and then somehow refresh them just by putting their own touch, production and vocal style on them, and then whoosh, I don't feel like I've heard them all a hundred times before, even when I have. That's one hell of a skill for a band not renowned for anything bordering on technicality or complexity. It's also one of the reasons they've long been high up on the short list of my favorite bands ever, and if Old Star is any evidence, that status isn't going to change for a very long time. \n\nLyrically the album continues the pattern of simplistic verses containing clever little subversions, all wrapped up into song titles that you HAVEN'T heard a hundred times before, primarily in English, as usual these days, but with a handful of Norse lines. Granted, a lot of folks will probably never read them, but while they are far from poetic wizards, the grisly-yet-thoughtful layman's appeal to their words is among the best in the entire scene. If Chadwick St. John's cover artwork seems familiar, it's because he uses a similar, gruesome, detailed pencil-like style that you might recall from Grafvitnir's Obeisance to a Witch Moon or Arckanum's \u00de\u00de\u00de\u00de\u00de\u00de\u00de\u00de\u00de\u00de\u00de. Great to see here and very fitting to the atmosphere of the six songs. Overall, Old Star is a step above Arctic Thunder and The Underground Resistance; the former because it left such a dry taste in my ears, and the latter because its handful of genius tracks are counterbalanced by some of its more muddled ideas. This isn't the first Darkthrone CD I'm going to grab off the rack, but it's very well constructed, gets a little better with each of the initial listens, and if you're down for a mix of, let's say Total Death and Circle the Wagons, then I think you'll be more than satisfied.\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nI suppose I'm in the minority of people that really covet the later-era Darkthrone - the more \u201cblack-n-roll\u201d stuff, that seems to be as basic as can be, seemingly uninspired and pedestrian, yet tangible and entertaining at the same time. It's also deemed a sort of classless regression for most of the ardent, elitist fans, of which I am surely a minuscule part of in theory and spirit. \n\nThere are, of course, happy exceptions. \n\nFor me, this is the very essence of what metal music - good metal music - should encompass. Not everything has to or should be intricate and / or overly evocative. Sometimes 'basic' is just about as good as it should be. The latest opus from Darkthrone, Old Star, subsists on a steady diet of repetitive riffs, familiar vocal patterns and brief moments of familiarity by way of generously recycled guitar parts circa 1980-83. All in all, it's a nice look back at a distant past that was, for all intents and purposes, leaps and bounds over today's run-of-the-mill musical efforts of similar ilk. Fenriz has always had a severely transparent penchant for all things NWOBHM and \u201cold school,\u201d so this (un)natural progression from death metal, to Norwegian black metal, to the current sound is not all that surprising. Truth told, he seems to have been more out of his personal element during those Under a Funeral Moon, Transylvanian Hunger and Blaze in the Northern Sky years. While those albums were groundbreaking and even good, I never was too sold on the band's black metal sound back when I first heard the band through tape trading in 1991. I thoroughly enjoyed Soulside Journey for both its impetuousness and 'green' feel throughout, but once the traditional / black-n-roll began creeping its way into the music on Dark Thrones and Black Flags I felt more at home with the band. I was among the sparse minions that found the last album, Arctic Thunder, more illuminating than musically offensive, but I digress. \n\nOld Star begins with a thundering riff in the opener, \u201cI Muffle Your Inner Choir,\u201d and from there it just keeps up the 'sing-song' pattern with slight variation mixed in for measure. I tend to personally gravitate towards music that holds me captive, and, more often than not, it's a solitary guitar riff that just holds me there, ala Burzum's trivial, yet enveloping \u201cLord of the Depths.\u201d Nocturno Culto and Fenriz still manage to call upon some familiar blackened sounds, ala \u201cDuke of Gloat,\u201d which is about as close to the old days as they're going to get with tremolo sweeping and some very Norse-forest-like feeling within. That guitar tone Culto employs certainly lends itself to a caustic, nostalgic aura that seems to fit right in with the overall mood of the record; such familiarity always helps when a band ventures off into another field of play. It seems to lessen the proverbial blow to the more \u201chardcore\u201d fans unable or unwilling to accept changes. That in place, a track like \u201cThe Key is Inside the Wall\u201d just screams out for a nod back to the days of Hellhammer, Celtic Frost or early Venom, with much emphasis on Frost's \"Morbid Tales\" era. I'm in the class that longs for that sound from the \u201cold days\u201d that seems to be becoming a 'thing' again these days, although most of it seriously lacks authenticity and passion. These guys in Darkthrone have never lacked either in their work; love it or hate it, they can never be accused of being inauthentic. \n\nIf you've come here to find something overly intoxicating or thought-provoking in Old Star you're more than likely going to be disappointed, but if you're a longtime study of the band as I am, you'll most likely enjoy and appreciate the growth, albeit a slower, less ethereal shedding of skin. Sometimes things from the past need to be razed to start anew from the ground up, and it's often more necessary than you might think. Old Star submits, for your listening enjoyment, a courteous nod to the forefathers that built this stable of music years before and left it for future men and women to cultivate and care for in their own good time and stead. \n\nIt's solid and that's all it really needs to entice you, nothing more and nothing less.\n\n(Originally written for www.Metalbite.com)\n",
        "\nAs it has become so incredibly influential, the importance of the album in hand can hardly be overrated in the history of black metal. \"Under A Funeral Moon\" by Darkthrone is, in effect, so revolutionary that its brilliance threatens to eclipse all the other blackness out there, worthy of your attention. There's no denying it anymore: its impact & repute have become truly overwhelming.\n\nPerhaps it doesn't have quite the same envergure as\u2014for instance\u2014Mayhem's \"De Mysteriis Dom. Sathanas\", Emperor's \"In The Nightside Eclipse\" or Satyricon's \"The Shadowthrone\". But still, many regard it as one of the paramount monuments of the black metal\u2011movement: none of the tracks are skippable and every single one has its own merits.\n\nWhat's more: it features some of the most chilling & iconic artwork ever to profanate the cover of a black metal\u2011record, representing a moonlit pale\u2011faced demon amidst the branches of a tree, evoking a looming black night in the cold of deep midwinter, in the spirit of Satan. How many black\u2011and\u2011white covers in suchlike minimalist style can't be found in today's black metal\u2011subculture?\n\nThe austere production values also emphasize this chilling coldness, by way of rendering the bass practically inaudible\u2014almost totally dissolving in the fuzzy background hiss. I find that immensely groundbreaking for this period in time. Moreover, those few times the bass line does come through the mix loud & clear \u2013 e.g.: shortly after the beginning of \"Summer Of The Diabolical Holocaust\" \u2013 it proves to be as effective as it's simple, chopping away in badass barbaric frenzy.\n\nIn the foreground Nocturno Culto is wreaking havoc\u2014as if possessed. His shrieks sound very raspy and are loaded with reverb. To give them an even more baleful feel they are interspersed with fiendish evil laughter & ominous unholy roars from the heinous mouth of hell itself. This extreme soundscape is topped off with the abyssal contrast between the ear\u2011piercing sharpness of the hi\u2011hats and the huge hollow thunder of the floor tom, that only bursts loose on scattered occasions.\n\nWhere \"A Blaze In The Northern Sky\"\u2014their previous effort\u2014still showed sparse riffs & structures reminiscent of the band's death metal\u2011origins, this is where Darkthrone's metamorphosis into a cold & uncompromising black metal\u2011beast was completed. But that doesn't mean in the least that the work presented here is anti\u2011musical or the product of bad musicians: it only means that the shrill harshness of the entire enterprise was never meant to please a large number of listeners.\n\nUncompromising is a fitting description for this, because the whole affair has a distinctly underground, nearly punkish vibe to it\u2014very much in the vein of the records France's Black Legions would come to release a few years further down the road.\n\nAs a matter of fact, according to Fenriz the main objective back in the day was a retrograde endeavour to revive the first wave of black metal, that had domineered the mid\u2011eighties under the banner of bands like Bathory, Celtic Frost and Hellhammer. As a result, these old school influences spice the primitive atmosphere throughout the full running time.\n\nThe standout song here has to be \"To Walk The Infernal Fields\". During the part that directly follows the spectacular transition \u2013 timespan: 04:12 \u279c 05:21 \u2013 the rhythm section wields a doomy yet emphatic pace, that sort of reminds of the violent midtempo harnessed on the song \"The Freezing Moon\" by the one and only true Mayhem.\n\nBut the album culminates in\u2014in what is in my opinion\u2014the most remarkable track on offer: the apocalyptic finale \"Crossing The Triangle Of Flames\" ; remarkable because of the for black metal unusually slow, massively pounding percussion, which blends in the uncanny ambiance of a gong sound effect as an outroductory rite, until\u2014at the very end\u2014the clanging chimes of doom fade away in the distance.\n",
        "\nThis album is a good example of the strength in metal being guitar riffs that you simply want to listen to over and over again... and how other aspects can be seriously lacking and yet forgiven by the listener. An example that comes to mind right now is early Metallica (say, KeA and RtL)... Lars isn't the best drummer and the drum production is seriously lacking (especially the low end, and sometimes the lack of actual utilization in the first place), and James's vocals can be kind of goofy, but the riffs are usually very good and ultimately you keep coming back for those.\n\n\"Ravishing Grimness\" falls in the same boat. To get the negatives out of the way... first of all, Fenriz gives us one lazy drum performance, and continues to subscribe to the confusing school of thought that the more difficult it is to hear the drum playing, the more necro or kvlt it is or... something. With the base album's production, most of these songs it would sound as if Fenriz is doing either (1) basic AC/DC bass-snare drum patterns that just really don't have a place in this kind of music, or (2) the most basic sort-of-fast (but not too fast) bass-snare \"thrash\" skank-beat, which was acceptable in first wave black metal, but is really out of place in 1999 when blast beats and double-bass galore is the black metal standard (not that black metal should be \"required\" to follow conventions, but still). Play around with your favorite EQ settings somewhat and boost the low frequencies, and, hey, it turns out that Fenriz is in fact laying down some respectable double-bass (but still very few blast beats, and you have to wonder why a drummer would be okay with being so quiet and unimportant in the mix... this isn't \"Black Sabbath Vol. 4\" in 1972 when people didn't know how to produce metal without drum clarity getting lost in the process). To be clear, the somewhat lazy and hidden drum performance isn't doing the album any favors from the outset. For the other negative, Nocturno Culto delivers a serviceable vocal effort in terms of the vocal sound itself, but the lyrics are pretty sparse, repeated sometimes frequently to make up for an otherwise lack of vocals, and are nowhere near the \"satanic poetry\" that I loved back on their first three black metal albums. I get the \"minimalist/depressed/angry\" vibe that they're going for with these lyrics (which continue on \"Plaguewielder\" and beyond) and I don't doubt NC's conviction in what he is delivering, but again, like the drums, this aspect doesn't do the album any particular favors...\n\n...however, in a macro sense these things end up not mattering too much. The riffs on this album are still mostly fantastic and very memorable. \"Lifeless\" and \"The Beast\" start things off on a sort of mediocre note (the former is the \"slowest\" song on the album and almost feels like a normal heavy metal song with black metal vocals for most of its runtime before the speed up at the end, and the latter is just kind of boring Hellhammer worship like some other reviewers have said), but after these, there are four songs of great riffs that are always netting repeated plays from this reviewer. The most animated song on the album might be \"To the Death (Under the King)\", perhaps a bit \"thrashy\" and headbangable for sure, with Fenriz showing some effort for once (and even some straight-up blast beats... maybe not very fast, but beggars can't be choosers), while \"The Claws of Time\" is a very melodic and depressing/melancholic song, those tremolo riffs just bleeding emotion and feeling. \"Across the Vacuum\" and the title track are similar to \"The Claws of Time\" with seven-minutes-plus running times and also somewhat melancholic feelings, but with their own atmospheres.\n\nIt's hard to emphasize how much I can recognize the simplicity/\"laziness\" of many of the lyrics and drum patterns, and yet still listen to any of the long tracks and just get lost in the riffs (repetitive in the right ways, and also varied enough at several quality riffs per song), or listen to the album closer and feel very satisfied. I would recommend you give this album a try (and hold on if the first two tracks are feeling somewhat lacking), and maybe bump up the low end if you can if you need convincing that Fenriz is in fact using the bass drums.\n",
        "\nToday Fenriz is the darling of the German magazine Deaf Forever, but 25 years ago, Darkthrone was banished. In the eyes of the media, the band was the synonym for useless anti-music with fascistic tendencies. For an ordinary metalhead like me, they were never darlings or fascists. I just enjoyed their music. Well, \"Panzerfaust\" is not able to challenge \"Transylvanian Hunger\", but it houses some decent compositions - and it reveals that Hellhammer / Celtic Frost were very influential for the Norwegians. The riff cascades of the mid-paced \"Triumphant Gleam\" takes the listener on a journey to the darkest niches of Switzerland and the droning guitars of the slow-moving \"The Hordes of Nebulah\" do the same. But the art of Tom Warrior and Martin Eric Ain (R.I.P.) did not totally dominate the record, even though \"Beholding the Throne of Might\" points in this direction, too. Darkthrone also were proud of their own roots. Therefore, the opener sounded like a second version of the title track of \"Transylvanian Hunger\". The riffing, the pattern, the length, everything is a little bit similar to the prominent predecessor. Just a little bit, of course, only as if they were identical twins, not more.\n\nThis time the back cover proclaims that the album offers \"True Norwegian Black Metal\" and this description fits much better than the nonsense of \"Norsk Arisk Whatever\". The booklet explains that \"Darkthrone is certainly not a Nazi-band\" and I am happy that my political correctness remains unpolluted. However, I would like to add \"and Darkthrone is certainly not a band that keeps a close eye on a clean production\". \"Panzerfaust\" sounds less strange than the totally absurd \"Under a Funeral Moon\", but the band still prefers a muddy and blurred mix. Nevertheless, it also possesses this misanthropic touch that suits the duo. Translate this sound into a picture and you get exactly the artwork of the album.\n\nThe most impressive track is \"Quintessence\". Co-written by Greifi Grishnakh, it reveals an enormous depth and an unholy suction effect. The nonsensical lyrics annoy only fools, but it cannot be said otherwise: they are nonsensical. \"Five million women so alone in the night\" and I would like to know who has counted them. The spiritual superego of Varg? The drunken alter ego of Fenriz? Or is this number just the result of a wet dream of Nocturno Culto? It doesn't matter. Everything is better than the \"Six Fat Women\" of Holy Moses. Either way, \"Quintessence\" leaves its long-lasting aroma due to its simple yet captivating riffing and the extremely charismatic vocals that express pain and pride, despair and battle-weariness. Too bad that a single killer does not make a great full-length. Panzerfaust suffers from the slightly boring tracks in the middle of the running order and, aggravating the situation, the closer has nothing in common with the usual tracks of the not-Nazi-band. An ambient piece with some spoken lines is not what I expect from a Darkthrone \"song\". Consequently, \"Panzerfaust\" confirms the proverb \"where there is light, there is also shadow\". Okay, Fenriz was probably of the opinion that too much light could damage his Nordic pallor, but I disagree, because the entire work stood and still stands in the shadow of its precursor.\n",
        "\nMany reviewers have described this as the beginning of Darkthrone's retro-revival-heavy-metal era. I disagree with that assessment, instead pointing to F.O.A.D. as the indicator of that shift. However, it must definitely be acknowledged that The Cult is Alive marks a clear turning point in the band's direction, regardless of the fact that this work is very much firmly planted in the classic era of Darkthrone. If this is only a crust-punk album as some claim, then it's surely one of the grimmest and \"blackest\" examples of crust-punk I've ever heard.\n\nNocturno Culto's guitar playing and riff writing honestly harkens back to the feeling of A Blaze in the Northern Sky and Under A Funeral Moon. Its tone in the production is crispy, cold, and scraping as hell, just like you'd expect, but there's a revived vigor to them on this record as well. What makes these riffs sound so fresh is the more complex rhythms that they play along with the drums. And this takes us to the drum parts, probably the single most different thing to be found on this album. Fenriz goes full punk and 1st-wave black metal in his drumming here. This combined with the more traditional tremolo, buzzing guitars by Nocturno layered above and you get a fascinatingly fresh approach to the Darkthrone feeling. Add to this that the drums sound way drier then they ever have, nearly approaching a \"tape demo\" feel, without the super lo-fi element of a old cassette. \n\nAlthough musically, Fenriz may have called this album in his interviews the beginning of a \"regression\", there's a real clarity to the production that definitely feels \"updated\" and appropriately contemporary. This is despite their claim to not do any mixing nor any \"turning of knobs\" once they record everything. If indeed they left the knobs at a random spot on the console, then fate did a good job at leaving them at the right spot because everything sounds just like it should. \n\nBesides the drums being so unique in the Darkthrone discography, we get a more old-school, even black-thrash approach to lyric writing. When listening to \"Atomic Coming\" one can see a nod to Sodom in the lyrics. \"Graveyard Slut\" also harkens back to Venom, Sodom, and even early death metal bands that sang of similar topics. Fenriz also sings on this track which comes as a great surprise, really delivering a deeper, more grunted and primitive style that adds so much power and creepiness to the track. \n\nMany consider their previous record, \"Sardonic Wrath\" to be the last black metal release and in a sense I understand where they're coming from because there is a strong continuity from Blaze in the Northern Sky to that album that cannot be denied. It's their consistency and purposely unchanging attitude that prevailed and made each release something you knew was going to be uncompromising black metal. However, crust-punk and heavy rock were always a part of Darkthrone's sound. This time around the band decides to focus in on this punk aspect to such a degree that in some ways it could be classified as crust-punk, but that would most likely fall short of recognizing this album's glory. It's incredibly fresh and different, yet also is totally recognizable as Darkthrone and real black metal. It breaks new ground while simultaneously regressing to a hateful primitiveness that is very palpable. In this sense this album achieves mastery. \n\nPerhaps one could argue that crust punk CAN BE black metal if done in this way, but then we'd be getting way too mired in genre arguments... Lets just say that The Cult is Alive is one of the band's darkest, grimmest, fucked-up, and hellish albums ever, regardless of its label. Other highlights would be \"The Cult of Goliath\" or \"Whiskey Funeral\", and \"Shut Up\" for a little comic relief.\n\nIf you listened to this once, or even a few times and turned it off because it wasn't satisfying your expectations, I recommend you go back and give this another chance, a real chance, and realize that just like \"Transylvanian Hunger\" this album is meant to be listened to alone, in the dark, somewhere where you can allow this to sink into your mind, and once it does, it'll never leave you. Post-apocalyptic Darkthrone at its finest.\n",
        "\nWhenever I think of great Darkthrone albums, outputs like \"Transylvanian Hunger\", \"The Cult Is Alive\" or \"Ravishing Grimness\" come to my mind. By contrast, I have never been a big fan of \"Circe the Wagons\". I cannot easily say what is missing on the 15th studio album of the well known duo. It holds two highlights, the opener and the title track, but the remaining material does not shine with an overdose of compositional brilliance.\n\nIn general, the album has more in common with its predecessor than with its successor. In other words, wide parts of \"Circle the Wagons\" deliver a metallic mishmash. Some black elements liaise with rather unorthodox vocals, mid-paced rhythms and relatively dense guitar do not result in aggressive songs. The tracks reach a solid level of density, but they lack outstanding riffs and a healthy dose of insanity. It seems as if Fenriz and Mr. Culto want to pay tribute to all of their old heroes and therefore we are listening to comparatively traditional songs which have taken a bath in the bathtub of this old bugbear called Lucifer. Coherent and pretty strict leads that shape the end of the title track remain more or less exceptional. Instead, quite powerless tunes gain the upper hand. I cannot identify clear structures and the songs just pass by, sometimes decent, sometimes faceless, sometimes suffering from the vocal performance. One can describe the vocals as individual, but one can also say that they are just grotesque. Don't try to sing professionally as long as you are much better in barking, nagging and screaming.\n\nAnother handicap is that the choruses do not really work. \"I Am the Working Class\", for instance, builds a bridge to some traditional punk bands in view of its simple, relatively melodic guitar leads. Love it or hate it, but the chorus of the song appears as the result of an accident. By the way, the riffing and drumming of this track lies not too far away from the title track and this form of double utilisation has never been a good idea. The fairly dull and somewhat uninspiring sound supports the feeling of uniformity. Yes, there are some aggressive, more belligerent parts on the album, but you have to search for the needle in the haystack if you want to find them. \n\nWhat was the intention behind \"Circle the Wagons\"? Did they plan to record just another Darkthrone album in order to be back? Unlikely. On the other hand, have they really been of the foolhardy opinion that the here presented compositions have the power to challenge their classics? Once again: unlikely. Darkthrone once stood for unbelievable misanthropy, for innovative ugliness and bestial sound experiences. \"Circle of Wagons\" avoids any form of extremes, if we ignore the fact that Darkthrone's music always sounds extreme for 98% of the world population. It is no coward full-length, but it also does not reflect spontaneity, inventiveness or the will to step out of the comfort zone. Fenriz delivers a list of must-have albums in the booklet where the perfect \"Protectors of the Lair\" (Griffin) is mentioned, but his own record is light years away from such a classic. This is a little bit disappointing, although there are no total flops on the album. But we know that the Norwegians can do it much better. Untouched potential is always a waste of resources. Guess it's time to listen to \"Hate Them\" or one of the albums I have mentioned in the first paragraph.\n",
        "\nDarkthrones\u00a0Panzerfaust\u00a0was one of the first black metal albums I listened too that had the heavy style riffing, mildly more produced guitars, and the\u00a0underproduced\u00a0vocals that are typical of raw black metal. This album is raw black metal at its finest. \u201cQuintessence\u201d drew me in with the unforgettable riff and the lyrics of pantheism, but the fast tremolos of \u201cHans sis vinter\u201d and the ridiculously simple but effective riff on \u201cHordes of Nebula\u201d is what kept me interested.\n\nThis album is really true black metal, Fenriz\u00a0talked about how he and Nocturno wanted to keep black metal a niche and closed in \u201cSlow and fucking heavy\u201d style of playing, which I think\u00a0is exemplified\u00a0on this album, without losing out on instrumentation or creativity. The drums are simple at points but offer some of the best\u00a0headbang-able\u00a0rhythms I\u2019ve heard out of the genre. As well as the long-held-note solos that ring with the riff in the back. Overall\u00a0the composition of\u00a0the music is simple, but effective. The vocal style fits it well, and is seemingly more tolerable (and distinguishable) than; say, Leviathan or\u00a0Xasthur; or their contemporaries, like\u00a0Burzum.\n\nThis album is powerful I think, it shows black metal at its roots. The heavy dissonant riffing and screamed, throaty vocals are all influencers in modern black metal. Similarly; the powerful overbearing volume and the typically simple drumming are all features on the album; which again,\u00a0is reciprocated\u00a0in modern black metal.\u00a0Definitely a major album for the genre, perhaps part of the holy trinity of\u00a0Darkthrone\u00a0albums as a fourth successor to the sound of\u00a0trve\u00a0kvlt\u00a0black metal.\n\nThere really isn\u2019t much else to say about the album. Its raw black metal at its finest and helped leave a mark on the genre like so many others from that time period. Great album.\n",
        "\nDarkthrone is the most productive unit of Norway and it is therefore forgivable that they did not only record masterpieces. \"Sardonic Wrath\" belongs to the efforts that remain on a more or less mediocre level. I don't think that many supporters of the duo say that the album from 2004 is their most favourite work. No song of \"Sardonic Wrath\" can challenge the real classics of the band.\n\nInstead of shooting some poisoned arrows, Darkthrone celebrate themselves. A lot of droning guitars shape many mid- or slow-paced parts and hail the duo's dogma of ugliness, but a comparatively great number of songs falls by the wayside. The pieces suffer from an insufficient flow, but fortunately there is an exception. \"Sjakk matt Jesu Krist\" has a pushing riff that generates a natural and dynamic form. The throaty vocals and up-tempo approach guarantee the desirable degree of vibrancy. No breathtaking number, but a pretty good one. \n\nDarkthrone have more good riffs in their luggage. \"Sacrificing to the God of Doubt\" starts with a riff that takes immediately possession of the listener, but it implodes after eighty seconds and a dragging section begins that has not much in common with my understanding of black metal. The riff from the beginning returns at the end of the song, but it is too late to heal the damage the middle section has caused. I still like \"Ravishing Grimness\" very much, because its songs have a very coherent flow. Here we have the exact opposite and that's not my cup of tea.\n\nSongs like \"Man tenker sitt\" present a more or less boring mid-tempo pattern. I miss fury, insanity and total dedication. The adequately produced album holds mainly tunes that are too fast to hypnotize and too slow to make my pulse race faster. Due to this situation, \"Sardonic Wrath\" is caught between two stools. In all fairness, Fenriz and Nocturno Culto did not record uninspired songs, but they forgot to define a clear direction. It feels good to listen to the straight, non-experimental and strong \"Hate Is the Law\", but this fast torpedo does not shape the album. It is rather an exotic ingredient. Perhaps the band wanted to set the focus on the power of mighty riffs. \"Alle gegen alle\" seems to indicate this intention. But this strategy failed, because the guitar works lacks inspiration. By the way, the same goes for the completely senseless intro - 150 seconds without any value. \n\nIt goes without saying that the album does not hold pure back metal. Elements of punk, doom and thrash also show up. Darkthrone work in their own niche and in view of their compositional skills, it is a pity that the result does not sound better, but they are not able to combine the different components to stringent songs. Already the first regular track suffers from average riffing and poorly executed tempo changes. Bad opener, bad album? This formula sounds easy, but don't jump to conclusions. After all, one can find some positive things here, but the longplayer remains an ambivalent experience that does not reflect the real power of Darkthrone.\n",
        "\nThe production? A sheer catastrophe. The music? Painful nonsense. The artwork? Which artwork? The album as a whole? Fantastic!\n\nIndeed, it belongs to the great mysteries of mankind that so many people are able to love this prime example of sonic ugliness. But the more a band pisses on commercial conventions, the more we can assume that the musicians have an artistic vision and the aim to mirror a part of their personalities. This is probably a very important aspect of art in general: the artist shows a part of herself or himself in order to give the audience the inspiration to seek for further insights. Well, I don't think that Fenriz or Nocturno Culto thought about such things when forging the explosive killer tracks for \"Transylvanian Hunger\" and this was probably the best they could do. Anyway, they created a milestone of cold hate, pure misanthropy and unleashed velocity. \n\nEach and every track is like a ferocious pursuit. Darkthrone hunt for the most repulsive appearance and they are, no doubt about it, successful. The vocals deliver nothing but snotty screaming, the guitars sound totally crude and create infernal leads that embody a mix of insanity and horror while the drummer is already insane and thrashes his kit constantly with full force. Repetitive lines are not forbidden, but they do not cause boredom, because this orgy of high speed leaves no time to pause. By the way, Darkthrone cannot completely suppress their musical skills and therefore the seemingly nonsensical structures reveal a surprising depth and more substance than I thought when listening to this exploration of the extremes for the first time. This is no half-baked snot, the songs follow - voluntary or not - a coherent pattern. But don't wait for comparatively \"epic\" numbers like \"To Walk the Infernal Fields\" from \"Under a Funeral Moon\", their first experiment in terms of a crude mix. This time Darkthrone focus on speed and they don't do things by halves.\n\nThe back cover heralds \"Norsk Arsik Black Metal\" and this cheap provocation fits the scheme. On the one hand, it shows that Darkthrone do not take care about the expectations of their business partners. On the other hand, it is aligned with the musical content: we are ugly, please f**k off. However, this slogan remains dubious, to say the least. But the entire full-length remains dubious, just think of the involvement of Greifi Grishnakh, another formidable expert in terms of \"Norsk Arisk\" matters. He wrote the culturally valuable lyrics for the second half of the album. Frankly speaking, a song title like \"As Flittermice as Satans Spys\" sounds like a persiflage to me. No doubt, this fourth album of Darkthrone belongs to the most polarizing works of the last century, but its influence on the scene cannot be denied. And even if this were not the case, the album definitely stands on its own feet. More independence is nearly impossible. \n\nDo I have something to criticise? Well, the ending of the second track is ridiculous, even the legendary fade-out of Sodom's \"Outbreak of Evil\" on their first EP sounded less amateurish. Maybe the entire song does not spread the massive amount of vileness that characterises the further pieces. Anyway, this is no big deal and therefore I would like to come back to \"In the Sign of Evil\", the first vinyl of Sodom. Perhaps there is a musical and spiritual connection between this EP and \"Transylvanian Hunger\", because both works spat in the face of the business. Darkthrone just took the next stage. I don't want to blame Tom Angelripper, but I think it is common sense that Sodom were non-experienced newcomers when it came to the recording of their debut. Therefore, their slightly crude result was more or less logical. By contrast, Darkthrone had already some albums under their belt, but they decided voluntarily to have this atypical, non-massive yet hateful sound. So it's up to you: lend an ear to the somersaulting opening title track and test its effect on you. If you don't like the first 15 seconds with its merciless guitar cascades and its rabid drumming, you will hate the album. But I say:\n\nThe production? Unique. The music? Wonderful. The artwork? Absolutely suitable. The album as a whole? A milestone.\n",
        "\nI\u2019m not really sure whether listening to Dark Thrones and Black Flags at a peaceable volume in an office setting is the best way to experience Darkthrone\u2019s music, though when one lives in China it becomes slightly difficult to find churches to burn, even if the bitterness of today could lead me to such lengths in order to keep warm. What I keep forgetting about latter-day Darkthrone (I\u2019ve got the endemic short-term memory loss caused by too much exposure to A Blaze in the Northern Sky) is that the Norwegian duo didn\u2019t lose a great deal of their darkness when they shed the Satanism and corpsepaint, certainly not sliding down the same slope into the black \u2018n\u2019 roll quarry with Satyricon. There\u2019s still as much in the way of ugly corners, \u201cwhat the fuck was that\u201d ambience, and streaks of yellow piss as the heyday of black metal offered up, maybe even more considering that they are now balancing those features against quirky humour, slower and simpler songs, and a non-deprecatory homage to \u201880s filth like Venom, Motorhead, and Hellhammer.\n\nPeople talk about crust in the same sentence as Darkthrone\u2019s late \u201800s output, though no one has ever asked whether Venom were a crust band and that\u2019s not just because of the timing of their first few albums. The sloppiness here is much more in vein with what Celtic Frost were doing in their early days, tossing in crawling grimy riffs that satisfy no criteria to call them doom, black, or heavy metal, Nocturno Culto all the while crunching away on his own throat like he\u2019s trying to dislodge a beetle from his lungs \u2013 something that he sadly never succeeds in doing, staying towards the rear of this recording for much of its duration. Perhaps it\u2019s that whole thing about the office setting above, but Dark Thrones and Black Flags doesn\u2019t get a great deal of joy from the production, establishing a guitar tone heavy on the treble and mids but with no great bass presence to back it up, nor much of clout from Fenriz\u2019s drums, which roll and pound about like he was recording from the naughty step outside the studio because he kept farting when the heating was turned on.\n\nThe combination of that sloppiness and the lo-fi tendencies of the sound only reinforces what we always knew about Darkthrone \u2013 that they are a defiantly underground band. However, that doesn\u2019t make it any easier to enjoy the music at a fairly low intensity, nothing jumping out of the sound to ambush the listener. Remembering how the occult speed metal rush of the title track from A Blaze\u2026 simply excoriated our ears back in 1992 makes me wonder what would have happened to the energetic riffing in \u2018Norway in September\u2019 if Darkthrone had really put their backs into it, while the filthy atmospheres of \u2018Grizzly Trade\u2019 and \u2018The Winds They Called the Dungeon Shaker\u2019 would benefit from that foulness actually occurring rather than just being described. It\u2019s a minor frustration that holds the album back from being both as nasty and as fun as the band tried to make it, leaving me feeling lukewarm and wishing to be drunker, so I could care less about the imperfections.\n\nWhat I suppose one must concede about the recent Darkthrone output, however, is that they aren\u2019t trying to make everything work all the time, but deliberately leaving some jagged pieces in both the songwriting and the production, as if in a bid to remind us of their credibility at every turn. The serrated nature of \u2018Launchpad to Nothingness\u2019 and \u2018Hiking Metal Punks\u2019 is just about offset by the fact that we now know Fenriz and Nocturno Culto to have tongues in cheeks at least part of the time, making it all the easier to smile at the minimal lyrics of the latter song (mostly just \u201cHiking metal punks \u2013 forever!\u201d and a verse in Norwegian), plus the description of going to a German gig (is that kvlt?) in \u2018Hanging Out in Haiger\u2019. There are some decent riffs to be enjoyed in several of the songs, particularly \u2018Norway in September\u2019, which is the most fleshed-out thing here, as well as the two closers, which stick to one purpose for their duration and end up easier to appreciate for it. On the other hand, an album under 40 minutes like this one doesn\u2019t have much space for throwaway numbers, leaving the mildly diverting instrumental title track and underwhelming (plus suddenly-curtailed) \u2018Blacksmith of the North\u2019 standing rather awkwardly in the midst of the others.\n\nAs one can see, my comments consist pretty evenly of complaints and grudging praise, though it is worth noting that most of the criticism is about areas that makes Dark Thrones and Black Flags a uniquely Darkthrone experience, even if the overall effect is rather similar to both F.O.A.D. and Circle the Wagons. There\u2019s no special reason why fans of the band would like this more than any of the other output, while there\u2019s also no insurmountable problems to enjoying it about as much as the aforementioned similar albums. All I would say on this score is that Dark Thrones and Black Flags certainly isn\u2019t Darkthrone\u2019s best, but it sees them continue on the journey of exploring what makes them an important band.\n",
        "\nFew things in life make you feel like children again. Terrified. Cold. Screaming. Behold the Dark Thrones of the Black Kings... \n\nThis is the ultimate black metal album; evil, cold, malicious and amazingly well put together. The only problem is it needs more cowbell. \n\nOpening up with a storm of guitar noise \"Natassja\" is a runaway killer of a song; a thrall's ode to his dead witch, the viseral emotions brought forth by Fenriz's lyrics are beautiful in the bleakest way. The guitar tone here completely redefines the phrase \"razor sharp guitars\", this is one of the best guitar tones you will ever hear (try Burzum's \"Burzum/Dunkelheit\", Saint Vitus'\" Zombie Hunger\" or Judas Priest's\" Victim of Changes\" [on vinyl] for examples). Production is poor, noisy and hissing (courtesy of Ted's bad copy of Vader's Necrolust which is also really cool), the treble is basically like a wasp and it's only added to by the stripped kit and primitive drumming patterns, 4/4 eat your heart out. The bass is deliberately buried but still absolutely vital as it is in all metal, Ted really holds it together well and performs effectively without going into trying to compete for attention like on an Atheist album for example. The whole idea is atmosphere, the rhythm section and production used solely to meet that goal; drawing focus to Ted's perfect rasps and ever present, deadly riffs. \n\nThere are so many cool riffs that I want to talk about every song but that isn't allowed so I'll give a quick count through of my favourites: Natassja's main, all of \"Infernal Fields\" and the title track, and the alien sounding bridge for \"Triangle\". The quintessential riffs however have to go to the Magnum Opus of Zephyrous and favourite Darkthrone track of both Fenriz and I: \"Inn I De Dype Skogens Favn\". This is the most primitive song on here and probably the most basic you can go before you get to bedroom black metal made by kids that don't know how to write or let alone read music. The whole thing is held together by TWO yes TWO riffs; the brooding, slow moving main riff, the fast change over that seems to spin in your head and was totally stolen from Hellhammer's \"Triumph of Death\" but is amazingly recycled here. I don't understand the hate; it's like an intro for itself that builds up slowly. The hi-hats tick and hell breaks loose with the THUMP of the floor tom that's been ignored for the whole album just for this moment, I must say to excellent effect. The Hellhammer rip off riff immediately follows with drums hammering wildly trying to deny the clever theft. Finally for the closing passage Fenriz brings back the riff crushing double floor tom idea used on the previous album to cover up death metal riffs. Except here this is a black metal riff and the double floor tom is used to ramp up the heaviness until your skull breaks. \n\nHighlights: most tracks of this record are hailed as some of the best black metal ever made, rightly so. A quick few examples include \"Under a Funeral Moon\" with it's raw, suicidal lyrics and grim tremolo really speaks to the depressive force in us all. \"Unholy Black Metal\"'s furious charge and hateful curses towards the christian menace, is perfect for playing to oneself whilst walking across a churchyard, giving a burning (no pun intended) desire to continue the work of Varg, Euro and crew. And \"Crossing the Triangle of Flames\" even for black metal this is weird and supremely dissonant; alienated, otherworldly harmonies surge throughout the lifeblood of this champion song of dismay. \n\n1993 is usually remembered as a terrible year for metal with hyper derivative nu and groove shite beginning to steam out the walls. However it is saved in part by this album, as proved by the sheer number of people that only turned up to Wacken 2004 to see Ted on stage with Satyricon playing just the title track of this record. The only bad thing about that performance was threat it had to be dedicated to the incredible Quorthon, who sadly passed away earlier that year.\n\nRest in Peace you Norse God of Music.\n",
        "\nI've gotten at least a half dozen queries over the last nine months as to why I hadn't reviewed Darkthrone's Arctic Thunder, as I've always been so adamant on covering the rest of the Norwegians' output in the past. The answer to that is I just haven't wanted to admit to myself, or in any kind of official capacity to the public, that one of my favorite bands in the world, who I've consistently lauded for decades, from the traditional sound they are best known for, to the constant subgenre-hopping of their more recent work, had finally released a record...that, well...I didn't really like. Now, previous to this, I would have touted their prior full-length The Underground Resistance as my least favorite of their studio efforts, but at least with that one, I can say I love half the songs entirely, and the other half just had a few flaws which marred them. Arctic Thunder, on the other hand, doesn't inspire me in the slightest...and it's taken me this long to really hash out why, to go back and give it those many chances to prove itself, to find out what I'd been 'missing', which is something rare in my listening. Oh, it happens, just not terribly often.\n\nNow, let me qualify that this is by no means a trainwreck of an album, and it possesses most of the hallmarks of what we come to expect from their sound. Simplistic songwriting, with 4-5 minute long songs, only a few riffs in each. Slightly more introspective interesting lyrics than you'd be expecting from your garden variety trad black metal, though nowhere near the band's most poignant, strange or whimsical. The production, while clean, is kept fairly raw, with the trashy but effective driving rock drums, the sincere but sinister guitar tones, and Nocturno Culto's unmistakable, potent rasping bark that is as fit as you've ever heard it, whether in short syllabic bursts or the more sustained growls that drift over the primacy of the riffing. Style-wise, we're no longer hearing some exploration into a new segment of traditional metal. No novelty speed, punk, thrash, doom, heavy metal, with the exception of how those niches' already intersect instrumentally or thematically, or how they've already appeared in the band's canon (the title track being a great example of this, with a heavy/black metal feel). This seems most intensively like a retrospective of the black and death roots the band was tugging at back in the early 90s, both as a warmup for their debut Soulside Journey and the raw, rustic black of their first few forays into that genre, then CHANNELED into the newer styles. The very narrow and minimalist range of chord progressions is highly reminiscent of stuff like Hellhammer, which so informed their earlier songwriting.\n\nIt looks inviting, with the dark woodland and sky, the fire crackling away, the logo displayed much as it was on Total Death, which once stood out for having the color artwork rather than the newsprint grimness. But this Arctic feels like it's populated by only the driest ice, the songs seem put together in the safest and least adventurous ways possible. It's not the first time I might have described one of their albums that way, mind you, but there was a particular darkness, novelty, and menace to older discs like Panzerfaust or Ravishing Grimness which immortalized them to my brain. Here, it seems like a couple of guys sitting around a campfire, dredging up memories of cutting room floor tunes that were a little too dull to incorporate on prior full-lengths, and then deciding to assemble them into one retrospective of work. All the pieces are functional, operate fluidly through the course of the disc, but just never manifest into truly worthwhile tracks. I often felt a little 'faked out', too, like in the tune \"Throw Me Through the Marshes\" where you get that cool, simple groove of the verse, but then it just never seemed as if it was capitalized on...the song doesn't effectively escalate beyond that point.\n\nI probably liked the style on \"Arctic Thunder\" and \"The Wyoming Distance\" the most, if mainly because I liked how that blackened epic heavy metal chugging bore the bulk of NC's vocals, giving it the sickest, coolest contrast, but even there it seemed like the bridge sections needed something more to them to make them more compelling. Most of the eight tracks seem like earnest attempts at 'one hook' wonders, but those solitary hooks are simply not memorable enough themselves to unlock that achievement. To me, it really did feel like these were all just sort of assembled from scraps of ideas that weren't strong enough to appear elsewhere, and rather than 40 minutes of killer, we get about 30 minutes of filler surrounding the few passable guitars, and the solid vocal performance. Granted, this is still Darkthrone, and that half-hour of median material is something I'd probably listen to over a whole range of other, lesser bands.\n\nAgain, this is no disaster. No Diabolicus in Musica. No Load. No Risk. I wouldn't describe it as weak or, even painfully average, but after a dozen attempts to go back and re-invest myself, I can't deny that it's my least favorite of their full-lengths, and unlikely to get a lot of playtime here even compared to Underground Resistance, Plaguewielder, or Goatlord, the albums I would have previously considered on the lower rungs of their studio catalog, which only goes to enforce how summarily smitten I am with the band, because I dig all of those. Arctic Thunder is probably just a fluke for me, a one-off, a record whose specifics just didn't gel with the entertainment center of my brain. Here's hoping...\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nDo you long for those old tapes of yourself jamming in the garage or basement and laying it all down with a cassette or perhaps even a poorly-implemented 4-track recorder? Are you such a purist that only the rehearsals will do, that every band has officially sold out after its first demo or album? Do you like to hear the roots of black metal with none of the frills, none of the polish, none of the studio wizardry it took to pull off some of the genre's most successful records? The Wind of 666 Black Hearts has a lot of this in mind, and Peaceville Records is banking that enough of you will find at least a collector's item out of these Darkthrone rehearsals over two 12\" records, priced reasonably enough as far as these bound-to-be collectibles are vomited out onto the market.\n\nThis is the majority of A Blaze in the Northern Sky and Under a Funeral Moon, or at least 10 of their 14 tracks, but in a cruder rehearsal form that lacks some of the frostbitten force you will have come to know from the studio incarnations. Raw, Hellhammer-spawned guitar lines moving at a moderate clip, back when that was their thing, back when they had switched out of death metal mode into a style that was quite new and fresh for the time, the same style that they would become royalty for over the ensuing decades. The guitars lack some of the coldness of the LPs, and the drums are even more tinny and crashy and amateurish, the vocals a paint-peeling rasp that appear less than you'll expect them to. Leads are an unwholesome mess. I did like that you could hear the bass, it gives the jamming a nice low end anchor and some contrast with the rawer rhythm tones, but on the whole I'd say that, at much as I love these songs on the albums, they seem a little less potent and atmospheric in this format, and I say that even as someone who is constantly dragging out such old demos and gladly ignoring their flaws in the name of nostalgia.\n\nOnly collectors and purists need apply here, especially if you want to hear the band with the lineup that included Dag and Zephyrous. This isn't just some dumpy compilation of pre-released album tracks being plucked at random and sold back to you, I'll grant it that, so there is some nostalgia in that it shows the band in the buff, at its most 'vulnerable'...as if these corpse-painted Scandinavian deviants could give a fuck about vulnerability. That said, I can think of no honest reason why I'd ever spin this over the 15+ good to great to perfect Darkthrone discs I've already got in my collection, all of which benefit from a better production and atmosphere. This is just such a sincere, raw band to begin with that an even more primal package like The Wind of 666 Black Hearts can't do it much justice, the songs lack that haunting and impressively defiant feel that I experienced when listening to them back in the dawn of the 90s, and it offers little more than history.\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nThis 7\" should prove a tempting little collector's item for those interested in it's B-side in particular, a cover of Celtic Frost's \"Visual Aggression\" which was recorded with the former Darkthrone members Dag Nilsen and Ivar Enger, before the band was rendered down to the two-piece formation we've so come to know and love. To my knowledge I don't think this has been released on anything before, not as a bonus track on any of the full-lengths, not even on the myriad of compilations, worthless or worthwhile, that the band's labels have ground out through the years. It's paired up here with a mildly rawer take on \"Burial Bliss\", a track from their latest full-length Arctic Thunder, which I have surprisingly not yet reviewed, though that will be remedied soon.\n\nSo I'll cover this in reverse...\"Visual Aggression\" is a rough track, but far more potent than you'd expect from the era in which it was released, more formidable than your average lost rehearsal track or cutting floor demo, and probably wouldn't have been out of place on their death metal-oriented debut Soulside Journey. Now, it's no secret that Hellhammer and early Celtic Frost were a huge influence upon the Norwegians, both their formative death metal era and A Blaze in the Northern Sky, which could be described as a frostbitten Hellhammer taken to extremes, so to that extent this version of it is played almost too closely to the original, with the only mild disparity coming through the vocals and the bulkier mix of the guitars; but it's a nifty little piece of history regardless of whether one is going to listen to it much with the original available, and nearly any of Darkthrone's more interesting and awesome original tunes.\n\nAs for \"Burial Bliss\", I have to admit that it's possible this is my preferred mix for the song, a pure barbaric mid-paced crusher which is aesthetically flush with \"Visual Aggression\", just a little more bloody and rough-edged than the one they settled on for the full-length. It's not an amazing piece in of itself, but travels at a workmanlike pace that likely pleased a lot of fans of the old Panzerfaust or Total Death era Darkthrone, grim as fuck with no surprise twists anywhere in its five minutes. In terms of being consistent, it's actually one of the better songs they could muster to partner up with the cover, so as a result the 7\" makes a lot of sense. That said, it's really not worth much if you're not in the market to collect...the cover doesn't justify itself beyond pure tribute, and the original, while a little harsher than on Arctic Thunder, is also not unique enough to go out of your way for. But if you collect everything they release, and yearn for those old, primitive days, it's borderline satisfactory.\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nI am almost sure that Fenriz and Nocturno Culto have sympathy for people with pretty dotty affinities, because they also revealed a very strange understanding of metal while recording \"Under a Funeral Moon\". This is neither good or bad per se, but it requires a closer look.\n\nOf course, it has long ceased to be a secret that the production of the album sucks. It's this kind of production that makes mainstream fans laugh compassionately. Admittedly, seen from an objective point of view, one can understand their reaction. Yet Darkthrone had developed their own ghastly philosophy of black metal and the earthy, flawed, raw and thin sound matched the context. Given this situation, it does not surprise that the barking, snarling and nagging vocals celebrate ugliness in all its facets and the buzz saw guitars torment the nerves of the audience. The quirky duo goes well beyond musical conventions and due to this uncompromising approach it is not difficult to understand why this album is widely deemed as a cult record. Yet this does not mean that the song material fulfils all wishes.\n\nOf course, the outstanding \"To Walk the Infernal Fields\" has an enormous impact. What a clever kind of paying tribute to one of the best tracks of Bathory. \"Enter the Eternal Fire\" comes to mind in a matter of seconds as soon as the first tones of Darkthrone's composition force their way. However, the song develops an own identity, although its main riff lies in close proximity to those of Bathory's masterpiece. It's a great number which almost reaches the phenomenal level of Quorthon's model example. The track has a similar pattern, it also opens the second half of the work in an epic manner and it slows down the speed significantly. And to be honest, this less rapid approach is more or less necessary after the first four songs. They impress with velocity and nastiness, but they do not deliver excellent riffs in abundance or many other outstanding musical feature. For example, the third track just rushes by and leaves me cold. More generally, these tunes are mainly furious, dirty and mean. A certain quantum of slower sequences, for example the middle part of \"Summer of the Diabolical Holocaust\", does not gain the upper hand.\n\nIn my humble opinion, the full-length must be understood as a kind of antithesis. I appreciate the album for its rebellious element and the idiosyncratic artwork, for its great title and its contribution to the last really exciting movement in the extreme metal scene, the Norwegian black metal riot. Yet I don't think that the music itself, actual the main component, is mind-blowing. Despite some pretty good pieces (opener, title track, closer), the compositions are just the necessary addition for the image Darkthrone wanted to create. Mission accomplished.\n",
        "\nTo many, the name Darkthrone evokes the sort of lo-fi Satanic witchery that only Norwegian black metal could achieve. They are almost singly associated with the \"true Norwegian black metal\" sound, and with good reason. But with their eleventh album, the band seems dedicated to challenging expectations.\n\nThe cult, indeed, is alive. But it sounds a little different this time around. The black metal shriek so well-known to genre fans is here in spades, as is the spiny shell of trebly guitars. But the blast beats of old have given way to D-beats, and the minor key tremolo picking is replaced with punk rock power chords. And though the crust punk influence here is nowhere near the level of later releases like F.O.A.D. or Dark Thrones & Black Flags, it comes as a welcome surprise after the less-than-stellar black metal drudgery of Sardonic Wrath, Hate Them and Plaguewielder.\n\nStrong opener \"The Cult of Goliath\" boldly demonstrates just how far from familiar territory the band is willing to stray. Speed metal-infused crust punk rages for two minutes, followed by a guitar solo introduced with a vicious howl of \"come on, you fuckers!\". It's the sort of thing that thrash bands call out during shows, yet Nocturno Culto's conviction is strong enough to make the rather absurd command sound convincing and well-placed. \n\nSome of this absurdity seems to be on purpose. Any Darkthrone fan knows that the band doesn't take themselves nearly as seriously as most of their musical peers, and on The Cult Is Alive, they revel in the joys of ridiculousness. The laughably-titled \"Graveyard Slut\" is almost like black metal's answer to the Misfits: catchy riffs behind lyrics whose combination of the spooky and the sleazy is gleefully obscene. \n\nOddly, despite the questionable lyrics and stylistic deviation, The Cult Is Alive is quintessentially Darkthrone. The riffs are strong enough to forgive weaker lyrical moments and propel greater ones skyward. Fenriz' manic drumming is somewhat tempered by the slower tempos, but he includes some tastefully overblown fills. On a fundamental level, the disc represents the primal minimalism that Darkthrone has always embodied, even when some of the flashier instrumentals betray the simplistic song structures.\n\nAnd within this lies the core of what makes Darkthrone work: even (or perhaps especially) when their impressive musicianship shows through the veneer of bare-bones heavy metal, it's obvious that they're having a hell of a lot of fun. If you're expecting a self-serious, corpse-painted album like Under a Funeral Moon you will be disappointed. But if you, like Fenriz and Culto, have a deep-seated love for heavy metal and punk rock, you'll find a lot of great songs and a whole lot of headbanging.\n",
        "\nA true institution of extreme metal, Darkthrone is one of those bands that never disappoints, at least to the vast majority of its fans. Not to the vast majority of metal fans though, and especially not those \u00fcber-conservative blackers who can't abide this kvlt band having non-black influences incorporated, still dreaming the Norwegian duo releases Transylvanian Hunger, Pt. II some day, and continue down that path forever. All this purity ideology reminds me of this orange-faced guy who wants only a certain type of people to live and prosper in the country he rules, a country which has been consistently developed and enriched by a vast variety of people of different backgrounds, nationalities, races, beliefs and other traits. In a similar way, extremist fans would like to build a wall around Darkthrone to keep all the outside influences at bay. Fortunately for the rest of us, Darkthrone has never been a band too concerned with what people expect of them, opting instead to compose and record whatever the fuck they want to, and sounding the way they want to sound. \n\nWhen I saw the classy cover for their (damn!) 16th studio album I was in fact expecting a sort of return to their blackened early years, even though I knew that sound would come with a twist. But like most of those who got fooled by the eye-candy of the dark, vintage photo on the cover, I found that Arctic Thunder is nothing more than a logical extension of their previous material, the solid 2013 The Underground Resistance. It's not the old school black metal found on A Blaze in the Northern Sky, though it definitely has its charm. But for instance, the record's opener, \u201cTundra Leech\u201d, has as much death/doom and trad metal as it has a corpsepainted taint, and most tracks actually recall early extreme metal a la Venom and early Bathory, though without the speed metal elements for the most part. Doomy, somber riffs are given a black coating, amidst a mid-paced march designed for mid-paced head-banging. Sometimes a slightly sped-up tempo might be used, but this is the exception rather than the norm.\n\nThe guitar tone is one of the most fulfilling aspects of the album. Not too raw, but dirty enough to make one think of black metal occasionally. The riffs are not particularly memorable I must say, but not bad either. The compositions are pretty straightforward, like the steady march of a battalion of tanks rolling over blasted, smokey plains after combat. Some changes in pace and a couple of variation in riffs keep them from becoming monotonous, but only marginally. There's also not a big emphasis on solos or melodies, but when they appear they're actually pretty good, just like the ending to \u201cBoreal Fiends\u201d. The bass is present, but takes a backseat to the guitars and the drums, which just have the perfect volume. The plates have also that half-crispy, half-raspy tone of the guitars, and complement the latter quite nicely. I particularly enjoy the simplicity and punchy drive of Fenris' drumming in the title-track itself, having a NWOHBM quality to them. That tune also has some of the catchiest riffs in the record, making it my favorite along with \u201cDeep Lake Trespass\u201d. As for Nocturno Culto's vocals, you know what you get; Norwegian guttural finesse, of course, still sounding like an undead version of the late and beloved Lemmy. \n\nEven though some songs enter one ear and exist the other without much lasting impact (not even some frosty leftover), like \u201cBurial Bliss\u201d or \u201cThrow Me Through the Marshes\u201d, Arctic Thunder is a decent addition to the Darkthrone lore. Not very thunderous nor arctic as its title and cover imply, but definitely has some of those characteristics appear from time to time, like distant fires on a scarcely populated prehistoric tundra. It is an album that can be enjoyed as a whole in one listen, like good records should, but independent songs can also be enjoyed on their own. It will appeal to most fans of the band, while it won't stir much of a reaction from other metalheads. If this is the first Darkthrone material you listen to and you happen to enjoy it, then I urge you to experience the rest of their discography. If you didn't like it, well, I also urge you to do the same, since these guys have given so much to metal and their back catalogue is varied and interesting throughout most of its stages. Darkthrone remains Darkthrone, and that's just it. \n\n\nOriginally written for Metal Recusants [metalrecusants.com]\n",
        "\nPanzerfaust is without a doubt one of Darkthrone's best works of black metal. It is somewhat of a departure from it's predecessor 'Transylvanian Hunger' although as Fenriz himself mentioned on the commentary track, there are certainly some ideas which remained from that album in tracks like 'En Vind Av Sorg'. However, it is clear that there was a much slower, more rhythmic approach taken to this record and there is a strong element of punk rock in play, especially in the drumming.\n\nThe vocals on this album are extremely raw and guttural, even more-so than on other releases. Some would perceive this as a negative but personally I loved these vocals and thought that they fitted the atmosphere of the album. I would say though that the vocals were turned up too high in the mix, drowning out the guitars at some points, but this was not a profound issue. There was an interesting spoken word song 'Sno Og Granskog (Utferd)' which had what I presume to be brass instruments (could've been a synthesizer preset though) playing in the background with Fenriz drumming atmospherically. It was different and refreshing at the end of the album but I'm glad that it was the only song of its kind on the record. The lyrics also worked very well on this album with plenty of biting Norwegian lyrics while I found myself laughing upon reading the English lyrics to the song 'Quintessance' which were unintentionally hilarious. For me at least, an excellent vocal performance by Nocturno.\n\nThe riffing on this album was brilliant at it's best and alright at it's worst. While there were several excellent melodic riffs on tracks like 'Hans Siste Vinter' and the aforementioned 'En Vind Av Sorg' as well as some brilliant rhythmic riffing on 'Quintessance' and 'The Hordes of Nebulah'. However, there were some more forgettable riffs on more punk songs like Triumphant Gleam. While they were by no means bad songs, they certainly weren't of very high quality. \n\nThe drumming was not the same continuous blast beat found on 'Transylvanian Hunger' but was much more rolled back and slow with some mid-paced punk-esque drumming as well as the occasional blast beat. Although for the most part it was \"just there\" there were some drum fills and even \"drum-centric\" passages in 'Sno Og Granskog'.\n\nOverall this album was very dark (duh), atmospheric, rhythmic and moody (with a very good guitar tone) with some mix-related issues. Best songs: 'En Vind Av Sorg', 'Hans Siste Vinter' and 'Quintessance'.\n\nAlso, apologies if this review is a bit shit as it is my first one.\n",
        "\nI'm not a black metal guy at all. I've just never been able to fully get into the genre like I have with my beloved death metal. Maybe it has to do with the division that early black metal and death metal bands had with each-other back in the day? I couldn't tell ya to be honest. However, one band that I've always thoroughly enjoyed is Darkthrone. Darkthrone were actually the first black metal band I heard. so maybe I just expected too much from the other bands of this genre? Because Darkthrone write these beautifully dark, cold, and absolutely raw sounding songs, while also not forgetting to not drag the song out longer than it needs to be. Or maybe it's the atmosphere they create? Who the hell cares right? BUT, that all changed with the release of 2007's Fuck Off And Die (Or F.O.A.D for you politically correct bastards). \n\nF.O.A.D is Darkthrone's first attempt at *gasps* changing their sound up?!?!?!?! Yes you fool! Gone is the cold, atmospheric, raw sound we've all grown to love and expect from dear ol' Nocturno Cult and Fenriz. Instead, we have a much more interesting combination of sounds found on this album. The best way to describe it is black metal meets speed metal. So basically, think Motorhead meets Venom meets Metallica, and that's what your in store for musically on this album. And wouldn't you know it, the boys pull this style of music off well. Don't worry, there's still plenty of black metal style to be found throughout this album, but it's more in the production and the overall atmosphere of the riffs being created, rather than the whole thing being a black metal album. (I'm gonna get crucified for saying this probably) but I like this style more than I do their later black metal material that ended up dominating most of their discography after Transylvanian Hunger. The title track is the best example of this. This song is a straight up Motorhead and Venom tribute, while also not forgetting to add their own sound. And I think that's what really made this album for me. Rather than become a joke band by doing this kind of music *cough* Evile *cough* Warbringer, the band instead use their influences to create something that's truly raw, dirty, and totally raw rock and roll. In fact, I'd label this album as more of a rock album than a black/speed metal album. Yes, Fenriz does bring the speed metal style to the table with his drumming, but it's more of a rock album because of the more groovy, mid-paced, and simplistic style of his drumming that is showcased throughout the album. Seriously, listen Splitkein Fever and try and tell me otherwise, I really want you to try and dissuade my opinion to the best of your abilities, it ain't gonna work. \n\nThe other positive I have towards this album is that Nocturno Cult and Fenriz sound as though they're genuinely having fun playing this kind of music. Yes, they've always had passion when creating music, but if you ask me, the band somewhat lost their energy and passion after Panzerfaust, because at that point, it seemed as though Darkthrone began to get a little TOO comfortable with the style of music they were playing. And for anyone who wants to argue with me about this, name one song aside from A Wind Of Sorrow, that's at least the one bit memorable, because to me, it all went downhill after that. Here, Darkthrone took a BIG risk by trading in their black metal style for the one found on here, and it paid of well. You can just feel the alcohol dripping from the speakers when you listen to these songs, and it really makes for a fun listen. Darkthrone clearly knew what sound they were looking for on this album, and they went for it, and for that I got nothing but respect. \n\nIn conclusion, Darkthrone's Fuck Off And Die is their best album in years, and for anyone looking for a good black/speed metal/straight up rock and roll album, I suggest giving this album a try. Drink a beer, smoke a joint, and crank this bad boy up! This is rock and roll in it's ugliest form.\n",
        "\n''Panzerfaust'' is quite a good album, with primitive and raw riffs, grim production and excellent songwriting, however there's one thing that holds it back from being truly amazing: The vocals. The first thing you'll notice is that Ted's vocals sound significantly different from other releases, and though some seem to like these vocals, I don't. Rather than doing the classic black metal shrieks, it simply sounds like he's drunkenly shouting, and it comes across as very lazy. And what makes it even worse, is the fact that the vocals are so predominant in the mix, so it's not easy to ignore how bad the vocals are.\n\nThat being said, ''Panzerfaust'' is quite the good album, apart from the vocals. Though there are traces from ''Transilvanian Hunger'', mainly seen on ''En Vind av Sorg'' and ''Hans Siste Vinter'', both excellent songs by the way, the riffs are very raw, stripped and simplistic. There's a very clear Celtic Frost influence (with a small hint of early Bathory). Most of the songs are quite slow paced, and sound nice and brutal. The songwriting is quite simplistic as well, as there's few riffs in each song, however this is made up for by each riff being great. \n\nThe production perfectly compliments the songwriting, as it is quite raw and cold. That isn't to say that it's hard to hear what's being played, however, as there's great clarity, and sounds similar to the production on ''Transilvanian Hunger''. ''Panzerfaust'' sounds a lot more aggressive than its predecessor, however. \n\nThough the material itself is quite good, it's sadly somewhat ruined by the vocals. I would only recommend ''Panzerfaust'' to those already familiar with black metal, as well as with Darkthrone's other work, and it can take some time to be able to appreciate the incredible songwriting.\n",
        "\nFor better or worse, Darkthrone have existed in a vacuum, at the very least since the time of The Cult is Alive and probably long before that as well. By that, I mean that they seem to be impervious to anything that's gone on outside their little bubble, nor does it appear like the outside world is influenced much at all but whatever they're doing. Darkthrone were always immune to weak trends and the opinions of others, but at this point, it truly feels like the \"scene\" doesn't even register. Where once they were cutting edge and out to provoke, the band has devolved (or developed?) into something more along the lines of a hobby project. What kind of tunes have Ted and Gylve been listening to these days? If you're not sure, just wait until they release an album, then all will be revealed.\n\nWhen you consider the kind of weight albums like A Blaze in the Northern Sky and Under a Funeral Moon had, and still have in black metal with their numberless clones, it is kind of remarkable to see them turn in on themselves. Depending on where my music taste has been at the time, I've ever respected or dismissed them for this. While I can say I'm again impressed by Darkthrone's thick authenticity as they return \"to their roots\" on Arctic Thunder, I also think people would be a lot less forgiving towards the generally unimaginative and amateurish material if it was literally any other band playing. Darkthrone have embraced this self-conscious \"fuck the scene\" mentality as a sort of armour. You could criticize them all you want, but it wouldn't mean anything. They're doing exactly the kind of music they want to make at this point in their lives, and to their credit, you can definitely hear that youthlike passion in almost every album they've made.\n\nArctic Thunder did come as a surprise. Even if it's scarcely different than the slower-marching black metal they did on Hate Them a decade ago, they had given every reason to believe that the Darkthrone name was now permanently dissociated from future black metal recordings. I suppose calling it \"black metal\" in the purest sense would be wrong; even if this is the closest they've gotten since Sardonic Wrath, you can still tell they've been listening to true heavy metal more often than not. The riffs are perfectly capable and plenty ballsy, proving that a passion for the classics is usually the most important thing involved in crafting heavy metal riffs. I'm most happy for the fact that Nocturno Culto's vocals are back in full, and they sound just as pissed off and aggressive here as they did on Panzerfaust. Even if Arctic Thunder comes across more or less as another Hate Them informed by all of the vintage 80s worship they've concocted since, they haven't lost their fire for their craft.\n\nI was left dry by \"Tundra Leach\" when I first heard it, and felt a lot more interested when I heard \"Boreal Fiends\". At worst or best though, you pretty much know exactly what you're getting with a new Darkthrone album. It doesn't have much in common with The Underground Resistance, but while this feels a league more authentic than the over-the-top heavy metal ham of that album, the riffs and songwriting aren't nearly as compelling. Don't get me wrong, I am glad that Darkthrone are back again; for the \"truer than true\" niche they occupy, there isn't anyone else to fill that void. I don't think I would be any better or worse off if Arctic Thunder hadn't happened. It is decent riffs and truth to form. I'm not surprised people were so excited when it first came out, and I'm not surprised that the excitement has all but vanished less than a month later.\n\nOriginally written for Heathen Harvest Periodical.\n",
        "\nEver since their creation already three decades ago, Darkthrone has been mastering the metal arts. From death metal to icy black metal and hardcore punk fueled heavy/thrash, Ted and Gylve always did what they wanted and it\u2019s never been anywhere near close to mediocrity. While we can go back to their classic trilogy for our black metal needs, I\u2019ve been loving their recent material a lot and I often listen to their underrated and somewhat overlooked mid-era period (Hate Them in particular). The point of this introduction is to say that their whole discography is fucking immaculate and that\u2019s a testament to both endurance and passion.\n\nAfter my immediate love affairs with Circle the Wagons and The Underground Resistance, I was really expecting Arctic Thunder to be incredible. Unfortunately, I was a bit skeptical at first, it just wasn\u2019t as good as I wanted to be. It seemed like a collection of good riffs without a cohesive feel or actual songs. I kept trying though as I knew the magic was there somewhere. The album was on constant rotation in December and January and turns out my understanding of it was waiting for me by the campfire. It was looking at the bright stars and the crisp flames wondering what I wasn\u2019t grasping. With a judgmental look on its immaterial face, the record pierced my soul and I finally understood it. \n\nThe main quality of Arctic Thunder is that it\u2019s metal down to its core. It\u2019s all about the riffs and it doesn\u2019t hide anything under a false sense of gimmicks, an overcooked production or flashy but sterile musicianship. The album is like a strong imperial India pale ale, it contains a looooot of hops and it fills you up to the brink. The amount of riffs it has is almost criminal. I do think that some songs could had been longer but the tightness and the contained attitude is what makes this record so great. It\u2019s epic by the strength of its riffs alone. The power of Nocturno\u2019s guitar is enough to elevate the entire thing to another level. Perfect metal guitar tone.\n\nDarkthrone doesn\u2019t care about fluff or unnecessary elements, it\u2019s riff after riff, thunderous drum beat after drum beat and bone shaking harsh vocals singing frosty anthems till you\u2019re dead. \n\nBOREAL FIENNNNNDS\n\nTo talk about the sound of this record, we need to talk about their evolution since their watershed album The Cult Is Alive. They\u2019ve been shedding their black metal skin since more than a decade while incorporating traditional metal elements (especially on their 2010 and 2013 records), punk, crust, D-beat or thrash metal. For this 2016 opus, it\u2019s like if they decided to go back in time yet again but to an alternate dimension. One where black metal is still an essential part of their sound but where they wouldn\u2019t have to leave their modern (read \u201cancient\u201d) influences aside.\n\nThey took the sound developed on their previous five full lengths, mixed things up, pushed the black metal aura to the front and just went for the jugular. The album, rich with mid-paced riffs is apt at mixing thrashy black with some old school proto doom/death (Fenriz mentioned Dream Death himself and Satan knows he knows his shit) and it\u2019s a lethal combination. Arctic Thunder brought back Darkthrone\u2019s black metal from the dead but when you mess with necromancy, the corpse of your ancient friend can come back... changed. In this case, it came back as evil as before, hungry, angry and with a curious interest for hiking and camping. \n\n\nNocturno handles almost all of the vocals on this record and it adds to the darker and murkier atmosphere they were going for. While I liked Fenriz\u2019s silly but insanely great clean vox (listen to TUR\u2019s \u201cValkyrie\u201d), it wouldn\u2019t had been a great fit here and like the old Norwegian wizards they are, they were wise enough not to include them here. Ted\u2019s vocals are awesome (that\u2019s not news for y\u2019all, I hope) and he shines on the opener \u201cTundra Leech\u201d. It made me want to sing the title while walking in the snowy roads of my city. \n\nTUNDRA LEEEEECH!\n\nThe quasi lo-fi production of Darkthrone has reached its peak here, I absolutely love the tone of the guitars and the drumming is both natural and loud without being overdone. The songwriting while highly condensed is all over the place and it\u2019s due to the riffs variation. They can channel Iron Maiden (check out the intense title track), their buddies of Aura Noir, Celtic Frost or even Sabbath without breaking a sweat. There\u2019s no much variation except for some slower tempos but it\u2019s not needed. Darkthrone doesn\u2019t do things for you, anyway. \n\nAll in all, Darkthrone is still proving that they\u2019re one of the best metal bands of all time by looking at the genre\u2019s extensive repertory and making it their own. Making relevancy an unknown concept, the Norwegian duo aims for excellence and memorability and they succeed at both. Arctic Thunder is timeless, precious and essential metal.\n\nMetantoine's Magickal Realm\n",
        "\nThere is a certain dependability that comes with a new Darkthrone album, because even when there is a big left turn in their stylistic direction, they always seem to find themselves in the same bleak and decrepit place. One might discount their auspiciously unsung debut masterwork Soulside Journey given its wildly more technical character and atmospheric keyboard usage, but even there the general picture of a frost-covered wasteland with a few dreary funeral pyres blazing in the distance tended to show through, at least in hindsight. Within this generally consistent context, there have been a few recent surprises to keep everyone guessing, be it the sudden shift towards a crust-punk sound on The Cult Is Alive and the foray into epic-tinged metal in the mold of Manilla Road just a couple years ago with The Underground Resistance, so expectations seemed to be that Arctic Thunder would present a few surprises of its own, and in a general sense that has occurred.\n\nThis album generally reflects the past-conscious heavy metal character that has tended to paint much of Darkthrone's work to varying extents in the past 10 years. The general flavor of things is of a somewhat doom-like mid-pace to moderate fast stride typical of a number of early 80s traditional metal outfits, with a character to the guitar work that is fairly reminiscent of Black Sabbath. However, the general aesthetic of this album's arrangement does point to a more blackened character relative to the last several albums, though this has been a bit over-emphasized by a lot of other who have given their assessment of it. There are some moments to be found here that are definitely reminiscent of Total Death and Ravishing Grimness, particularly the more flowing character of the guitar work on select sections of \"Inbred Vermin\" and \"Deep Lake Trespass\", and the vocals are more consistently garbled and harsh, but even these songs still have a clear post-Sardonic Wrath character to them.\n\nThough the ramifications of this conversion of older and newer are a bit difficult to describe as being either more innovative or derivative, the end result is something that is definitely different from both their recent and more distant past. Moreover, while the songwriting has still retained a fairly repetitive character in the same respect as most of their post-90s material, the ideas here tend to mirror the tendency of The Underground Resistance where they are good enough to bare the repetition. Particularly on the title song \"Arctic Thunder\" and \"The Wyoming Distance\", the slower paced grooving character finds a fine collection of concise riffs and driving beats that make for a memorable listen, with arguably the only liability being that the vocals are a fairly one-dimensional combination of blackened malice and Motorhead inspired grit. Even the extremely repetitive and more death/doom infused album opener \"Tundra Leach\" manages to hit a few sweet spots here and there while being among the more obvious throwbacks to the band's late 90s sound.\n\nIt's a foregone conclusion that one shouldn't expect to be hit with the same kind of low-fi mystique that painted this band's material prior to 1996, as if Fenriz and Nocturno's already longstanding lack of interest in retreading said territory hasn't been made clear ever since. Nevertheless, this album is probably the most conducive one to a fan of older school raw black metal than anything since the mid 2000s, and is of a higher quality grade than anything that followed Ravishing Grimness in said style. When a band has been going on for the better part of three decades and has put out 16 full length albums, revisiting the past to some extent becomes inevitable, but this is definitely not an exercise in dwelling upon it. Arctic Thunder may hit with an impact more in line with a distant clap of thunder rather than a direct strike to the body, but it gets the job done and displays yet again why Darkthrone is a band that changes more in spite of the times, rather than with them.\n",
        "\n\"Plaguewielder\" is an album that I always discover anew. On the one hand, this fact prevents that I am getting bored by this work. On the other hand, it mirrors the problem of the full-length, the lack of memorable parts. The successor of \"Ravishing Grimness\" follows the route of this album without reaching its high class completely. The excessively designed pieces are definitely not bad, they combine fierceness, high velocity and grimness. Nevertheless, the song formula remains a little bit dubious. It is always a good idea to listen to songs such as the sharp and rigorous \"Raining Murder\", but, as said before, they do not deliver catchy sections in abundance and this makes the situation a little bit difficult. (You say I am just too old for this kind of metal and it is all my fault? No chance!)\n\nDarkthrone were always able to create large-scaled songs. Just think of \"Transylvanian Hunger\", \"In the Shadow of the Horns\" or, to mention a recent example, \"Leave no Cross Unturned\". \"Ravishing Grimness\" (the album) also provided evidence in this context and some of the here presented tunes have a good flow as well. But I cannot say that the duo hits the bull's eye with each single number. Admittedly, the album starts in an interesting way. The opener \"Weakling Avenger\" is a hybrid of mid-tempo sections and faster parts, while the sound of the guitars combines sharpness, filth and coldness. These attributes describe the vocal performance of Nocturno Culto fittingly, too. Although this band invents itself again and again, the slightly morbid touch of the guitar lines can be deemed as the typical, pure sound of Darkthrone. This morbidity also shimmers through the inspiring \"Raining Murder\" and its breaks are intelligently executed as well. To cut a long story short, all tracks follow the same (interesting) pattern - with varying degrees of success.\n\nThe intensity of the unleashed sections of \"Command\" destroy any form of half-heartedness. Darkthrone reveal their grim side (without reaching the extraordinary level of misanthropy which characterised the three famous albums after their debut). Fenriz and Nocturno Culto rather present an adult form of negativity. It seems as if structure and traceability have become pretty important for the band. This approach does not prevent that \"Sin Origin\", the only composition of Fenriz on this album, falls short of expectations, but the remaining pieces are based on nasty leads that reflect the contempt of the duo. Okay, they should have shortened the closer, but redundant parts at the end of a full-length are a well known phenomenon, if my information is correct. Apart from this little weakness, \"Wreak\" holds some unrelenting guitars as well and does not fail to add value to the album. However, the most ambivalent detail of the album is, as mentioned at the beginning, that almost no part keeps sticking in my mind. Yet I guess there exists bigger problems in life.\n",
        "\nAfter spending the better part of a decade putting out crust punk releases and experimenting with forays into grimy pseudotraditional metal with The Underground Resistance, Darkthrone decided to return to the dark, gloomy landscape of black metal in 2016. Their first album in three years, Arctic Thunder is a return to form of sorts, even if it's far from a carbon copy of A Blaze in the Northern Sky. While perhaps not an essential part of this band's expansive discography, this release is a satisfying slab of Norwegian metal just different enough to have its own identity amid a legion of other Darkthrone releases.\n\nThe grittiness, spookiness, and cold malevolence of black metal is back, baby. While the sort of 'tude that exemplifies the original Norwegian scene is in place, the album doesn't deliver it the same way most of the movement\u2019s early masterpieces did. This time around, Darkthrone employs a style highly reminiscent of what Celtic Frost was doing in their Morbid Tales era. Arctic Thunder is devoid of blast beats and short on tremolo lines, delivering its atmosphere with slower riffs that burst at the seams with negativity and icy unfriendliness.\n\nDarkthrone slows down the pace quite a bit on most of this album and even in its fastest moments, it would still certainly lose a footrace with the tremolo marathons from earlier in the group\u2019s career. Don\u2019t let this lack of speed discourage you, though. Fenriz and Nocturno Culto are plenty capable of delivering the goods without a frantic pace. The guitars, with their murky tone and simple yet engaging riffs, and the supportive but not especially powerful drums come together to form an excellent background for Nocturno Culto\u2019s grimy half grunted, half shouted vocals. Though Arctic Thunder never intrudes on doom metal territory, there\u2019s a deliberate middling pace that works spectacularly well with the dark mood the album cultivates, lending many of the songs an aura that calls to mind a monster lurching towards you from behind, with the simplistic, but still malevolent lick that recurs throughout \u2018Boreal Fiends\u2019 and the entirety of the epically sinister \u2018Throw Me through the Marshes\u2019 being among this album\u2019s most superb examples of this.\n\nThe album does speed up occasionally and when it does, it sacrifices sinister atmospherics for roughshod, energetic bursts of fun. When the rollicking faster rhythms in \u2018Burial Bliss\u2019 and the otherwise unsubstantial 'Inbred Vermin' kick in, the album takes on an undeniably rockin\u2019 feel. This might sound like it would clash with the doomier offerings on the rest of the album but it doesn\u2019t. These occasional deviations provide a few much-needed breaks from the ambling pace and sinister vibe, always seeming to come in at the right times to provide a healthy dose of variety.\n\nThis isn\u2019t exactly what you\u2019re looking for if you\u2019re in the mood for a vicious black metal assault like Darkthrone so capably delivered in the band\u2019s golden age. That being said, this is a satisfying, evil-sounding album. Not nearly as timeless as dozens of other black metal releases you can surely name, Arctic Thunder is a work that brings the dread and the hatred with a much more calculated groove than anything else Darkthrone has done to date.\n",
        "\nExcuse me, I have a question. I have seen the promotion pictures of Darkthrone that were released with regard to the publication of \"Arctic Thunder\" - and they left me disturbed. Sir Fenriz and Mister Culto look exactly as they have already looked ten, fifteen or even more years ago, while I am just getting older day by day. How do they manage this natural challenge? It's simply unfair. By the way, does anybody know where my electric heating pad is?\n\nIt gets even better. Darkthrone's music also still has a certain amount of juvenile charm. An adolescent, snotty attitude constitutes the overarching element of the eight songs. Consequently, the production combines rigor and nastiness without flirting with modernity in any way. It meets the standard of the productions of the last Darkthrone albums on an equal footing. By contrast, the songs themselves cover a broader spectrum. For example, the rude opener salutes the listener with the droning riff of \"Quintessence\", while the second piece scores with the irresistible guitar flow that made the best tracks of \"Ravishing Grimness\" so fascinating. Finally, the filthy approach of songs like \"Graveyard Slut\" is still present and shapes the majority of the new tracks. Consequently, the smell of sweaty leather jackets is in my nose. \n\nYet this is not to say that each and every number works. \"Tundra Leech\" and, despite its lame fade-out, \"Burial Bliss\" show their teeth like a rather unfriendly bulldog, but what comes next? Neither \"Boreal Fiends\", which holds a very strange break that expresses the crude humour of the two musicians, nor \"Inbred Vermin\" have exciting riffs and dynamic or energy cannot be associated with these relatively uninspired tracks. In principle, fans of high velocity will need time to take this album into their heart. Open-mindedness is required. The pretty erratic duo does not put the focus on fast drum parts and rapid guitars. Darkthrone rather deliver more or less well-hung riffs without being interested in creating a new \"Transylvanian Hunger\". Of course, the metal community did not expect another collection of hyper-fast weapons, but from my point of view, the somehow withdrawn songs of \"Arctic Thunder\" neglect velocity and fierceness in a somewhat dubious manner. Think back to former curiosities such as \"Norway in September\", they also did not celebrate the harshest form of black metal. Yet this piece had a somewhat spooky atmosphere. In comparison, the new songs are left empty-handed.\n\nLeaving aside the details, something else is out of question: Darkthrone's integrity. The here presented music seems to be the perfect reflection of the black spots on the souls of the artists. This is one of the very few bands that really does not take the expectation of its fans into consideration. I don't know whether I really like this mindset, but one cannot deny that this speaks for the spiritual independence of the duo. Too bad that the music does not benefit from this approach. I have already mentioned the two lukewarm pieces of the album's first half, but the last three tracks also do not unleash a stormy breeze over the Norwegian fields. To call them faceless might be too strong, but they lack of intensity and hooks. In reverse this means that the casualty of the title track's riffs remains an isolated case. I hate to write it, but I cannot hide the fact that I am slightly disappointed. Where is the explosiveness of \"The Cult of Goliath\"? When did the fatal riffing of \"Dead Early\" die? Who stole the charm of \"Canadian Metal\"?\n\nAll in all, the seventeenth album delivers a very atmospheric, ingenious cover, but only three strong songs and far too many compositions of average quality. The album title is also slightly irritating, because the musical content is based on the mishmash of Darkthrone's numerous global, not only Scandinavian / Norwegian or \"Arctic\" influences. However, the most important thing here is exceptionally not the music. You know that I have started with a question; now I end with an urgent request. Fenriz or Nocturno, please send me your recipe for eternal youth! Thanks in advance.\n",
        "\nIf you\u2019ve been waiting for Darkthrone to make their triumphant return to black metal, it\u2019s time to give up. Fenriz has always said that he\u2019s the first one to leave the party when the nerds arrive. Spoiler Alert: the nerds have arrived to the black metal party and Darkthrone will never be going back to that party. Arctic Thunder goes further down the heavy metal tinged road that they began traveling down in 2006, but something is noticeably different this time. Gone are the fun-poking metal anthems like Raised On Rock from F.O.A.D., or the clean-vocal laden Valkyrie from The Underground Resistance. These songs are heavy, slow, and mean. If anything, this album may be considered a middle ground between the Hate Them and Circle The Wagons albums. \n\nFenriz and Nocturno Culto equally divided both songwriting and lyrics, and it is actually hard to tell them apart. Upon reading the album credits, I was able to nitpick and realize \u201cokay, that\u2019s a typical N. Culto riff here\u201d or a \u201cFenriz riff there\u201d, but I give them credit for writing a very fluid and uniform album. Nocturno Culto handles all of the vocals, but it is impossible not to notice Fenriz screaming the song title in Boreal Fiends. Performance wise, this may be the most interesting drumming Fenriz has done since he was a teenager. From the double bass sections in Boreal Fiends, the cymbal chokes and double bass in Inbred Vermin, and the cool hihat patterns in Throw Me Through The Marshes, he really put some extra effort into standing out more than usual.\n\nOverall, the biggest setback on the album is that there are filler riffs and moments present in just about every song. The songs move along nicely and flow well together, but at the sacrifice of Darkthrone choosing to simply color inside the lines. Missing is an anthem such as Too Old, Too Cold or Leave No Cross Unturned. A solid and respectable effort, but certainly room for improve. My suggestion is to bring back Fenriz on vocals! \n\n\nFavorite track: Throw Me Through The Marshes\n",
        "\nArctic Thunder is a *pretty good* Darkthrone record-- indeed, like most of what they've done this century IMO, though in a slightly different way than 2013's also-pretty-good Underground Resistance. It doesn't really sound like 2008's Dark Thrones & Black Flags, or 2005's Cult Is Alive either. Going further back, I consider 2003's Hate Them and its sister record Sardonic Wrath to be their last \"great\" records, and the new one definitely isn't as good as those.\n\nThat said, the Norwegian duo lay down a modest return to simplified, black metal aesthetics on Arctic Thunder, albeit filtered through their (seemingly undying) love of 80s heavy/speed metal. That absolutely *does not mean* they're playing anything like Transylvanian Hunger. No blast-beats or lo-fi atmosphere here. They're *almost* doing something Panzerfaust-esque, in throwing several influences into a blender, and brewing up a murky stew of Celtic Frost, Candlemass, and Mob Rules-era Black Sabbath-ized metal. However, what it TRULY means is that Arctic Thunder is a shade more blackened than their last few albums, and features a song or two that might not have sounded out of place on, say, 1999's Ravishing Grimness.\n\nFor fanboys like me, that's (pretty) good news. My favorite track is \"Burial Bliss\", which is easily the most straightforwardly \"black metal\" music Darkthrone have made since the 90s. And *straightforward* is the key word -- there's nothing particularly \"interesting\" about this track, but it surges forward with punky kinetics and a cutting, minimal riffing style this band perfected long ago. Doesn't hurt that Nocturno Culto is doing all the vocals, as even in middle-age, he sounds crusted-out and utterly no-bullshit. Could it be that Darkthrone are the true torch-bearers of the Motorhead ethos? I'm being serious here.\n\nI also like \"Boreal Fiends\" for its nuanced take on doom metal (by way of the Frost, of course). Starting with a clean riff is a neat change for this band, and though I wish they'd stop inserting 80s metal bridges into their songs, I could certainly enjoy more of these stylings in the future. See also the slightly less coherent, but nonetheless sinister take on doom in \"Throw Me Through the Marshes\". For that matter, check the lead track \"Tundra Leech\", which I initially found somewhat underwhelming -- but in true Darkthrone style, grew to like on repeated bludgeonings/listens.\n\nAnd then there are some other, less distinct songs. Are any of them bad? Not really. They just kind of pad out the record. Every Darkthrone album sans the absolute classics are like this. A lot of filler -- decent enough for fans -- but somewhat forgettable when all is said and done. Of course, your mileage may vary regarding what songs are good or filler-- but I doubt your percentage will. For what it's worth, I've already played Arctic Thunder more than either of their last couple of records, so if you're looking for a consumer-guide kind of review, go with that. Pretty good.\n",
        "\nDarkthrone is many things. They're aggressive. Primal. DIY. They're quintessentially black metal, and have been since their second album. But for everything that Darkthrone is, one thing they definitely aren't is predictable. They transitioned sharply from underground death metal to \"trve kvlt\" black metal in the span of one release, and switched just as sharply to crust punk inflected speed metal in the early 2000s. And when \"Tundra Leech\", the lead single from Arctic Thunder, was released, it came as yet another shock.\n\nIt's immediately apparent from the start of the song - track one on the record - that this album represents a shift back to black metal. Yet it's not the \"black metal\" that one may come to expect. Plodding blackened-doom riffs thunder along where blast beats and tremolo picked guitars may once have reigned, and thrash-inspired chord progressions keep the album from sounding like a Panzerfaust rehash. It's almost like an early '90s Burzum release, strained through an '80s thrash filter and given the primitive Darkthrone treatment. \n\nMost of the songs are slow. This might be a turn-off for many listeners, but it matches the lyrical content well and none of the songs drag on. The longest song doesn't even crack six minutes, but each still has the same claustrophobic, cold atmosphere as a ten-minute epic like \"Kathaarian Life Code\". Slow tempos also put the spotlight on Nocturno Culto's vocals, where previous albums drowned him out in trebly guitars and lightning-speed drums. His spotlight is well-deserved - it may well be his best vocal performance since Transilvanian Hunger.\n\nEschewing the traditional black metal shriek in favor of a mid-range snarl, Culto evokes the spirit of early death metal in a manner rather befitting of the songs. The vocal style might be out of fashion nowadays - a clear pitch can be discerned from many of his screams - but it feels new and refreshing in the context of music that is often singularly dominated by one technique. \n\nHis vocals match the lyrics, too. Fenriz, who penned the words to five of the eight songs on the record, seems hell-bent on keeping the lyrics as cold and grim as the Northern wasteland that his music evokes. It's clear here, as on most other Darkthrone releases, that English isn't his first language. But even when Culto howls about \"scepters\" instead of \"specters\", the ghostly image that Fenriz surely intended is still easily discerned. Many of the other songs discuss such \"kvlt\" topics as misanthropy and evil. \"The Wyoming Distance\" expresses this quite directly. Fenriz writes that he regrets that others pursue him when he'd wish to be alone, and somehow manages to elucidate (however vaguely) what in the hell a \"Wyoming distance\" might be.\n\nMany metal bands have tried and failed to return late in their careers to the styles where they cut their teeth. But Darkthrone looks to black metal of old with enough reverence to do it right. The result is one of the band's best albums in recent history, and likely one of their best altogether.\n",
        "\nFenriz is omnipresent in the German metal magazine \"Deaf Forever\", inter alia due to his special relationship with G\u00f6tz K\u00fchnemund. This crazy yet likable dude is probably the most popular German journalist in terms of heavy metal and so Fenriz has the possibility to play the clown. He does it successfully. But first and foremost, this kind of clowns may never forget to focus on their core competency. Our friend behind the drums and his partner in crime are fortunately aware of this situation and as a logical consequence, \"The Underground Resistance\" contains no overly theatrical moments. Instead, inadequate elements do not appear. Okay, some self-declared guardians of metallic morals will cry that the present status of Darkthrone has nothing in common with any type of underground. They will say that the album's title alone is a (bad) joke. However, when looking back on crude efforts such as \"Under a Funeral Moon\", Nocturno Culto and Fenriz have the right to proclaim the label \"underground\" for themselves. \n\nLeaving irrelevant things like the wording aside, \"The Underground Resistance\" reveals a more serious problem. Four songs - and despite its playtime of more than 40 minutes, the album houses only six tracks - do not distinguish themselves from the masses of solid black / speed / thrash whatever metal pieces. To put it more precisely, the riffing sounds neither boring nor excellent, effective structures do not show up, great choruses are missing. Although the production does not suffer from any major flaws, the tunes fail to cause a massive impact. Only the chorus of \"Valkyrie\" and the second half of the excessive \"Come Warfare, the Entire Doom\" attack insistently. But the expression of real fury is reserved for the magnum opus of this full-length. Of course, I am speaking of the finishing \"Leave No Cross Unturned\", which opens the massive gates to a greater dimension.\n\nAlready its vibrant riffing at the beginning, the straight verses and the concise chorus indicate the outstanding class of this song. Yet it needs more to shape a number of almost 14 minutes. Darkthrone have therefore realized dragging parts, an obvious Celtic Frost homage and dynamic solos, while lead vocalist Fenriz celebrates different styles in order to add the final touch. Although this mix of ingredients is exciting, the song appears neither progressive nor overloaded. Darkthrone have taken only a comparatively small number of different parts for the construction of this giant, but the result speaks for itself. No doubt, each and every other song of the here presented work pales beside the closer. By the way, it remains a mystery whether its playtime (13:49 minutes) is an allusion to 1349, the year when the pest came to Norway. Generally speaking, this was a terrible year for the inhabitants of the Scandinavian country - but, among other things, the constantly growing discography of our strange duo proves evidence that the ancestors of Fenriz and Nocturno Culto have survived this plague. With that said, \"Dead Early\", the name of the album's opener, does not really match the career or the physical condition of the two musicians. Nevertheless, this song is the only one which is not completely doomed to failure when being compared with \"Leave No Cross Unturned\". Its stoic riffing during the slow parts has a fatalistic touch and the high speed sequences leave scorched earth behind. Finally, the slightly desperate feeling of the comparatively slow riffs is perfectly aligned with the compressed yet precise lyrics. No doubt, the album shines with a strong beginning and an elephantine ending.\n\nFace the facts. When we take a look at the cold, clear and dark Norwegian sky, \"The Underground Resistance\" is not the brightest shining star that we discover. Yet Darkthrone stand their ground. Nobody expects that the sixteenth work of a band turns out to be its best album. One rather fears that such a long-standing formation runs out of ideas and offers more of the same, but in a lower quality. Exactly this is not the case. Darkthrone do not rest on their laurels. Their music still emanates a fresh and lively atmosphere. This is definitely not a matter of course after more than 25 years in the business. Moreover, the full-length from 2013 beats its two predecessors with great ease. Not only because of this performance enhancement, it is not hard to make the prediction that the aforementioned omnipresence of Fenriz will go on.\n",
        "\nGrowing sick and tired of the direction death metal was taking (polished sound, bright clothing, political and virtue-signalling lyrics), the Norwegian trio Darkthrone had a hateful fire burning up inside of them and violently crafted an evil, frozen piece of filth we know today as 'A Blaze in the Northern Sky'. After some resistance from their label (Peaceville) they finally managed to unleash this crucial phenomenon into the underground world of extreme metal. \n\nThe album begins with 'Kathaarian Life Code', possessing a desolate and threatening intro with demonic mutterings, mysterious chants and the slow beat of a drum. Already the listener is feeling hope escaping their body as if they're watching their blood pour down a plug hole. 'Kathaarian...' is a pretty good song to sum up the flavour of this album; none of the songs really sound that much alike yet they fit together so well which is not an easy thing to accomplish. Throughout the entire album we're met with raspy vocals incredibly delivered by Nocturno Culto. His vocals here aren't guttural yet not incredibly high pitched, just very hoarse, strong and harsh sounding. Most of the guitar riffs we encounter are of the death metal variety but are crushed and almost deformed by an overwhelming amount of nasty, waspy distortion which is one of the sonic hallmarks of second wave black metal and makes us feel lucky to have this violent creation taking form before us. The devilishly catchy 'In the Shadow of the Horns' stands out and is distinguished by its punkish guitar riff, harsh snare drum within a genuine rock beat. The only thing I don't like so much in this track are the celebrational mutterings before the actually lyrics begin as it kills the threatening atmosphere slightly (although I do enjoy this in their later albums). 'Paragon Belial' has some of my favourite riffs on the album, being that they sound so fucking eerie, strange and sickening. The best song on the album for me is 'Where Cold Winds Blow' by far the 'coldest' sounding song and I do believe we can hear pure black metal surfacing for Darkthrone here. We also rewarded with triumphant phases towards the end of the album with the title track, feeling rewarded after being skinned and raped by this unrelenting winter demon of an album; inducing the listener into a strange calmness. \n\nAs I said, the songs on this album fit together perfectly but keeps the listener on edge the entire time, thanks to the drum tempo changing around a lot and unusual riff patterns (typical death metal behaviour). This first installment of the 'unholy trinity' should be in the collection of extreme metal collectors everywhere.\n",
        "\nHaiger is a totally ordinary, sleepy village in Germany with less than 20.000 inhabitants. To hang out in this Hessian tundra is anything else but fun. But for eccentric guys who originate from countries with a rural character like, for example, Norway, Haiger is probably a kind of glittering metropolis. This might be one of the reasons why Darkthrone wrote a song about this place without any sights. Nevertheless, the song is as shitty as this village itself. Alarmingly weak riffs and crude vocals dominate, while a coherent structure is not visible. How fortunate that this insubstantial piece cannot be considered as representative for \"Dark Thrones and Black Flags\".\n\nThe vehement opener is also not a typical track, because Fenriz likes to play the black metal clown from Kolbotn. (I promise that I will vote for this lovely district as the next partner city of Haiger. Guess this would be the perfect combination.) Beware of his crooked style of singing during the chorus of \"The Winds They Called the Dungeon Shaker\". I do not know his intention, but he sounds like an owl that suffers from insomnia. Nevertheless, this kind of vocals is an outstanding and somehow likable feature, because it needs a certain courage to offer such a strange chorus line. Apart from this detail, the fast-paced opener shines with aggressive riffs, catchiness and coherence. Additionally, the rhythmic emphasis of \"The Winds\" and \"They Called\" lends the chorus a dynamic appearance. A good entry - for a more or less difficult album. No doubt, the fourteenth full-length confirms the old rule: where there is light, there is also shadow. Please allow me to avoid the cold shadow for the time being. \n\nAs indicated above, \"Dark Thrones and Black Flags\" is not overloaded with highlights. Apart from the opener, only \"Norway in September\" makes my blood run cold - of course, in the most pleasant way. Its title alone is very atmospheric and the sinister mid-paced tune spreads a magic aura as well. Stoic guitars are the driving force, a short soft break adds a melancholic note and the intensive ending completes the picture. Long instrumental sequences allow the listener's mind to wander, but the harsh vocal performance is also well done. Further tracks, for example \"Hiking Metal Punks\", are pretty decent due to their creaking guitars, the crude vocals and, in the event of the aforementioned song, the lively guitars at the end which create a fresh feeling.\n\nNevertheless, broad sections of the album remain a mystery to me. The instrumental title track, for instance, consists of nothing else but lame riffs. This number does not make any sense at all; pure enthusiasm sounds different. Tracks like \"Grizzy Trade\" or \"Launchpad to Nothingness\" do not leave an impact as well. Despite some fairly interesting guitar sounds, they begin somewhere, meander aimlessly and end somewhere else. As a result, the music of this album falls short of expectations and the rather undifferentiated, relatively powerless production also fails to take the full-length to the next level. That's a pity, because the stylish booklet, which is ornamented with a lot of atmospheric or funny pictures, would have deserved a better recording result. Anyway, the solid and comprehensibly designed \"Witch Ghetto\" closes this unspectacular work, which finds its place in the lower part of the middle ranges of Darkthrone's catalogue. Recommended exclusively for fanatic collectors - and maybe for every sleepyhead in Haiger.\n",
        "\n(originally published at valleyofsteel.net)\n\nSo I'm pretty sure that every single one of you is familiar with Darkthrone. Formed as a death metal band in Norway way back around the end of the 1980s, then transforming their sound soon after, becoming one of the most significant movers-and-shakers in terms of the Scandinavian black metal scene of the 90s; putting out over a dozen albums (not to mention countless demos, EPs, and compilations) since then, and consistently maintaining a core membership of multi-instrumentalists Gylve \"Fenriz\" Nagell and Ted \"Nocturno Culto\" Skjellum over nearly that whole span. The band responsible for some of the most essential, genre-defining releases in all of black metal, including Transilvanian Hunger, A Blaze in the Northern Sky, and Under a Funeral Moon. Sure, of course you already knew all of that.\n\nBut have you heard Darkthrone lately? For about the past decade, these guys have been back at Peaceville Records, which had been their home for their first four groundbreaking records in the early 90s. But this time around, they've been gradually drifting away from the signature sound that they helped forge, which went on to inspire entire legions (literally) of imitators; instead they've increasingly been sneaking in elements as varied as crust-punk, doom, and speed/traditional heavy metal. Which brings us to The Underground Resistance, their latest release (which was just a little over three years ago).\n\nThe six tracks here -- mostly in the four-to-five-minute range, with the exception of the last two -- bear very little resemblance whatsoever to the band's earlier material. For example, the introduction to the first song \"Dead Early\" has one guitar part that uses a fast alternate-picking style, but that's about as close to black metal as you're going to get; this soon turns into way more of a speed/NWOBHM-style galloping riff, while some time later incorporating more of a D-beat feel, creating an overall kind of thrash/punk/crossover vibe. The vocals here are sort of a gruff combination of grunting/growling -- certainly not \"clean\" by any standards -- but far more decipherable than your standard black metal fare.\n\nThis gruff vocal style is predominant in about half of the songs -- including the thrashy \"Lesser Men\" and the nearly nine-minute-long slow and heavy \"Come Warfare, the Entire Doom.\" In other places, though, is a cleaner -- more like traditional heavy metal or, more specifically, NWOBHM-ish -- vocal style: for example, \"Valkyrie\" whose song structure and drum fills are both highly reminiscent of Iron Maiden. But in my opinion, the highest points of the album come when both vocalists work in tandem: \"The Ones You Left Behind,\" another medium-paced Maidenesque gallop, features both in unison on its ultra-catchy chorus, almost sounding like these gentlemen are actually having fun with the material -- especially when one vocal part slips up to a super-high falsetto right in the middle of the song -- which makes it difficult to tell if they're genuinely paying tribute or playfully mocking cliches of the genre, but chances are it's actually a little of both.\n\nThe same could be said, to an even greater extent, of the final song \"Leave No Cross Unturned\" -- switching between fast and chuggy bits and some more intense riffing, sometimes employing straight-up NWOBHM soaring vocals and elsewhere a deeper style (that incidentally sounds a bit like Dr. Teeth), the song continues recycling sections of riffs and verses and choruses, getting more over-the-top as it goes along; later picking up speed, adding crazy guitar solos while the vocals continue to get more intentionally melodramatic as well. For fourteen whole minutes, every time it seems like it might be ending soon, they throw in one more iteration of one of the sections of riffs or another chorus -- finally leaving the whole thing feeling wonderfully ridiculous.\n",
        "\nAny discussion of Darkthrone at this point is essentially a veiled discussion of Ted and Gylve's music tastes. Even as a casual fan of their silly \"true\" metal era, it's puzzling to place The Underground Resistance is the same sentence as A Blaze in the Northern Sky or Under a Funeral Moon, let alone in the same discography. Even if the Darkthrone boys were more tongue-in-cheek about evil than some of the less enduring Second Wave bands, there was something about the classics that reeked of a serious, primal malevolence. It takes some kind of vision to craft a sound and have only a handful of your followers match up to par. Now, I get that half a lifetime has passed since then. Darkthrone would have burnt out if they hadn't treaded away from black metal. In fact, they almost did. Plaguewielder, Hate Them and Sardonic Wrath were far more redundant than any of the 80s cult worship Fenris and NC are up to these days. But when The Underground Resistance arguably sounds more tongue-in-cheek and kitschy than they ever have, I do begin to wonder about where they're headed.\n\nThe Underground Resistance completes the transition to full-on \"epic\" heavy metal Darkthrone alluded to on Circle the Wagons. This is the first time where clean vocals have dominated the proceedings on a Fenriz-affiliated project since the Isengard days, and you can believe they sound more like an overly enthused metal fan than a trained singer. On the quasi-crust albums, the meta references to the metal scene were coated in a curmudgeonly scorn for all they deemed false. With this one, I've got to agree with observations that this is easily the \"friendliest\" Darkthrone have ever sounded. All of this brings me to an interesting impasse. Relative to Darkthrone's roots, I'd say this is the first time where they've finally pushed things too far. Yet, judged by its own merits, it doesn't stop The Underground Resistance from being my most liked and listened-to album they've done since F.O.A.D.. Dropping all pretences about whether Darkthrone can or should be taken as serious artists-- well, who cares, most of the riffs are solid as heck, and the \"professional amateur\" quality to the vocals has a uniquely endearing charm.\n\nAlthough Darkthrone showed off their technical talents on Soulside Journey (only to hide them away for the rest of their career) it's refreshing in a certain light to hear them playing and recording with greater precision. While the shift of style is most apparent in the use of clean vocals, Darkthrone have probably ever been close to this sonic \"fullness\" on Hate Them, and even then, they didn't have the dynamic punch in the production. Considering how far they've treaded over the years, it's nonetheless impressive that they're still able to navigate without losing their authenticity. Even when they're playing riffs that sound drawn from the NWOBHM heyday (see: \"The Ones You Left Behind\") there's an enthusiasm here that makes you believe they were meant to make this sort of music. That is, provided you're able to forget the far-better work they've done in the past, but that's beside the point here.\n\nThe transition to heavy metal has worked out much better than the crust entry circa The Cult is Alive. There's a sense that Darkthrone are being guided on autopilot by the music they listened to as kids. I could mention the fact that they're now in their 40s, and that it might make a youthful mentality out of place for them at this point. That would be true, but Fenriz and Nocturno Culto have kept their enthusiasm for metal as bright as ever, and I don't know how they do it. I think anyone into this sort of music had a stage at some point where they were equal parts in love and obsessed with the music. For Darkthrone, that naive excitement never faded. Although Fenriz's attempts at operatic wailing is far from perfect, there's a sincere joy to his performance. It actually makes him more interesting to listen to than most conventionally gifted metal vocalists. \n\nThe Underground Resistance isn't a Darkthrone album so much as it is an enthusiastic celebration of the music they love. They're not putting up any images with this. Sure, I'd prefer to hear more albums in the classic vein, but I'd certainly rather listen to this than anything uninspired. These days, inspiration certainly isn't an area Ted and Gylve are lacking in. The album's first half is much stronger than the second-- I agree with the consensus that \"Leave No Cross Unturned\" is far too long for its own good-- but even keeping the less vibrant moments in mind, there are far more standout riffs here than I'd expect to hear from a heavy metal record on this side of the new millennium.\n",
        "\nDarkthrone's descent into \"true\" metal self-parody still hits me with mixed feelings. There are good arguments on both sides whether to support or condemn the recent years. Ted and Gylve have always gone wherever their hearts led, and if a band has made its reputation on apparently not caring worth the shit of an earthworm what the rest of the world thinks of them, who's to hold an unpopular style change against them? My heart will always be with the material they released up to and including the underrated Goatlord, a change of pace was necessary. The last truly worthwhile black metal album under the Darkthrone banner was Ravishing Grimness, and it was nearing a decade later before they finally made the shift. There's nothing close to an Under a Funeral Moon in these latter years, but it's the first time in years the band sound legitimately excited by what they're doing.\n\nOf course, such a change involved a transition phase. I would like to have heard that excitement on The Cult is Alive, but I didn't. It wasn't really until F.O.A.D. the following year where Darkthrone finally proved the worth of their quasi-crust shift. Should New Wave of Black Heavy Metal be considered as an extended transition after Cult? The EP was released only two months prior to F.O.A.D., and while the style's the same, the effect is like night and day between the two. Somehow even more haphazard than The Cult is Alive (and not in a good way), this rough collection of tracks only goes to prove what a revelation the next album would be.\n\nIt would be missing the point of any Darkthrone album to criticize it for being rough. Considering how much better the first two songs here sound in their F.O.A.D. versions however, it begs the question what is weaker here. The vocal performances are mixed poorly like on Panzerfaust, and while there's a naive sincerity to the performances on the best crust-era material, the vocals here sound like they're in on the joke. \"Hedninger fra Helvete\" is a decent track exclusive to NWOBHM, and could have fit on NWOBHM easily enough, if that's any compliment. It's probably a bad sign that the most exciting track here is a cover. Darkthrone take the Testors' punk rock screecher \"Bad Attitude\" and sound like they're having more fun with it than any of the three originals.\n\nTo its credit, at least NWOBHM gave Darkthrone's new sound a cute name.\n",
        "\nA lot reviews have already been written for this album. From an objective point of view, its importance for the evolution of the Norwegian black metal scene cannot be denied. But I want to give a voice to the (minority of) black metal fans that do not appreciate this monument of the genre very much. Compared with other widely respected outputs from Norway such as \"De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas\", \"In the Nightside Eclipse\" or \"Det som engang var\", the first black metal record of Darkthrone falls by the wayside, at least in my humble opinion. The song-writing skills were not yet fully developed. The effect was that the excessive, not to say overlong tracks did not possess the necessary amount of fascinating parts. No doubt, the cold sound, the rawness of the guitars and the uncompromising attitude provided evidence to a certain degree that Darkthrone were able to realize their musical vision. But the music itself failed to have an affect on me.\n\nThe seemingly endless opener is just boring. Dragging rhythms are sandwiched by fast parts at the beginning and the end of \"Kathaarian Life Code\". In particular the slow-moving section seems to be infinite. It's not the greatest shit one has heard in ages, it's just too much music for too little ideas. To put it in positive terms, already this song makes clear that Darkthrone don't want to be loved by millions. Inter alia the ugly breaks of \"Paragon Belial\" with their nerve-shattering guitar squealing underline this statement. Anyway, the album is characterized by long sections, sometimes slow, sometimes fast, that have one thing in common: neither the guitars nor the drums set surprising or even intriguing impulses. Aggravating this situation, the ugliness of the sound is not accompanied by diabolic elements. \"A Blaze in the Northern Sky\" can be described as extremely raw and hostile, but the hellish aura of Mayhem's or Emperor's classics is missing. Neither occult or mystical elements shape the here presented full-length.\n\nThis does not mean that the album completely fails to evoke emotions. The lead vocals don't lack of insanity and gruesomeness, but honestly speaking, they cannot win in view of the mediocre music. Two things are true: back in the early nineties, the album itself was anything else but predictable, but as soon as you have understood the formula of Darkthrone, each and every song suffers from a lack of unexpected details. This alone would not be a great problem, but the brutal yet mostly prosy riffing as well as the noisy \"I show you how sick it can sound\" solos add insult to injury. And the production? Of course, it's a statement that says: we are Darkthrone and you suck. But from an objective point of view, the full-length sounds like the recording of a rehearsal. Seems as if I suck.\n\nFinally, I don't want to hide the fact that the courage of Darkthrone was admirable. Of course, a record company is naturally interested in commercially usable products and to present the guys of Peaceville such a rude piece of noise was anything else but a matter of course. That was really a casual action of the Norwegians. Another good idea was the creation of \"In the Shadow of the Horns\". This track marked the first successful composition of Darkthrone. As we all know, dozens of blistering songs followed. However, the opening riff is truly merciless and the song develops in a coherent way. But overall, this average work fails to impress due to musical reasons. Anyway, it has become an icon of the then uprising scene, whether I like it or not.\n",
        "\nIt is madness to think that Circle the Wagons was Darkthrone's fifteenth album. Through thick and thin, they've been releasing albums at a relatively steady rate, never losing sight of the DIY mentality they've sported since adolescence. A lot of the albums they released between Circle the Wagons and their widely acknowledged golden period weren't all that great. A few were downright mediocre. At the end of the day though, Darkthrone were the ones left standing.\n\nNot a review of Darkthrone's more recent material could spare mention of the band's propitious shift from black metal to a crust-infused traditional metal blend, one parts Motorhead, three parts Celtic Frost and Hellhammer, and two parts sizzling grease and faded denim. I'm a stronger follower of black metal than any of the genres they've drawn from recently, but I definitely count myself among those who support Darkthrone's transition into distilled true metal wholeheartedly. They got lazy with black metal. The crusty authenticity was the spark they needed to revive the passion and creativity. Ironically, in making albums that are essentially shameless rip-offs of their classic metal influences, they inadvertently began to make more distinctive and colourful albums than they had done in several years at last.\n\nListening to Circle the Wagons, I'm slightly amazed that Darkthrone are able to stick to the same old-school aesthetic and show artistic progress without compromising a cent of it. While their major turnaround F.O.A.D. still arguably reigns as the most significant record they've done since the glory days, Circle the Wagons is about as much fun, and easily more impressive from a more technical perspective. Even if the stylistic advancements aren't as bold as they were on past albums, Circle the Wagons tends to one area I felt Darkthrone struggled with on past albums. I'm referring to the songwriting here. While I'd consider myself lucky to find three songs memorable on one of the last several albums, this album's weighted heavy metal influence has been instrumental in helping them carve out more memorable tunes.\n\nCircle the Wagons doesn't have the same soft spot in my heart that F.O.A.D. will always claim, but it's easily more listenable, tight, and mature in a good way. While Darkthrone's past three records sounded like a sincerely felt parody (and I say that as a fan of at least two of them) I do get the impression they tried to make Circle the Wagons a more serious, hard-hitting sort of metal record. The condemnations of posers and \"plastic metal\" are still rife and common, but Fenriz and Nocturno Culto wisely put the jokes on the back burner. Not that jokes are a bad thing per se-- Fenriz's one of the funniest dudes in music after all-- but when it got to the point where it felt like Darkthrone weren't just a parody, but a parody of a parody of themselves, it was probably a good idea to reel in the silly.\n\nCircle the Wagons is every bit as fun as its predecessors, so don't go mistaking maturity for boredom. The self-conscious references to the band's legacy and the state of modern metal are hard to take seriously, but the rest of the lyrics bolster the music in a way that fits the aesthetic they already had. The subject matter for \"Circle the Wagons\" always reminds me of Iron Maiden's \"Run to the Hills\", and I'm sure I'm not the only one. Heavy metal's always been big into subjects like that. The hardest hitting material are the personal reflections however. \"I Am the Working Class\" technically fits precisely with the band's greasy sound, but it's not like the lyrics are made up or embellished. Music isn't the thing that's kept Fenriz's belly full after all. I thought Darkthrone sounded sincere when they were barking about hailing the Church of Real Metal and other ridiculous shit. Just imagine the kind of authenticity that runs behind lyrics about work and the economic recession. Fuck.\n\nDarkthrone's music got a bit more interesting on Circle the Wagons. The riffs are way more intricate than they were on Dark Thrones and Black Flags, and the more consistent fast pace of the album keeps any of the songs from dragging on. Of course, this is still post-golden Darkthrone we're talking about. They're obviously reliable when it comes to good riffs and raw atmosphere, but they're not the sort of band you should be listening to if you want anything other than a straightforward, greasy, beer-friendly half-hour ahead of you. For what it's worth, Circle the Wagons was the most musical these guys had sounded since Ravishing Grimness 11 years prior.\n",
        "\nIn one of so many ways, Dark Thrones and Black Flags continues the tradition of F.O.A.D. by opening things up with one of Darkthrone's best ever songs. \"These Shores Are Damned\" felt like the legendary pair had thrown all of their inspiration into writing a truly classic tune 15 years past their golden years, and I think the same applies to \"The Winds They Called the Dungeon Shaker\". As much as I appreciate Darkthrone, it's easy to take their basic riff format for granted, so when they don the daddy pants for even slightly nuanced songwriting, I'm quickly amazed by what they're capable of. I'm serious; if these guys wrote an album of songs as consistently fiendish and engaging as the opener for this one, they'd have a masterpiece on par with A Blaze in the Northern Sky or any of their other classics.\n\nGenerally speaking, Dark Thrones and Black Flags shows Darkthrone settling into the crusty true metal hybrid they introduced on The Cult is Alive and perfected (within reasonable expectations) on F.O.A.D.. Almost ten years on, and the debate still rages over the more recent turn in Darkthrone's career. Was their black metal style more majestic? Sure, but I'll never understand the segment of their fanbase who would have preferred more black metal mediocrity over hearing the guys play music that actually renewed their inspiration. While F.O.A.D. was a moment of refreshing affirmation for me as a self-proclaimed fan of these guys, Dark Thrones and Black Flags essentially does more of the same as its predecessor, burrowing Darkthrone's sound deeper into their concoction of all things traditional and greasy. It's a step down from the rush of the album before it, but like F.O.A.D., there's a lot of no-bullshit fun to be had.\n\nMy first theory why Dark Thrones and Black Flags wasn't hitting me as hard was the fact that F.O.A.D. had beaten it to the chase in most respects. While there's probably some truth in that, I don't think an homage to the greats of heavy, punk and speed need be qualified based on its originality or lack thereof. Really, the quality to a post-classic Darkthrone album is dependent on how passionate they felt when they were making it. Fenriz's work exhaustion resulted in a less solid album on Total Death for example; the same applies to depression and the lacklustre result on Plaguewielder. For whatever reason, these guys started hitting hard again with these ones. I think you can hear the authenticity in what they're doing here. Although the style they're playing is best seen as an amalgam of sounds (it's not a crust album as some say) the music is just as straightforward and basic as ever. Unsurprisingly, the performance hits as hard as I could have expected. Nocturno Culto's vocals only seem to get better with age, and the drums and guitars continue to uphold the \"less is more\" mentality. Rehearsal quality production? Check. All of the elements of Darkthrone are here.\n\nI think art of this sort needs to be caustic and wild to some extent. F.O.A.D. was basic as all hell, but it felt dangerous, like a train at the eternal brink of being derailed. I do feel some of the same with Dark Thrones and Black Flags, but I think with the familiarity they gained with this newer style, they started settling a bit more than would have been preferable. Darkthrone's songwriting has never been their strong suit, but this album showed to a greater extent that they weren't prone to consistent writing regardless of the genre they were working with. \"The Winds They Called the Dungeon Shaker\", \"Hiking Metal Punks\" and \"Blacksmith of the North\" are the best cuts, all in the first twenty minutes of the album. The second half has its moments (\"Hanging Out in Haiger\" is good fun, if anything) but the album loses some steam. As it happens, I find myself listening to the first side of Dark Thrones and Black Flags a lot more than the second half, nevermind the album as a whole. It pales in comparison to F.O.A.D., but I would say Darkthrone put out another solid record here. If anything, it's good to hear the band having pushed on with their desired sound in the face of criticism. These guys were years removed from making great music at this point, but no one can say they weren't as sworn to their convictions.\n",
        "\nF.O.A.D. is a fucking ton of fun. It's inevitable that any talk of Darkthrone's unlucky thirteenth LP would involve putting two cents into the great \"style change\" debate, the likes of which seem to have haunted their fandom since their shift in 2006 with The Cult Is Alive. F.O.A.D. is the album where Darkthronefully realized their transition from cold black metal to their tongue-in-cheek blend of all things traditional, classic and true. A lot of the stances other \"crust era\" fans have used to defend this album are pretty misguided, but I can favour the artistic seriousness of their classic records and still get a major kick out of this. After years of relative mediocrity, F.O.A.D arguably stands as the best album these guys had done to date since the '90s. \n\nF.O.A.D.'s detractors call it obnoxious and silly. I've heard it even said a few times that the over-the-top brand of self-awareness made them a parody of the band they used to be. I can't bring myself to disagree with most of that. F.O.A.D. is an album that was probably written with the intention of filling the beer-swilling regaliae their records had been host to from the virtual get-go. Instead of making music about being evil, they're making music about loving music about being evil. Unsurprisingly, that push into meta territory has done a lot to change the tone. Where before they were hateful and seemingly nihilistic with the '00s albums, the lyrics here are excitable. Fenriz and Nocturno Culto don't want you to fuck off and die-- not really, at least. Instead, they want to share their passion for a classic musical aesthetic.\n\nF.O.A.D is a true-to-form tribute to the sorts of bands Darkthrone listened to while they were growing up. This would appear to be a step down for a band that once codified a cutting edge genre two decades prior through sheer invention. From a broad perspective, it certainly is, but this is what Darkthrone needed. Part of the reason F.O.A.D. is so compelling is because they were struggling with finding that inspiration. The last wholly worthwhile recording was Ravishing Grimness in 1999, and even then some people could rightly accuse it of being inferior to the material they wrote as young men. I think this goes to show why you don't see any longlasting black metal bands with fully consistent careers. A misanthropic air and \"fuck the world\" attitude is undoubtedly more natural coming from a youngster. These two were fast approaching middle-age. A no-frills passion for hard rock and heavy music is more simplistic than their darker themes, but that's clearly what it took to light a fire under their asses again.\n\nEven if you hate seeing the quintessential black metal band turn in their guns for something new, I'd challenge a hater to say these guys don't sound leagues more excited about what they're doing than the string of albums before it. Darkthrone's best work emerged from a desire to do things their way, and for all its supposed triteness, there's a lot of fun to be had here. It's arguably the first time in Darkthrone's history where I've been specifically impressed by the songwriting itself. \"These Shores Are Damned\", \"Canadian Metal\", \"F.O.A.D.\" and \"Raised on Rock\" are the sort of infectious earbugs that will force an \"Ough\" out of you before you know it. While The Cult Is Alivesounded like a compromise between what they wanted to do and what was supposedly expected of them, F.O.A.D is uncompromising through and through. It's got the DIY rehearsal tape vibe that is perfect for this sort of greasy metal. There are no illusions that it's somehow a notable artistic achievement, but this was the first time in ages that Darkthrone had felt truly dangerous, maybe even since the time of Transilvanian Hunger.\n\nDarkthrone needed this. F.O.A.D. goes to show that it's never age itself that kills passion or creativity. It's circumstance. It's complacency. It's that inevitable feeling of needing to play a role you've already arranged for yourself; after all, exploring new roads is a pastime for the young. Or is it? In truth, the actual sound of this album isn't so much different from their black metal material. It's the tone and inspiration that ultimately sets it apart from the stuff that came before it. Even while I really like this album however, I've been a bit tired of the same rote defences the fans of this era give it, as if not enjoying a new direction is the fault of the listener and a failure to be \"true\" enough. Darkthrone are some of the sincerest musicians around, but their \"no fucks given\" attitude doesn't magically exempt them from criticism. Personally, I'm a pretty big fan of Darkthrone's early black metal and easily prefer it to this, but I've never been so obsessed with that sound that I'd be heartbroken if they changed it. For a band like this, the question shouldn't be about which genre is better, but how well they pull off a given style on a given album. If their quasi-crust era had turned out lame the way The Cult Is Alive suggested it would be, I would be the first to shrug it off as a misguided decision. No, F.O.A.D. is exactly the sort of album Darkthrone should have been making at that point in their lives, and as a listener, there are certain situations where no other album will do.\n",
        "\nGraveyard sluts! Wow!\n\nAlthough their crust and classic metal oeuvre can't hold a candle to the essential magic of their early black metal albums, I do think Darkthrone were in the right to shift their sound. Although Ravishing Grimness stands out as a pretty great album from their hazy mid-period, the other albums seemed to just exist without much determination of their own. Nocturno Culto and Fenriz weren't really trying to retrace territory with these albums, but this didn't stop the albums from having an enjoyable-but-wavering grasp of atmosphere and power. Even Sardonic Wrath-- the second best of the four-- showed signs of laziness on the band's part. In truth, they had already done about as much with black metal as any pair could stand to muster. Change was obviously needed. The Cult is Alive brought the answer.\n\nI doubt the debate between Darkthrone purists and adopters of their punkish stuff will die down anytime soon. Judging by my tastes I suppose I'm an unlikely supporter in that regard, but I had a lot of fun with F.O.A.D back in high school. Detractors refer to the era that arguably began with The Cult is Alive as an over-the-top metal self-parody. I don't think anyone could argue to the contrary. For what it's worth, the effect is usually a ton of fun, provided you've got a 12 case to back up your stereo with. Although The Cult is Alive stands as a necessary transition record for Darkthrone, it actually lacks a lot of the charm that made the subsequent crust albums so enjoyable for what they were. Caught smack dab in the centre of their middle-of-the-road black metal and the all-things-traditional mix, the combination falls flat. \n\nMuch like Plaguewielder, this is another album that simply exists for what it is. To describe it like a heavy metal band hijacked Sardonic Wrath and went their own way would probably make it sound more exciting than it is. You would think it would be exciting to see Darkthrone pay respect to their classic influences, but the mix of sounds doesn't really manage to wring the best out of any of the genres involved. From a pure standpoint of songwriting, it may be as forgettable as Plaguewielder. Luckily, a predictably aggressive performance of this material gives it some worth to a prospective listener, even if only as an album to put on once the classics have been overplayed.\n\nThe album's textures are black metal, the songwriting is heavy/speed, and the lyrics fall somewhere between their circa-Hate Them misanthropy and the meta references to heavy music culture they would later embrace in full. Although Darkthrone had proven 15 years prior that they can jump from one genre to another without batting an eye, it's possible that an album like The Cult is Alive helped to ease the impact of the quintessential black metal band throwing in their guns for greasier pastures. As far as I'm concerned, it doesn't matter what Darkthrone are playing so much as how they're putting the plan into action. To be fair, I hadn't expected much in the way of solid songwriting since Ravishing Grimness. The thing that's kept me coming back for more is the energy they usually fuel into their performances. After all, it wasn't the songwriting so much as the underwhelming presentation that made Plaguewielder such a dud. \n\nThe Cult is Alive has a strong, edgy performance. Fenriz and Nocturno sound nice and pissed off. That's about all this album has going in its favour. Luckily, the styles they're playing don't normally need more than that to function. I'm most disappointed in this album for the fact that a kitchen sink combination of their past and future sounds could have worked. I mean, there's no reason for it not to have; lots of bands have fused crust with black metal together and it usually sounds great. The issue lies in the fact that they delegated a part of the music (the tones, the riff writing etc.) to a different style, as opposed to truly fusing it together as a mesh. I am confident Darkthrone had the potential to make something great with this stage. The songwriting doesn't really leap out, and having heard the album a few times now, none of the songs outside of \"Atomic Coming\" and \"Forebyggende krig\" sound identifiable. The tinny black metal timbres feel ill-spent on what are essentially amorphous speed metal riffs. To the album's credit, the lyrics are just as hate-filled as I'd hope to hear from their mid-period onward, but even then, mixing that with tongue-in-cheek references to metal culture somewhat defeats the effect of it.\n\nLike it or not, Darkthrone finally moved onward with this one. Considering how stagnant their art was getting, The Cult is Alive cam e at the right place and time. If it helped set the stage for F.O.A.D and the rest, it's indirectly earned its keep as such. For the sake of actually listening to it, Darkthrone had technically done worse for themselves in the past, but I'm nonetheless disappointed they approached this new sound with the same bag of problems as the string of albums before it.\n",
        "\nSardonic Wrath marked the true end of an era in so many ways. While most of the other Second Wave legends had either disbanded or traded black metal for ambient or the avant-garde, Darkthrone stayed remarkably close to form throughout their career. Sure, every album offered up a different experience-- this is something that's made their discography such a compelling listen-- but they were always a band you could count on for reliable, authentic black metal. Of course, all of that changed when Darkthrone traded in the grim for their heavy metal-come-crust punk sound on The Cult is Alive. That's another story for another review. Nonetheless, it has a pretty significant effect on the way this album is looked upon in hindsight.\n\nFrom their return on Ravishing Grimness to Sardonic Wrath, I think Darkthrone had fallen into a comfortable maturity. The music they were making wasn't a fraction as hard-hitting as the classics they earned their bread by, but far from being has-beens, they gave slightly new shades with this familiar territory. Ravishing Grimness was notably clean and well-written. Plaguewielder attempted to be rawer, but ended up feeling vaguely underwhelming.Hate Them, by contrast, was arguably the most aggressive-sounding Darkthrone have ever been. To me, Sardonic Wrath is the album Plaguewielder tried to be. They're clearly trying to draw upon the old Second Wave atmosphere here, and this is the closest they ever came to reviving it. \n\nThe riffs are bleak, and the production is grimy and cold. Most of all, it doesn't sound like the band lost any of their inner rage and contempt. I'll follow the general consensus on this one and concede that while Sardonic Wrath is nowhere close to the grim magic of the trilogy, the album is plenty hard-hitting and worth being heard by all fans of the band. Given their DIY mentality and barebones aesthetic, I've never found Darkthrone to be the band that needed constant innovation to stay interesting. Sure, black metal had grown far past their original vision (Deathspell Omega's Si Monvmentvm Requires, Circvmspice was released within months of this, for instance) but are there many \"traditional\" acts from past or present that functioned so successfully as a bona fide riff machine? Ravishing Grimness may have been the last black metal album from Darkthrone to have truly timeless riffs (I'm looking at you, \"The Claws of Time\"!) but the atmosphere this pair manages to create with the bare essentials still feels unique even here.\n\nSardonic Wrath is arguably less hate-filled than Hate Them, but the difference is miniscule. Although I'd say the songwriting is about the same here as it was there (the grimy \"Hate is the Law\" stands as a bold highlight) this album stakes its identity in raw terms of its production. Although Darkthrone clearly intended to recall the coldness of their classics here, there's a proper mix and firm meatiness to the bass end of the spectrum. Perhaps it makes Sardonic Wrath feel less like a black metal album in some respects, but it's a great boon to the experience of the riffs themselves. I've always thought the way you could distinguish a solid Darkthrone record from their lesser work is the passion they injected into it. While Plaguewielder felt like Xanax metal by comparison, Sardonic Wrath may be the first time Darkthrone felt close to dangerous since Goatlord. The riffs and drums are played as aggressively as you would expect. The real highlight here are the vocals of Nocturno Culto; the ballsy aggression he wreaked with his voice on Panzerfaust found a far better home in the band's mid-period. I was impressed by his screams even on Plaguewielder, and they're all the better here.\n\nSardonic Wrath echoes the might of its predecessors, but I wouldn't say it ever unlocks the same essential magic. It doesn't change the legacy of the band all that much, certainly nowhere close to the total shift with The Cult is Alive. No, this is just Darkthrone doing what they do, with passion and experience. I think the amount I've been listening to these guys lately has made it clear that the albums following Ravishing Grimness were probably too comfortable for their own good. But after having listened to Soulside Journey through to Goatlord countless times, it's nice to have these extra records to dive into. Like Hate Them, Sardonic Wrath is a solid piece of black metal. I've had a lot of fun with the tongue-in-cheek parody punk they shifted into with The Cult is Alive onwards, but I can't help but feel that Sardonic Wrath marked the end of a legendary epoch in black metal culture we will never see the likes of again.\n",
        "\nDarkthrone's career has had its ups and downs, but I can't help but respect them for doing whatever the hell they wanted, when they wanted to do it. Even having been established as legends, there's a DIY-approach to their music that's extended to everything they've done to the present day. They're nothing if not sincere about what they do, which is why I found it surprising they were even capable of releasing less-than-solid work. While Total Death still stands as the band's most lackadaisical work, I felt the same lacking inspiration on 2001's Plaguewielder. All of the ingredients for good black metal were onboard, but it didn't come together in a way that felt transgressive or dangerous. Luckily they fixed that issue on Hate Them.\n\nBy 2003, the \"unholy trilogy\" was already a decade behind Darkthrone, so an album in that same style could only be so scary or striking. I don't think Nocturno Culto and Fenriz had any illusions that they were continuing to push boundaries with their music at this point, but the timeless threads they're plucking on here only need passion to feel relevant. Part of why Hate Them sounds so damned angry is probably because of its improvement over Plaguewielder. Unlike Ravishing Grimness, this one didn't produce any classic riffs or songs for the Darkthrone pantheon, but it's one of the angriest-sounding records they ever did. Considering Hate Them was recorded and released in the band's third decade of existing, that's not the sort of feat that should go unnoticed.\n\nThe riffs on Hate Them are definitely slower than its predecessor, although songs like \"Ytterst I Livet\" and \"Divided We Stand\" offer a more quintessentially Norwegian sound of black metal. Although Darkthrone wouldn't make the total shift until The Cult is Alive two albums later, there's definitely a punkish vibe to the band's performance. I don't think they were trying to revive the success and style they had with the trilogy (although Sardonic Wrath would come much closer in this respect) but they were certainly aiming for the youthful, aggressive mentality that the few albums before this one seemed to lack. It's their impulse to stay naive and excited about their music that makes Darkthrone's post-golden era worthwhile.\n\nThe blunt anger of \"Fucked Up and Ready to Die\", and the Nordic-come-punk fusion of \"Ytterst I Livet\" and \"Divided We Stand\" strike me as standouts on the album. Although the songwriting's kept more interesting than it ever was on Plaguewielder, I wouldn't say Darkthrone really shake me with their writing this time around. Barring those well-penned highlights, the songs fall into a fairly predictable riff machine that doesn't help nor hinder enjoyment. Really, if you're going to be getting into Hate Them, it's the way Darkthrone plays their material that make the whole thing worth it. The drums and guitar sound beefier than they ever had before, and Nocturno Culto's vocals are some of the best in Darkthrone's entire discography. I prefer Ravishing Grimness for the songwriting, and Sardonic Wrath for the cold atmosphere and production, but Hate Them is competent, reliable, and every bit as wrathful as you'd come to expect from a band that once had the world in their grip.\n",
        "\n\"Ravishing Grimness\" opened a new chapter in the history of Darkthrone. The duo broke with its crude tradition of delivering very individual productions and ugly melodies. Some songs of \"Total Death\", for example its relatively smooth opener, had already indicated the modified style of the Norwegian mavericks. But \"Ravishing Grimness\" went one step further. Its monolithic and homogeneous appearance was something completely new for the band and its supporters as well. In terms of the production, an almost totalitarian wall of sound left no room for strange experiments. The endless flow of leaden guitar lines formed a previously unknown facet of the band and the comparatively polished sound emphasized the fresh approach additionally. Quite irrespective of the technical formatting, Darkthrone surprised with meticulously designed songs with an average length of more than six minutes. Guitar cascades and intelligently defined breaks formed meaty lumps of black metal. Four good songs and two absolute killer tracks were finally registered.\n\nDespite its even overall impression, the album never gets boring. Darkthrone, in particular Nocturno Culto who has written five songs, show their keen sense for gloomy melodies. They enjoy each and every guitar line and give them enough room to develop their full flavour. While acting on the border to repetitiveness, Darkthrone never loose their instinct for compelling compositions. Consequently, they are able to find the balance between a healthy catchiness and the necessary degree of variety. Some breaks can be described as simple or minimalist, but they are highly efficient. In particular \"Across the Vacuum\" and the title track benefit from this approach. The brilliant lines of these pieces create perfect flows and thanks to the masterly executed breaks, the songs do not show any sign of incoherence. Every note hits the spot. The long instrumental parts carry the listener away and one can spiritually merge with the music. I don't want to say that these two pieces work like mantras and I will not compare Darkthrone with some Indian crybabies, but they trigger a process in my mind and enable me to forget my daily concerns for a while.\n\nThe remaining tracks fail to fascinate me in a similar way. This does not mean, of course, that they taste vapid or stale. \"Lifeless\", the opener, impresses with its very malignant and relentless mid-tempo parts, but the fast sections also reach a good level. Despite the fairly clean sound, the song - as well as the entire album - emanates a vile feeling and the raw vocals form a contrast to the everflowing guitars. \"The Claws of Time\", to come up with another example, is opened by broad, levelling guitars and the song reveals its cruelness slowly but steadily. No doubt, the tracks of \"Ravishing Grimness\" show a clear signature and express the attitude of the duo, although they are hardly comparable with the acoustic whirlwinds of the previous albums. Instead of heading for total devastation, Darkthrone have got everything under control. Due to the fact that this new approach had no negative impact, I appreciate this record very much. In other words, there are better things in life than \"A Blaze in the Northern Sky\".\n",
        "\nI am actually surprised a band like Darkthrone is even capable of releasing less-than-stellar releases. They've been host to many of black metal's foundational innovations, yet their aesthetic has never required originality to succeed. It's not like they've ever fallen short of passion for their art either; just watch a recent interview with Fenriz and tell me the guy doesn't still have a young man's enthusiasm for heavy music. I think self-awareness would keep them from putting anything that was truly weak, but for a band so legendary, mediocrity feels almost as inexcusable. \n\nThe painfully underwhelming Total Death is the only truly mediocre record Darkthrone have ever put out, but I feel a lot of the same disappointment towards the band's 9th studio album, Plaguewielder. Fan reception has been lukewarm at best towards this album, and it's generally down there with Goatlord as a Darkthrone album people seem to love to shit on. While in Goatlord's case this divisiveness could be justified on the basis that it was a half-baked (but brilliant) mess, Plaguewielder is smote for the sake that it's just, well, not all that great. \n\nDarkthrone had invested the decade prior to this exploring the furthest reaches of extreme metal. They had done some stuff, seen some shit, and generally knew the ins and outs of black metal like the backs of their respective hands. The album before this, Ravishing Grimness, basically sounded like Fenriz and Nocturno Culto had finally settled into a comfortable black metal niche but were still passionate enough to put out great records in doing so. I think taking things back to a rawer level with Plaguewielder was a good idea in theory, but I don't hear evidence of great songwriting here. The riffs are solid, sure, but that's something we've always been able to count on this band for at the worst of times. \n\nAs was the case for Total Death, all of the ingredients for a great Darkthrone record are technically here. It's the way they fail to spark that makes the problem. Plaguewielder is still a fair bit superior to that album, but for little reason other than the fact that this album has a steady grasp of character; Darkthrone were seasoned riff-conjuring black metal veterans at this point, and another straightforward black metal record a la Ravishing Grimness was what they were probably going for. It doesn't take past the first track to notice they sound somewhat weaker than usual. After a promising ambient intro, Fenriz and Nocturno jump into their familiar territory with simple-but-effective riffs and a no-nonsense aggression. The riffs on \"Weakling Avenger\" feel less hard-hitting than they should. Is it because their repetition of riffs wears on a bit long? Or the album's muddled production, which seems to suck power from all instruments but the vocals?\n\nEven so, this is still Darkthrone we're talking about. What counts as a failure compared to other Darkthrone records is still at least a mixed success by general standards. If there's anything I think could be the explanation for why Plaguewielder didn't turn out as well as it could have, it's that Darkthrone were trying to backstep by combining their recent \"controlled\" black metal sound (see: Ravishing Grimness) with a rawer, angrier mentality (see: Panzerfaust). By all means that should have worked, but it obviously wasn't handled the right way. The vocals here are some of the best I've heard on a Darkthrone record, but Fenriz's drums still feel too restrained to suit what they were going for. They would come much closer to their aim on Hate Them and Sardonic Wrath. As for Plaguewielder... Well, it's definitely one of their weaker albums, but I'm sure you could do a lot worse overall.\n",
        "\nDarkthrone had effectively settled into a sound of Ravishing Grimness. Despite their merits, both Panzerfaust and Total Death had felt like they were unsure how to innovate the band's sound following three of the most innovative records in black metal history. While it's always sad to hear the end of a band's golden era, Darkthrone's no-nonsense sensibility would never need constant innovation in order to pack a punch. Really, I'm sure the less inspired strokes were a result of the duo spreading themselves too far. Even gods may falter.\n\nThere was a three year silence prior to the release of Ravishing Grimness. I think their break as well-needed and completely deserved. More importantly, it helped them put out their first fully solid new record (not including Goatlord) since Transilvanian Hunger. Even if it offers little different musically from the mid-paced sound of Panzerfaust onward, this is the first time where that style is working to their full advantage as a band.\n\nHaving immersed myself in Darkthrone's work lately, it's not surprising they've come up in more than one conversation lately. Barring the same familiar banter regarding the \"Unholy trilogy\", quite a few fans I've spoken with would point to this album as a gem in their discography. I'm inclined to agree. While this description could never completely link to a band who pride themselves on DIY ethic and rawness, I do think Ravishing Grimness is the first point where Darkthrone ha found maturity in their black metal. The first three albums were wild risks that could only emerge from youth. The two black metal albums post-trilogy clearly wanted to settle down, but they were misguided. On Ravishing Grimness, we hear the black metal sound Darkthrone were looking for all those years in its true, realized form. \n\nUnsurprisingly, Ravishing Grimness' greatest strength is its collection of riffs. Regardless of what style they're playing, Darkthrone have always been better with writing great riffs than songs as a whole, but when you're able to compose a song using those great riffs exclusively, the quality of the two can be judged as one and the same. Approached from this mindset, Darkthrone produced one of their best songs on this song with \"The Claws of Time\". The opening riff here is incredibly simple and endlessly evocative. The other truly great highlight here is this album's title track; \"Ravishing Grimness\" is surprisingly one of the most true-to-form Norwegian black metal tunes Darkthrone ever cranked out, and they nail the isolated beauty of it to virtual perfection.\n\nGiven the 1999 release date, Ravishing Grimness was stubbornly simple at a time where black metal was getting turned on its head by bands like Dodheimsgard and Weakling. I think it's a tribute to Darkthrone's passion and talent that they're able to give so much across using so little. Even for a Darkthrone record, the album feels barebones. Although a guitar/drums combo under vocals was clearly nothing new, the extra simplicity comes through in the album's production. I do not mean to say that Ravishing Grimness is rawer than their earlier stuff-- quite the opposite. Much like a frostbitten Phil Collins, the early Darkthrone would use the studio as an instrument of expression itself. For instance, the frigid way they produced Under a Funeral Moon evokes more atmosphere than any of the instruments themselves. Ravishing Grimness, on the other hand, is functionally raw, comfortably mixed. They lost none of their authenticity going this route, but I do feel it's the most straightforward listening experience they had offered up to that point in their career.\n\nRavishing Grimness ultimately succeeds because it sounds like the pair were immersed in their art again. It's not to say they didn't care about the prior couple of albums, but the risks they were making were paying off less and less. Compared to a mediocre dud like Total Death, you can hear the inspiration dripping off a lot of the riffs here. Even if they were past the point of their best innovations, Darkthrone still had it with this album, and even though their style has evolved plenty in the years since, they still wield that passion with most everything they do.\n",
        "\nApparently Darkthrone are still putting out albums. Gotta give them credit for caring when no one else does anymore, at least sort of caring given the notable absence of songwriting on this album.\n\nSo around the time of Ravishing Grimness we started getting snippets from Fenriz about how he loves \"boring metal\" now and is trying to get Darkthrone in that sort of direction, and I guess it was kind of cool for novelty's sake with that album, giving us some nice tunes like \"The Claws of Time\" and \"The Beast\" along the way. But somehow this infatuation never seems to have ended and turned into some sort of obsession? People say Darkthrone is an ever-changing beast, and yeah, on the surface they display different influences now than they did in 1999, but it's still the same \"boring metal\" schtick they've kept repeating now for almost two decades, taking the most stock riffs they can think of and driving them into the ground by endless repetition. Different window dressing with epic heavy metal or whatever influences you claim to have these days doesn't hide the fact that it's just another retread of the same \"boring metal\" idea that worked once in 1999 as a one-off experience.\n\nThat isn't even the most glaring fault of the album. What really kills it is the way the songs and riffs are structured. After almost every single time they play a riff there's a sort of break/fill that has you feel they are moving on to the next part, but play the riff again instead. Ad nauseam sometimes. It gives the songs such a start-stop feeling devoid of any flow, the way they seem to start over after every time they play a riff, as if they're unsure if it's time for the next part and keep making a last-moment decision to repeat the riff once more again instead. And since every instance of a riff being played ends in the expectation that the next part is going to start now, you'd expect it to at least happen that way, but when a next part does start, they manage to make it feel thrown in completely randomly. Finally time for a new part after so many opportunities to start it, and then it seems they don't actually have any idea how to move on to it. Were they dissociating when they made this album? I thought cough syrup was something for hipster black metallers exclusively.\n\nThe vocals are another thing that bothers me. Vocals on Darkthrone albums in the old days were either overwhelmingly strong or offensively horrible, becoming charming after repeated listens and adding to the album's overall atmosphere - thinking of Panzerfaust and Goatlord here. The last few albums they just don't seem to give a fuck to go either way anymore, which I guess they wear as a sort of badge of honour like with their music, \"Hey, we're Darkthrone, we don't give a fuck\", but honestly, it's descended to an appallingly low level on this album. Nocturno Culto seems to do what Satyr of Satyricon always loved to do, just talking a few words in a raspy voice every time a riff starts, as if to say, hey guys, by the way, riff is starting. It sounds more like commentary on the song than actual vocals. Oh yeah, here's a riff, saying a few words. Pause till next riff. Then say a few more words. Annoying. Fenriz tries a little more with actual vocals, but not adding anything to the music, just accompanying it a bit. It's cool for stuff like Isengard or that exhumed doom metal project of his, but for the epic heavy metal thing they are apparently trying to go for in these songs there's just not enough character to his voice, the vocals are just there for the sake of having vocals. And I guess Fenriz wasn't too fond of his efforts here, either, or got shy in his advancing age, else I don't know why they'd put his clean vocals so low in the mix, especially compared to his bandmate's.\n\nSo, Darkthrone guys, you wanna old-school-up your sound more and more with each album. That's cool, I think you got the talent to pull it off. You're fucking Darkthrone, of course you do. But not as long as you keep hanging on to the loooooong worn-out Ravishing Grimness \"boring metal\"/\"we're Darkthrone, we don't give a fuck\" approach and repeating it over and over again, album after album. Had you abandoned that after trying it for one or two albums and given us the last few records with some spirit and some giving a shit - which is not a crime against true metal or whatever, whoever told you that? - we could have had some solid albums. But if you wanna keep doing your \"boring metal\" routine, it's me who doesn't give a fuck.\n",
        "\nPanzerfaust is sometimes seen as the point where Darkthrone began to lose it. Maybe that's true to some extent, but there were more than enough solid riffs on it to excuse its faults. For many others, it's the following album, Goatlord, where the masters fell apart. But even then, I don't think that's true; Goatlord is a fiendishly underrated album for what it is. if it gets a bad rep, it's only because it dared to be odd.\n\nNo, it's at Total Death where we start to hear the legacy of Darkthrone show its wear. Fenriz was notoriously prolific during this period, and it's clear by this point he had spread himself out too thin. Total Death arguably doesn't have glaring issues like the two albums that came before, but it also lacks inspiration, the likes of which that made said issues worth the trouble on past efforts. Considering this band's obsessive devotion with passionate authenticity, it is sobering to hear Darkthrone make an album that isn't all that stimulating to begin with. This is what happens when a creative juggernaut loses its steam. Nothing is technically out of place, but the sudden drop in quality with Total Death all but marked the end of their classic period as far as I'm concerned.\n\nI wouldn't say it's fair to go comparing Total Death to the \"unholy trilogy\" Darkthrone had put out a few years before, but some differences are worth mentioning. A Blaze in the Northern Sky, Under a Funeral Moon and Transilvanian Hunger all had unique personalities to them. For the most part, Total Death feels like another step in the direction of Panzerfaust. It's the work of a band who can't settle on a style for their album, so they've tried to be all-inclusive. There are parts here that sound like they were dredged up from doom lake, and lots of others that pay tribute to their influences: Hellhammer and Bathory, to name a couple. As Darkthrone's clearinghouse album, I think Panzerfaust ultimately found a personality on the basis that a lot of the more traditional sounds had not been heard from them before. Of course, come Total Death, Fenriz's stockpile of ideas had dried up. Again, he was probably too prolific for his own good at this point. \n\nThe retreading throughout Total Death is structurally similar to past Darkthrone, but it comes off as fairly dull. There are great moments here however, and just enough to make the album worth recommending to fans. The best parts of Total Death are closest to the simplicity on Transilvanian Hunger. \"Ravnajuv\" could have fit on that album and been no worse for wear. The band makes great strides with slower riffs here as well; \"Earth's Last Picture\" and \"Blackwinged\" have some grizzly riffs and appropriately feral vocals to boot. At it's best however, Total Death only ever seems to ape past albums. For a band that had several classics under their belt already, this is to be expected, but it is disappointing to see them having cashed it in so fast. The one innovation the album has to offer Darkthrone's history is arguably the production. Although the execution is still leagues from the inspired coldness of Under a Funeral Moon, it has the kind of solid mix I would like to have seen on Panzerfaust.\n\nI think Darkthrone are one of the few bands that could make gold from any style they touched, but if they'd actually been inspired with this album, I'm sure a more consistent direction would have come out of it. These guys are always at their best when they immerse themselves fully in a single aesthetic. That's part of the reason their shift to crust punk was so successful; they eased into it like they'd never known anything else. Total Death has some great moments, but ultimately it doesn't sound like they knew what they wanted to make of it.\n",
        "\nI wasn't expecting much going into Goatlord. Although I have great respect for all eras of Darkthrone, the idea of an old death metal rehearsal tape being dressed up as a new album didn't exactly inspire confidence. Even though these guys have had great success with a gritty, lo-fi approach, the fan consensus generally appeared to be that this was the first \"weak\" record they ever put out. Fans will know that this was actually intended to be the band's second album following Soulside Journey. What eventually became Goatlord never got past the demo stage before they traded in death for black metal. The rest, as they say, is history, and these demos remained buried until Fenriz decided to throw on some vocals five years after the fact and called it a day. It doesn't sound like a recipe for success, even by Darkthrone's standards. Rather, it sounds like the recipe for a fans-only throwaway.\n\nGoatlord is the coathanger aborted offspring of Soulside Journey. People who hate this album would probably agree with this description. Surprisingly enough, I love it for all the same reasons. Considering that Goatlord was released half a decade after it was actually recorded, it's easy to forget just how innovative they were relative to other death metal in 1991. Soulside Journey had its share of atmospheric and progressive touches. Goatlord is a foray into legitimately experimental death metal territory, and while no one is hopefully arguing the fact that it wouldn't have been better with a full studio treatment, the hodge-podge ugliness on this album gives it a truly unique atmosphere. Music this technical is seldom heard in such a lo-fi setting even today, and some of the tricks they did here would take the rest of the death metal world at least a couple of years to catch up to them.\n\nI think Goatlord is great for a lot of the same reasons many people don't like it. It is the Born Again of the extreme metal sphere, a divisive album where the unwitting flaws actually give it a special atmosphere. I can defend Darkthrone the same way I did with that Black Sabbath album; the flaws here are apparent, and the album is far from perfect. The production is patchy. The songwriting is meandering. Fenriz's growls sound like an afterthought overtop the instruments, and his King Diamond-esque falsetto is downright silly. This is all evidence of a band making clear mistakes in their craft, and whatever magic is heard on the album wasn't necessarily intentional. Like a lot of the genre-defining classics in black metal, Goatlord just sort of happened. Damn the rules, throw some ideas together and see how they mix; that seems to have been the Darkthrone mentality come Goatlord, and it works.\n\nSoulside Journey is the obvious first comparison people like to make. I'd actually argue that Goatlord sounds closer to the atmosphere on A Blaze in the Northern Sky. Soulside Journey, despite its strengths, felt like a very controlled record. Contrast that with Darkthrone's first foray into black metal, which still sounds counter-intuitive in the way they pieced their ideas together. Goatlord works with shorter songs in the image of the debut, but the riffs are abrupt and swirling. As if they were thrown together, there are a ton of time signature changes. In conventional terms of song structure, the tracks on Goatlord are a total mess. The riffs themselves are often so compelling that the dynamic shifts are made to feel exciting. I've listened to Goatlord now many more times than I gave the disappointing Panzerfaust, and I still find myself surprised by the twists they take.\n\nOf course, there are the vocals. A few nights ago, I was laughing with some friends over Fenriz's attempt at a \"female\" falsetto. While his rasps here are great (I actually like them more than what Nocturno Culto would have probably done) the King Diamond wails are definitely odd. If you laughed at them, you'd be justified in doing so. Though silly at first, I think the vocals here are one of Goatlord's most striking elements. A band who was taking an album truly seriously would never have done something like that, but the effect is incredibly eerie. Fenriz uses the falsettos sparingly enough to make their effect felt whenever they're used. It's like hearing an autistic princess wailing away in the keep of a haunted Gothic castle. Can an approach like that necessarily be defended on some formal, academic level? Probably not. But then again, the same could be said for most of Darkthrone's greatest innovations. They've always been prone to making perfectly imperfect art. Goatlord just happens to be the most imperfect of them all.\n",
        "\nSomething like the Second Wave of Norwegian black metal has become so canonized that even its most apocryphal offerings seem to have worth, if even only for their historical merits. Among the bands that made the Second Wave so great, few rank higher than Darkthrone. Of course, that's coming as news to no one by that point. One thing I admire the band's \"unholy trilogy\" for is the fact that any of the three could technically be my favourite depending on the mood I'm in. In spite of the countless imitators, I Darkthrone's personal identity still feels unique to my ears. Under a Funeral Moon is one of the coldest fucking albums that have ever slithered into my ears, and given the blissfully effective roughness these guys sported was a purposeful artistic choice on their parts, hearing them play some of that album in a rough rehearsal is fine by me.\n\nUnder beskyttelse av m\u00f8rke was released in Japan under a strict 666 copy limit. For the sake of collection, I've no doubt the prices run high for this one; whether it's actually worth selling a kidney on the black market ultimately depends on whether you're a real diehard. While it's probably more of a side attraction to other listeners, I can't help but think this is a pretty cool expansion on the existing legend that is Under a Funeral Moon. While that album is still famed for its cold rawness, hearing a living room rehearsal like this goes to show how much of it was really calculated. The tracks here are about as rough as you can get, and the music practically begs for that mentality.\n\nNormally, the sound (or lack thereof) of the mix cutting out in lieu of static would be a bad (even horrible) thing for an album. Here, it adds to that \"lost gem\" charm, in a sort of way I think only Darkthrone have ever truly managed to pull off. \"Unholy Black Metal\" and \"Under a Funeral Moon\" sound about as wretched as you would expect, far less atmospheric but certainly heavier than the official studio versions. If you're pining for something original to this release, the only thing on Under beskyttelse av m\u00f8rke that might fit the bill is an instrumental playthrough of \"Crossing the Triangle of Flames\". I'm not sure what the idea behind an instrumental version was-- Karaoke night, anyone?-- but it arguably works to this release's benefit that there has been change from the original.\n\nI wouldn't say a ton of forethought went into Under beskyttelse av m\u00f8rke, but who cares. It's a rare and candid insight into one of the best-ever black metal bands playing together at their height. Lack of original material or not, it's well worth checking out if you're a fan of Under a Funeral Moon.\n",
        "\nThat this isn't your typical Darkthrone record is a fact well-known to anyone with a cursory knowledge of extreme metal history. Yes, they were death metal before they went on to define the blackened sphere, and I'm positive they could have gone onto a competent career if Soulside Journey had been the template for their future work. I'll throw out the obvious immediately: this is a fine album in the vein of Scandinavian death metal like Entombed. It's competently written and well-played. Most of all, it showed a band that emerged with an already fierce sense of musicianship and tact.\n\nThat last part, I think, is the most important thing about Soulside Journey. I've never been completely thrilled by this album, but it improves my experience of the classic albums they would put out come the following years. Here, Darkthrone are playing as well as any extreme metal band. It proves that the lo-fi ugliness and totally sloppy musicianship on the following three records was a matter of choice for them. Not that the atmosphere on Under a Funeral Moon would feel any less magickal had I known it were performed by weak technical players, but it certainly impresses me that Darkthrone pieced together that legendary archetype with total forethought and calculation. \n\nWhile I don't think a death metal Darkthrone would have made such waves in the scene, it should be said that it sounds like they knew exactly how to wring the best from their chosen style. I've written before that I'm amazed that Darkthrone seemed to put an inimitable spin on any style they touched, and I think the same can be said for Soulside Journey. This is a much more reverb and keys-laden album than your average death metal. While I wonder whether the band would welcome the description, the way they perform the music comes closer to the progressive, over traditional death metal. Even if the band carries a fine punch, the background synths and general resonance make it seem like they were more interested in creating an atmosphere as opposed to sheer aggression. Either course would have worked in the case of this debut, but I think Darkthrone set themselves more apart from the crowd by going this route.\n\nThe atmosphere is appropriately cold and vast, and even if the airy production doesn't pack the sort of wallop I tend to look for in death metal, I'm completely impressed by the way they played here. In particular, Gylve \"Fenriz\" Nagell (credited here as \"Hank Amarillo\") gives a really nuanced and dynamic performance as the drummer. Again, considering the occasional difficulty Darkthrone would seem to have keeping up a steady rhythm on subsequent albums, the competence the band is showing here tag all following expressions with a wink and a nudge. Even Ted Skjellum (Nocturno Culto)'s vocals sound perfect for death metal.\n\nIf it's all that good, the question remains: What would have laid in store had they stuck with it? To be honest, for all I'm impressed by with Soulside Journey, the album doesn't hint at the promise of legend. Darkthrone could have been a solid death metal band, sure, but their innovation was put to much better use in a style that often values atmosphere over all else. The riffs are competently written, but there's little variety or surprise here. Every time I hear A Blaze in the Northern Sky, I somehow end up hearing something new, or noticing a trick that leaves me scratching my head. That's certainly not the case for Soulside Journey, but for the way it's benefited my love of the later albums, I can only thank the band for putting it out first.\n",
        "\nI have a special relationship with this full-length, because it was my first album of a Norwegian band. Unfortunately, there are no further reasons to appreciate this record in a specific manner. \"Soulside Journey\" is stuffed with painfully meaningless death metal. Inter alia due to its then exotic status, I tried hard to become a fan of this work. But I had no chance.\n\nToday they are dinosaurs, but back in 1991, Darkthrone were absolute beginners and did not know much about the art of writing enthralling songs. The gap between their ambitions and their abilities was greater than the distance between Oslo and Hammerfest. To be more precise, the songs start somewhere and end somewhere, but I cannot identify central ideas. Instead, it feels like listening to fragments, because the single pieces appear torn and inconsistent. Darkthrone spit on conventional song patterns and that is not bad per se. The problem is that the songs fail to create a comprehensible flow. Too much (mediocre) ideas show up, and, even worse, none of them is clearly defined. This leads to pretty obscure results, not least because of a high number of awkward breaks. \"Grave with a View\", to mention just one example, starts atmospheric with background chorals, but this approach remains incomplete and the following parts fail to evoke any kind of emotions.\n\nBasically, I miss catchiness and velocity. Too many slow-moving parts occur and some of them have the potential to cause mental anguish. The longer the album goes on, the worse it gets. This is not so much a problem of the later songs. They are not better or worse than their predecessors. The annoying fact is the recognition that the entire album lacks of great compositions. In view of the omnipresent mediocrity of the song material, it is almost useless to philosophize about the quality of the production. Briefly, the nasty sound cannot be dismissed as amateurish or inappropriate. It does not lack of power and creates a cold aura, no more and no less.\n\nOne may call the compositional approach \"progressive\". Well, I do not support progressive metal actively, but I bet that no fan of this sub genre would use this term in connection with \"Soulside Journey\". It would be also unfair to speak of \"free jazz death metal\", because Darkthrone, there is no doubt about it, try to give their material a structure. Unfortunately, they are simply not able to form the songs successfully. Whenever they perform a good part, and there are doubtlessly a few pretty decent sections, they throw it away in a matter of seconds and turn to other ideas. It is therefore no wonder that the tasteful artwork of this wonky debut remains its biggest asset.\n\nSome pitiless smart alecks criticise the Norwegian duo for being inconsistent. I do not care about their babbling, because Darkthrone mostly deliver high quality albums. But the most important reason for my lack of interest is that I really appreciated the stylistic modifications of the band after this half-baked debut whose only very little highlight is the opener. Therefore, come out and accompany Fenriz and Nocturno Culto on their journey if you like to do so. I stay at home.\n",
        "\nThe late nineties were a rocky era for Darkthrone. Armed with their newly-found reputation as \"the most evil band in the world,\" they flirted with greater commercial appeal - hastily finishing and releasing the unearthed Goatlord, the \"star power\" of Total Death's lyrics, advertising their polished production for Ravishing Grimness, and an uncharacteristically colourful cover for the clean-sounding Plaguewielder. While none of these albums were singularly bad, they lacked the urgency of the classics that preceded them. Hate Them and the subsequent Sardonic Wrath formed an unexpected mid-career duology of vitality prior to taking a slight step down with The Cult is Alive. Of course, they then began a string of self-parodying albums that, in the interest of legacy preservation, would perhaps have been best suited for release under a different moniker, but I digress. \n\nHate Them brims with rejuvenated spontaneity and intensity. The songs are stylistically similar to those found on Ravishing Grimness and incorporate the crust sound that they would use ad nauseam in later albums in tasteful and unobtrusive doses. Fenriz\u2019s drumming is powerful and confident with an hint of intentional sloppiness. Nocturno Culto\u2019s vocals reverberate with a revitalized ferocity, especially compared to the relatively weak performance on Plaguewielder. The guitars wield a gritty edge with an appropriately lackluster sound, but retain sufficient clarity to allow the riffs to flow unobstructed. All these elements come together in a powerful, cohesive whole that allows the album to successfully forge its own sound of mechanized nihilism.\n\nHate Them is Darkthrone at an interstitial stage in their discography; they had found a renewed passion but still took their style seriously enough to hold off the abrupt and goofy change in direction they were to take several albums later on F.O.A.D. They thus turned to what they did best with this revitalization and yielded impressive results.\n",
        "\nThese early Darkthrone albums are pesky things to write about, since you're either sure that others have already said all you want to say or that your point of view hasn't been represented at all. With 'A Blaze in the Northern Sky', it was more of the former, while I don't feel that 'Transilvanian Hunger' has been described in a way that I entirely agree with. In the first place, has anyone looked very closely at that title? Transylvania? Vampires? True black metal? Excuse me while I deliver this letter to Cradle of Filth telling them that all is forgiven. The title track is about \"warm blood\" and \"daylight slumber\", but I don't suppose anyone is paying attention to that, since the focus seems to be the raw and \"pure\" black metal. What really confuses me about that opinion is how anyone could term this album pure black metal when the preceding 'Under a Funeral Moon' is actually that much frostier, evil, and mysterious. I'm going to take a risk and say that, for me, this is actually an extension of black metal into more epic realms, capturing not a little of the nascent Viking spirit that burgeoned in the second wave.\n\nOf course, with Darkthrone, any kind of progression always has an eye on the past, and the dirty churn of Celtic Frost, the punkish forthrightness of Venom and Motorhead, and the tarnished epic sprawl of Bathory all feature here as much as they ever did before, if not more. Much of 'Transilvanian Hunger' is a blastbeat-heavy listen, packed with crusty bass and swirling guitars that come on with the energy and blatancy of Motorhead, though the subjects and guitar themes often have more than a touch of adventure and windswept bravado to them, which is totally at odds with the grim, morbid, and even lamenting style chosen by Burzum and Mayhem. Darkthrone have never been completely without human qualities: all those interview videos of Fenriz and Nocturno Culto drinking and smoking, the increasing lack of mystery throughout their career, plus a frequent tendency to just rock out in their music without worrying about being \"true\". There are plenty of instances of that here, notably in the placement of riffs at the forefront of the sound, always giving plenty of power to the guitars and allowing a few bonafide concessions to headbanging, such as the introduction to 'Skald Av Satans Sol'. As such, this album actually possesses a sense of fun and carefree abandon, which is certainly not one of the precepts of pure black metal.\n\nThis is what brings it into the realms of epic or Viking metal in my mind. Notwithstanding some dreadful sounds of impending darkness, the rush and clatter of this album is a close cousin to the sounds of battle, as is the atmosphere of heraldic triumph that rings clear in many of the ascending tremolo riffs, such as that of 'En As I Dype Skogen' and the title track. Unlike with Burzum, where the blastbeats tended to monotonize the sound, smoothing over the roughness of the guitars, or with Mayhem, where Hellhammer's more diverse battery had some purely musical aspirations, Fenriz's drumming is an accelerator that whips the flowing guitars into a frenzy, providing energy and excitement that would not be out of place in classic heavy metal, whatever the difference in extremity.\n\nThe reason why the pace and excitement are both so necessary is because the \"pure\" attribute of 'Transilvanian Hunger' means it comes dangerously close to being plain and boring. This is pretty simple music and the basic chord progressions would get dull very quickly if they weren't played with spirit and sufficient backup from the clattering drums and thundering bass. That background roar of the rhythm instruments is very helpful at turning the repetition into a force of nature rather than an invitation to nap, plus some of those riffs, however easy to learn, almost take the skin off your face with their raw potency. Combined with Nocturno Culto's hungry and desperate screams, 'Slottet I Det Fjerne' and 'Skald Av Satans Sol' in particular soar and rush through alternate rabid onslaughts and transcendental swoons of riffs, proving that the visceral and the (pseudo-)spiritual can go hand in hand. That intensity and conviction in the art make all of the songs a success, barring 'Over Fjell Gjennom Torner', which seems underdeveloped, and 'Graven Takeheimens Saler', the first half of which is plain and uninspired. The lack of variety can cause problems at first, since it appears that all songs follow very similar patterns, though after a few listens, the planning and minor details start to come through more quickly and it becomes easy to love the minute guitar diversion (it would be impossible to call such a small thing a solo) near the close of 'Slottet I Det Fjerne', the dipping bends in the riff for 'I En Hall Med Flesk Og Mjod', or the deep ripping sound in Nocturno Culto's voice.\n\nIf I have a complaint about this album, it would be the lack of variety, which can make 'Transilvanian Hunger' a tiring listen at times and prevents it from being a frequent choice of listen. There is also, of all things, a substantial problem with the gaps between tracks, which on my edition (the 2003 Peaceville digipak) leaves a lengthy break of 10 seconds between songs, meaning that the ferocious energy and forward momentum is lost as a new song begins. One would have thought that should be easy to fix, but it's a minor bummer when listening to the entire album, even if it doesn't really efface the blitzkrieg enthusiasm of 'Slottet I Det Fjerne' or the troubling rise and fall of 'As Flittermice As Satans Spys'.\n",
        "\nA few albums offer fantastic tracks exclusively, some outputs present just good stuff in a pretty homogeneous manner. A third category gathers the albums whose tracks vary widely in terms of quality. The last type of albums is difficult to evaluate. Thank God, \"F.O.A.D.\" gives me the chance to practice the description of these works.\n\nDarkthrone have written some excellent tracks and the production is powerful and smelly at the same time. It displays a fairly adequate sound, albeit the album was recorded during a lot of different sessions. The result is that the production wins no award for homogeneity or consistency. But this shortcoming is widely compensated by the special attitude of the Norwegians. They were never afraid of a more or less rotten mix. This way of thinking also affects \"F.O.A.D.\". Due to the slightly mouldy character of the sound, the songs do not lack of a certain quantum of dirt. It fits the nasty guitar work that drives the highlights of the album. For example, the forcefulness of the riff which leads to the chorus of \"The Church of Real Metal\" is simply brilliant. It finds its way through the ear canals into the darkest corner of the brain in an irresistible manner and says that it has come to stay. The solo orgy at the end breaks the chains of the strict configuration of the track and adds the final touch. Fenriz and Nocturno Culto behave like snotty brats who do whatever they want. In this case, the outcome is more than impressive. In other cases, the stubbornness of the crude duo leads to relatively meaningless results, as much as I regret it. The album suffers from a handful of songs which fail to come to the point.\n\nThank God, the amazing \"Canadian Metal\" does not belong to these tracks. Quite the opposite, this star sparkles brightly at the dark and cold Norwegian firmament. Its lyrics praise the metallic pioneers from - surprise, surprise - Canada. In accordance with this historic issue, the straight track appears as a trip into the past. Endowed with an iota of insanity, both the leads and the chorus are absolutely ingenious and the band seems to fly at the end of the song. A fascinating outburst of primordial vehemence. Too bad that the majority of the remaining songs dwell in the realm of mediocrity. Neckbreaking riffs and memorable moments hardly emerge. Instead, insufficient guitars and a lack of coherent song-writing show up. Tunes like \"The Banners of Old\" pass by without leaving any trace and the slightly punk influenced riffing of the title track does not yield an impact as well. More tracks remain inconspicuous or suffer slightly from the crude humour of the band (the fairly acceptable \"Raised on Rock\" reveals a more or less moronic vocal performance). Only the two already described highlights, the grumpy opener and the solid \"Splitkein Fever\" keep the album above water.\n\nCompared with their groundbreaking albums, \"F.O.A.D.\" stays in the background. It is no flop, but too many songs fail to enthuse me. They seem to be carelessly designed. I do not wish to offend the duo, but it is difficult to avoid this impression. The band should take this seriously, because a credible, down-to-earth attitude belongs to its greatest assets and archaic songs that try to preach the rules of the old school deserve exactly this kind of attitude. This is the tragedy of \"F.O.A.D.\": all of its tracks originate from the dusty heavy metal wastelands, but some of them just do not work.\n",
        "\nIt is commonly agreed that \"Hate Them\", the tenth regular studio album of the Norwegian duo, does not belong to its most impressive works. What is even worse, it can be easily overlooked in view of the nearly unmanageable discography of the Scandinavian metal trolls. But ignoring this album would be a pity, because it is definitely not weaker than some of its predecessors. After their mediocre death metal debut, the mind-boggling black metal reference works and the intermezzo with the heterogeneously produced \"Total Death\" and the incredibly shitty \"Goatlord\", Darkthrone had begun a new era with \"Ravishing Grimness\". This album was the first that featured fairly complex, long songs. They combined many elements of extreme metal without delivering generic black, death or thrash metal. \"Plaguewielder\" confirmed the approach of \"Ravishing Grimness\" and the here presented album made the trilogy complete.\n\nAlthough the songs are a little bit shorter than on the two foregoing outputs, they are in accordance with the fundamental orientation of the aforementioned full-lengths. Based on a solid fundament, the tunes rely on strong riffs and resilient lines that prevent any touch of boredom. They are neither overloaded nor progressive, yet they do not lack of breaks and tempo variations which guarantee the necessary variety. The patterns of the individual songs do not differ in a substantial manner. Nevertheless, the majority of the tracks possesses at least a minimum of more or less unique features. For example, \"Striving for a Piece of Lucifer\" has an excellently flowing guitar line, the remorseless guitar work of \"Rust\" grows menacingly and \"In Honour of Thy Name\" combines staccato riffing with a profound, slow-moving middle part. Moreover, these songs deliver cold, edgy riffs and rather insane drumming. Despite their generous playtime, they avoid lame sections with great ease.\n\n\"Black metal is the devil's fuel\" is an excerpt of the closer's lyrics. Yet it remains an open question whether the here gathered songs represent this sub genre. Let's have a look on typical black metal works in order to compare them with \"Hate Them\". Darkthrone's output has not much to do with the unholy intensity of \"De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas\". Unlike \"In the Nightside Eclipse\", the work of Fenriz and Nocturno Culto does not combine weird melodies with a nightly aura. Finally, the rage of \"Pure Holocaust\" remains untouched. Therefore, I tend to say that \"Hate Them\" only reaches the outskirts of black metal. The songs score with violence and sleaziness, but the typical black metal aura remains absent. That is the reason why I would like to speak of a blackened thrash album. Furthermore, it seems as if Darkthrone appreciate the rawness and the rebelliousness of the punk movement. Anyway, thrash is dominating, inter alia because the production puts the focus on harshness while almost neglecting the creation of a diabolic aura. Nevertheless, the grim nagging and the piercing guitars transmit the feeling of discomfort.\n\n\"Hate Them\" is a very good album, but it cannot offer legendary background stories. There is only one exception. At the time of its release, Fenriz said that its title refers to King Diamond's \"Them\". He did not get tired to point out that he did not like this album since its publication. Therefore, he preached that Darkthrone's album title should be understood as an invitation to hate \"Them\". I guess this kind of humour was the blackest element of the here presented full-length.\n",
        "\nEven if Panzerfaust lacks the classic aura of the three (or even four) albums that came prior to it, there's no doubting the fact that the mid-90s belonged to Darkthrone. Fenriz and Nocturno Culto had invented a sound and aesthetic, then swiftly proceeded to reinvent it again and again, each time offering a new fresh glimpse into what palpable horrors black metal could wreak upon the unwitting listener's soul. Even listening to these albums a t a time where these albums have long since been canonized into the essential pantheon, I've always had the feeling that a lot of the magic happened by chance. This band had a bold and unnervingly unique way of approaching their craft, but the way it's played out in the music's lurid details could have turned out a hundred different ways. Fortunately for us as listeners and they as artists, the cold and wilfully sloppy risks they took with their presentation paid off like crazy.\n\nPanzerfaust really is the first time in Darkthrone's career where I think they made a real misstep. This doesn't have to do with the music itself, of course; you don't suddenly become a bad musician or songwriter overnight, and this album dropped only a year after Darkthrone had finished their punishing 'Unholy Trilogy' with the deceptively melodic Transilvanian Hunger. No, Darkthrone's real key has always been the manner in which they've realized their music. Each of the three before Panzerfaust were blissfully raw and rough, and Darkthrone had Soulside Journey before those to demonstrate that they could actually play with tact and polish-- they simply chose not to. \n\nAnyway, the problem with Panzerfaust isn't that they took rawness too far, but that the wilful sloppiness began to give way to, well, actual sloppiness. Those complaining about the fact that Panzerfaust draws in as much from doom and punk as it does from black metal proper should stick to Transilvanian Hunger and stay blissfully unaware that Fenriz and Herr Nocturno have almost always been eclectic with their material. No, the real issue with Panzerfaust is that other glaring elephant in the room. A bad production can be good in certain cases, but a bad mix is always a bad mix. Can a review still be worth writing if it's just parroting the same thing everyone else has said? What were you thinking, Darkthrone? The vocals are mixed highly to the point where the riffs actually sound underwhelming by comparison. And as for the vocals themselves... Nocturno Culto was reportedly drunk as all hell while recording them, which would normally be a great thing and totally in keeping with the band's production aesthetic. Unfortunately, Mr. Culto's drunken yell lacks the frantic resonance and punch of the fantastic performances he'd given on albums past. The extent to which those vocals botch the mix is almost extreme enough to define the album as a whole.\n\nTo add insult to injury, Panzerfaust is otherwise a pretty great album. Even if it lacks the monolithic atmosphere of Under a Funeral Moon or Transilvanian Hunger, the eclecticism feels revived in a way from A Blaze in the Northern Sky. That album offered an all-expenses paid buffet of their influences, and I think the same thing could be said for Panzerfaust. The line between black metal and punk rock was becoming harder to distinguish once again, and Darkthrone weren't beyond embracing their doomy inklings full-force with this one. Although it doesn't have the black metal force of the albums before it, Darkthrone demonstrate such a palpable knowledge of proper doom atmosphere that it's an honest shame they've never made pursuing it their front-and-centre at one point or another. \"Quintessence\" earns top marks from me; it still suffers from the damnable mixing issue, but it's otherwise hard to fault a song agog with rich and atmospheric riffs.\n\nI really wanted to like Panzerfaust more. I do enjoy it, and would never turn away from acknowledging the pros as much as the cons, but it is frustrating to hear an album that could (read:should) have been so much better if Darkthrone had decided not to purposefully sabotage their own music. If that was really their intention, I'd say they only half-succeeded. It's enough to pull Panzerfaust from ever being considered a great album in my books, but not nearly enough to defame to the level of the lukewarm bands the duo went on to influence. Oh well.\n",
        "\nNo intro, no hesitation. \"The Cult Is Alive\" is kicked off by an explosive riff which pulls the unsuspecting listener into the song immediately. As you surely know, the versatile chameleon called Darkthrone has already appeared in many different forms. Now it is back and already the untamed opener makes clear that the days of low budget productions are gone. \"The Cult Is Alive\" has a competitive sound and does not reveal any grave deficiencies. Instead, the mix is characterized by its density and gruffness. The radical rejection of any kind of compromise is the third feature which shapes the sound. Therefore, the frame is set and Darkthrone start working.\n\nThe impulsive duo has forged a handful of fascinating black thrash metal pieces. Three tunes, the opener as well as \"Atomic Coming\" and \"Whisky Funeral\" put the focus on speed while attacking with piercing riffs. Although these songs are based on a fairly ordinary configuration, they possess the typical iota of insanity for which the band stands. Apart from this trademark, each and every number marks a straightly running neckbreaker which does not lack of pressure and dynamic. Of course, these songs do not refer to their classic tracks such as \"Transilvanian Hunger\". Nevertheless, wimps should run for cover, not least because of the raw vocals which are strengthened by an almost overpowering reverb.\n\nBut Darkthrone would not be Darkthrone if they had not more curious stuff to offer. \"Graveyard Slut\" sounds as if a drunken Tom G. Warrior tries to sing a sinister rock song - and I see Fenriz with a moronic grin before my inner eye. Anyway, the snotty, shabby and filthy \"Too Old, too Cold\" is even more strange. A casual riff drives the mid-paced rocker that does not lack of catchiness and heaviness. One can blame this song for its simplicity, I praise it for its immediate effectiveness and the combative lyrics (\"You call your metal black / It's just plastic, lame and weak\"). Maybe you have the possibility to watch the video they produced for this song. Fenriz announced proudly that they did not pay a dime for it. Well, everybody who saw the video so far did not suspect anything else.\n\nI could list a lot of more strange details, for example the squeaky guitar solo of \"Tyster p\u00e5 Gud\" or the black humour of the lyrics (\"Victims, do your job / Die now for your own God\", taken from \"Forebyggende krig\"). But let me turn the spotlight on the big picture. Darkthrone still sound ugly and independent. They are able to elicit the crudest tones from their guitars. Consequently, the underground charisma is omnipresent and that's probably the most important thing. Although the band has already shown a lot of different faces, its authenticity does not need to be discussed. This is not to say that every single song is a killer. I do not want to hide that the last four tracks do not enrich the band's catalogue sustainably. Yet they achieve an acceptable level so that the two Norwegians avoid throwaway tracks successfully. They have a knack for strong riffs, coherent structures and smooth yet effervescent melody lines. Although the colourless booklet is almost too stylish for a proletarian gang, this album underlines the relevance of the odd duo.\n",
        "\nIf there's anything that sets Darkthrone apart from their Second Wave peers, it's that they make you take the tropes and clich\u00e9s seriously. Even if Fenriz and Nocturno Culto are less sombre sorts in person, there's a grating authenticity to virtually everything they've done. Is it because they were actually great musicians that wilfully sounded sloppy for the sake of atmosphere. Was it even merely the fact that they got around to doing it first? A monochromatic image of a young man garbed to the nines in spooky regalia would either be laughed at or wearily dismissed today; enough imbeciles have dipped their wicks in black metal to ruin the look for the elites in their midst. \n\nTransilvanian Hunger is easily the most conventional, straightforward and predictably 'black metal' album of Darkthrone's early career, and if it had been released much later into the genre's development, I can't see it having made a fraction of the ripple it's ended up making in black metal spheres. This is a far cry from the unpredictable eclecticism of A Blaze in the Northern Sky, and the pristine coldness of Under a Funeral Moon, both of which would sound just as spooky today as they did twenty-odd years ago when I was still shitting myself in diapers. To its credit, Transilvanian Hunger didn't rest of the laurels of Under a Funeral Moon; it instead continued the band's ravenous hunger for change and evolution. The result? One of the most straightforward black metal albums I've ever heard.\n\nJust because I think of it as the weakest in Darkthrone's 'Unholy Trilogy' shouldn't imply I don't think it stands out in its own way, much less that I don't like it. Nevertheless, I can't see too many bands other than these guys really pulling off something so barren and unfrilled. Under a Funeral Moon was arguably even rawer than this, but from that void came a sort of spontaneous magical essence. A lot less on Transilvanian Hunger seems like it was left up to chance. Darkthrone played this album much more straight than the one before it; there aren't the same sort of abrupt tempo changes, exaggerated tinny tones or oh-so-possibly intentional fuck-ups in the musicianship. Nocturno Culto's vocals lack the same creepy resonance effect in the recording. The recorded tracks have been left about as plain as can be.\n\nAs a performance and style, Transilvanian Hunger was a step down from its predecessors, I think, although I don't think you can fault them for seeing how barebones they could take the sound. It's not quite as twistedly pretty to listen to as Under a Funeral Moon, but the atmosphere is still here in spades. If anything really defines Transilvanian Hunger in my eyes, it's the songwriting they brought to bear. All things considered, Darkthrone are working with a very narrow palette here. The tempo is very consistent and laden with everpresent blastbeats. The riffs are vaguely melodic and minimalistic. Nocturno Culto's garbled snarl is hard to make out, even on the English-sung title track. \n\nThe spectrum is practically narrow enough to paint these tracks as variations on a theme, but Darkthrone's songwriting manages to pull through. Although the atmosphere took a few listens to really appreciate, there were songs here that instantly grabbed me, as though I'd heard them countless times before. \"Transilvanian Hunger\" stands out in particular in my mind for its fuzzy guitar harmony and droning melody. \"Slottet i det fjerne\", \"I en hall med flesk og mj\u00f8d\" and \"En \u00e5s i dype skogen\" hit me equally as hard, and all for the same reasons; all are cold, punishing and unfriendly. Darkthrone do so much with so little here; despite the wilful simplicity of the art they've created here, I only find my admiration growing with each time I listen to it.\n\nSo, the question remains: What would people have made of Transilvanian Hunger, had it been released sometime in the new millennium? I'm honestly not sure. It lacks the chilling high concepts of the two preceding works that would get people excited in this day and age, but when it all comes down to basics, memorable songwriting has an eternal shelf life.\n",
        "\nDarkthrone have had one of the most interesting careers in metal history. For the band arguably most closely associated with black metal clich\u00e9 (alongside Immortal) they remain deceptively unique and strange, even in the wake of countless would-be successors. With each album I've explored from them, it's forced me to reconsider my opinions on the albums around it. The basement fodder sloppiness of A Blaze in the Northern Sky seems that much more like a badge of honour when you consider the technical finesse the Darkthrone boys demonstrated on Soulside Journey the year before. It's taken some hours of intent listening to Under a Funeral Moon then to realize how deceptively sophisticated they actually were on A Blaze in the Northern Sky. Darkthrone cloaked themselves in a murky lo-fi fog with that one, but progressive riffs and ambitious song structures were still present for those with the ears and patience to dig a little deeper.\n\nI now think of Darkthrone's second album as complex because of the new standard Under a Funeral Moon set for terms of sheer minimalism and rawness. A Blaze in the Northern Sky was weird and diverse. This is real black metal. This is the archetype for the cold and frostbitten legions that came hereafter. Darkthrone's third album is rough and completely void of professionalism. Of course, this is not at all because Darkthrone didn't possess A-list musicianship; rather, they knew that spare trinkets and furnishings would only serve to take away from the essence of their atmosphere. The same has been said of Under a Funeral Moon ten thousand times before, but fuck it, I'll say it again: This album is as evil and frigid-sounding as anything ever derived from the Norwegian canon. For whatever it lacks in individually memorable moments or distinctive soundbites, it totally makes up for with regards to its monochromatic, unyielding atmosphere.\n\nOnce you're under the funeral moon, you are trapped. Darkthrone most themselves cited this album as the only true black metal album of their whole career; while most of their post-Soulside, pre-crust material revels in an aura of blackened enshrinement, I would be inclined to agree this is the album that most closely resembles the black metal archetype they're so often accredited for imagining. Darkthrone really are one of the last among the real essentials I got around to checking-- I think I wasn't too excited purely on the merits that I thought I knew exactly what to expect. After all, so many others have done what they've done... but is that really truthful? Minimalistic song structures, repetitive and cold riffs, a treble-fetishizing production and vaguely animalistic vocals are all extremely familiar and probably overdone by this point. I don't think I'm being controversial when I say Under a Funeral Moon would not work, were it not for the band's grasp of atmosphere. As to how Darkthrone managed to perfect atmosphere through the most imperfect of means is beyond me. Unlike some of the other go-to black metal classics however, there's nothing supposedly tongue-in-cheek about the tone of the music. Fenriz and Nocturno Culto may be fun-loving blokes most of the time, but you wouldn't guess from the music itself. The latter's vocals here actually sound possessed, and the omnipresent tinny fuzz does strange things to the psyche, particularly if you listen to the album more than once in a sitting.\n\nDarkthrone's musical endowments take a total backseat to the atmosphere here, though I suppose atmosphere is itself a product of good musicianship. What I think a lot of people tend to overlook here is how interesting (if not conventionally solid) the band's performances here are. The next time you're spinning Under a Funeral Moon, try to pierce through the atmosphere and pay attention to the way they structure songs and write riffs. There is something so counter-intuitive about the way they will abruptly switch paces and ideas in their songs, with precious little to suggest a great deal of thought or intent behind it. Darkthrone were most certainly inspired in creating this album, but it's a wonder how much of the magic was actually intentional. I think that's a great part of the appeal behind this album compared to other, otherwise stronger albums in their discography. Darkthrone tapped into something Otherly here. A certain x-factor that can't be channelled into words so much as felt by the listener attentive enough to give themselves over to the atmosphere. This is what distinguishes Darkthrone from the hordes of soundalikes after them; while most others were making music based solely on their musical influences, Darkthrone were getting part of it from somewhere else entirely.\n",
        "\nDarkthrone are probably the last among the 'essential' bands I hadn't properly checked out. Considering they (amongst the likes of Mayhem and Immortal) have most closely come to exemplify the icy sounds of black metal's Second Wave, it's pretty remarkable to dive into a trope-codifying classic like A Blaze in the Northern Sky, realizing that they're actually much more in a league of their own than many fans give them credit for.\n\nDarkthrone's journey through time and style is one of the most fascinating to be found in metal. Soulside Journey struck me as a fairly exceptional slab of early death metal, and might have foreshadowed a great career in that neighbourhood if Euronymous hadn't gotten the pair into blacker arts. The technical display and relative professionalism displayed on Soulside Journey frames a lot of the baser aspects of A Blaze in the Northern Sky as intentionally rebellious in nature, rather than a case of lacking skills. Similar to Varg Vikernes' own encouragement of conventionally 'low' production values with Burzum, A Blaze in the Northern Sky made its weaknesses into strengths.\n\nThe rest is history, and any stuffy textbook on the rise of metal would probably say much the same. For my own experience, I think I was shirking away from Darkthrone under the misguided impression that it was better to stay up to date with the latest and greatest, and that time spent dawdling about in black metals past would feel overly familiar in the light of the legions of half-baked acolytes that followed them. The frostbitten nihilism and appropriately cold production on A Blaze in the Northern Sky have been parroted to the point of parody, but what's rarely talked about with Darkthrone are the things that otherwise defined them as a unique artist. Darkthrone's first foray into blackened territories may have formed the basis for a lot of future influence, but taken on its own, it's an incredibly compelling navigation of styles, bold and treacherously imperfect.\n\nSay what you will about Darkthrone; if anything may be gleaned from an interview with Mr. Fenriz, it's that the band are as true as can be when it comes to their dedication to music and heavy metal culture. Darkthrone have paved their own path as a natural reflection of their varied musical interests. While that's more apparent in the overall shift of styles (from death to black to crust to traditional) as the years have gone on, you can even hear multiple approaches channelled forth in A Blaze in the Northern Sky. The grizzly, authentically disquieting atmosphere plants the album as a black metal experience first and foremost, but a lot of the riffs betray influences from other spheres, heavy metal, death and doom chief among Darkthrone's parental inspirations. Euronymous' personal influence on the Darkthrone guys musically resulted in the black metal-canon minimalism, but it was never enough to mask their innate love of riffs and metal classicism.\n\nI was surprisingly underwhelmed by A Blaze in the Northern Sky, at least at first. While at first I brushed that off as a result of the Second Wave tropes having been reduced to overfamiliarity in the past years, a few more listens in and I began to realize that feeling was a result of the album lacking a firm sense of focus in comparison to the other so-called masterpieces of the early '90s. The very things that consequently make this album stand out today (the latent doom riffs, the eclectic fuck-you attitude and ambitious riffcraft) are the very stuff that makes the album a surprisingly slow grower. Of course, like most canon classics, the quality comes to light with time and patience. Darkthrone's songwriting may be all over the place here (a testament to your youth and wild ambitions, perhaps) but the distinctive riffs are a treat enough. There's a legitimate weirdness to some of the guitar ideas on this album; especially compared to Soulside Journey there's nothing of a technically demanding nature here, but Darkthrone conjure an immense and foreboding atmosphere through fairly minimal means.\n\nA Blaze in the Northern Sky is an album that almost feels pointless to write about. The people who love Darkthrone already swear by it, and there's a growing number of contemporary listeners that are happy to look past the Second Wave achievements as passe or even not to be taken seriously. I was lamentably part of that latter category for a long time, but it doesn't take long listening to a classic to learn precisely why it was remembered.\n",
        "\nThe Norwegian black metal explosion was based on albums such as \"De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas\", \"Hyis lyset tar oss\", \"In the Nightside Eclipse\", \"Pure Holocaust\" and \"Transilvanian Hunger\". No doubt, Darkthrone have played their part and this deserves our respect. Better still, they have released a huge amount of very strong outputs. But the here presented rip-off does not belong to these releases. Okay, I knew that the demo recordings had been kept hidden from the public for a long time and that they had nothing in common with their black metal works such as \"Panzerfaust\" or \"Under a Funeral Moon\". But I did not know that the pieces also had nothing in common with any kind of acceptable music at all. \"Goatlord\" is the definitive blot of my collection. While listening to this output in order to write a fair and profound review, my sole consolation is that I will never again listen to this rape of music instruments. These tunes make me sick and I will tell you why. But before doing that - does anybody have a barf bag for me?\n\nFirst of all, the totally blurred production with its powerless guitars sucks. Of course, Darkthrone have always been the defenders of shabby sounds. Yet this is no excuse for any kind of shitty productions. Admittedly, one can offer a special mix that does not follow the metallic sound dogmas of pressure, sharpness and vehemence as long as it possesses a specific kind of atmosphere. Too bad that this is exactly the point where \"Goatlord\" fails. It is just tacky and bad.\n\nBut here comes the good news. The insufficiency of the sound is definitely of minor relevance. Even the best production in the history of metal would not have been able to pull the here collected work samples on an adequate level. The compositions are absolutely amateurish. Each and every piece lacks of solid riffs, but this constitutes just one of the many factors that lead into the sonic disaster. The pieces suffer from immature breaks and they are clearly lacking focus. Thousands of mid-tempo parts present crooked harmonies that fail to create a suitable mood. Well, in comparison with black metal, death metal - and these recordings were declared as death metal, for whatever reasons - is less based on atmosphere. Nevertheless, it needs a minimum of flair or charm. But Darkthrone did not share this point of view or they were just not able to generate an appropriate aura. \n\nThe worst detail of this pile of shit is the vocal performance. Admittedly, the masculine vocals are fairly acceptable. But the rarely appearing female vocals are totally gruesome. Celtic Frost knew how to integrate female vocals, just remember their godlike opus \"Necromantical Screams\". But on \"Goatlord\" we are listening to the stupid sister of Celtic Frost\u00b4s guest singer. Weird, crude and lousy, these attributes describe her performance in a sufficient way. Hell yes, this \"sister\" is very sick - and that is the point where the Scorpions come into play. No, they do not play death or black metal (with the exception of \"Still Loving You\" and \"Wind of Change\", of course). But they knew that \"He\u00b4s a Woman - She\u00b4s a Man\". Therefore, it comes as no surprise that the female vocals were contributed by Fenriz and \"guest star\" Satyr. However, they are miserable and celebrate the triumph of idiocy.\n\nIt makes no sense to speak about the individual songs. If one wants to be very polite, one can describe them with the term \"experimental\". But in fact, all of them are an insult to every fan of extreme metal. Summing up, Darkthrone\u00b4s career seems to be based on a very strong fundament. \"Goatlord\" would otherwise have been able to damage their reputation sustainably in a matter of minutes.\n",
        "\nFor some reason, Panzerfaust is an album that never got the respect it deserved. While people have warmed up to it very much, it still isn't hard to find people. This is Black Sabbath if Black Sabbath were pissed off Norwegians who knew Euronymous. Panzerfaust isn't trying to be the next Transylvanian Hunger, it isn't trying to grow Darkthrone's audience, shit, it isn't even trying to sound sober but what it lacks in raw black metal, it makes up for in it's doom-drenched riffs. \n\nPanzerfaust is full of great, buzzing guitars, churning out some excellent and surprisingly catchy chords. The big hitters for me in these categories being \"Triumphant Gleam\" and \"Quintessence\", the former also having some of Darkthrone's best drumming, with Fenriz discarding the usual black metal beats in exchange for a slightly slower but still pounding kicks and snares that really make the song come to life as an anthem of war. I also really enjoy the closing track \"Sn\u00f8 og granskog\", it's an eerie chant spoken by Fenriz and it works incredibly well.\n\nThere really isn't a bad song here, everything is just as heavy as its always been, just now it more doom-inspired black metal, instead of death-inspired black metal, which I think I prefer a little bit.\n\nUnfortunately, while the instrumentation is as good as it's ever been, the vocals are really crap in comparison to Darkthrones other albums. Culto was supposedly drunk while recording them, and I guess Fenriz was high enough to not make him some eggs or something and make him record them later. The vocals feel like they're from completely different songs, all out of time and just weird. Culto's vocal depth has also been lost, which is a shame as he usually makes use of many different techniques that make his performances come to life. To be fair, some of the later songs do sound a little more sober but not by much. It's an interesting sound, but it really doesn't pay off. \n\nAs well as that, did we really need another track written by Varg? I mentioned before that I liked \"Quintessence\" but the lyrics just don't fit with the rest of the album that well in my opinion. Varg should just stick to writing his own stuff where he has control of the song that fits around it. \n\nFor all I've said, Panzerfaust is a hard album to summarise. If you loved Darkthrones previous work, or even didn't like it all that much, this album is still worth your time. It's an excellent blend of genres and a great accompaniment to Transylvanian Hunger.\n",
        "\nDarkthrone have managed to reinvent themselves over and over again and \"Total Death\" does not constitute an exemption. The barrenness of the outer space artwork had not much in common with their previous covers and the first track also pointed in a then new direction. The grandeur of the mightily hammering opener showed a previously unknown side of the Norwegian duo. To create a majestic aura was a challenge that the band mastered in a glorious way. Nevertheless, I had to get used to the mid-tempo approach that welcomed me. Of course, \"Panzerfaust\" had already been less speed focused than its ultimately furious predecessor. Anyway, a mid-paced opener surprised me. An album which was titled \"Total Death\" seemed to promise another song design. But Darkthrone did not only concentrate on mid-paced pieces (and the strong opener itself picked up speed after three and a half minutes).\n\nRawness and ugliness still played an important role. Icy leads and high velocity parts also belonged to the significant components. The well implemented combination of these two elements led to the highlight of the album. \"Gather for Attack on the Pearly Gates\" scored exactly with these ingredients, although its belligerent atmosphere was worth mentioning, too. This also followed from the production. The track - as well as the further pieces of the first half of \"Total Death\" - was equipped with a grim and hateful sound that had nothing in common with any kind of rehearsal recordings. Unfortunately, the somewhat dotty dudes recorded the album during two sessions. As a consequence thereof, the second half of the album did not benefit from a proper mix. Darkthrone went back to the roots, but these roots were rotten. Rattling drums - the snare drum seemed to suffer from asthma - and blurred guitars prevented a vigorous appearance of the songs. Due to their lack of power, a further speed hammer like \"Ravnajuv\" failed to blow the listener away. This was a pity, because this track actually possessed everything that a raw black metal eruption needs. Its merciless leads and the hostile vocals shaped a further highlight of the album. Despite the catastrophic production, the song was on an equal footing with the more meticulously produced \"Blackwinged\".\n\nIrrespective of its minor stylistic changes, the foundation of \"Total Death\" consisted of pure black metal. Song titles like \"Blasphemer\" underlined the compositional approach and its malignant aura was a further hint. Apart from questions of style, Darkthrone did not present any type of filling material. During the 35 minutes of this album, the necessity of the skip button does not become obvious. Well, some might say that \"Total Death\" lacks of spectacular ideas, but I do not care. Instead of trying to revitalize the formula of \"Transylvanian Hunger\" one more time, Darkthrone just released a fine collection of tracks. Those of you who do not always need a powerful production may add five or ten percentage points.\n",
        "\nOccasionally in life, something comes before an object to prevent you seeing it clearly. For anyone who has ever been to the Louvre Museum in Paris in the hope of catching a glimpse of the 'Mona Lisa', you will know that the picture itself is never what you end up seeing; rather, you will perhaps see the picture, but you will certainly see the heads and shoulders of a few hundred people standing in front of you, who are also trying to see the picture and waving their cameras and shouting, so that your impression of the art is of its popularity, not of its skill or beauty. The painting itself is a mirage, or a mythology, to use a Barthesian term, which is obscured by its own fame, preventing us from ever looking at it as itself.\n\nSuch is the case with Darkthrone's 'A Blaze in the Northern Sky'. Part historical landmark, part heavy metal album, it has become difficult to take an objective view on the importance and the execution of the music on this release. In terms of the genre question, I come down firmly on the side of black metal for a couple of reasons: firstly, this release has been taken in by the black metal movement and certainly has the most aesthetic, atmospheric, and thematic qualities in common with the genre; secondly, this album plays more like the last statement of the first wave of black metal than any other subgenre, keeping (as always with Darkthrone) one foot in the past of Hellhammer and Bathory and Venom, while also introducing the signature grimness and snowy fuzz that would mark most second wave black metal to come. Sure, the vocals are a little distant from the high-pitched, unearthly wail that would arrive, but that has never defined the genre for me - black metal has always been more about intent than specific execution.\n\nDarkthrone do have one thing that really goes for them as a result of the slight stylistic lag from their death metal material. The riffs and the tone of the guitars end up a lot more powerful than many later releases, since the sound is often quite thick and crunchy, making some of the more obvious speed riffs (not really death or thrash or black) on 'Paragon Belial' and the title track really sit up and sweep through the listener's stomach with wonderful dynamics and powerful groove. Some of the faster tremolo riffs stay a bit thin, and a large part of 'Where Cold Winds Blow' is without character, but the aggression of Fenriz's blastbeats saves it a little, even if it becomes repetitive too quickly. In fact, all of the instrumentalists play with more variety in style than would govern a normal black metal album, thus providing a more interesting approach than on, say, 'Transylvanian Hunger', which maintains its integrity to the point of being a little predictable.\n\nThe thing that really makes 'A Blaze' work is that the songs are so damn good for the most part. The way that they are structured makes little sense and sometimes the transitions between sections are roughly formed, yet that's what makes them exciting and unnerving, especially on a song like 'Paragon Belial' when the creepy higher guitars come in and slowly morph from ugly brooding gargoyles (some would say melodies, but that doesn't seem right) into a creepy and sweeping riff. The slower sections hold up the album so well and give it more character than a thousand blasts and icy tremolos could ever achieve. As such, when 'The Pagan Winter' crawls through its middle part, it gets better and never loses its focus, giving off a definite aroma of the North, along with the almost scenic mid-paced riffs that Fenriz wisely chooses not to add too much drumwork to. As I mentioned earlier, the only song that disappoints me is 'Where Cold Winds Blow', while 'Kaatharian Life Code' ends up a little unwieldy and less essential, though not without merit.\n\nThe thing that settles it for me is that 'A Blaze in the Northern Sky' is good to listen to and plays to more than one mood as well. I can put this album on in the middle of the night to creep myself out, I can listen to it in the car when I'm late, I can listen to it in a foul depression - hell, I even played it at a party once. The whole thing hangs together very well considering that it isn't really well-planned and mixes styles to a certain extent, meaning that rocking out and soul-searching don't need to be mutually exclusive activities. Plus, there's that line in the title track that cannot fail to send a shiver up your spine: remember Christians - \"The next thousand years are OURS.\" That's black metal.\n",
        "\nMy initial reaction upon seeing another of these Darkthrone compilations was not a positive one. Beyond Preparing for War and the Frostland Tapes, they seem to have become an increasingly useless proposition to free the band's audience from some of their hard earned scratch, culminating with the inane and worthless Introducing Darkthrone, which as we all know sits gathering dust at the local record shop alongside Introducing Ricky Martin and the much sought after Introducing The Monkees. However, despite the level of bile rising in my throat every time one of my favorite bands is either served some rehashed anthology dreck, I am forced to swallow a glass of water with Black Death and Beyond because there are actually some touches of personal involvement with this LP set that might just make it worthwhile, at least for a collector, not necessarily for anyone who is first coming into their music; those individuals should immediately proceed to experiencing their full-length albums regardless of the media upon which they are printed.\n\nNo, there is nothing new musically on the recording, which still reduces its overall value enormously and bars it from becoming a mandatory acquisition, but how they've exactly ORGANIZED the tunes here is at least interesting. The 'Black', 'Death' and 'Beyond' in the title actually correspond to how they've arranged the chronological material, with one vinyl devoted to the earlier death metal years, another to the middle phase, exclusively raw black metal, and the 'Beyond' represents their later deviations towards punk, speed metal and ultimately heavy metal. It's a neat gimmick with which to parse out the band's stylistic mutations, and give the listener a little more uninterrupted immersion as if he/she were listening to a Darkthrone album of a particular niche. Past that, you can also tell by the song selection that Fenriz was actually more involved in the selection, since this is not just some 'best of...' arrangement with the band's 'better known' material, but a mix of the more popular ragers and the obscure. As invested as I am in the majority of their discography, which features very few tunes that I do NOT adore, it's still quite affirming to find that the creators themselves hold tracks like \"The Wind They Called the Dungeon Shaker\", \"Graveyard Slut\" and \"The Ones You Left Behind\" in such regard. That's not to say it's an 'ultimate collection', because that would require the band just releasing a 16-LP box set which I would possibly sell a few organs on the black market to acquire. But there's a bit more qualification here than just 'throw a bunch of random songs together'.\n\nEven better than that, the set comes with an excellent, lavish book loaded with photos, biographical info, interviews of the band and others, and this is something that should sell like hotcakes even if separated from the boxed set (no idea if it will be). I can't attest to the book alone covering the value of the entire purchase, but this is something deserved and that I'm sure a lot of us were waiting for. Fenriz and Culto are nothing if not constantly entertaining personalities, and there are even some words with the old bassist Dag Nilsen in there. Yet another component which keeps this release hovering over the edge of the fire, though I fear with only about 3000 copies in circulation, not enough of the audience will be able to get their hands on it (maybe a separate physical release or a .pdf floating around could fix that). Of course that assumes more than 3000 people actually desire to read such a thing, but if not then the state of the world is far sadder than we thought. In the end, an additional disc with a bunch of unreleased or exclusive material would have padded out the deal and made this far more mandatory, but the addition of the book, and the minimum of effort arranging the musical content protect this from the typical artillery shelling such compilations deserve. Is it still a Peaceville profiteering sham? To an extent, and $70-80 US is steep for a bunch of music you likely already own, but the track selection flows well through the discs, and there is at least a qualifying 'cool factor' to compensate. But buy it for the book, or not at all.\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nAround 1994, something interesting started happening in the Norwegian black metal movement where many of the movement originators, such as Darkthrone, Burzum, Emperor and Enslaved, as well as then newcomers Dimmu Borgir, began taking the genre in a direction distinctive from what Mayhem had laid down. Whether this was the result of Euronymous' murder (and thus Mayhem's diminishing influence on the Norwegian movement) or a coincidental shift in tone, the Norwegian black metal bands began to take inspiration not just in the first wave bands such as Bathory or Celtic Frost, but in their own history, culture and natural landscapes, hence an increased interest in Norse paganism, a lyrical focus on the natural world and the usage of the Norwegian language in the songs. I mention this bit of history because, at first glance, Darkthrone's \"Transilvanian Hunger\" seems and sounds like a fairly conservative black metal album. The guitars are raw and fast, backed up by constant blast beat drumming and the cover features a corpse paint sporting Fenriz in a black background much like their previous two albums. Look deeper into the album, and instead you will be presented with an interesting case: an album cloaked in the traditional, darkness obsessed approach of black metal, but underneath is an album as grandiose as anything by a classical composer, with a lyrical approach that goes beyond the death and Satan trappings that black metal is associated with.\n\nAlthough nominally a Darkthrone album, the final product can ultimately be attributed to two musicians whose contributions are equally important, though separate in effect: Fenriz, the instrumentalist, and Varg Vikernes of Burzum, who wrote much of the lyrics for the later half of the album. The musical decisions Fenriz made on this album must be emphasized first, as that is what immediately catches the listener's intention. From the opening strains of the title track, we are presented with guitar work that is about as equally primitive as it is melodic. Underneath the guitars for this and other songs such as \"Scald av Satans sol\" and \"En as I Dype Skogen\", you can hear a tune that could have easily been played as part of a movie soundtrack or a classical symphony. There is also an increased emphasis on allowing the buzzing of the guitars to create a cold atmosphere reminiscent of the blowing winter winds in a dark forest (you can almost make out the sounds of leaves crunching in the title track, further heightening this feeling), which sets this album apart from it's predecessor \"Under a Funeral Moon\", which was focused on creating an absolute musical attack without much thought for transporting it's listener to a world elsewhere. \n\nThis approach to the music is not without it's flaws however, and at more than a couple of points throughout the album, the music seems to stagnate, emphasizing passages that are not particularly interesting and repeating them ad naseaum. The real culprit here is \"Slottet I det Fjerne\", with a riff that is certainly dark, but lacks the melody of the title track or the sinister, foreboding qualities of \"Graven Takeheimens Saler\", which sounds like it could be a villain's theme song or \"Scald av Satans sol\" with a dark riff that sounds surprisingly Arabic. To the credit of \"Slottet I det Fjerne\", it is one of the only tracks on the album that makes an attempt at a guitar solo, which is a welcome change of pace from the largely riff driven sound on the album. I don't believe guitar solos have to be on an album, but on their previous works, Darkthrone were more than capable of doing leads and the occasional inclusion of such leads offered a change of pace that kept the music from staying at the same level throughout. \"Transilvanian Hunger\", by contrast, is stripped down significantly in terms of song structure, though the cold feeling the riffs convey make up for the lack of pace changing.\n\nAs far as the lyrics are concerned, I would first like to point out that of the eight songs on the album, only two are in English. I don't know whether this was the influence of lyrical collaborator Varg Vikernes, but the shift to mostly Norwegian is important, since it also comes along with a shift in lyrical content. Find a translation of the lyrics, particularly those written by Varg, and you will see that while the approach to the lyrics still has that dark, blasphemous quality to it, there is also a focus on the pagan world, on ancient mead halls and battles with Christian warriors that seem removed from the musical and visual aesthetic of the album. The best lyrics are naturally to be found on the best song on the album, \"En As I Dype Skogen\", with it's Lord of the Rings references (\"Nine armed men, nine gray proud horses, carrying a banner on which the eye turned out\" is, translated in English, one of the passages in the songs) and the choral vocals set in the background that make this seem like it could be on a modern symphonic black metal release if not for the production quality. Even some of the lyrics of Fenriz have a similar elevated subject matter, such as can be found in \"Over Fjell Og Gjennom Torner\" and \"Slottet I det Fjerne\" the first of which describes the heat of battle, the second calls to mind ancient pagan rituals. Today, such a lyrical focus is commonplace, but at the time it was a step up from the Satanic obsessions that Darkthrone expressed in their previous records.\n\n\"Transilvanian Hunger\" is not the perfect Darkthrone record or even the perfect Norwegian black metal record; the music is far too stripped down for my black metal taste and almost never changes pace, if even for a moment. This doesn't mean that the album's value is purely historical, however. The importance of this album to black metal in Norway cannot be underestimated, since it, along with many other albums at the time, signaled a shift to writing songs in their native language with a focus on the more pagan side of mysticism. But the album also works as an example of how you can meld two different approaches to a genre together, and come up with a product that is not only consistent, but enjoyable to listen to. Even if you are not a fan of the buzz saw guitar aesthetic, the music has enough melody hidden underneath the fuzz, the overall sound of the album is cold and otherworldly enough and the lyrics are surprisingly poetic enough that may find yourself listening to the album more than once.\n",
        "\nThe Unholy Trilogy. It\u2019s pretty untouchable. There is nary a black metal fan who would argue that any other album in Darkthrone\u2019s discography can bump them from the top 3; and they would be right. However, I would argue that of all of the albums that came after, Hate Them is the one that comes closest to in quality and sits comfortably at #4.\n\nA little aside, those familiar with the often hilarious commentaries that have been released with the majority of the DT catalog at this point are familiar with Fenriz\u2019s own opinions of the albums (or \u201cparts of songs\u201d as he would put it). I\u2019ve never seen Fenriz definitively rank his albums, and he doesn\u2019t seem like the type who would. Even so, having heard all of the commentaries, Fenriz speaks the most highly of this one. Some may be surprised to hear that he spends the majority of even A Blaze in the Northern Sky talking about what terrible black/death melding shit it is. I think Fenriz himself might rank this in his top three, but I digress.\n\nThe fact is, Hate Them is a solid album. I think it gets a bad rap given its position smack dab in the middle of their post-trilogy discography, sandwiched between the unfortunate Plaguewielder and meh Sardonic Wrath. But taken out of context, there is a lot to like here. For one, the mix strikes a nice balance. It lacks the icy cold feel of its predecessors, but makes up for it with its grittiness and the levelness of the instruments. \n\nVocals are grim and powerful, but not grating as on Panzerfaust. The guitar manages a nice melding of the old with a more punk style. If you took the riffs from Under a Funeral Moon and Transylvanian Hunger, put them in a blender with some caffeine and testosterone, you\u2019d get the Hate Them sound. A back to back listen with Celtic Frost\u2019s To Mega Therion further illustrates the full circle that has happened here. Finally, the drums are just excellent. There is so much energy. While Blaze is my favorite album for the drums, Fenriz\u2019s position against \u201cfancy pants\u201d drumming has left him favoring a more minimalist approach. That said, this is the most he has sounded like he has cared since that first album. Just listen to \u201cStriving for a Piece of Lucifer.\u201d That is the kit work of someone who is having a blast; and how the beats gel with the really cool riffs doesn\u2019t hurt either.\n\nSome might argue that the punk influence is a bad thing for black metal, or that this is too black n\u2019 roll. But I challenge you to listen to early Mayhem, Bathory, or Venom and tell me to my face that there is not a shred of punk on those albums. Nocturno and Fenriz could have easily performed this music as kids in the 90\u2019s and I doubt anyone would have cried foul. \u201cIn Honour of Thy Name,\u201d aside from also sporting excellent guitar and drums, has a vocal delivery that sounds straight off of De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas.\n\nAnother standout track is the opener, \u201cRust.\u201d My God. That simple, yet effective riff with those deliberately plodding drums is absolutely imposing. Midway, Fenriz even conjures up the ol\u2019 blastbeat: something he normally avoids as a rule due to over-saturation in the genre. But here, it seems serendipitous. The various fills sprinkled in make it far more interesting than most of the blueprint black metal being pumped out today. And the riffs all just feel so evocative.\n\nI could go on, but I\u2019ll let the album speak for itself. I highly recommend listening to this album if you are a fan of Darkthrone or the other bands I have mentioned. If you heard this before and didn\u2019t give it the time of day, I encourage you to give it another go while considering the points I have made and doing your best to put bias aside.\n",
        "\nThis album is probably my least favorite out of the \u201cUnholy Trilogy.\u201d This is not an insult. If you won a bronze metal at the Olympics, damned if you wouldn\u2019t be proud of it. Anyways, from what I can gather, my ears are just not kvlt enough to fully appreciate it. My favorite is A Blaze in the Northern Sky, which Fenriz himself rails against even on the commentary track for containing too much death metal influence and \u201cfancy pants\u201d drumming. Under a Funeral Moon, on the other hand, he calls their only true black metal album.\n\nBeing a guitarist and former drummer, his complaints about the first album are exactly what draw me to it. There are a number of deceivingly simplistic, but interesting and memorable riffs. The drumming showcases a lot of variety as well, more so than on later releases. But enough. This is a review of the latter, not the former.\n\nThe entire sound has been stripped down, likely to fit a much more prototypical template. The drum kit was literally broken down to a few pieces and the playing is far more simplistic. The recording of the drums is also purposefully reduced in quality. The blast beats sound like distant cardboard being beaten with spoons. You could probably recreate it with a busted microphone and your hands slapping on your thighs. There are really only two style here: blast beats and mid-tempo 4/4 with a simple cymbal fill here and there.\n\nRegarding the guitars, gone are most of the hooks and almost progressive elements of the last album. They have been replaced by a handful of simple riffs consisting mostly of alternating power chords and tremolo picking. Occasionally there is a standout, particularly on the main riff of the title track which I absolutely dig. Everything else fits very much in with the buzz and drone of fellow band Burzum. The difference is that Darkthrone keeps the songs to fairly average length and follow a more conventional rock structure. As for the bass, you can actually hear it, which is more than can be said about a lot of \u201ctr00\u201d black metal. It has a nice heavy, distorted buzz that is similar to hardcore punk. Not surprising given Fenriz\u2019s taste for the 80\u2019s and crust punk.\n\nThere is not much to be said of Nocturno\u2019s vocals other than that I like them. They are a bit less aggressive and volatile this time around, but they fit the overall atmosphere. They come through slowly with a nice echo, like a demon calling out from hell. Definitely creepy and not at all obnoxious compared to some of the newer groups that tried to adopt this style.\n\nNow to an untrained eye, all that I\u2019ve said seems to add up to a negative review. Wrong. All of my points about the changes in guitar, drums, and production come together quite well to create a masterpiece of atmosphere. While I generally see that term as a masturbatory way of saying \u201cboring,\u201d here it is not so. The album carries a nice cohesive darkness, the songs never overstay their welcome, and few have managed to hit a balance like this before or since. Just when I find myself thinking \u201cokay\u2026I\u2019ve heard enough of this riff,\u201d they move onto the next song. Standout tracks are Natassja in Eternal Sleep, Summer of the Diabolical Holocaust, To Walk the Eternal Fields, and Under a Funeral Moon. I will always recommend Blaze and Transylvanian Hunger over this album, but it is no less important to hearing the foundations of black metal and Darkthrone.\n",
        "\nLike the previous year's Hate Them, Sardonic Wrath is part of Darkthrone's 00s rebirth from the dark ashes of Black Metal into something a little less \"black\", but arguably more \"metal\". Of course, that doesn't necessarily mean fans welcomed the shift, particularly because the band seemed to embrace an idea of just celebrating metal itself, riffs, booze-y attitude and all, at the expense of all the enigmatic imagery and murky, subterranean evil-ness of their more famous BM offerings.\n\nI, for one, am a big fan of Sardonic Wrath (and 2003's Hate Them too). Where records such as Transylvanian Hunger or A Blaze In the Northern Sky masked their sounds in layers of lo-fidelity, Sardonic Wrath brings all the spiky, cutting sound to the forefront. The guitars fill almost the entire sonic spectrum with glorious, LOUD distortion. The riffs are simple, but effective -- I'd pit the almost Sabbath-y sludge of \"Alle Gegen Alle\" or the high-speed breakdown in \"Hate Is the Law\" against most else in the band's catalog. The drums are clearer than on any of the classic BM trilogy records, and while Fenriz probably won't ever go down as one of the truly *great* metal drummers, his style perfectly suits this music. Personally, I'll take the ring of his ride cymbal during the blastbeat that opens \"Information Wants to Be Syndicated\" (one of my favorite Darkthrone titles) over anyone else's. \n\nThe album as a whole sounds angry and inspired, again similar to Hate Them. It's almost as if the band is making up for lost time, which I'd argue they were, considering the limp reception greeted the records following 1995's Panzerfaust. When you compare the sound of Sardonic Wrath with, say, Total Death or Plaguewielder, it's hard not to notice how much more aggressive, confident it sounds. Fittingly, it's also the last record where you can hear \"black metal\" from Darkthrone, but for my money, they kissed off that style with with a bang.\n\nAfter this, the band would change up their sound a bit, diving headfirst into a kind of \"punk\"-influenced black'n'roll (though more accurately, just substituting their love of Bathory for their love of Motorhead). Although you can hear aspects of Darkthrone's classic style on Sardonic Wrath, it's easier to hear it as edging towards something new. Aggressive, no-frills, loud as hell and fun at the same time. Sure, like all Darkthrone records, some of the songs tend to run together in my head, but the best stuff is as good as almost anything they've done.\n",
        "\nHate Them was Darkthrone's return from the murky late-90s/early 00s, and albums like Ravishing Grimness and Plaguewielder. More to the point, it was Fenriz's return from a prolonged bout of depression and delving into psychedelics (not to mention handing over most of Darkthrone's songwriting duties to Nocturno Culto), and anyone sufficiently into Darkthrone's (now) back catalog will notice a brighter, more aggressive touch to this record compared with its predecessors.\n\nIt's not that Hate Them is a masterpiece. As with most Darkthrone records after their classic Black Metal trilogy of the early 90s, its spiritual roots are in a record like 1995's Panzerfaust, mixing BM, punkish, booze-y Motorhead rock and roll, and Celtic Frost/Hellhammer-styled jams into a kind of all-purpose Darkthrone headbang-stew. BM purists will likely think the record is a letdown, and in terms of how it relates to, say, Under A Funeral Moon or Transylvanian Hunger, it is. It's NOT a *scary* record, but rather an aggressive, angry, no-frills one. It sounds amazing -- clear, heavy, cutting guitar sound and great vocals. And, except for Sardonic Wrath (which came immediately after it), Hate Them doesn't really sound like much else in the band's catalog. In songwriting terms, it's more Black Metal-styled than most of what they did afterwards, though nowhere near as enigmatic/lo-fi/atmospheric as their classic trilogy.\n\nMy favorite tracks are \"Fucked Up And Ready to Die\" (check the awesome tritone riff accompanied by 12/8 blastbeat), \"Divided We Stand\" (NWOBHM tempo, thrash-y riffing and VERY un-BM power chords in the break) and the opener \"Rust\". Once you get past its lengthy intro, you get a minor-key riff-sludge and slow, ultra-simple drumming. Normally, that's not necessarily what you want from Darkthrone, but to lead off what is essentially their 00s \"rebirth\" record, it's a great warning that this band follows its own path, no matter the cost. (Which, in all honesty, doesn't seem to be much except the occasional BM \"purist\" calling them out on a messageboard somewhere.)\n\nI think Hate Them is about equal in quality to its follow-up Sardonic Wrath, but not as good as something like Panzerfaust. It's a \"mature\" Darkthrone record, from arguably their last era that could be described as \"black metal\". However, it's also the first one that really shows the band breaking beyond their (well-earned) reputation as BM pioneers.\n",
        "\nI was looking around at an HMV for some black metal stuff which was tough considering there was only the stuff I heard, but that's another story for another time. That story however lead me into buying this CD by Darkthrone knowing it's a black metal band. Little to my knowledge the band went to a more punky and thrashy sound with black lyrics. Now I am a fan of thrash metal and hardcore punk at times, but I really didn't expect this from Darkthrone and I was hoping for the traditional black take. This album is seriously a hit and miss but there's it's good points and it's bad points within it.\n\nThe songs all were very thrash styled but had some elements of doom, heavy, crust punk, and well duh, black. It mostly stayed towards the thrash and it was like Darkthrone were trying to be Slayer or any of those more evil sounding thrash bands with songs like \"Leave No Cross Unturned\". From my research after I bought the album I learned this album was a tribute to the speed, heavy, thrash, and doom bands out there, which it felt too much like Darkthrone was trying to be something they weren't. (And nobody likes a rip-off band.) I will say, I did listen to the crust punk by Darkthrone and I don't think it's that great so that really just adds to the fiery confusion of an opinion on this release. Some bands happen to begin leaning towards another genre and ditching the previous one only to the fan's knowledge to learn they start to sound not so interesting. (Metallica, I'm looking at you here.) This really seems to be the case with the actual musical content of this release because it felt like the most generic thrash ever and it was really hard to actually get myself to keep listening and enjoy it. For instrumentation, the drums were mostly just fast-paced with certain times they'd be slower, and the guitar was just like an early Slayer demo to be bluntly honest. Vocals, or just everything recorded; sounded very half-assed and like they really didn't give a fuck about the quality of the song structures like \"Screw it, this will be good enough.\" and had a few more beers so they could forget this was their own album they just recorded.\n\nThe actual case of the limited edition mediabook is really nice. The artwork is done well, it's very solid, and the booklet inside has some interesting things. (Such as that long ass list of praise in Norwegian.) The photos in the booklet are quite well done and of course the lyrics are in there too if you actually enjoy the album and want to sing along to it. In terms of the packaging, they did quite the job though it would have been nice to get some little item in there like a Darkthrone patch or whatever memorabilia bands like doing for their merchandise. I also really felt Darkthrone's use of their logo is going to throw people off, considering that logo looks very much like black metal and not like anything they've recorded on this album. (People really pay attention to small details, and logos are one that's looked at heavily.)\n\nReally, what I think of this album is that it really depends on the person listening. I didn't exactly enjoy it but I didn't hate it, and sometimes it's a little fun to hear, even if it's not the Darkthrone I know and enjoy. If you're a fan of Darkthrone's crust punk and non-black stuff, you'll probably like this. If you're more for Darkthrone's black metal, this really isn't worth the time and you'll most likely be disappointed unless you also listen to thrash. This is a solid 50% rating for me because as said earlier, really depends on the person listening. Personally, I don't think Darkthrone should have ever moved away from black but times change and we still have the old releases of their black metal days.\n",
        "\nAs far as black metal is concerned, this may very well be the zenith. A bleak monochromatic soundscape set on a pedestal so high that only the select few will be able to envision. Under A Funeral Moon creates an album of such unrelenting darkness and nihilism that all other black metal albums seem light in comparison. Atmosphere will always be the key to success for a black metal band and Under A Funeral Moon delivers it in spades.\n\nHow does one go about creating atmosphere? This has always wondered me and I have spent many an hour debating this. There is no one way in which atmosphere can be created, but the end result is usually the same. Black metal strives to be dark, cold and misanthropic. Whether this is by a depressive black metal band creating an atmosphere of pure unrelenting agony, or an atmospheric band crafting long droning hymns to celebrate the winter, atmosphere in black metal (usually) comes across as cold and inhospitable. Needless to say there is always exceptions to the rule, with recent years showing an influx in the laughably named \u201cgood guy\u201d black metal scene, with bands such as Altar of Plagues, Fen and Wolves in the Throne Room instantly coming to mind. However, one must realize that no other album has created the same unrelenting loneliness and emptiness that defines Under A Funeral Moon.\n\nIt can be said that Under A Funeral Moon serves as the counterweight to Transilvanian Hunger. Far away from said albums melodic sensibility, Under A Funeral Moon is dissonant, almost bordering on the outright atonal. Riffs seem to come and go in a random fashion, the songs defy conventional structure. Rhythms are strange and incoherent, with the seemingly random use of repetition making it even more off kilter and unconventional. The production makes this album all the more deranged, with the drums and bass being very distant whilst guitars and vocals are loud and piercingly thin. \n\nWhilst many will pass this up in favor for Transilvanian Hunger, when looking at this album from a critical viewpoint it becomes clearer that Under A Funeral Moon is far more important in influencing the musical nature of black metal than Transilvanian Hunger which was far more important in cementing the genres primary aesthetics. Although Transilvanian Hunger is another flawless album, Under A Funeral Moon remains all the more compelling and intriguing. The bizarre nature of the songs coupled with the powerful vocals and perplexing riff changes makes for an album that is constantly challenging. There is really nothing accessible about this release, it is a black metal sound stream that is anything but therapeutic. \n\nSimilar to the ironically named Swans, Under A Funeral Moon is a prime example of beauty through ugliness. Each song, despite being uniformly dark has a strong sense of somber melody. The criticisms leveled at this album are entirely legit; it is essentially a sloppily played, minimalistic opus of droning black metal with very low fi production values. However, each criticism can easily be disapproved by saying it was all intentional. People who are focusing on superficial aspects only whilst ignoring the music as a whole are missing the entire point of the album. As an album that aimed to create an atmosphere of pure unrelenting darkness then you can\u2019t do any better than this.\n\nIt comes clear that right from the start, with the introductory track Natassja in Eternal Sleep what Darkthrone aim to do. With jagged riffs lurching in strange patterns and vocals that sound like Nocturno Culto has risen from the grave, the sense of coldness embodies in the first track serves to foreshadow the dark and misanthropic journey the listener is about to depart on. There\u2019s a very good sense of flow throughout this album, each track serves as a natural evolution of the ideas laid down by the former. Despite the unnatural nature of these compositions, the sound remains surprisingly natural and organic. Gone are the death metal elements of the bands past, the sound has been exorcised of all unnecessary elements. Gone is the powerful drumming that dominated the past albums, with Fenriz learning more about how black metal drumming should sound and thus toning it down. \n\nStripped down is an apt descriptor for this album and therefore can often be seen as a primary influence on the modern day bedroom black metal scene. The influence that Under A Funeral Moon has sown upon the black metal scene is undeniable and to this day, remains one of the most challenging yet rewarding albums in black metal history. Essential.\n",
        "\nHaving taken to playing for several albums in a punk-influenced style, this new Darkthrone release takes yet another anthological look at what originally inspired them, then to be thrown into a modern framework.\n\nThis has made for mildly entertaining material at times, though on an artistic level will never eclipse any of their material from \u2018Soulside Journey\u2019 through to \u2018Panzerfaust\u2019.\n\nNotable on here is the exchange here between Nocturno Culto and Fenriz for individual songwriting. The former goes for more atavistic, punk and thrash influenced compositions and a Tom G Warrior esque vocal, whilst the latter takes a strong aversion toward traditional metal and a doom influence that recalls work with Isengard, using clean sung vocals.\n\nAt it\u2019s most aggressive, some of the riffs used are very much akin to the Celtic Frost inspired motifs on \u2018Panzerfaust\u2019 or \u2018A Blaze In The Northern Sky\u2019, some riffs even having nuances of the techniques on earlier Bathory albums, but often sound as if they were just thrown in as a sole means to please old school nostalgics.\n\nFor certain, the aesthetic alone will tick the right values for those seeking a record that is merely there to be enjoyed, but the depth and atmosphere that made Darkthrone essential years ago is gone here.\n\nFor instance, the first breakdown riff of \u2018Leave No Cross Unturned\u2019 sounds identical to the opening riff of \u2018In The Shadow Of The Horns\u2019, though is ill-fitting with an otherwise entertaining heavy metal song that early on recalls the likes of Omen, Agent Steel or Brocas Helm, only to wear out it\u2019s welcome mid-way through its 14 minutes.\n\nThere are short moments of excellence, such as the mid-section of \u2018The Ones You Left Behind\u2019, with a quite resonating melodic lead, but it all seems stuck in a plethora of drudging motifs that merely entertain, but never transcend it any further.\n\nWhere newer bands like the NWOBHM inclined Enforcer and the now on-hold Hour Of 13 have put out work that treads old ground with clarity, Darkthrone sound muddled and confused.\n\nThe term \u2018every dog has its day\u2019 flashes heavily when listening to \u2018The Underground Resistance\u2019. It\u2019s symbolic of a band totally bereft of ideas. Whilst they have more or less admitted to taking on a \u2018give less of a fuck\u2019 attitude, the sense of continuity wears itself thin quite fast.\n\nhttp://stenchofishtar.wordpress.com/2013/03/12/darkthrone-the-underground-resistance/\n",
        "\nWhat is it that makes a good black metal album? I have always considered atmosphere to be the absolute key to black metal. Atmosphere can be achieved in many ways, through orchestrations or unconventional instruments (Lustre, Emperor, Summoning etc), but what I have come to realise, is that NO other black metal album creates the pure darkness and bitterly-cold despair that is heard on Under A Funeral Moon. And we are not talking dreamy keyboards and menacing symphonies, we are talking raw minimalism and by god is it effective. \n\nFrom when 'Natassja In Eternal Sleep' kicks in, the riffs are very repetitive but teeming with menace. The ultra-thin guitars create an eerie, hypnotic soundscape unlike no other, and even though some might complain about the production quality it is a key factor in making this album so dark. Black metal is rarely based around good production, and sometimes it can be unlistenable (Pure Fucking Armageddon anyone?), but this is different. This is how the genre should sound in its purest form. 'Summer Of The Diabolical Holocaust' is one of the highlights as it shows off the writing skills of Fenriz and Nocturno Culto. Strange, otherworldly melodies that sound like they were built for the overall vibe of the production. \n\nAnother ingenious factor of Darkthrone's third record is the structure of the songs. Riffs seem to change without warning defying conventional patterns, with the title track being an example. The unpredictability of it all not only makes it more interesting, but also more creepy. The vocals here are incredibly harsh as well, and stand high and proud above anything else in the mix. Nocturno Culto's rasps and wails are proof of the darkness that human beings are capable of producing, and together with the guitars create a frozen, unrivalled listening experience. There are also slight elements of thrash in here as heard in the opening seconds of 'Unholy Black Metal', which shows that Darkthrone can take elements of other genre and give them a blackened twist.\n\nThe drums here are very muffled and distant, but it works well with the grim tone of the album. Although not being very clear the drumming itself is excellent. The lyrics are also more well written than on the predecessor, and are poetically evil. That is the word that sums up Under A Funeral Moon, evil, because it is so utterly devoid of light and hope that one cannot help but feel both creeped out and astounded by its unusual sound. This is as black as black metal can ever get, and no other album has used such minimalism to create such an eerie soundscape.\n\nDarkthrone's finest, and an essential for BM fans.\n",
        "\nSay what you will about Darkthrone's transformation over the past several years it certainly has not been a static stylistic shift, more a continuously evolving transmutation. The first seeds were laid a full decade ago with the attitude-laden \u201cFucked Up And Ready To Die\u201d track from Hate Them, whilst the Punk influence was first really tested with the cover of Siouxsie and the Banshees' \u201cLove In A Void\u201d on the Too Old, Too Cold EP 3 years later. The next 2 albums, F.O.A.D. and Dark Thrones And Black Flags, typified the Blackened Metalpunk style that most people seem to associate the Darkthrone name with these days, but after shifting focus more towards lo-fi 80's Heavy Metal on Circle The Wagons that Punk edge has now been moved on from, seemingly as much of an afterthought on this album as even their Black Metal roots are. \n\nWith that in mind it seems fitting that this is the first Darkthrone album in 6 years without cover art from Dennis Dread, instead joining the rarified circle of Metal bands, along with Thin Lizzy and Manilla Road, to have collaborated with legendary Celtic artist Jim Fitzpatrick. As a fan of Fitzpatrick probably even more than I am of Darkthrone it is somewhat disappointing to his see his usual style of vibrantly coloured battle scenes replaced by such rusty and muted tones (though the drawing itself is unmistakeably his), but this almost sepia tint to the sleeve design suits the dust-hazed and vomit-fuelled filter with which Darkthrone reimagine 80's Metal here.\n\nThe lead riff of \u201cDead Early\u201d evokes early 80's Judas Priest which announces this latest stage in Darkthrone's evolution perfectly, though a D-beat quality to the drums is still present but \u201cValkyrie\u201d is the track that really shows the duo's new direction. The log-cabin production values and highness of the cymbals in the mix keeps thing suitably crust-ified and consistent with previous releases but that Bathory/Candlemass-referencing Epic Doom intro is like nothing Darkthrone have ever done before, and nothing could be a bigger ditching of convention for this band than introducing clean vocals. Naturally they are sloppy, untrained, out of time and out of tune, but not entirely out of place and certainly better than you might expect for Fenriz trying his hand at them. There's a definite early NWOBHM vibe to this track thanks to the vocals and although it is certainly something that should be worked on and improved for the next release no one can say that Darkthrone rest on their laurels and don't try new things.\n\nEven more ambitious though are the final 2 lengthy tracks of this 6 song album. Firstly \u201cCome Warfare, The Entire Doom\u201d is the longest Darkthrone song since \u201cWreak\u201d from 2001's Plagueweilder, and closing number \u201cLeave No Cross Unturned\u201d is the longest track they have ever penned, smashing \u201cKathaarian Life Code\u201d by a full 3 minutes. The first of these two is far and away the strongest track on here as it rocks back and forth between Dream Death and Cirith Ungol vibes and even a bit of classic Transylvanian Hunger-style riffing, but the final track doesn't quite repeat the brilliance. In spite of at times successfully evoking early Mercyful Fate and being the most directly melodic track in terms of vocals and guitar leads they have perhaps ever done it is still essentially 13 minutes of done to death bog-standard Mot\u00f6r-beats and early Bathory riffs. \n\nEven with such long songs taking up over half the playing time Darkthrone's notoriously lax approach to rehearsal and songwriting still manages to find a way to produce filler here, and aside from a bit of an Accept buzz on \u201cLesser Men\u201d both it and \u201cThe Ones You Leave Behind\u201d add absolutely nothing of value here. A bold attempt by Darkthrone then to move on yet again to new musical pastures, but ultimately an experiment yielding sub-standard results.

        "\nTake any song from this album, it doesn't matter which one, and play it to someone who likes raw music and needs an introduction to black metal. Chances are they'll like it. Also, chances are that song will be their favorite song from this album. My first exposure to this album was Graven Takeheimens Saler, so that remains the song song I find the most tolerable from this album. But even that is fleeting. \n\nThere's really no point in anyone describing the general style of this -- you already know it, as it's pretty fuckin' obvious from looking at the front cover. In fact, you've probably heard everything this album has to offer elsewhere, by bands with much more creative juice than Darkthrone. There's nothing here to be gained. There's no point in loving it, no point in hating it, no point in anything to do with this turd, because there are so few ideas in this album, many of which have already been sufficiently expressed in other albums who's record date precedes this one. I detect Mayhem riffs, Burzum riffs, and even a Bathory riff here and there. As expected, originality is not Transilvanian Hunger's strong suite. As well, this album is so well known, it goes without saying it it's pretty obvious that this is raw, ultra-minimalist black metal, but you already knew that. However, it is not GOOD raw, ultra-minimalist black metal. Want good minimalist black metal? Any band from Arkona to Mgla to Hate Forest does the job a helluva lot better than this album did. Hell, even Darkthrone's past catalog does a much better job. Essentially, the concept behind Transilvanian Hunger is to take the weakest song from Under a Funeral Moon (Inn I De Dype Skogers Favn) and make an entire album out of the ideas behind that song. That's the concept, folks -- that is, that's what they were TRYING to do. That's their ambition. Needless to say, the execution fails this admittedly unambitious idea. It's like someone who is doing terrible in high school, tries to get his/her GED, and then even fails at that. It's like Darkthrone have failed at failing here; their other albums are usually of a higher quality, but this is just beyond the pale.\n\nThe production isn't even the biggest problem here. I've heard worse, although the paper-thin nature of Transilvanian Hunger does lend it a two-dimensional feel that reduces its staying power (before listening to it right now, I hadn't listened to it in at least a year) and makes it age terribly. Like, I found it tolerable at one point, but that point has long gone. But I digress; the biggest problem here is the lack of effort by Fenriz (I have read, including interviews by Fenriz, that he performed this entire album) and the sloppiness of it all. While most albums where the band \"leader\" records everything are usually lackluster, (think Divine Retribution by Slayer), this takes the cake. Like I said, take the monotony of Inn I De Dype Skogers Favn from the previous album and make the guitars sloppier with plenty of fuckups and mistakes, make the drums sloppier (I swear to god in every song he slows down by at least 25 bpm by the time every song is done, and that's not on purpose) and, of course, make the production thinner. There's not even aggression here; usually I'm able to forgive sloppy performances and sloppy production if there is genuine aggression and vitriol (think Gorgoroth's early albums, Bathory's early albums, really almost any other black metal legend is better than this). There is none here. The tremolo picking is so slow and staid, it sounds like Fenris shot up china white heroin prior to recording this. That's the only explanation I can think of for why every instrument here sounds so lazy and lifeless. Perhaps that's what Fenris was going for? Either way, that doesn't make it any more listenable. Even if they were trying to make it crappy and succeeded at that, it's still crap and succeeds in only a dadaist, defacing manner. Although, I'd have to seriously question the creativity of someone who defaces their own work.\n\nAs well, the riffbase for this is extremely sparse, and I get the feeling that if they took every riff from this album and condensed it into a 20 minute EP, and given the same (paltry) level of performances, it probably would've earned this a 70 or so, but having to listen to an album with very few ideas, very poor execution, and an unflattering production (if the performances were better, the production wouldn't matter) that kills whatever ideas this album DOES have, is not what I would consider a fun musical experience, nor especially gratifying. I like raw black metal, but I'm not a masochist, and I'll stick to better and more able bands for now. Frankly, this album is almost like a phase of shitty music that bored teenagers go through -- most of the blackmetallers I've known who were in their twenties distanced themselves as far as they could from this. In a way, this is less a creative statement and contribution to the metal world and more a retrospective of the state of black metal at the time. Every single cliche' is in place, and all the elements for a stylistically \"correct\" black metal album are in place, but none of the passion, ambition, and drive behind the roots of the genre are present. As it follows, it's then a good album for newbies to black metal (as well as those who forget that black metal exists outside of Norway) to get into. I guess as well closeminded black metal fans who want nothing but sloppy blastbeats, sloppy guitars, and sloppy production would enjoy the shit out of this album; it means they don't have to actually think about the music they listen to. However, once you have been listening to black metal for at least 8 or so years and gotten a good handle on what the genre can REALLY offer, this album just feels empty, worthless, and more than everything else, overly monotonous and soulless. Going back to the beginning of this review, the reason why the first Transilvanian Hunger song you listen to will be your favorite is because this album is so monotonous, that one song is literally ALL you need to get a good picture of this album. Also, one song is about all I can tolerate at one time from this album nowadays. So I'll just listen to Graven Takeheimens Saler, and let the rest of this sorry excuse for an album rot in the depths of my hard drive.\n",
        "\nPositives for this release have to do musically, not lyrically. I think that the \"raw\" sound in the guitar category was quite suitable and translucent. Finally a Darkthrone release that doesn't flip me into the realms of oblivion musically speaking. For the most part, the vocals were quite odd and didn't exhibit much intensity as I've been accustomed to. These 2 guys put together some great guitar melodies both clean and crunch, not simultaneously, just overall. It makes the album easier to get into. The tempo changes aren't subtle, they really aren't exceptionally vast either. I found that the combination of the music, vocals, production and uncompromising guitar riffs seeded the album greatly.\n\nVariety in the vocals make the music more simpler to really get into. I like the fact that they toned down some and aren't all about extreme aggression, they have evolved and this release is commendable. The leads however are quite distasteful, and a good thing that they're for the most part kept to a minimum. I think that if the band took out all of the lead guitar work, the overall album would be held in higher esteem from me. So that is the reason for taking off some points from the overall album. I dig the variety in the vocal department though. It's not just scream filled with high pitch ends to the core, it's highly varied and likeable.\n\nThe drums were right on key with the guitar riffs, though they weren't in the greatest in terms of technicality. It encompasses the \"raw\" sound, but the snare can be quite ignoble. Not to set a complaint in this department, it's quite an ignoble claim to make, yet we're looking at reality here. I mainly found the guitar concoctions to be the most excessive flowing of rich and fresh melodies. Total thrash sort of tone of the axe seemingly falling into a blackened/thrash sort release kind of in the vein of Devian (RIP). Every track on this album contains a variety in the vocal department. Nothing really THAT brutal in terms of hoarse sound, some of it is actual \"singing.\"\n\nDefinitely one of the top albums of 2013 in metal at least. A lot of originality in songwriting style and an album that's not filled with just blast beating galore like a lot of bands nowadays. Seems to drown out the music, those kind of bands at least. However, I'm just saying in general that they've worked hard on composition, something fresh and a great overall sound in the recording. Things seemed to flow on this one, with no things out of balance in terms of tempo changes, vocals and \"raw\" sound. Amazing that only 2 members for the band that really created something pretty monumental.\n\nIf you haven't heard any tracks off of this one, then utilize YouTube and see if there are any songs available before you go out and buy the album. But I'm supremely confident that on multiple listens and insight into the album labeling the peaks and valleys to the release. I'd say that overall, that this is an album not to miss out on. Definitely one that will blow your hair back. Best not to focus on the lyrics to this album since they aren't very strong in that department. I think that if they put a lot of emphasis on their writings, it would be more savvy to my palette. But the music is just outstanding! Get it ASAP!\n",
        "\nThe year was 1996, I was just discovering metal. A friend and I got a hold of a Relapse Records mail-order catalog and had been using it as a guide to explore the wild and new world of extreme metal. We'd pick out albums based on the cover artwork and descriptions, then go hunt for them at our local record store. One day while shopping around my friend came up to me holding an album. He proudly held it up. The artwork was more gritty than anything I had seen before. I was familiar with the works of Deicide, Dismember, Dissection, but this. . . this was something different, this looked serious. \"This is some real vampire shit' my friend proclaimed. I couldn't read the name of the band. All I could make out were the words at the bottom of the album: Transilvanian Hunger\n\nThis was the story of my first black metal purchase. \n\nSo what makes this album so special after all these years? Transilvaian Hunger is not only a gem of old Norwegian black metal, it is one of the earliest \"pure\" (a term I try to avoid) examples of the genre. With this album Darkthrone shed every last trace of their musical influences. There isn't a hint of death metal, heavy metal, thrash, punk, or classical. This album is comprised of nothing but the distinct black metal elements that had developed within the scene up until the point, and this was (to my knowledge) the first black metal album to do so.\n\nBut what of the music? Purity implies nothing of the musical quality. Transilvanian Hunger sounds like one large, sweeping cold wind blowing through a forest at night. The music on this album might be raw and minimal but the pacing and variation is just right that there is enough here to keep things interesting all throughout the album. The riffing is almost completely comprised of multiple guitars tremolo picking single notes to weave a dense, grim tapestry. To my knowledge not many, or possibly no other bands were using this style of riffing before this album. These grim riffs are the core that leads this album. The bass just follows the guitars and the drums usually play a constant 16th note semi blast-beat which became so distinctly black metal. There isn't much point in going on endlessly about the music on this album. The songs are a well-written, consistent bunch with little variation.\n\nIn conclusion the world needed Transilvanian Hunger. It needed this pure, undiluted example of black metal. What it didn't need was the thousands of Darkthrone clones which would come out of the woodwork immediately following this album. If you haven't experienced this album yet, I highly recommend listening to it during some type of solitary activity such as a long walk.\n",
        "\nRecall2CD is apparently no misnomer, because the imprint brand, a sub label of the Snapper Music family (which also includes Peaceville and KScope), is dedicated wholly to issuing two-disc collections of reprinted material spanning the careers and catalogs of acts associated with the sister and parent labels. So, along with Introducing Darkthrone we've had Introducing Katatonia, My Dying Bride and so forth and really you get the gist of it. The fact that these releases have been relegated to a separate imprint is telling, though, they've been set up more or less as '101 courses' for new listeners, with basic biographical information enclosed, a visual catalog of the band's albums available through the label, and you can pick it up either on CD or MP3 at a normal price...\n\n...and that's the rub, because priced at $2-3 dollars, or better yet FREE streamed/digitally, Introducing Darkthrone wouldn't be a horrible access point for someone first exploring black metal, or this band in particular, to get a chronological perspective of how Fenriz and Nocturno Culto first instituted and then later changed up their game across about 25 years. It's entirely dispensable, and 18 tracks is in NO FUCKING WAY going to do any justice to a discography which includes 16 full-length albums and numerous EPs to boot! Previous Darkthrone collections like Preparing for War and the Frostland Tapes proved worth the while for the avid consumer, because they were comprehensive or included something of value (a nice DVD, a thorough selection of the band's unavailable demo recordings, etc), but the material here isn't re-recorded, or particularly equalized, or anything to 'refresh' it. Which, honestly, would be a 'no-win' situation, since the point of something like this is to show how the band's sound had evolved in their many different phases.\n\nSuffice to say, Darkthrone is an important band, and a mere smattering of cuts cannot aptly represent their appeal. Each of their individual full-length albums casts a particular shadow, establishes a mood that in my estimation usually requires complete immersion to appreciate. Sure, they've got a handful of the more fun and obvious, 'bubblegum' writing present in their punk and speed metal numbers of the last decade, and these are immediately catchy, but then they only represent the last five tracks on the compilation (and exclude the latest album The Underground Resistance). Using \"Cromlech\" alone as an introduction to their death metal material, or single song selections from some of the most important recordings in the entire genre like A Blaze in the Northern Sky, is simply not going to cut it, and as much as I worship Dark Thrones and Black Flags, I'm not sure why it nets two inclusions while an ageless, fundamental work like Transilvanian Hunger nets just one. Personally, I find them both equally entertaining, but there can be no question which is the more influential and critical for a new listener to comprehend...\n\nIt'd be pretty difficult to rattle off names of Darkthrone tracks that I don't enjoy, so naturally I don't have much of an issue with the choices here, and they all still sound as great as they did when I first heard them (testament to the timelessness of their aesthetic choices), but in context I feel that many of their records are better experienced in 'blocks', where the raw tone and overwhelming bitterness don't disappear after a few minutes, so in no way could I recommend this in a time where a curious party has the means to instantly acquire any and all of the content and then some (whether legally or not), and the same could be said for the other collections being put out through Recall2CD. Reeks of Roadrunner's old practices with their death metal bands in the 90s. The packaging is nothing special, the biography is old hat to anyone who already knows the band, and it all seems vaguely like a tactless retread meant to bilk a few pounds/dollars from some suckers. If you are one such individual, then feel free to skew my review score up to 30-40%, since you're still not going to behold enough of the real, emotionally draining depth of the earlier work or the mockingly rocking nostalgia of their later catalog to matter.\n\nAs for myself, Introducing Darkthrone is utter tripe, and the materials used in pressing these collections would have been better used in fashioning prosthetic limbs for amputees or plastic sippy drinks for school children. 'But I can play it at parties, or weddings!' Fuck RIGHT OFF. You wanna get someone into Darkthrone? Grab a flask of whiskey or equivalent, at least one of their full-length albums, and a boombox; take the prospective listener to a defaced local castle/landmark (graffiti preferred) or a woodland or park littered with abandoned automobiles and other social detritus. The closer to winter, the more effective. Take a swig and trade off. Apply volume liberally. Bonfires or oil-drum-fires welcome. If that doesn't work, then the subject doesn't really deserve to listen to Darkthrone. Try Katy Perry instead.\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nBack in '06 Darkthrone released an album titled 'The Cult is Alive' and effectively switched musical gears to something entirely different that left their past behind and had me shaking my head and just wondering why. Sure, most of the bands post-90's releases had been just so-so, but I digged 'em for what they were - they were still black metal, and little did I expect icons of the black metal genre to ever compromise their vision as they had done so on Cult. Three more full-lengths would follow without making much of an impact, but perhaps my acceptance of change was coming as I did find some of the songs on 'F.O.A.D.' & 'Circle the Wagons' to be at least fun, which ultimately was where I think the band was going. The black metal days were done for them and they just wanted to embrace the bands and music makers that originally inspired them to pick up their instruments in the early 80's.\n\nNews of 'The Underground Resistance' came in through one ear and out the other as I anticipated more of the same. That is until a friend began telling me about how the band had taken a turn towards classic 80's speed metal and more or less that the record was fantastic. Flash forward a few days later and I'm drinking and spinning old NWOBHM records and I suddenly remember to look the album up on youtube and, well, to say the least I fucking loved it!\n\nThroughout six songs and forty one minutes Darkthrone essentially delivers '80's Metal 101,' a total amalgamation of speed metal, Germanic thrash, NWOBHM and proto-black metal-ness and best of all its incredible. 'Dead Early' opens with a driving catchy lead that instantly has me hooked whilst the rest of the song is thick, heavy and hard hitting as Nocturno Culto grumbles out his words. 'Valkyrie' signals towards something more epic in its grand scope, howling high pitched vocals from Fenriz and an utterly memorable main riff that can't be beat. A total fist pumper and head banger right here for sure! 'Lesser Men' shouts Mercyful Fate from the get go with a soaring start eventually Tom G. Warrior styled vocals set the stage and the song moves back and fourth between Fate and early unstoppable Celtic Frost godliness, while 'The Ones You Left Behind' hankers with this sense of teenage ardency and just plain fun that you don't hear in metal these days. Couple that up with some killer ass riffs and a mighty solo mid-way through and you've got a killer on your hands here.\n\n'Come Warfare, The Entire Doom' just drives on and on and gets mightier as it progresses, especially the riff that pops up around the five minute mark is by far one of the catchiest I've heard in a long while and perhaps solidifies it as one of the albums best. The album concludes with the epic beast known as 'Leave No Cross Unturned,' which is no less than fourteen minutes of speedy, thrashy, Celtic Frosty and even doominess that simply can't be touched.\n\nWhere most bands progress, change for better or worse, Darkthrone has regressed and they don't go past '85 in their musical stylings. Nocturno's guitar work is undeniably exceptional featuring an innumerable amount of killer, catchy, head bobbin', fist pumping and absolutely immense riffs as well as an assortment of solos that simply can't be touched. Not to mention that guitar tone is thick and oh so vintage that I just can't get enough of it. Fenriz' drumming is surely at its best too, and its impressive the way he took extra measures to ensure it had that vintage feel to it.\n\nDarkthrone spares no expense at raising the middle finger a bit too, for example, the photo on the back finds Fenriz in a psuedo black metal pose, while the photo is credited to 'the hater of lame BM.' Similarly the quote, \"This record is 100% free of any cut 'n' paste trickery\" is found and \"Vintage metal sound, contains non-triggered drums\" as well as a few other instances of tongue and cheek humor are to be found throughout the booklet.\n\nIn the end I am and will continue to be amazed at just how good this record is. Sure, its not the band we all heard ten or even twenty years ago, but it is without a doubt one of the bands finest outputs, yes vastly superior to their alleged classics, such as, Transilvanian Junker. Darkthrone has always influenced and will continue to do so with this record - watch as more classic sounding metal bands appear in the coming years! Sure, the black metal days are gone, but Darkthrone has taken their music to surprisingly exceptional territories and it will be fun to see where they go from here. Until then, bottoms up and keep no cross unturned! \n\nOriginally Publish at Lunar Hypnosis: http://lunarhypnosis.blogspot.com\n",
        "\nLet's get the novelty out of the way before we start, yes this is in fact a death metal record by Darkthrone a band more well known as one of the pioneers of Norwegian black metal with seminal black metal records such as \"A Blaze in the Northern Sky\" or \"Transilvanian Hunger\" but \"Soulside Journey\" is a unique but brief look at history that could have been. \"Soulside Journey\" has become a bit of a novelty among extreme metal fans, to some black metal fans it's divine heresy against the genre. To some death metal fans a sorrowful nostalgic look at the best death metal band that never was.\n\n\"Soulside Journey\" feels like it should have originated in Sweden, alongside the debut's from Grave, Entombed and Dismember. From the vocals right down to the sound of the guitar this album reeks of Sunlight Studio. The guitar tone isn't quite as crunchy as the tone found on Swedish death metal releases like \"Left Hand Path\" or \"Into the Grave\" but it certainly isn't clean by no stretch of the imagination. This is undoubtedly a Scandinavian death metal record. The vocals by Nocturno are low and not unlike Lars Goran Petrov's vocals for Entombed, a striking difference from Nocturno's vocals on any of the black metal records that followed.\n\nDoom metal riffs permeate the fabric of this album, this isn't a fast album instead it focuses purely on visceral doom laden riffs to add atmosphere to the music, it's heavy but don't expect 200bpm or more. This doom laden approach is especially evident on the track \"Neptune Towers\" which frequently slows down with overlayed keyboards for effect and it actually works quite well without sounding too gimmicky. This album would certainly be more experimental than any of the Swedish death metal albums at the time. It features more layered keyboards and the bass guitar plays a prominent role in a few songs including \"Accumulation of Generalization\" and \"Iconoclasm Sweeps Cappadocia\". \n\nThe production on this album is very good, as mentioned it feels like a Swedish death metal record. The album should ship with sticker emblazoned on the front cover \"I can't believe it's not Swedish death metal\". Sunlight Studio did an excellent job with the production on this album. Also to add to the peculiarity of this release it actually has a much superior production than the trinity of black metal albums Darkthrone released after this. But that isn't down to budget constraints it is more so to do with the bands change in musical direction.\n\n\"Soulside Journey\" is a blast from the past, a record that time forgot, a record seen by some as a bit of a novelty due to the bands later work. But this in no way diminishes the quality of this record. This is for death metal fans, for fans of Entombed, Grave, Dismember or Unleashed among others of that ilk. It's just a shame there wasn't more after this, that is speaking as a death metal fan more so than a black metal fan. If you're a black metal fan only; then \"Soulside Journey\" may not be for you.\n",
        "\nDarkthrone needs no introduction; everyone knows about these guys and the tremendous impact they\u2019ve had on extreme metal. While they are largely known as a black metal band with their early albums engraved as milestones in the Norwegian scene, many don\u2019t give their diversity enough justice. That comes to a screeching halt on their latest work however. You just have to love Fenriz and Nocturno; they do whatever they want, however they want, and don\u2019t give a care in the world how anyone feels about it. Throughout the course of their career, they\u2019ve gone from death metal, to black metal, to punk, to this. And what we have in \u201cThe Underground Resistance\u201d is a very unique blend of eighties heavy metal and punk rock, all while maintaining traces of their early black metal form. Get ready to headbang to this one!\n\nListeners may be surprised by what they hear at first listen, especially those not closely acquainted with Darkthrone\u2019s recent punk rock escapades. I personally did not see this coming at all from the same band that released \u201cUnder a Funeral Moon\u201d twenty years ago. The riffing is very fast paced and the music is very reminiscent of 80s east coast punk-influenced thrash, much in the vein of Overkill or Anthrax. The guitar work is very nice. You obviously won\u2019t find any shredding, but some of the finest and catchiest riffs in Darkthrone\u2019s discography can be found here, and they are absolutely relentless. Fenriz\u2019s drumming compliments the music very well as usual. As mentioned earlier, \u201cThe Underground Resistance\u201d is great headbanging music and will no doubt draw in some listeners from the thrash crowd who typically don\u2019t associate themselves with black metal.\n\nSpeaking of black metal, while Darkthrone may no longer play the style as prominently as they used to, there\u2019s no doubt that traces of it remain in some of the riffs and vocals. This certainly makes sense, seeing as they\u2019re pretty much the Godfathers of the whole thing. They mix it up a lot though. And I mean a LOT. There are just so many different genres on display here. Take \u201cValkyries\u201d for example. It begins with an acoustic piece and slow black metal section before shifting gears into a relentless punk rock assault. Then there\u2019s the thirteen minute long closer \u201cLeave no Cross Unturned\u201d that sounds strikingly similar to Mercyful Fate, with Nocturno singing in a style startlingly akin to King Diamond. That\u2019s the theme of this album really; variety. One minute they\u2019re playing punk, then black metal in another, then heavy metal in another, then, oh, you get the point! Fifteen studio albums in and these guys sound more versatile and interesting than ever.\n\nI\u2019ve always admired Darkthrone for what they do. They\u2019re very uncompromising and self-fulfilling musicians who work hard to produce the music that they want to hear, not what anyone else wants to. Not the fans. Not the record labels. Not the critics. Them. How many bands can honestly achieve such success in doing that? No matter what dark alley Fenriz and Nocturno explore, they never cease to impress. Call their music whatever you want, but the bottom line is that no matter what style they\u2019re playing, whether it be black metal, punk rock, thrash metal, or all of them mixed into one, Darkthrone kicks insurmountable amounts of ass. If only they would play some shows\u2026\n\nOriginally written for Dermetalkrieger.com\n",
        "\nThis writer has been a Darkthrone fan since 1992, and I know most of you reading this know well the Darkthrone history of black metal-into-crusty-punk that left the fan base a camp divided over the last few years. So it's with casual hesitancy that I venture into The Underground Resistance. I bear in mind the black metal days are long over, and I suggest you faithful readers assign a like-mind to that as well. You may be very surprised.\n\nOff the top, the ugly and raw speed-metal-meets-NWOBHM cloak that Fenriz is so wrapped in rears its very impressive theads, shadowing over the legions of dark minions and boldly claiming residence in the new era. The guitar tone in the opener \u201cDead Early\u201d is thick, heavy, and undeniably potent as Nocturno Culto growls and bellows his sermon. I'm pleasantly surprised right off the bat, and I have a feeling this may only lead to better places. Upon entry into \u201cValkyrie\u201d and hearing those soaring vocals that remind me of any chosen NWOBHM vocalist worth his salt, I'm convinced that the new Darkthrone era has not only been cemented into the earth but lays waste to the notion that the band's better days are long behind it. The main riff in \u201cValkyrie\u201d is so heavy and memorable that I couldn't shake it until \u201cLesser Men\u201d pops into my ears and I immediately picture a young and hungry Mercyful Fate in some Danish studio going for it on all cylinders, influencing a young Norse band (and a host of countless others) for years to come. As the song progresses, old farts like myself will be treated to a mixture of Fate and early Celtic Frost ala Morbid Tales with that deadly, albeit blueprint vocal of Tom G. Warrior barreling through the tempo. Hearing some high vocals neatly mixed into the fray without being overdone sets a new standard for Darkthrone's upgraded style. Being disciples of the old school of heavy metal, this album encompasses all of the finer elements of said era to a proverbial apex of near perfection. \n\nThe \u201cleaked\u201d track \u201cLeave No Cross Unturned\u201d definitely grew on me upon repeated listens, and it moves along like an Agent Steel speed metal trek ala Unstoppable Force, which really tends to burrow into your brain and take root. \u201cCome War, the Entire Doom\u201d is a more sludgy doom-inspired metal that balances between abrasiveness and accelerated solemnity. All through the record, the guitar tone takes immediate control of the reins and is akin to a sharp implement poking around in random order; it's just a simplistic and fluid sound that grabs you and, while void of flair and dramatics, simmers underfoot. Fenriz' drumming is really on the mark throughout as well, and it's clear he took special pains to grab that antiquated sound and make it viable for the current day. His occasional vocals are a pretty good effort as well; you'll know where he comes in and either dig them or dismiss them, but I'm betting on the latter. \n\nThere is a gaunt stylistic approach to the haphazard feel of the record; that is, the 'patterns' followed here don't necessarily subscribe to anything you might consider \u201cclean\u201d or \u201cneat\u201d by definition. It's primitive and unpolished to the trained ear, but while it might appear easy to bash the effort simply due to the Under a Funeral Moon contingent pushing and upset apple cart it's not a fair presumption. The Underground Resistance is a galloping jaunt through the past glories of some of the genre's more impressive bands and artists, which might assuage some of the oldsters in need of a nostalgic fix and impress the younger generation enough to open its collective mind a bit. \n\nI am pleasantly surprised at how entertaining this record is throughout. Yes, it's not your father's Darkthrone, but the corpsepainted faces are thankfully gone to time and dust. NC and Fenriz have managed to tap into the recesses of Heavy Metal 101 and issue an homage of heavy, tongue-in-cheek subservience to the aged art of thrashy speed metal in the New Wave fashion. When I say this Darkthrone record has something for everyone, it's simply the truth.\n\n(Originally written for www.metalpsalter.com)\n",
        "\nI suppose that every time Darkthrone prepare themselves to release another album there are shockwaves of fear - little tremors of uncertainty - that run through the 'true' black metal underground, separate sections or cloisters of people throughout the world who are preparing themselves for disappointment. Hidden away, they drown day by day in their pessimism, wherever they may be, hoping (maybe) against hope that Darkthrone will give in, capitulate, release something that is blatantly commercial, or (even worse?) modern . 'That day must come, sooner or later', they think to themselves, having been taught by years and years of formerly viable (or in any way special) bands giving in, accepting a dollar, letting their stomachs and alimony payments make their musical decisions. Of course it isn't as simple as all of this, and I'm really not trying to judge anyone in any way (the specifics for why a band goes over towards playing pop are always inherently difficult to understand, and unique to that band's position, although they all seem to share a common thread or two), but Darkthrone have not made it a secret that they hold their music to be something completely separate from commercialism, and they have never tried to 'earn a living' from it, supposedly prefering to work normal jobs in order to leave the music unsullied, or being motivated to live outside the music business altogether - aside from the practice of making the music, of course. Ethics like this have a long tradition, in fact, and some of the most moving music in the history of composition has in fact been given over to history by amateurs - or at least by people who considered themselves 'amateurs' - especially over the last thirty years in the various musical genres that have descended from straight rock and roll. In fact, I think in black metal (more than in the other subsections of metal) 'amateurism' has given the movement all of its best moments.\n\nSo it shouldn't come as a surprise to you that this album, 'Plaguewielder', is once again a massive, freezing-cold outpouring of Northern darkness, even harsher in many ways than the record that came before it. It's certainly faster (if you want to just consider tempo), as if composed in order to express a deep sense of urgency or anxiety, which was something that was lacking from 'Ravishing Grimness'. While that album mainly moved through sedate, traditional anthems, falling to a sort of wistful melancholy in certain places out of sheer exhaustion, this album breathes new life into the Darkthrone clich\u00e9s, and Nocturno Culto lets his fingers wander a bit in order to spread new tonal colors around the fretboard, or through the main melodies. I hate to say this, but 'Plaguewielder' just sounds a little more 'mature' than the prior release, 'mature' meaning that they aren't so tied down to formula melodicism, and allow some breathing room for innovation or experimentation. When it comes to the songwriting patterns, however, you shouldn't really expect anything completely new...no, it's almost as if their convictions concerning song structure just couldn't be shaken, no matter how hard anyone tried (to influence them), or how many new ideas as to black metal composition they may originate in their time away from songwriting. Walking alone by himself, Nocturno Culto may come up with an idea for a riff or song segment that he'd like to try, but when it comes down to what he actually writes before the recording process, you can almost always bank on the fact that it's going to be rock solid, traditional, Bathory/Celtic Frost riff-based structures. In 'Sin Origin', for example, he employs a few dissonant chords that jar noticeably with the smooth rock riffs they are enslaved inside, but their ultimate effect on the complete impact of the song is almost negligible. I do like the slow, trance-like picking of chords that finishes this song, however, as it sort of reminds me of Burzum, and the atonal drive towards strange melodies that used to be at the heart of these Norwegian bands. 'Command', the fourth track, is something of an oddity, being almost completely based around the ideas of power and 'solidity' or basic strength (I don't have the lyrics, so I have to guess what Fenriz penned here) - and if the general structure and melody/riff choices are any clue as to the thematic material of this song, this should be about some abstract form of 'domination'...starting out slowly, it soon builds into a blasting frenzy, before subsiding once again into traditional riffing, and then going back and forth between the two tempos. Fenriz unleashes some of his fastest drumming, really, since 'Transilvanian Hunger' - a blurring lightning beat of flying sticks and cymbal crashes. This really just plays out like some form of war metal, I suppose, in the vein of Motorhead crossed with a little Sodom, at twice the normal speed, of course.\n\nIt should be noted that the production on this record is just a little better than the sound on 'Ravishing Grimness', allowing the bass to sound out its backing accompaniment with a more powerful array of tones, and even though the drum sound is, as usual, blurred a little in order to hide it beneath the guitars (which almost always take precedence in Darkthrone's recorded output), they are clear enough for one to notice that Fenriz is not limiting himself to simple rhythms and/or fills in order to stay close to any kind of 'tradition'. Overall, the sound is warm and embracing (analog?), which ironically goes very far in revealing the icy shards of Nocturno Culto's best moments on the six-strings. I should also add that his voice sounds absolutely excellent here.\n\nThe two best songs on this record are probably the opener, 'Weakling Avenger', and the closer, 'Wreak'... the latter being something of a return-to-form for this band, and which features a very nice tremelo-picked riff that echoes some of their earlier work, which was so much more haunting and ethereal than what they have been coming up with lately. 'Wreak', as all of the songs on this record do, works its way steadily through a few different riff choices or specific segments before settling on a lurching, moving Hellhammer rhythm that Fenriz then spins separate drum patterns beneath, ending at a point just right when you think the drummer is going to splash through a quick fill and then push the song forward yet again - in fact Fenriz's powerful drumming at this point is so catchy that you just want it to break and go to a faster riff...instead we have a burst of silence, and then the howling of wind, and behind that the sound of a fire raging... or is it the burning of churches? In the midst of this life, all this joyfulness in bringing forth music, death descends like a flaming scythe, and cuts away everything that matters.\n\nI suppose I will probably always want this band to go back to what they were doing almost ten years ago, at a time when they created a couple of albums that will always rank among my favorites, but I suppose that just isn't feasible anymore, and while Darkthrone certainly don't want to 'evolve' into something that is completely different from what they are doing now (and have been doing for so long now), they surely also don't want to overtly repeat themselves. Why would they? And so, within the tight confines they have limited themselves to, they now reach out once again, trying to completely explore the purity, powers and/or flexibility of an approach that has been seen by some to be completely inflexible. Oh well, Darkthrone is Darkthrone, as solid as ever, and as always you know they will deliver when you ask them to. This is yet another brick in the wall that divides them from every other band trying to play in this style, and yet another reason why Darkthrone will always be the black metal band to listen to, above everyone else... lay your fears to rest.\n\nUA\n\nErebus Magazine\nhttp://erebuszine.blogspot.com\n",
        "\nDarkthrone are one of my favorite bands, and have been for upwards of eight years now, so if you are new to this band or are just curious about this release (having forsaken them years ago) be warned of my enthusiasm for their completely original approach to black metal, and be aware of my bias in this respect.\n\nThere is very little I can say when trying to introduce this band, and so I find myself falling back to that tried and true cliche of sneering 'if you don't know about Darkthrone by now, well... there's nothing I can help you with.' Of course Darkthrone are one of the few bands in the entire history of metal whom you can apply such a sarcastic rejoinder to when introducing them - they are the essence of the cult approach both in their music and in their attitude towards their own reputation. If you aren't familiar with this band by now, I really don't know what to say to you. They are absolutely essential in any exploration of the dark side of music, as they have always had an unparalleled ability to summon the perfect level of inspiration in any of their compositions, whether it was the early technical death of 'Soulside Journey' (still one of the strangest and most idiosyncratic death metal masterpieces, in my opinion, taking the approach of Entombed and Dismember (read: Nihilist/Carnage) to new heights of trilling technical ecstasy or bizarre harmonic depths unsounded by any other outfit) or the later utter grim melodic brilliance of 'A Blaze in the Northern Sky' and 'Transilvanian Hunger' (the latter being the best black metal album of all time, in my opinion). In fact, in this reviewer's eyes, Darkthrone are the quintessence of black metal in the '90s - no other band can match their string of superior releases.\n\nBut what makes Darkthrone stand out above all others is not their technical wizardry or compositional mastery (even though they have both in spades, so much so in fact that they are satisfied with disguising these abilities if they can) but their seemingly magical capacity for reaching down within themselves, time after time, and coming up into the light with melodies and riffs that are absolutely beautiful in the way that they crystallize the essence of all mystery or dark occult mysticism. For me, Darkthrone is above all an evocative instrument for sounding the depths of the dark side of life. Their melodies are often morbid, perverted, sick, obtuse, malevolent, obscure, psychotic, elusive, and stubbornly pessimistic, but they are always beautiful - and always presented in such a way that you can not ignore their fantastic power. Darkthrone, more than any other band in the genre, has the ability to summon the blackened, blasted, and shadowed forces of 'evil' and then paint the resulting influences of evocation with unerring precision - they are the metal musicians closest to the withered heart of man's tragic fall from grace in the last part of this century, and they have always had the capability to further explore both their own dark side and the lightless underworld of civilization - the influences of isolation, misanthropy, alienation, hatred, violence, sickness, and despair. Darkthrone truly are 'Satan's poets' - the voice of the downtrodden, the forgotten, the souls swirling in the madness of modern life; they are the black metal touchstone, unholy alchemists in that they can take the sordid and grim aspects of life and turn them into purest spun gold.\n\nI know that a number of Darkthrone's followers were concerned given the duo's inactivity over the last few years - many were of the opinion that the band had decided to quietly fade from the scene after the release of 'Total Death'. Thankfully Fenriz and Nocturno Culto have decided to return, this time gracing us with yet another journey into the 'true' black metal sound. Ever since 'Panzerfaust' Darkthrone has seemingly been satisfied to just hone their approach to creating 'primitive, atavistic' music, referencing for the main part their earliest influences and staying very close to their convictions about the potential this music has to offer. What does this mean? Hellhammer, Hellhammer, and more Hellhammer - oh, and throw a little Bathory and Celtic Frost in there to spice up the mixture. While I feel that these convictions left them without much room to maneuver on 'Total Death' (which was indicative, at times, of their boredom with black metal) they have had enough space and breathing room now to take these tools and forge something completely new even while it constantly references the past. They have taken the simplistic, driving, pounding black distortion of Hellhammer and updated it to carry their own sound forward, including (I believe for the first time) melodies and passages that are Scandinavian in influence, similar to Satyricon's past norse folk noir obsessions.\n\nWhat that means on this release is that they finally sound very comfortable within the confines of their own convictions: sure, on almost every level, that they have taken the right path. This assurance and confidence is evident in every song on this record - the freedom that their compositional beliefs have given them becomes evident in the power displayed in the melodies. While some of the tracks are seemingly simple exercises in back-to-the-basics black metal, concentrating on a few riffs to carry the impetus of the song striding forward (an approach which this band are probably more practiced at than any other, and thus much better) there are a few selections on this album that I feel could stand easily with the finest material they have ever composed - and once again it is not the song structures or a fatuous 'cleverness' in construction that makes them stand out, but the entrancing melancholy beauty of the melodies. The third song, 'The Claws of Time', is such an example, with an introductory/main riff that is singularly evocative - arguably perfect in its slow unweaving of the agonizing emotions of regret, nostalgia, and hopelessness. Similar in this aspect is the fifth (and in my opinion greatest on the album) song, the title track 'Ravishing Grimness', which is in its combination of fast atmospheric strumming and slightly slower power grooves a genuine expression of the concepts inherent in the title and the lyrics: the mesmerizing loveliness of the darkness, the seductive charm of night and misanthropic isolation - the sweet lament of a soul proudly damned to perdition. The main thematic riff in this song is probably one of the most superb distillations of sadness Darkthrone have ever put forth.\n\nEqually impressive is the production on this work - for the first time Darkthrone have been given a clear, clean, and loud sound on a release, and this goes to show (contrary to my first opinions of their production aesthetics) that the evocative power of their songs does indeed lay in the bewitching music itself, untouched by a deliberately 'cult' or 'obscure' production. The engineering on this record is amazing in that it fills the entire listening space using only the few elements of the band's 'live' sound - Nocturno Culto's monstrously cold guitar being the predominant component.\n\nWhat else can I say? If you are a Darkthrone fan or consider yourself in any way to be a follower of the black metal scene, this is an essential release. If you are new to this band - what are you waiting for?\n\nUA\n\nErebus Magazine\nhttp://erebuszine.blogspot.com\n",
        "\nWhen I think of modern black metal, or black metal that has been stripped of the all-too-self-conscious revisionist leanings of the metal historians, metal that doesn't try overhard in its own inherent proclamations to lay claim to being 'influenced' by Quorthon's early fumblings or the 'theatrical' blasphemy (is there any other kind?) of Venom, I always return to this seminal album. To be sure, Darkthrone were already well on their way to establishing themselves as the legitimate primogenitors of something original with their second album, and they further cemented their necro convictions with the utterly raw and brilliant 'Under A Funeral Moon' (try getting past the production for once and listening to the actual music - especially the interplay of bass and guitar), but it is this album, I think, that finished their blueprint for Norwegian black metal (I remember Fenriz originally saying at the time that they were only going to record three 'black' albums and then break up), and fulfilled their ambitions for creating a new sound that was so monstrously misanthropic, cold, sterile, and hate-filled that it would leave a mark on music that could never be equaled or surpassed. Quite simply, I believe they achieved this on 'Transilvanian Hunger'. This albums stands out among all their others, and completes, I think, their most original phase. After this they would mix the style/aesthetics of cold black metal with Celtic Frost/Hellhammer grooves that, while being original in their own right, somehow didn't seem to carry the weight of conviction that is burned into these songs. I know of no more misanthropic music than this - for here we have a handful of incredibly talented musicians basically turning their backs on the music 'scene' and 'industry', if not the whole of mankind: their masks/paint have become their true identities, their convictions as to the style of their music have become solid reality, and feeling (I believe) completely confident in their abilities and the path they had chosen, they decided to write some of the most emotional, beautiful, obscure, mysterious, despair-ridden, sorrow-filled music ever brought into being or recorded. By playing, one can sense, solely for themselves, using a melodic language that was now strictly their own - so strange, so subjective and personal - Darkthrone created an album of universally applicable music: they brought into the light a landscape freed from the inner darkness.\n\nThe production on this album is absolutely 100% perfect and surely must be seen as the benchmark by which all other 'cold black metal' recordings are to be judged, if you were in the frame of mind for 'judging' (I leave that to the pundits and 'critics'). Recorded, supposedly, on a four-track (Fenriz's 'Necrohell Studios'), the production covers the music in a freezing miasma of dejection: you must pierce through this funeral fog in order to even hear what's going on.... but there, right beneath the surface, hides some of the most inspired black metal guitar work ever conceived: layers of ice, the roar of tearing Northern winds, the falling of snow, the howling of wolves, the crisp cold of the night air, the falling away of the Norwegian fjords beneath you as you stand on a mountain side, the steel glint of the mocking stars high above, the sound of the midnight breeze walking through the dark forests; all these various emotions or sensations: an all-consuming hunger, a hatred towards the light, the swooning storm of unconsciousness, slowly sinking, the deafening silence of depression's nadir - all these I hear, or feel, in the guitars. But it goes way beyond these invocations/evocations - there is something so utterly alien, so 'anti-human', so abstract and expressionist in the melodies presented on this album that you can not help but seriously wonder about their frame of mind (or their sanity) when they composed this - and also, how much Burzum they were listening to, if any. Much like the early Vikernes material, this music tends to concentrate on a repetition of simple (but highly evocative, mysterious, spectral, almost overwhelmingly eerie) melodies, and in doing so I am convinced a difficult choice had to be made as to which chord progressions to use. For the most part, if examined closely, the structures used here are not overly complex, and so the most important characteristic of these songs is not the manipulations the melodies are put through but rather the defining, singular, black essence of each theme and the way it blends with the production to form a mesmerizing wall of sound. At its most potent, in the crucible of art for art's sake, through sheer subjective solipsism, this technique reduced the constituents of evil, misanthropic inspiration down to their barest contours and presented these naked, unadorned, chaotic, inchoate, shreds of obscurity in what can only be termed their purest form. This is a purity almost 'religious' or spiritual in its effects, and at its summit it produces a wondrous stillness of the senses, a quiescence of the soul.\n\nFor the last year I have despaired of writing this review - how, I felt, could I ever put into words how this album makes me feel - what it stirs up, what it brings to the surface within me? I could write for hours and hours about this album, detailing all its fine points, ruthlessly cataloging all the images or impressions it forms within me, and then where would I be? There would still be the unspeakable, the ineffable - that which can not be communicated, but which I feel somehow must still be translated across... and I would be left where I had started. Such is the power of music - or rather, this is why there is music and we do not delegate all of our attempts at communication to speech alone. All I can say, in the end, is that I recommend this album as I could never recommend another. If the entire history of the Norwegian black metal movement somehow disappeared tomorrow, vanishing into time and space, and all I was left with was this one album, I would not be disappointed - I would be fulfilled, satisfied.\n\nUA\n\nErebus Magazine\nhttp://erebuszine.blogspot.com\n",
        "\nHere\u2019s a band that needs no introduction. Well into their 16th album, \u201cThe Underground Resistance\u201d once again under the fabled Peaceville Records, Darkthrone continue with indefinite experimentation. If adding punk wasn't enough but also with traditional metal, Darkthrone take pleasure in peeling the skin off of your eyes. Branching further and further and letting the venom take root for it will take you for a fantasy ride.\n\nAll the riffs are catchy and memorial. \u201cDead Early\u201d blends a good brew of traditional and black metal with excellent punk riffing. From there we go into one of the most beautiful songs, \u201cValkyrie\u201d. This is definitely my favorite for many reasons. In it\u2019s unique way there\u2019s a combination of punk and atmospheric black metal successfully accompanied by beautiful warm-felt vocals. These vocals soar into skies as you ride the heavenly steed. I\u2019d like to call them folk vocals because they sound foreign to the mainland. Clean vocals that glide you to victory. I don\u2019t know if you've seen the movie, \u201cRemember the Titans\u201d but this reminds me of that song they sing when someone departs. That scene where they are all sad and mournful but together. Just listen to the main rhythm of this song and see if you can fit the chanting \u201cNa Na Na Na Hey Hey Hey Goodbye\u201d. Soulful and in unison, kind of the vibe \u201cValkyrie\u201d had.\n\nNow we discover \u201cLesser Men\u201d things start to get a bit sludgy along with the same catchy riffing. I immediately start to think about the likes of Motorhead and High On Fire. The solo sounds interesting, it\u2019s fast but scatterbrained. Just imagine James Murphy playing an ambient solo and underneath it\u2019s layered with a great riff assertively charging. Things start to get interesting in \u201cThe Ones You Left Behind\u201d. Try visualizing a mental image of Fenriz and Nocturno Culto in fancy get-ups singing duets up onstage in elegant velvet clothing to a bunch of rich people. That\u2019s exactly what it seems like but this isn't Hollywood instead let\u2019s serenade nature\u2019s creatures out in the Norwegian plains.\n\n\u201cCome Warfare, the Entire Doom\u201d just as the title suggests it start to explore doom metal. They did a rather good job with it as well. Finally comes the killer and longest song, \u201cLeave No Cross Unturned\u201d. The title is a testament to signify that if the previous five songs have not worked for you this one will definitely convert you. Right from the get-go you are slapped in the face with high soaring vocals, Rob Halford style. If this doesn't indent your eyes backwards then I don\u2019t know what will. The vocals are magnificent in its variance. He has this nice accent as he rolls his letters. He shows a varying degree of execution as his voice drops a few octaves and disperses into a few new realms. This song continues it\u2019s effort with doom metal but also speed metal.\n\nGoing through \u201cThe Underground Resistance\u201d once isn't good enough. You\u2019re probably struck silent and baffled that it\u2019s going to take at least another listen to fully appreciate what you just heard. It\u2019s an acceptable release, you have to admire musicians willing to try different routes with a grand understanding of music. What\u2019s excellent about it is its accessibility. I've already mentioned it before but the riffs are catchy and fun. It\u2019s definitely one I see myself playing over and over.\n\nOriginally written for http://www.metal-temple.com/\n",
        "\nAfter a few years of not releasing any content, Darkthrone has finally released their latest album \"The Underground Resistance\" and I must say right off the bat that this album is nothing what I expected at all. It is no surprise to us that Darkthrone has a tendency to jump around metal sub-genres quite a bit. First they started off with death metal on their debut album \"Soulside Journey\", went black metal with albums like \"A Blaze In The Northern Sky\" and \"Transylvanian Hunger\", then released a series of crust punk full-lengths like \"The Cult is Alive\" and \"Fuck Off and Die\". Now that the fans have been comfortable with their crust punk approach for some time, the band has made a change yet again with this release. Instead of playing their usual punk mixed in with black metal, they are playing a traditional '80s speed metal sound. It sounds awesome and it also reveals a side of Darkthrone that seems unique or new to the ear.\n\nThe album contains six tracks, all of which are amazing. For one thing, the sound is the same old Darkthrone we know and love. Sure, it sounds better in terms of production quality and the music itself sounds more clear and concise, but make no mistake that it still has that '90s black metal, low-quality feel that Darkthrone has put in their albums for years. As for the music itself, it reminds me of Judas Priest or Megadeth in their early years. If you disagree with me then it's safe to say that they at least sound a little bit like Destruction or other bands of the like. You can't really compare Darkthrone to them, but they at least come close to their sounds and music style. Second, the tracks all have this powerful kick to them; they all sound like they have taken a step up in their distortion, power, and have more of a kick ass quality. Their previous installment, \"Circle the Wagons\", was a fairly powerful release and comparing it with this album, it sounds as if the band were aiming to make \"Resistance\" sound ten times more powerful and stronger than the rest. They certainly did not disappoint here. \n\nFinally, I really like the fact that Darkthrone didn't ditch their roots. You listen to any song from this album and you will know straight away that it's a Darkthrone track. They still have that Darkthrone sound and vibe that they've always had. The crust punk vocals are still there, but they seem more refined and sound much better than previous albums. The guitars and other instruments are what you'd expect: the conventional Darkthrone at its finest. Don't get me wrong here, this album sounds way better than the last three or so albums they've put out. Everything has been improved musically and in terms of sound quality.\n\nThere's a downside to this album. Maybe it's just me, but I would've liked to have a few more tracks on this release. To me, six tracks seems a little short. I personally believe that we've waited for the new Darkthrone album for three years or so and to only get six tracks out of it seems a little bit unfair to say the least. Then again, it makes sense why the track \"Leave No Cross Unturned\" is thirteen minutes long in length to make up for the lack of songs on the album. Perhaps I'm being a little selfish and just enjoy with what we've been given by these Norwegian legends. Believe me, I'm enjoying every second of this album. Still, a few more tracks would be nice. We just crave more from these guys and it just goes to show that they have done a great job on this album.\n\n\"Resistance\" was a real track and all the tracks really stood out on their own. Every single one sounded powerful and unique. I really enjoyed songs like \"Valkyrie\" and \"Leave No Cross Unturned\", both of which were orgasmic to the ear. It makes it sound like the legendary Darkthrone has returned to melt the faces of their fans once again. I certainly can't wait to see what the dynamic duo conjure up next. I hate to jump to the next thing, but I'm merely excited what their next album is going to sound like. Darkthrone never ceases to amaze me and others and this album easily is a competitor for the album of the year category. To sum it up, this album kicks major ass and I highly suggest you buy it and make it a part of your collection. You won't regret it.\n",
        "\nIt is with delicious irony that a band once recognised as upholding the truest of ideals from their scene of birth while all others changed (or went to prison) is now the one gloriously morphing into a unchallenged, untamed beast. For Darkthrone, this retrospective transformation through the last ten of their 25-year history reaches an apogee in \"The Underground Resistance\" where the deadly duo of Fenriz and Nocturno Culto have made a record so devastatingly corrupt that as a fountain of inspiration for future metalheads it could knock at the doors of their quintessential early black metal material.\n\nDespite being a strict no live shows band the Darkthrone boys are rarely out of the metal press these days thanks to the wonderfully outspoken Fenriz and his highly influential 'Band of the Week' blogs. Few veterans of any scene take such an interest in the underground and as an early recommender of Ghost, among others, his word carries credence, as has always been the case with his music. When the closing track from this LP, \"Leave No Cross Unturned\", was pushed online a few weeks before release I was not the only one frothing at the mouth for as an early indicator of style it positioned \"The Underground Resistance\" unashamedly in the 80's speed metal camp. A shift from the punky snarl of \"Circle The Wagons\" and \"Dark Thrones and Black Flags\" is no hint of the duo conforming to current trends; it would not be totally off-limits to suggest the prevailing underground trends are a reaction to the recent works of Darkthrone. Shunning digital production values, of course, the six tracks here fizz and bristle with enough pure passion to hopefully encourage more of the metal hordes so far unswayed by Darkthrone's revisionist efforts to take up arms and demand a similarly pure aesthetic from all modern acts.\n\nThe tracks penned by Fenriz in particular (\"Valkyrie\", \"The Ones You Left Behind\", \"Leave No Cross Unturned\") are filled with a sense of teenage enthusiasm and optimism as his banshee screams lead a furious charge of fast riffing in the style of ancient Slayer, Agent Steel or Exciter, while it is Culto's tunes that predominantly revel in the Celtic Frost influenced crust that has always been the cornerstone of the DT sound. Opener \"Dead Early\" is the fastest of Culto's three, morphing from a classic metal riff into a bass-heavy punk charge distinguished by his weathered drawl before \"Valkyrie\" sets Fenriz loose. His wailing vocals are surprisingly coherent but it is in knowing them to be the release of internal fires and not natural talent that endears. Slowing to a close with a touch of epic Manilla Road riffing it marks a neat contrast in the songwriting styles of the two. \"Lesser Men\" by comparison sounds much angrier but as the rhythms hark to distant works of their back-catalogue Culto's solos now better display the classic metal spirit for an altogether less hostile atmosphere, at least for those with a historical background in Darkthrone.\n\n\"The Ones You Left Behind\" is a lyrical homage to past protectors of the heavy metal flame, specifically dedicated to the sound of 1984 in the liner notes and musically a brasher more punchdrunk version of the many obscure acts they are worshipping in the song. \"Come Warfare, The Entire Doom\" flies off some great rhythm riffs from the guitar of Culto atop the appreciatively simple drum backing from Fenriz, before the speed frenzy of \"Leave No Cross Unturned\" kicks in, leaving no stone unturned in a desire to peddle the most furiously catchy opening to an extreme metal song in a long time. The speed does drop to allow the Celtic Frost quotient to be fixed with the ratchet being picked up again before finally the classic pounding Darkthrone riffing closes the songs' overly elongated 14 minutes.\n\nThe wider state of metal may ultimately lay beyond the abilities even of Darkthrone but as a work of both protest and emancipation \"The Underground Resistance\" marks the most consistent of their recent works and lays forth such a feast of riffs that the winds of change will do well to miss this mark.\n\nOriginally written for www.Rockfreaks.net\n",
        "\nAs humans, it can be difficult for us to admit that we occasionally need to give up and go back to the drawing board, no matter what the situation may be. In music, the same applies; some bands may have experimented as much as they can with a certain style, or may have simply run out of ideas and lost their direction. When all else fails, it's usually a good idea to go back to basics, whatever those basics might be. While some, be it St. Anger by Metallica or The World Needs a Hero by Megadeth, may have been extremely weak reboots while some have pulled it off marvelously. Just look at Voivod's new record, Target Earth, for example; even knowing that the band's strongest link had passed away, they managed to set their time aside and release a hell of an album. \n\nWith different circumstances, this seems to be the case for Darkthrone's biggest triumph, The Underground Resistance. A household name in extreme metal, Darkthrone unfortunately started to slightly lose their way after the 1991-1994 legendary black metal trilogy was released. The addition of crust punk influences later in their career only added to the disappointment (though some may argue otherwise), and the polarized views people had of the band came in droves. So the next logical step for the duo was to...make a classic speed metal album mixing the old with the new? I'll admit, I thought this would be a trainwreck after hearing the news about their new direction...and let me tell you, I was dead wrong.\n\nIn the six songs within, Darkthrone play a blend of classic speed metal/thrash, black metal, doom metal, and numerous other stylistic hints here and there. Contrary to the last few releases, there's only a slight punk influence here. The vocals range from gruff thrash grunts, to the occasional black metal shriek, to dramatic power metal-esque chants, and so forth. Every song has a different vibe and yet somehow the band manage to tie every mood together with their trademark sound. The emotions vary from song to song, among them triumphant, hopeless, hopeful, angry, determined, etc.; the musical backing is always helping to convey these thoughts perfectly. Take the acoustic motif that kicks off \"Valkyrie\", for instance. The hollow minimalism of the sole acoustic guitar is strong enough to carry the feeling of distance and loneliness on its own, but when the doom metal riff follows, the entire musical portrait is realized. As the lead guitar soars over the burdening heaviness, there is thought to be a sense of hope all the same. Powerful imagery indeed. \n\nOther songs are speed metal frenzies from the get-go, and even the thirteen-minute epic, \"Leave No Cross Unturned\", takes a stab at Hammerfall-meets-Overkill power thrash before opting for a mid-tempo swing and progressing from there. Similarly, \"The Ones You Left Behind\" sounds like a song from Metallica's Kill 'Em All if it was modernized and given a nice facelift in terms of songwriting quality. While its E-standard guitar riff is a dime a dozen, the chorus is really where the song hits home; the near-operatic vocals meld with the stop-start guitar work make this climactic portion a joy to listen to. Such moments like these are littered about the album and the consistency of the record only makes the whole experience even easier to digest. That, and the variety and the balance of how the band use each genre is just incredible. Want some of that aforementioned black metal? Get an earful of the blackened \"doom\" (it does pick up speed frequently, but generally has a doom metal-like atmosphere) number \"Come Warfare, the Entire Doom\". Want a nice shot of adrenaline? Listen to opener \"Dead Early\" or \"The Ones You Left Behind\". Want a moment to take in some atmosphere? Listen to \"Valkyrie\"'s folk elements and reflective nature. You get the idea.\n\nIt's tough to give this release the justice it deserves, so my only recommendation is that you buy it immediately. Whether you're a fan of black metal, thrash metal, death metal, progressive metal, or ANY kind of metal, this is one record that needs to be heard. It needs an audience. It needs to be listened to by heavy metal veterans as well as anybody who's listening to metal for the first time. This album is the sound of a band back in high gear after a long dull patch, and after a record like The Underground Resistance, it's time to treat them like kings. Darkthrone are back, and this may be the biggest crowning heavy metal achievement in recent years. Welcome back, guys!\n",
        "\nOver the last eight years Darkthrone has undergone quite the change in sound. Starting with The Cult is Alive the band who epitomized \"pure black metal\" has blended elements of punk rock and various other types of metal (traditional, thrash, speed) into its sound. At first, punk was strongest element in the new Darkthrone sound, but with each proceeding album both the punk and black metal elements have faded in significance while the traditional metal elements have become more pronounced. With Underground Resistance\u2014Darkthrone's fifth album since \"the change,\" sixteenth overall\u2014Darkthrone can no longer be described as black metal in any respect. They are now a heavy metal band whose primary influence is the NWOBHM, though Celtic Frost and viking-era Bathory are also major influences on this record.\n\nUnderground Resistance is the biggest and heaviest Darkthrone has sounded in ages. The guitars are nice and meaty while the bass and drums are thunderous. Yet, Darkthrone achieve a bigger sound without betraying its lo-fi aesthetic. The sound is still gritty and direct. Ferniz and Nocturno Culto offer two very distinct vocal styles. Ferniz provides falsetto wails that at times, are surprisingly good. His delivery on \u201cValkyrie,\u201d for example, has a startling amount of power and bravado. Nocturno Culto does a very good Tom G. Warrior impression, offering a low, gravely hybrid of singing and growling. Both vocalists can be sloppy and times but nonetheless, their performances fit within the overall aesthetic of the record.\n\nIn contrast to previous Darkthrone records, the songs are fewer in quantity and longer in length. The change in songwriting has given Darkthrone a level of focus that has been lacking for ages. Though there are fewer overall riffs and more repetition, the quality of the riffs is very high, so you won't mind listening to the same three or four riffs over and over. While the riffs range from slow and harmonious to fast and slashing, they all share an epic flare that gives the album a unified spirit. The album cover captures the spirit of Underground Resistance quite well; these songs will have you envisioning barbarian hordes storming down mountainsides, prepared to die for the old gods. Yup, this album is fucking epic. Yet, even with an endless supply of kickass riffs and excellent atmosphere, it's hard to ignore just how derivative Underground Resistance can be. On a number of occasions Darkthrone fall into overindulgent passages of Celtic Frost worship that will make you wonder if you'd be better off just listening to To Mega Therion. \n\nWhile Underground Resistance is the best Darkthrone album in ages, fans need to know what to expect going in. This is a very good piece of retro heavy metal full of awesome riffs, beastly drumming, and inconsistent but somewhat endearing vocals. If you look past the iconic logo and take it for what it is, then you're ready to enjoy a good old fashioned headbang, but if you can't get over the fact that these are the same guys that produced the \u201cUnholy Trilogy\u201d then you should probably pass this one by.\n\nOriginally written for Deafsparrow.com\n",
        "\nFrom the evil, cold and grim mountains of Norway, oh wait this is not a black metal album\u2026\n\nThere is some releases that I am actually looking forward to during the course of 2013, but I certainly wasn\u2019t looking forward to the new Darkthrone record, when it was announced with cover art and so on. I definitely do enjoy some nostalgia with some of their old black metal albums, and occasionally some of their death metal as well. So when word came out that \u201cThe Underground Resistance\u201d would be released I really couldn\u2019t care less because of the band\u2019s development into punk through out the last couple of years. And for the record, I do not like punk. At all. But of course my mind was changed when a friend of mine told me it was like speed metal. To be honest my response to this was: \u201cYou have got to be shitting me\u201d, but I was not dumped upon. There definitely is a good range of influences on this album. Heavy metal and speed metal are the primary influences, and there is also a bit of viking, but that is solely because of the track Valkyrie. Speaking of that track, when you look at the album and the tracks it contain Valkyrie is kind of misplaced in a way as it got that viking metal influence to it and unlike the other tracks it got clean vocals the whole way through. But since it is the surprise of the year, I guess it was coming anyway, and do not think that it is a bad track, it is actually pretty good and I wouldn\u2019t say that there really is any weak tracks on the album.\n\nLeave No Cross Unturned is the song that changed my mind about this album, as it was the song that was put up back when the album\u2019s release date, or something like that, was announced. This track reaches almost 14 minutes in total length, and that is pretty long for a heavy/speed song, and maybe it should have been cut into two tracks. I actually can\u2019t quite decide because it doesn\u2019t really feel like it is that long when you listen to it. That is a very fortunate thing for the track that it does not feel dragged out. Or maybe it is dragged out and just too awesome for it to be a problem? Decide for yourself. A little side note, for the fans of the bands early black metal it contains a funny little gem for you/us. Simply wait until the 6:22 mark.\n\nThe tracks I would choose to highlight from the album is: Dead Early, Valkyrie, The Ones You Left Behind, and Leave No Cross Unturned. Fenriz really gets the shit done on the drums, it is catchy and serves the album quite right. As for the guitar work, just splendid, I did not know those two had it in them. There is heavy metal, then some speed influences, but also slower sections, and with solos to fit it at some times. I\u2019d wish there was a way to clap my hands while still writing this review, because they did such a good job on the album. No matter if you\u2019re an old fan or new, this is something that must be checked out.\n\nI named this review \u201cSurprise of the Year\u201d simply because I did not see it coming, obviously. Even though we at the moment of this review are in the beginning of 2013, I think at least for my own musical taste, and also when I look upon what else is coming out this has got to be the surprise of the year. A really great one indeed! Who knows, maybe the next Darkthrone album will be viking metal, it wouldn\u2019t even surprise me\u2026 or?\nI am not really going to speak on behalf of the catalogue of Darkthrone since I haven\u2019t been through it. My listens primarily reaches their work up till \u201995. I have heard some of the newer Darkthrone in the punk vein, but as I mentioned earlier\u2026 I do not like that. This is such a fresh release and I would not mind if Darkthrone made another album in the likes of \u201cThe Underground Resistance\u201d, though it only contains 6 tracks and reaches just above 40 minutes of playtime. Now for the tricky part: Who the hell should I recommend this album to? If you expect crust punk you\u2019re in for a disappointment, and the same if you expect black metal. If you however are open for an incredible sounding heavy/speed metal album you won\u2019t be disappointed at all!\n\nNocturno Culto!\n\nWritten for Reigning Damnation.\n",
        "\nOriginally written for Me Gusta Reviews. www.megustareviews.com\n\nDarkthrone is one of the most notorious names within the heavy metal community. So notorious, in fact, that one cannot carry out a conversation about heavy metal without dropping the band \"Darkthrone\" once or twice (or so it seems). Along with the household name, the band is known for their unique attitude and for their strong ability to play whichever genre of metal that they wish. Not only can Darkthrone play whichever genre of metal they please, but they seem to blow \"seasoned\" bands, be it death metal bands, black metal bands, crust punk bands, and heavy metal bands (genres they have played in their respective order), out of the water! The much-anticipated release by this grim duo has been well worth the wait! The Underground Resistance not only pushes further into the genre of crust punk (the genre Darkthrone has been playing around with on recent past releases), but it delves further into the genres of heavy metal, all while holding on to the bands notable black metal sound.\n\nUpon looking at the track list, I was surprised to see only 6 songs. Quickly overcoming my surprise and remembering that I was dealing with Darkthrone (they can do whatever they want), I quickly began listening to The Underground Resistance. One element of the album that was pleasing was the way Darkthrone arranged the songs. The band starts short and sweet and finishes in huge, grandiose fashion. What I mean by my previous sentence is that Darkthrone starts the album with 4 songs that all average out at the 4 minute mark and finish with 2 long songs (8 minutes and 13 minutes, respectively). Darkthrone wastes no time in setting the tone with \"Dead Early\". The killer groove that is established shortly after the songs midpoint is worth all the headbangs! Keeping with the opening pace, Darkthrone throws riff after tasty riff, build after successful build at the listener in preparation for the final 2 numbers, \"Come Warfare, the Entire Doom\" and \"Leave No Cross Unturned\". Along with \"Dead Early\", \"Leave No Cross Unturned\" is a song that I am particularly fond of. Darkthrone fill all 13 minutes and 50 secs of time with immense builds and excellent riffs; riffs reminiscent of the bands old school death metal and black metal days with some crust punk spice. Be advised, \"Leave No Cross Unturned\" will ruin your neck! A final note to the musical side of this album, it was mentioned above that the band pursued further into the heavy metal (traditional heavy metal) genre as well as crust punk. I say this because many of the vocal parts take direct influence from the NWOBHM, however the uses of such vocal stylings are tastefully placed to fit, and function, very well over a particular riff. \n\nTo back up these great tracks is some razor sharp production! Nothing is lost in this mix and the sound of the band is sharper than diamonds. On a final note, Darkthrone is able to sound great without sounding over produced. Nothing is flawless or \"too perfect\" sounding, the music leaves room to breathe, and a raw feel is accurately conveyed to the listener.\n\nThe drumming, well... Fenriz does what Fenriz does, and he does it well! Another great performance from a heavy metal veteran!\n\nHonestly, I was not expecting to take to this album as strongly as I did. I have always been a fan of Darkthrones' black metal records more than anything else they have ever done. Hell, even their recent crust punk releases didn't really speak to me! Finally, I have found the crust punk Darkthrone album I enjoy, The Underground Resistance! Packed full of excellent songs, well crafted and well exceuted musical build-ups, and a tasteful mix of each members musical influences, Darkthrone have once again set a high bar in the crust punk community. Clearly, the band is not anywhere close to folding up their banner! Support Darkthrone by buying this album, and as much merchandise as your bank account allows!\n",
        "\nYou love them. You hate them. You used to enjoy them, but now you cannot stand them. Flip the script. Few bands get both the hackles and beers raised as often as Darkthrone, and it seems each new release is a theatrical event missing only the popcorn. Thankfully, due to the advent of the microwave oven, we can rectify this. 'Goddamnit, I fuckin' loathe these poseurs and sellouts', quoth the twenty something armchair hack who fancies himself a 1st-2nd generation black metaller, who hates and trolls the world, privately wishing he had the time machine to back his claim. As if the notion of a band like this, with a long history of obscure and inaccessible audio recordings behind them, incorporating influences from music no one at large really gives a shit about, somehow justifies the claim that they're in it for the money, or they're 'artistic failures' because they tried to match two different shoelaces on their latest sneaker line. Hey, Vlad, how about you go troll some panties? Or some boxer briefs (I wouldn't wanna presume...). I'm not asking that you step out into the sunlight or anything drastic, but it might be time to harden the fuck up, take out the fake fangs, brush off the dandruff and church ashes, and get yourself a ghoulfriend (or equivalent).\n\nNewsflash: musicians change. Bands change. It's a kinetic universe. Even the planets are fucking moving. Even the dead ones. You either change with them, change of your own accord, or you stagnate. 'I'll gladly take stagnant over something...different!' Really? I was wondering where that smell was coming from. Yeah, I realize that Mot\u00f6rhead somehow scored itself an exemption clause to this rule, but Nocturno Culto and Fenriz have been evolving, devolving, and sidestepping for well over 20 years now, and to their credit, just about every choice they've made has proven pretty entertaining. Ever since I first picked up a copy of Soulside Journey on cassette, wholly ignorant of what the future would bring, theirs was a journey worth signing up for. In fact, I can say without any hesitation that I've enjoyed every Darkthrone record to date. Yes, even Goatlord. Even Plaguewielder. And, yeah, the 'punk' years, the 'speed metal' years, when the death-gone-black duo started digger into their record collections, and expanding their quest for inspiration beyond their copies of Deathcrush, Morbid Tales, Under the Sign of the Black Mark and Apocalyptic Raids 1990 AD. So be it. Without this period of experimentation, I wouldn't have gotten Dark Thrones and Black Flags, one of my favorite of all their works, and one of my favorite metal albums of the 21st century to date.\n\nDarkthrone has gotten goofier. More endearing. Self-referential, beyond a doubt. They're not putting out records like A Blaze in the Northern Sky anymore (they've been there and done that). Neptune Towers is ancient history. The Underground Resistance is perhaps the friendliest record these two have released beneath this moniker, and as billed, it continues to carve out the members' nostalgia for antiquated metal by mashing it into their Celtic Frost-ed fundamentals and seeing what happens. Sure, to some degree this is influenced by Fenriz' fanaticism for the sounds of the 80s. His roots love. His 'bands of the week'. But you have to give these two credit: through the process of retroactive evolution, they're churning out something refreshing and welcome. Just about everyone with a pulse who pays attention to metal news heard all the presages and doomsayers about how they'd be searching for an 'epic heavy metal' style after the largely speed metal-inspired Circle the Wagons. In truth, while there are faint whiffs of early Manowar, Thor, Manilla Road, Cirith Ungol, and post-black/thrash Bathory, this fruit actually doesn't fall far from its 2010 tree. Surprisingly, the more 'epic' this record got, in terms of the more baseline heavy metal riffs and sillier clean vocals, the less I actually liked it...\n\nWhich leads me to a shocking conclusion, well before the actual conclusion: The Underground Resistance is the first Darkthrone studio album I would not qualify as 'great'. It's 'good', and I've been having a blast listening to half the tracks here, but certain overlong numbers and one particularly weak (if well intended) tune create a lot of inconsistency whenever I'm listening through in the proper order. I dug that they'd returned to the 'less is more' philosophy of their formal years (having first evolved into their black metal sound), but it's a double edged sword. With just six songs, you've got to fire on all cylinders, and I felt that the album's decision to back load its bloated content gave it a lopsided feel. Not that the cleverly titled \"Leave No Cross Unturned\" doesn't have its moments, but it sure as shit doesn't have fourteen of them, and even the superior \"Come Warfare, The Entire Doom\" could have used a slight hedge clipping. Not because the riffs are lacking, or that they've not pulled off some lengthy tunes in the past, but these don't exactly pad themselves out in any meaningful way. I kept waiting for buried thrills, and found none.\n\nYet the primary offender, \"Valkyrie\", comes earlier on in the proceedings. This, more than any other, is an honest attempt to create that epic heavy metal feel so publicized by the band and its slathering fans. It's the furthest from the Darkthrone comfort zone, in that it consists of pure speed/heavy metal with some doom and punk elements. No blackening. Fenriz' vocals throughout are almost entirely clean (there are some raving, harsher barks to give it personality), and unfortunately rather tuneless. I get what he was going for, and these sorts of quirky hooks worked for him in Isengard or on earlier 'throne tunes like \"The Winds They Call the Dungeon Shaker\", but there is nothing in there to snag me, and coupled with the really bland and boring guitar melodies and the rather underwhelming chord progressions, it fails to leave an impact in the midst of harder, Culto-fronted crushers like \"Dead Early\" and \"Lesser Men\". That's another thing, too. The N.C. sounds so goddamn good through this record, his ravenous T.G. Warrior-like rambling so archaic, like a tomb opening after a century of neglect, that the cleans sound absolutely ludicrous in contrast...\n\nThat's not to say they're all a bust, because on \"The Ones You Left Behind\" the biting cleans are delivered with a grisly harmonic arrangement that works in the context of the song, but it seems as if too little emphasis was put on making them consistently catchy. In terms of the riffs, there are easily a good dozen or so on the disc that stick out, like the blistering, full-bore speed metal stylings in \"The Ones You Left Behind\", \"Come Warfare, The Entire Doom\" or \"Dead Early\". Nothing revolutionary, mind you, and in truth if you heard them on any obscure heavy metal record from the early to mid 80s you might just ignore them, but it's how they mix and match them with their slower, muscular Celtic Frost grooves that creates variety and balance. The highlight for me personally was the melody embedded into the bridge of \"The Ones You Left Behind\", which just hit me from nowhere and had me pressing the repeat button numerous times. The grand finale, \"Leave No Cross Behind\" also has some real scorchers in their, but I think the ideas might have been better served in 2-3 separate, shorter tunes, because they don't seem to transitional all that smoothy or emotionally.\n\nIn addition to Culto, who has really been on fire of late with this and his work in Sarke, the production is an obvious highlight. The guitars are enormous, with great reverb on the melodies and in the chords themselves that attain the larger than life, airy aesthetics of 80s metal. This is one zephyr primed for headbanging. The drums are crystal clear while retaining that live studio quality most of their records are known for, and the bass is copious. Corpulent. Not always written well, since most of the lines fall behind the rhythm guitar and stay there, but at least you can feel that low end once \"Dead Early\" picks up momentum, and it never ceases whenever the riffs are pounding along. I may personally prefer some of their darker mixes from the 90s, because I tend to enjoy the nuances (and even the sloppiness) of those grimy and formative years, but those seeking a blast of in the face heavy metal will not be disappointed by how fulsome and level The Underground Resistance sounds at any volume. As for the lyrics, they're as usually pretty good, trying to come off 'dumber' than they really are, but packed with striking images that makes you think (the one exception being \"The Ones You Left Behind\" which is more about shouting and rhyming the 'ing' suffix).\n\nUltimately, this album would have been a lot better without \"Valkyrie\", and with \"Leave No Cross Unturned\" chopped and rearranged into two different songs, but I still had a good enough time that I don't feel my money was ill spent. Of course, I'm an incalculable manwhore for this band and their side projects, so your own mileage may vary, but if you loved the shit out of Circle the Wagons then it's a safe recommendation. I didn't get a whole lot of the Manilla Road/Omen flavor I was sort of expecting, and there aren't any tunes as infectious as a \"Hiking Metal Punks\", \"Eyes Burst at Dawn\", or \"...Dungeon Shaker\", but its worth it just to listen to N. Culto's howling and a stellar mix redolent of rhinoceros-driven chariots across a Roman Empire battlefield. Or were they elephants?! Regardless, if you're on the way to pick this up and you happen to see Imperator Vlad of the Flat Earth Black Metal Society hiding out in the shade of a tree or awning, buy the guy a cheeseburger or some bus fare. You'll be alright, buddy. The world's moving on. Here's a ticket.\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nOne of the more embarrassing habits that tends to be exhibited by critics of any art form, be it those annoying well-known ones or those slightly less-known and less annoying ones (mostly because they never get read), is that of speaking too soon. The writer of this review is himself guilty of an all too common sub-species of this miscalculation which could be dubbed the \"this is the strangest shift in style ever heard of\" fallacy. This could be seen as a forgivable offense when used in reaction to Celtic Frost's \"Cold Lake\" or Discharge's \"Grave New World\", but even those aberrations fail to capture exactly what has transpired with the premier of Darkthrone's newly concocted 15th studio album \"The Underground Resistance\".\n\nIn contrast to the expected motive of audience pandering, what occurs here is about as far removed from anything that could be mistaken for seeking after sales from either mainstream circles or the growing wing of fashionable non-conformists lapping up the so-called \"cult\" side of black metal. It is still recognizably possessed of the earliest black metal influences attributable to Bathory, Celtic Frost, Venom and Mercyful Fate, but also loaded with epic power/speed metal elements that hearken towards something a lot closer to Manilla Road mixed with Quorthon's Viking era material. The songs are generally up tempo, yet simultaneously avoiding the blast happy tendencies of the 2nd wave sound in favor for the traditional speeding approach of early 80s Motorhead. Truth be told, this is arguably the most overtly 80s album that Darkthrone has ever put out, if going by the roads a bit less traveled during said era.\n\nThe first thing that leaps out from the opening throws of \"Dead Early\" is a combination of light rawness meshed with a somewhat polished production, not all that far removed from the last couple offerings out of Mark Shelton's projects, though the drums are actually a good bit more thunderous and exuding an uncharacteristic amount of clarity compared to Fenris' previous stints behind the kit in the studio. Soon following is a duality between doom leaning guitar themes and a generally speed/thrashing rhythmic demeanor that is not unheard of, but definitely uncharacteristic of Fenris and Nocturno's numerous works. Special attention should be given to the frequent lead guitar breaks, which don't quite reach the level of indulgent jam shredding that Shelton does with Manilla Road, yet is far more adventurous and captivating than anything that this band has done since \"Soulside Journey\".\n\nFor the most part, the arrangement tends to be simply and doesn't really exploit the frequent switch-up approach known to thrash metal bands from the 80s, but there is definitely an effort at development at play here. The album pretty much starts on a decent note and proceeds to get better and better with each song, culminating in two very well accomplished epics at the tail end of the album. \"Come Warfare, The Entire Doom\" proves to be an intricate mix of dragging doom themes played at high tempo with a smattering of tremolo picked riffs that hint at an early death/thrash sound, complete with a semi-guttural snarl that was the common vocal approach before Chris Barnes and David Vincent started going deeper. \"Leave No Cross Unturned\" kicks things off in a driving thrash fury not all the far from early Exodus with a denser guitar tone, before navigating through a variety of high tempo changes and shouted ravings, topped off with the occasional vocal homage to King Diamond out of Fenris.\n\nIt's a foregone conclusion that a lot of Darkthrone's regulars who managed to weather the change in sound that came in with \"The Cult Is Alive\" will be scratching their heads at this one, let alone what the archaic purists who swore off everything after \"Transylvanian Hunger\", and it is equally inevitable that this band will hardly be bothered at such a turn of events. These guys are making music entirely on their own terms, refusing to even dignify the calls for more cliche black masses at moonlight, and it is a delight to follow them as they continue to buck the trends and the naysayers while continuing to make great music in a variety of forms. Unsheathe your swords and prepare for a different kind of battle, and don't skip up on the mead.\n\nLater submitted to (www.metal-observer.com) on April 8, 2013.\n",
        "\nDarkthrone needs no introduction. Their influence on extreme metal is almost unparalleled and the band has more than their share of timeless classics. After conquering all they possible could in the black metal category the band changed their approach and started infusing elements of crust punk and heavy metal though never entirely moving from their roots. This started from their album in 2006 entitled \u2018The Cult is Alive\u2019 and the band proceeded to release a string of albums that sounded rather different from each other though never they were all essentially Black/Crust albums with hints of heavy metal. It was evident from the aural experience as well as the lyrics that the band were having fun. Anyone who has been following the band, even if it has only been from their punk infused music days (however unlikely that may be), one thing has been evident. That has been the gradual shift from crust and the inclusion of the more traditional, heavier and thrashier sound. So, as the band releases its 16th album on Peaceviile Records (a label that has released albums from some big bands in the music industry like Opeth, Katatonia, Anathema and Pentagram to name a few) entitled \u2018The Underground Resistance\u2019 one could expect another album which embraced the traditional sound a bit more and let go of the punk attitude music a bit more.\n\n\u2018The Underground Resistance\u2019 is in a plethora of ways much much different from what the duo of Fenriz and Nocturno has ever done. Containing only 6 songs but lasting 42 minutes the band has opted for quality more than quantity and with long tracks the band will test the listener\u2019s patience at times. The music on this record can be defined as a combination of Of Black Metal, Thrash metal, Heavy metal, speed metal, power metal and crust punk. It is not like the band choose to mesh all these genres together in each and every track but instead chose to pick a few of these genres per song and move on to the next and this is the reason no two tracks sound similar and make my job as a reviewer that much tougher because as much as I hate track by track reviews the band leaves me no choice here.\n\nThe album starts off with \u2018Dead Early\u2019 and as soon as it hits you one thing is clear and that is that the band unsurprisingly has shed the punk sound a bit more and embraced a heavier more traditional approach. If you\u2019ve been a fan of the band\u2019s last few albums there is no reason you shouldn\u2019t enjoy this track with punky vocals and riffs (that would have made \u2018Fast Eddie\u2019 proud) played out with a tuning more suitable for a proper black metal album. Throughout the track the band plays with a Motorhead sensibility and even though it is less than 5 minutes in length it a bit dragged out. Nothing special this track and is a lukewarm album opener. It is the second track entitled \u2018Valkyrie\u2019 where things start getting interested. Starting off on an acoustic guitar this track is the unlikely mix of traditional metal, old school power metal mixed with a tingle of black metal. While the song structure if based on traditional metal Fenriz tries his hand on the operatic siren like power metal vocals while the cymbal work on the drums as well the guitar tuning is more suited to a typical black metal abum. As the soaring chorus of the track has a definite epic Manilla Road feel to it you cannot but praise the song writing skills the band has expressed here. The tempo changes, the placing everything here is brilliant, and as the track ends on a beautifully soaring melodic outo that conjures images of the artwork in your mind you can understand why this track will be many\u2019s favourite track off of the record. Proceeding to track number three entitled \u2018Lesser Men\u2019 which starts off with a blatant rip off of the famous Mercyful Fate track named \u2018A Dangerous Meeting\u2019 the influence of Celtic Frost and Hellhammer in the drumming, vocals and riffs permeates through this track and acts as the precursor of what is to come for the rest of album. Yep, expect a lot of First Wave of Black metal worship from now. As contrasted to the previous track there are a lot of gruff Celtic Frost vocals here as well as the Hellhammer riffs. Also as contrasted to the previous track the song writing is bad and like the first track this song as well seems too stretched. The fourth track \u2018The Ones You Left Behind\u2019 is essentially more of the same stuff but instead of gruff vocals there is a duo of operatic vocals as well as raspy vocals. Like Valkyrie this track has a great melodic section here with an atmospheric build up and heavy metal influenced solo but the tempo change from this section to a more upbeat part is bad and really breaks the flow of what was a great track. It just seems forced and out of place. This brings us the last two tracks which length wise make up half the album. The first of these entitled \u2018Come Warfare, The Entire Doom\u2019 lasting more than 8 minutes sheds off all influences except Celtic Frost/Hellhammer with the simplistic heavy and catchy riffs with raspy vocals with a good bit of Venom thrown in. Even with the long track length it never gets tedious even with hardy any riffs and just one small guitar solo in the end. The last track is the epic of the album, and clocking in at 13:49 minutes (of course, the length has to deliberate, and for those who don\u2019t know 1349 was the year of the infamous Bubonic Plague in Europe) entitled \u2018Leave No Cross Unturned\u2019. The riffs, the clean vocals which are at time operatic is the bands take on old school power metal. Fenriz never sounded better with his clean vocals approach and the track starts off strongly with his strong vocals and catchy riffs. It doesn\u2019t take long for the abundant Celtic Frost worship to come in once again with those simple catchy riffs, supporting drumming and gruff vocals. Amidst the tempo changes and the switching between Celtic Frost worship and old school power metal worship even though this song doesn\u2019t have enough changes in the tempo or enough riffs to warrant the massive track length the band manages to pull it off in all its epicness and glory.\n\nThis amount of Celtic Frost worship could be expected though. If anyone had seen the promo photos of Darkthrone there was a pic where some felt the band was throwing a pace sign, but if one noticed carefully it was homage to the famous cover of Celtic Frost\u2019s \u201cTo Mega Therion\u201d. This latest release is definitely a grower though, because a solitary or maybe two listens will not let you get hold of everything that is going around here. Just for the sake of summarization this album has elements of heavy metal, speed metal, power metal, 2 waves of black metal, thrash metal and crust punk. The vocals range from clean to operating to gruff to punky and to raspy. The track lengths vary from 4 minutes to 14, and from aggressive to laid back to atmospheric to epic. Though it was wise of the band not to incorporate all these elements on each track together because that would just have been a clusterfuck, this albums seem to me an attempt to throw everything at the wall and see what stuck. Because of the variance of style of tracks the band has little or no fluidity and continuity and seems like the band doesn\u2019t really know what they want to achieve. Unlike previous albums where the band had their fun this was a serious attempt at creating some good music however on previous releases, the band knew what they wanted, a good time, but here the band seems unsure and confused of what they want. That being said it if definitely a better release than the last few albums and has enough on it even amidst the poor song writing to warrant a few listens except of course \u2018Valkyrie\u2019 and the brilliant epic \u2018Leave No Cross Unturned\u2019.\n\n[Originally posted on http://toolatetopray.blogspot.in/]\n",
        "\nDarkthrone is interesting because, despite what anyone says about them, they just don\u2019t give a shit. Their entire aesthetic and songwriting practice seems to be based on emulating their old heroes and, consequently, winging out a never ending stream of cool riffs that gallop and flay like medieval crusaders on a blood-thirsty rampage. It\u2019s hard to tell them that they\u2019re being unoriginal hacks because really all they\u2019re doing is getting drunk off their asses, putting on some Celtic Frost, Mercyful Fate and Venom records and just turning them up to 11 while penning down songs, and if they can write such awesome music as they have in the last 5 years while doing that, who are we to complain?\n\nThe fact that they don\u2019t care is part of the whole idea! It\u2019s almost satirical of the entire metal scene after 1990 \u2013 here are two old school vets, with several classic holy-cow albums under their belts, and rather than succumb to that black-metal superstardom that morons like Gaahl and Varg Vikernes have succumbed to and just ride on controversy and infamy, the Darkthrone boys have chosen to release albums with no coherent theme between them, no real songwriting aesthetic besides \u201880s!!\u2019 and no real credence given to any kind of serious philosophy or lyrical ideology \u2013 all things that are directly anathema to what the black metal kiddies want. Darkthrone do what they want and it\u2019s pretty hilarious to see the reactions sometimes. However, on this new album The Underground Resistance, in which they\u2019ve decided to turn their crosshairs to Manilla Road/Omen-style epic metal, I can\u2019t help but think they\u2019ve fallen a bit short of expectations.\n\nFor one, maybe it is just a personal thing on my part. After all, I listen to bands like Manilla Road and Omen all the time, so my expectations are naturally higher. It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t think this is good \u2013 it is. But it\u2019s not that great. The previous new-era Darkthrone albums like FOAD were masterworks of loose, jamming guitars and the mastery of the rocking guitar riff \u2013 they exuded attitude and style like it was natural. On this album, I don\u2019t really get that at all. The production is muddier and less sharp, so the riffs stand out less, and what riffs there are just don\u2019t really gel as truly awesome \u2013 a lot of them repeat way too much in the confines of the longer song structures, and while Darkthrone tries their hands at making longer more \u201cprogressive\u201d songs, it\u2019s not totally there yet.\n\nI just don\u2019t think this is as memorable an album as the last couple. Everything is sufficiently old school and retro, without ever sounding poser-ish, but the songs aren\u2019t as good \u2013 there is nothing here to match killers like \u201cThese Shores Are Damned\u201d and \u201cOath Minus\u201d off the last few albums, let alone the killer \u201cStylized Corpse\u201d or \u201cThese Treasures Will Never Befall You.\u201d For the first time, a Darkthrone album just makes me want to turn on albums by the bands they\u2019re aping, rather than listen to the full Darkthrone album. I\u2019m not going to say it\u2019s bad or anything, as on songs like \u201cValkyrie,\u201d \u201cThe Ones Left Behind\u201d and the awesome Mercyful Fate-esque \u201cLeave No Cross Unturned,\u201d they do a good job at busting the heads of any posers in the vicinity. But none of them are really that memorable, maybe save for the howling chorus of \u201cLeave No Cross Unturned.\u201d None of them really stick in my head much. And generally, there\u2019s also much less of the unhinged craziness that those other recent albums had. There\u2019s a lot less of the odd lyrical musings, the strange vocal inflections, et cetera \u2013 Darkthrone has dialed down the humorous \u201cironic\u201d touch to their music that made it so gleefully fun in recent years, and as a consequence, I don\u2019t think this is quite as enjoyable.\n\nI\u2019ve been listening to this for a week or so and I enjoy it; really I do. But for an album like this to work, you really need to get awesome fucking riffs, which this album largely does not have. It has good riffs, sure, but the other recent Darkthrone albums have all had better ones in spades. There\u2019s really just no comparison: between the jagged, flailing, head-stomping riffs on Dark Thrones and Black Flags, the searing Paganized heavy metal ownage on FOAD and the total Maiden worship on Circle the Wagons, this album falls short. I applaud Darkthrone\u2019s efforts to go for this kind of sound, because it\u2019s a good sound to copy, but they\u2019ll need better songs next time.\n",
        "\nDarkthrone has always been a very divisive band for me personally. From the minute I heard Under a Funeral Moon I was in love with their particular brand of stripped down, raw black metal; beyond the corpse paint and cover art, they were a no frills, no unnecessary elements, neck-destroying band. A lot of this could be attributed to the heavy Celtic Frost influence their music contained, especially on Panzerfaust, which one could easily call a love letter to Tom G. Warrior's innovators of extreme metal through tracks like \"Quintessence\". On the other hand, the then-excellent Transilvanian Hunger style of black metal was copied by hundreds, probably thousands, of bands that merely took the template that record used and recycled it until it overtook black metal and became what many people generally believe the genre to mostly or entirely consist of at first glance, leading to dozens of bands that in my own listening tenure with extreme metal I wanted to reach through the record player and strangle someone for making such bad music. Many of these same copycats decried the band with their shift to a more punk influenced sound with The Cult is Alive in 2004, a style they continued with through 2008's Dark Thrones and Black Flags. 2010's Circle the Wagons brought the introduction of speed metal elements to the band, a sound which has become fully realized with The Underground Resistance. Make no bones about it, this is the best Darkthrone record not only of their post-black metal era, but since Under a Funeral Moon.\n\nA lot of this album's charm comes with the balls out rocking atmosphere that Fenriz and Nocturno Culto have created here. In the 42 minutes that The Underground Resistance plays for, you just know that these two men are having the time of their lives playing it, something that many of the more modern sounding albums of the here and now sorely lack due to their over-processed, sterile nature. Even with the louder, room vibrating volume this record plays at, you can sense that there is some genuine rock 'n' roll magic taking place in these songs. Musically, as alluded to earlier, the speed metal influences from Circle the Wagons have overtaken the album, leading to a unique yet very entertaining mixture of influences ranging from Agent Steel to Celtic Frost to early Mercyful Fate even. The former two are the most prevalent musical influence on The Underground Resistance, with the latter only really showing itself through the use of high pitched falsetto vocals that are occasionally sprinkled throughout the record (or in the case of \"Leave No Cross Unturned\", the second main vocal style). About half the record is slower and more on the doomy side of things, with \"Come Warfare, the Entire Doom\" best showcasing this, while the other half is balls to the wall speed and intensity, seen through tracks like \"Dead Early\" and the 13-and-a-half minute barnstormer \"Leave No Cross Unturned\". The latter I feel deserves special mention, as to me it encompasses the entire record in one song; half crazy speed metal, and half Celtic Frost, not feeling unnatural in the slightest when the song transitions between the two styles. The record could be construed as a throwback album to speed metal's glory days in the 80s; if that's the case, then I am all for it. Retro-inspired metal has been shown to produce some excellent music, be it the Satanic Blue Oyster Cult of Ghost or Attic's pure King Diamond worship, right down to their vocalist potentially being easily mistaken for one Kim Petersen himself. As long as the music is good, I'm game for anything.\n\nNow this is not to say that the band's most famous style, black metal, is entirely missing from The Underground Resistance. Tracks like \"Come Warfare, the Entire Doom\" mix this hybrid style with some blackened riffage peppered throughout the tune. The whole record in fact has this very distinct feeling to it that one will almost instantly recognize as being Darkthrone. Performance wise the group is just as good as they've always been, if not better. Fenriz and Culto split vocal duties on the record, and it's generally not too hard to discern one from the other; Fenriz uses the Tom Warrior-inspired groan and falsetto voice, and Culto's distinct blackened snarl is noticeable the moment he opens his mouth. The duo's traditional roles throughout most of Darkthrone's discography are no different here, with Culto taking guitars and Fenriz handling drum duties. Culto blazes away with reckless abandon and Fenriz pounds his kit into oblivion throughout the record, best showcased, once again, on \"Leave No Cross Unturned\". The abilities of both are on full display, Culto shredding and Fenriz smashing. It only adds to the sheer fun one will have when listening to the album, something, as mentioned earlier, sorely lacking in many albums released nowadays.\n\nDarkthrone have shown with The Underground Resistance that not only are they in top form, but they are wiping the floor and ringing the wet out of all the bands that aped their early-to-mid-90s style with no care to add anything to it that would make them stand out from the squillions of other bands using that style at the same time. Even nowadays many bands prefer to just use the formula Darkthrone made popular and throw all ingenuity out the proverbial window. Merely rehashing the same ideas over and over again is most definitely not Darkthrone's preferred method of thinking, as The Underground Resistance takes inspiration from the great bands of yesteryear and builds on that inspiration to create a very easy contender for best record of 2013. With its balls out rocking feel, unique mixture of various metal styles, and the sense that the band is having a bigger blast than the Tsar Bomba playing and creating this material, Darkthrone and The Underground Resistance exceed all expectations and firmly secures their place as a band and record you will have no choice but to headbang to. A job well done indeed.\n",
        "\nSoulside Journey holds an interesting place in the history of extreme metal. It was made by Darkthrone, who are one of, if not THE, archetypal second wave black metal acts, yet Soulside Journey is in fact a death metal album. That, however, for me, is the extent of Soulside Journey's appeal. It holds no appeal for repeated listens, and I find after I am done listening to it that I can only pick out a few riffs and lines here and there. Far from being either atmospheric OR brutal, it seems to be content with meandering around with no direction or substance. True to what would later become a plague among Darkthrone albums, Gylve and co. seem to have the idea that good enough is good enough; that simply playing a random assortment of riffs for 3-5 minutes is enough for a song. Dynamics are out the window, and the phrasing is about as comatose as it gets.\n\nPart of the blame must lay on my expectations; I had heard Soulside Journey being described as a technical death metal album, or at least one where the musicians get to shine and \"proves\" they can actually play their instruments. I must wonder, then, whether we are listening to the same album. Fenriz (credited here as Hank Amarillo for some reason) doesn't really do anything that hasn't been done to death in the world of death metal at the time of Soulside Journey's making (c. 1990) and I can think of many albums made around the same time that have WAY more technical drumming. Sure, Fenriz can keep a beat on this album (which on a couple later albums he can't even make that claim) but his drumming never adds anything to the music; the best Fenriz can do, it seems, is not totally fuck up the songs. The guitar riffs are equally amorphous and anonymous, with few lines to hold on to, it seems the songs just plod on and on and on with no climax and no emotion from the guitars whatsoever. \n\nPartially to blame, as well, is the production. I don't know who's idea this was, but the drum levels were jacked way up, and the guitars are left to wither at the bottom of the mix. The vocals dominate as well, making this sound like a vocals/drums show with the guitars and bass left in the dust. The guitar tone is actually surprisingly similar to the tone on the next two Darkthrone albums, i.e. cold and \"snarky\". The difference here is that they are mixed way down and as a result the production lends Soulside Journey a \"safe\", \"sterile\" sound that fails to excite me. The drums, as well, even though mixed high in the mix, have a dead, hermetically void sound. The drum hits decay very quickly, which, although the drums are loud, make them quite thin-sounding. In fact, the whole production sounds quite thin, and this isn't an issue of money; how much, after all, can it cost to just bump the guitars up a bit? Well either way the production, just like the rest of the aspects of Soulside Journey, is mediocre. \n\nI can't recommend getting this album, though. Death metal fans will probably find it to be quite boring, and fans of Darkthrone's black metal works will likely pass on it due to the lack of any discernible atmosphere. A lesson that any musician should learn early on, is that good enough isn't ever good enough. Here, Darkthrone wrote a bunch of death metal songs that were good enough, with a production that was good enough; they never, however, aspire to greatness, it seems, and there's really nothing, other than the name and it's place in Darkthrone's history, that would make Soulside Journey stand out. With so many other, better, death metal albums out there, there's no reason to get this.\n",
        "\nDarkthrone's 1994 release Transilvanian Hunger is considered one of the classic and best albums in the genre that is Black Metal. It's raw sound has captivated many for over a decade now, and has been cited as an influence on black metal bands since it's release. But does it hold up, and is it really that good?\n\nThe album was released in 1994 under the seal of the record company Peaceville. This was Darkthrone's fourth album, and their third as a Black Metal band. The album was recorded in two separate sessions; one in December of 1993 for the instruments, and one in 1994 for the vocals. The album was actually recorded in it's entirety by the band's founding member Fenriz himself. While some people have considered this a rumor, Fenriz has stated in two interviews at least.\n\nAs with most early Darkthrone albums, a member of the band is featured on the cover. For this recording, Fenriz takes the cover. The album originally had a little controversy with a phrase on the back of the cover. Originally, the back cover featured the phrase Norsk Arisk Black Metal, which translates to Norwegian Aryan Black Metal. However due to the negative reception by many distributors, it was later changed to the band's signature phrase \"True Norwegian Black Metal.\" Another little fun fact that some people might not be aware of, is that Varg Vikernes is credited on the album under his name Count Grishnackh. This is due to the fact that he wrote the lyrics for the lost four songs of the album. Many people who heard this back in '94 thought that because he wrote the lyrics, that he was the one who appeared on the cover.\n\nThe track list for the album is as follows:\n\n1. Transilvanian Hunger\n2. Over Fjell Og Gjennom Torner (the unofficial English translation is Over Mountains and Through Thorns)\n3. Skald Av Satans Sol (the unofficial English translation is Scald Of Satan's Sun)\n4. Slottet I Det Fjerne (the unofficial English translation is The Castle in the Distance)\n5. Graven Takeheimens Saler (the unofficial English translation is Tombs in the Misty Halls)\n6. I En Hall Med Flesk Og Mj\u00f8d (the unofficial English translation is In a Hall With Meat and Mead)\n7. As Flittermice As Satans Spys\n8. En As I Dype Skogen (the unofficial English translation is An \u00c1s* in the Deep Woods)\n\n* A Norse deity\n\nThe entire sound of the album is for the most part raw. This has never been uncommon when it comes to Black Metal recordings, especially for those from Norway and Sweden. Due to this, it helps paint a picture with the lyrics. If you close your eyes, and listen to the album in the dark at night, with headphones on, you can begin to imagine the landscape of Transylvania, and the interior of the castle sung about. I might get stabbed by my fellow metal heads for saying this, but this album could be a fun companion to the old classic Castlevania games for the Nintendo Entertainment System and Super Nintendo Entertainment System.\n\nEach instrument can be clearly heard. The guitar and drums are at the forefront as are with most Darkthrone releases. The riffs that drone out are some of the most classic in the genre, and can paint a bleak sound for the listener. The drums pound about throughout the album, bringing a thunderous beat to these black hymns. Hell, you can even make out the sound of the base on some tracks. The sound which is featured on Transylvania Hunger is what I myself, and many others consider the quintessential sound for Norwegian Black metal albums. It's one of the band's most complex and mature releases, and shows the progress from when they started as a death metal band in the mid to late 80's, and transformed into the cult black metal band they became and are now.\n\nIn conclusion, Transilvanian Hunger is one of the great albums of Norweigna Black Metal, and Black Metal as a whole. Is it the best album? Well no. Some of the production is not at it's best here. As I alluded to earlier, there are times when the atmosphere of the songs really comes through and can paint a picture. However, on the other side of the tracks, it can do the complete opposite and kill whatever atmosphere it had going for it.\n\nIs it a masterpiece? No. Is it a piece of a crap? Not at all. But it isn't the be all album that many fans consider it, and go head over heels for. Of course, this is all just opinion. So don't start bashing the album because somebody says what's bad about it. And to that degree, don't attack the reviewer.\n\nNo matter what you think about the album, it is very enjoyable. I highly suggest this to anybody who comes and asks me for a good metal album, no matter what genre they prefer. It's not perfect, but it does the job of helping to cement Darkthrone, and it's members as some of the elite in the Black Metal scene.\n\n***Originally written by myself for my review Blog***\n",
        "\nBefore Darkthrone became one of the most important bands in the history of black metal, it released a single atmospheric death metal album\u2014Soulside Journey. While the album does create an intensely alienating atmosphere, the disinterested pathos seems to infest the band\u2019s performance. While the music is fairly interesting, the performance is lethargic and plodding. The result is a technically efficient but emotionally stale recording. \n\nMusically, Soulside Journey is fairly standard Scandinavian death metal circa 1991. There is lots of muddy tremolo picking, a fair share of slow, harmonious passages and a few brisk solos. The vocals are husky, but not excessively deep. They are heavily reverbed, which gives them a supernatural sensibility. It\u2019s as if some massive apparition were speaking to you from another realm. The elements that manage to distinguish Soulside Journey are the production and keyboards. In spite of the thick riffs, this album feels very open. Perhaps it\u2019s all the echo and reverb, but this album creates immense space not unlike the landscape on the album cover. This is accentuated by the keyboards, which from time to time cloak the music in alien tones and ghostly choirs. The lyrics, which constantly reference vast landscapes, further help Soulside Journey create a distinct atmosphere.\n\nWhere the album falls short is in song-structure and energy. Many Darkthrone songs have unconventional song structures and on albums like A Blaze in the Northern Sky and Under a Funeral Moon they provide quite a few thrills. However, here the songs often feel directionless and unorganized. Songs often end out of the blue. A number of songs end on guitar or bass solos (i.e. \u201cNeptune Towers\u201d and \u201cSempiternal Sepulchrality\u201d), which are played at a notably faster pace than the rest of the song. It is an unnatural and unsatisfying way to end a song. Considering these songs are all fairly short (3-5 minutes) Darkthrone should have taken the time to provide more fluid outros. \n\nHowever, the biggest problem is that the album is just so low on energy. None of the musicians sound inspired. The riffs are dry and the though the vocals are atmospherically effective, they lack emotion. Similarly, the keyboards often feel exhausted. Furthermore, the tempo shifts are high in quantity but low in intensity. Most the album is played in a slow tempo, so it would be nice if when the band shifted into a faster tempo the music received a jolt of life. Unfortunately that never happens, and consequently, the tempo shifts are fairly unmoving. \n\nSoulside Journey is a sedating album. The atmosphere is interesting and the musicianship is stellar, but when combined with the tired performance and emotional emptiness, Soulside Journey can be a somewhat dull listen. This is all quite shocking when one considers that Darkthrone would release one of the most cathartic and energetic albums in the history of extreme metal only a year later. Odds are that the bland flavor of Soulside Journey is a product of a band playing a style of music that is not their strong suit. That said, there are enough interesting riffs that it is worth listening to a song or two every now and then. Not a bad album, but by far the weakest of the early Darkthrone releases. \n\n(Originally written for http://deinos-logos.blogspot.com)\n",
        "\nI'm a particularly big fan of old school extreme metal demos. Darkthrone's entire demo output is no exception. Their initial demo, Land Of Frost, is one I find, despite the horrible quality, a perfect introduction to their death metal material for those who know the band only for their black metal releases. \n\nBack in that wonderful year of 1988, when death metal and grindcore were both already established quite well, little was known about the bands that were forming in Norway. Among them were Mayhem, who was already established in the country, Burzum was just getting underway, and then there was Darkthrone, a band who had formed the year before. The next year, they would cough up a demo that would spark their amazingly influential career. \n\nThe demo kicks off with some static-drenched wind and some kind of monster growling. It then kicks off into a brutal death metal riff, complete with blast beats and demonic vocals that have an atmospheric delay effect to them. And that is just the first song. All the songs are extreme and contain these attributes. It appears Nocturno Culto wasn't even in the band at the time, making drummer Fenriz the only original member on this release, but that doesn't hinder the overall musical quality. Their are some of the most impressive riffs I've ever heard, switching between violent amounts of distortion and eerie clean sounds, and the fact that the song titles and the artwork of the demo cases are seriously awesome is just a bonus. And although the quality is completely wretched, it too, like so many lo-fi releases, adds to the overall heaviness of the demo.\n\nI absolutely adore this release. It's a perfect introduction to the origins of early Norwegian black metal. It's also a reminder that these bands weren't always black metal, with their roots and beginnings buried so deep within death metal. It's also a must-have for anyone interested in the origins of Darkthrone.\n",
        "\nDarkthrone fans are fucking fickle. They constantly change at the drop of the hat by Fenriz's word and are the first to start saying \"Black Metal sucks\" yet were the very same reason why Darklthrone has been trying to get away from the genre for their past few albums and essentially telling the entire genre that the game is pretty much over and done with. Well this isn't the FIRST time they have tried to do this sort of thing. And I don't mean by changing genres with 'Ablaze\"...no, I'm speaking about telling BM to basically piss off. They did this at the height of their creative peak in the mid 90's in the form of an album that generally is not well-recognized. I mean, yeah it exists and fans KNOW that it does, but because of the album that came before it, it doesn't get the attention it deserves and damn it it deserves just about as much praise as their unholy trinity (\"Ablaze/Under/Transilvanian\"). \"Panzerfaust\" is an album that is basically uglier than all of those albums combined. It doesn't let up on the feeling that you are being shouted at by an aging old man in a wheelchair, hunched over, just about to be touched by death himself, while shitting his pants and telling kids to get the hell away from him. \n\nFirst thing to be noted; don't expect \"Transilvanian Hunger\" Even though the first song \"En Vind Ar Sorg\" sounds like a left-over, it's to set you up for what is to come with the rest of the album. It's the calm before the storm of fucking RIFFS and I do mean RIFFS from metal hell. Because shortly after that song we are subjected to what could be the best Celtic Frost-worship album next to Dream Death's \"Journey Into Mystery.\" \"Triumphant Gleam\"??? That intro riff is the same intro riff to Celtic Frost's \"The Usurper\" and the CF worship doesn't stop there. \"The Hordes Of Nebulah\"....one word: DOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM!!!! Oh motherfuck me, it doesn't get any heavier than this song. The song is more Hellhammer-influenced with a dash of possibly early Paradise Lost/Dream Death as far as the doom influence goes. \"Hans siste vinter\" is really the only other song that is a leftover from \"Transylvania Hunger\" almost to the point where you might call it \"En Vind Ar Sorg Prt. 2.\" \"Beholding The Throne Of Might\" goes right back into the doom-ridden Hellhammer influence and the truly epic finale of \"Panzerfaust\" is the song \"Quintessence\" that takes the doomy-as-fuck song \"The Hordes of Nebula\" to even more doomier lengths. How that is even possible, I don't know but they pull if off. One might say that \"Quintessence\" is a more somber/depressed-sounding cousin to the ever-fucking-pissed and angry sounding \"Hordes...\"....and at last we come to the weirdest way to ever end a Darkthrone album. \"Sn\u00f8 Og Granskog\" is an instrumental/spoken word track. Imagine early Mortiis ala \"F\u00f8dt til \u00e5 Herske\" with deep Norse vocals and that's what you would get. Essentially \"Sn\u00f8 Og Granskog\" is an old poem by Tarjei Vesaas. I have no clue to as what this poem may have in relation to the music, but feel-wise you get the idea of who the real kings of Norway are as far as music goes. The horns, tribal drum sounds.....it's all very fitting.\n\nLyrically wise, and this is something that I forgot to touch upon. It's definitely the angriest. Remember this is the album before \"Total Death\" which was essentially Darkthrone having all the other well-know Norway bands basically write their own album for them. You can definitely hear the levels of pure misanthropic frustration and general hatred Fenriz and Nocturno Culo have for their fellow man. It doesn't take a rocket scientist to feel Nocturno and Fenriz's scorn when reading lyrics such as this;\n\n\"For the eternal slaves\nThe envy of losers so indeed upon losers themselves\nAnd destruction upon the holy man\nWho hails a Jew\nJoin us \nWe are (the) future now\nBe desecration master\nBe the hammer\nThe hammer\" - \"Beholding The Throne Of Might\"\n\nThere's also some lyrics that might suggest a bit of, dare I say 'soul-searching', or in the case of these Nord's.....a search for even further isolation which just re-affirms for their unobtainable level of misanthropy:\n\n\"Oh, We are the Hordes of Nebula\nHaving Traveled through an Eternal Sea of Void\nWe glance upon a distant light\nStar in the Far; Ye Mighty Sun\nWill you Die before We reach you?\" - \"The Hordes of Nebula\"\n\nThe only thing that I do not tend to agree with everyone on this is the sound production. Folks, this is a Darkthrone album. This is the band that carried the torch of lo-fi sounding albums into the 90's. I mean if these so-called \"TR00 METAL WARRIORS\" with their cut little kvttle jackets they post on tshirtslayer.com all the time just to compare the same 50 million patches everyone has, are complaining about the sound production on a fucking Darkthrone album then why in Satan's name would they also say listen to Sodom's \"Obsessed By Cruelty\", or Sarcofago's \"I.N.R.I.\" for that matter??? This is what Metal is supposed to be; raw, ugly, uncaring, in-your-face, and going against the grain which Darkthrone has been doing long before these assholes started stroking themselves over Xasthur 2 years ago.\n\nIn short; it's a definite album any Darkthrone fan should have. It's a must-have. It's the angriest and possible most misanthropic album they've ever created, and....what else....it's a fucking Darkthrone album. Nuff said. Get it and worship it's ugliness.\n",
        "\nDoes the world really need another re-release of the Darkthrone demos? That really all depends on how much of a fanatic one has become for the band, or whether or not one finds particular format more appealing than the previous conditions under which they were issued upon the niche audience. A handful of years ago, in 2008, Peaceville put out the 21st anniversary collection Frostland Tapes which included all the material in a rougher form, on three CDs packed with extras. Even earlier than that, the Preparing for War collection included a number of the demo tracks though in a less sequential, incomplete package. So really, it's hard not to think of Sempiternal Past: The Darkthrone Demos as a bit of a redundancy despite the decision to remaster and restore the material with the best possible quality. Even the cover art has already been used...\n\nHowever, if one had not previously acquired those earlier compilations, then Sempiternal Past is a great way of gathering the demos in one place in their proper, chronological order. As hinted, they audio has been better flushed out from the original source tapes here, and so even their most primordial, amateurish compositions like \"Forest of Darkness\" from the 1988 Land of Frost demo feels more brazen and fulfilling with the filtered, odd vocals and drudging, primitive riffs. I feel that personally the drums sound a little better, and even the guitars, though I've never been a huge proponent for these earlier tapes as they offered nothing more than groundwork for the Norwegians to establish the later, death metal style of Soulside Journey. There's also the fact that, well, do compositions as prehistoric as these of Land of Frost or A New Dimension even NEED to be brushed up? Doesn't the very base nature of their sound on the prior collections or even just tracking down filthy digital versions sort of lend to their charm? I don't necessarily see the point of polishing a turd if the very charm of it was the stench to begin with...\n\nBut then, on the other hand, Sempiternal Past feels like the 'de facto' format with which to experience the material. Whether you've got the vinyls or the CD set, the demos are carefully laid out in order without arbitrary interference from rehearsals or other bits. There are bonus tracks included after the four demos, including the two 1989 live performances that were aired on television in Oslo (\"Soria Moria Slott\" and \"Eon/Thulcandra\" medley). But then, anyone with the special edition of Preparing for War already experienced them. Probably the best part of Semptineral Reign is having the track \"God of Disturbance and Friction\" for your collection, but then this is a pretty average piece with standard Celtic Frost inspired, mid-paced chords and rasping that isn't among their better written, or more sinister executions.\n\nUltimately, with two previous collections available with three discs each, I didn't come away from this feeling as if I'd gotten anything new or important. None of the demo material is capable of superceding the album incarnations (where applicable), and neither does the skimpy bonus material impress. If you don't already have the Frostland Tapes, and you're looking to complete your Darkthrone collection or replace whatever dubs or rips you have of the old demos, then this is an acceptable solution (and maybe bump my rating up a notch or two). It's not like Fenriz, Culto and Peaceville just regurgitated this to turn a cheap buck, some effort was used in refinishing the levels of the mix and giving you a version they were happy with you hearing. But I didn't end up enjoying these particular tunes more than past exposures, and thus my preference remains with Preparing for War as it had that sweet DVD, or especially Frostland for that added instrumental disc. If you're ever faced with the choice, just be forewarned what you'll be getting in each case. I'm sure the double vinyl will at least prove collectible since that format is all the rage right now.\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nThere's never been a time in music like the winter of 1993-1994. Being only a one year old, I can't say that from experience, but looking at the albums released at that time (Transylvanian Hunger, Hvis Lysett Tar Oss, Pure Holocaust, In the Nightside Eclipse, Vikingligr Veldi, De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas) is basically looking at a list of greatest black metal albums ever.\n\nEven though Hvis Lysett Tar Oss may have been the best album in the group and In the Nightside Eclipse may have had the greatest influence, Transylvanian Hunger is perhaps the most significant album here. Without a doubt, it's become a bible among minimalist/atmospheric/mother's basement bands the world over. It was the first and most successful instance of the genre and has been copied, for good reason, ad nauseum.\n\nThe production is perfect for what they were trying to achieve. The vocals stick out like a lead instrument should, the guitars are harsh, the bass is fully audible, and the drums provide a nice atmospheric rhythm. The instrumentation is pretty much a non-issue when it comes to atmospheric black metal. The one thing I would like to share is that, contrary to popular opinion, songs like these can be surprisingly hard to play on a guitar (as far as drums and bass go, I have no idea). Playing perfectly-executed tremolo power chords five minutes straight requires a fair amount of stamina in your wrists that takes some time to develop.\n\nWith the lyrics mostly being in Norwegian, I doubt I could have much to say in this respect. Judging from the many amateur translations, I'd say their pretty much the awesome, satanism/paganism-inspired narratives you would expect. \u201cSlottet I Det Fjerne\u201d is no doubt inspired by Grendel in \u201cBeowulf\u201d and is a stand out.\n\nThe two English songs are very far apart in quality. \u201cTranslivanian Hunger\u201d has classic, albeit clich\u00e9d, Norenglish lyrics (apparently memorable, since the queer phrase \u201cdelightfully immortal\u201d is always popping in my head for some reason...). The lyrics to \u201cAs Flittermice As Satans Spys,\u201d courtesy of Varg Vikernes, are probably my favorite lyrics to any black metal song ever. These lyrics are great simply for all of the words it invents (\u201cplenilune\u201d = full moon; \u201cFlittermice\u201d = bats; use of \u201cumbrage\u201d as a verb). It also pretty much summarizes the ideology of all of black metal in one song, like in the lines:\n\n\u201cBeholding the son recrucified, beholding gods race browbeaten (yes, for better or worse, anti-semitism will always be apart of black metal...),\nBeholding the Devastation of all morals built by them.\u201d\n\n\nIn terms of composition, a lot of people hate this album because they somehow perceive it as \u201clazy\u201d or \u201cunskilled\u201d for repeating riffs. I suppose when they hear the words \u201cminimalist atmospheric black metal\u201d, they think of Necrophagist or something. Of course riffs are going to be repeated \u2013 the key to not becoming boring is asking yourself how often, when, how long, ect. Darkthrone answers these questions perfectly on this album. For all of the simplified drum beats and lack of variation in song composition, I very rarely, if at all, feel bored when listening to this album. That says a lot.\n\nMost of the time what makes a great minimalist band, of course, are the riffs. This is where Darkthrone shines the most as the melodies on these riffs are simply amazingly atmospheric. There's only maybe one or two riffs here that I would consider substandard and a little boring, but the rest are pure gold. Solos are implemented to tastefully augment the effect of the music (the end of \u201cSkald Av Satans Sol\u201d is a good example), which is a must because solos can easily ruin the atmosphere if they run amok.\n\nThe other thing to mention is that this isn't what I'd term \u201ccut-and-paste\u201d riff compositions like some other minimalist bands (not just black metal). That is to say there is a lot of variation and, perhaps, improvisation outside of the regular riff progression. The guitar feedback and ominous drums at the end of \u201cOver Fjell Og Gjennom Torner\u201d is a good example. The wriggling bass line under \u201cTransilvanian Hunger\u201d is another. These seldom-noticed aspects prevent the music from becoming merely robotic, \u201criff A to riff B\u201d shit.\n\nTo conclude:\nPositive Points \u2013 the riffs are hypnotizing; the production fits like a glove; the lyrics are classic.\nNegative Points \u2013 none\n",
        "\nFollowing critically acclaimed releases like Transilvanian Hunger and Panzerfaust, the next Darkthrone album had a lot to live up to. Unfortunately, Total Death didn't seem to live up to those standards and many will argue that it's the first album of the crappy mid-era Darkthrone. Total Death is still a pretty good album on its own terms because it is a lot different than their previous albums and thus shows off more what the band is capable of. Also, most of the lyrics here were written by people not in the band. You can expect a lot of diversity in ideas between tracks and that holds to be true. \n\nTotal Death indeed sounds like a Darkthrone album. If you were to take their entire discography and pick out what can be defined as the average Darkthrone song, that is, a blend of everything they've done, you'd probably get something like what's on Total Death. The music as a whole keeps its raw nature, offering simple guitar riffs, competent enough drumming, and always the deep and bitter shrieks performed by Nocturno Culto. There isn't anything particularly deep in the songwriting and if you can take a guess at where the song is going to go next, you might be right. \n\nThe worst aspect of this album may be the lack of atmosphere, at least compared to previous albums. Panzerfaust put me in a grey world with bitterly freezing winds, while Transilvanian Hunger made me envision a dark forest. Blaze in the Northern Sky made me imagine a dark winter sky in weather that completely numbed you and Under a Funeral Moon had a unique, dark, ritualistic feel. I don't get any of this in Total Death which is a shame because the atmosphere is what drew me into Darkthrone in the first place. I can't really use my imagination for most of these songs when I listen to them. \n\nFortunately, some of the tracks really save the day. 'Blasphemer' is incredible! It's strongly thrash based with simple but extremely catchy riffs. It feels like something I've heard in older bands but the song always feels fresh to me. Nocturno Culto's harsh, abrasive vocals also kill on this track - the performance adds an entirely new level of quality in the music. Another good track is 'The Serpent's Harvest.' This one can start off a bit laggy, but it does show a great deal of Darkthrone's melodic side once you get to the middle. This wasn't something I was expecting so easily. None of the tracks are really that weak - they're all kind of average. If you like one, you might like the rest. \n\nDespite the lack of a strong atmosphere and intricate song writing, there are some decent surprises in some of the tracks, as well as the album itself. Sure, a lot of it is still predictable, but there's nothing too offensive or disappointing in that respect. Total Death is an album that will probably be remembered most for having so many song writing contributions from non-members. It's one of those albums that Darkthrone fans will buy but leave in their collection for a while until they suddenly get an urge to remember this album and listen to it again. Total Death is by no means a bad album, but doesn't hold that same fire as Darkthrone's stronger works. Most of the material on here is at least worth listening to.\n",
        "\nPlaguewielder is quite a unique album that features the traditional black metal production but manages to pack a punch. We also see Darkthrone mature as artist, incorporating more complicated song writing without sound too pretentious. Sometimes Plaguewielder sounds like newer Emperor, for example \u201cCommand\u201d features some Emperor like riffing around the 6:30 minute mark. The best way to describe the tone of this album would be Satyricon (Rebel Extravaganza) meets A Blaze in the Northern Sky. \n\nPlaguewielder, features six lengthy tracks, ranging from 5-9 minutes. The exciting part is that these tracks feature lots of beefy riffs. Nocturno Culto isn\u2019t the best guitarist but he knows how to make catchy riffs. Check out the chorus\u2019 of Sin Origin and Command, both feature anthem-like riffs that will have your foot tapping. The final track, Wreak features some of the catchiest mid-tempo riffs and tremolo picking ever. During the three-minute mark, begins a build up that eventually hits a minute later. This build up features Nocturno Culto playing a simple lead over some crazy blast beats. At the four-minute mark we get a big Transylvanian Hunter type of tremolo riff, which will hook you on the first listen! \n\nMost of Plaguewielder\u2019s punch comes from the drums. The band\u2019s previous album, Ravishing Grimness (1999) saw Fenriz playing half assed beats that simply kept the pace. With Plaguewielder, Fenriz breaks through the icy grimness and releases a plague upon the ears. This album is full of drum fills that bridge the gaps between riffs seamlessly. His high-hat taping always seems to carry an extra groove, for example the middle section of I, Voidhanger. The snare and bass kick are perfectly mixed with the buzzing guitars, unlike older albums such as Under a Funeral Moon or Transylvanian Hunger. Like A Blaze in the Northern Sky, Fenriz\u2019s drum set takes a beating. Unlike Blaze\u2026, Plaguewielder\u2019s production allows the listener to hear that beating MUCH clearer. \n\nOverall, Plaguewielder sounds much more inspired than their previous black metal albums. The only downfall is that this album seems to be dismissed within the cannon Darkthrone collection. Perhaps this is because it\u2019s more complicated nature, or not so grim production. Recommended for fans that want to hear a more professional Darkthrone. Plus if you buy the album, you\u2019ll get to see Nocturno Culto in some nu-metal baggy jeans!\n",
        "\nI first discovered Darkthrone through their Black Metal release Transylvanian Hunger. While being a fan of Black Metal at the time, I was not necessarily impressed with the lo fidelity production values. When it came to Black Metal, I always favored the likes of later Anthems to the Welkin at Dusk Emperor. Then suddenly, I had accidentally stumbled across an album by Darkthrone entitled \u201cSoulside Journey\u201d. Judging by the album cover and the layout of the cardboard disc holder, I thought they had released a new album. To my surprise, Soulside Journey was actually their first studio album ever made, and upon listening, the best they\u2019ve ever made.\n\nIn the vein of Nocturnus\u2019 The Key, Soulside Journey is a Death Metal album that uses keyboards, which was (and still is) rare in Death Metal. Soulside Journey was actually recorded in Sunlight Studios, Sweden, the same studio Entombed recorded their debut release Left Hand Path. The typical high quality Sunlight studio production is all there, so don\u2019t expect some raw lo fidelity quality here at all. According to an interview with Fenriz, the guys from Entombed actually helped Darkthrone achieve that typical Swedish trademark sound, which I can safely say did them well. Unfortunately, shortly after the release of SJ, Darkthrone caught the Black Metal plague and abandoned their unique trademark Death Metal sound. Although, few Death Metal traits remained for their A Blaze In the Northern Sky release.\n\nThe album starts you off with Cromlech which consists of an eerie synth intro then escalates into fast and menacing tremolo riffs and double kick style drumming. After the fast parts come to an end, the song reverts to slow dark Doom Metal inducing powerchords with keyboard fills to give it extra atmosphere, then repeats the process again. When you first hear Nocturno Culto\u2019s \u201cInto the abyss I fall\u201d line it is enough to send shivers down your spine. There\u2019s also one part where he does a pitch shifted growl that sounds very menacing and evil. In my opinion, the vocals here are much more evil than the vocals on Under a Funeral Moon or Transylvanian Hunger by a long shot. After Cromlech, the album progresses and becomes much more technical sounding.\n\nI\u2019ll skip ahead to the track Accumulation of Generalization. It\u2019s an instrumental with no lyrics, but there are a few pretty cool pitch shifted vocal fills here and there. Neptune Towers features some eerie synth work, slow Doom inducing riffs, and gives you an overall feeling of impending doom. My favorite track of the whole album is Grave With A View. The lyrics are really brutal in which they tell a scenario of spitting into the mouth of a priest and killing him as \u201crevenge\u201d for those that died. An obvious reference to the Christian - Pagan massacres in Norway that happened in the middle ages. In a way, you could say Grave With A View is an almost Black Metal like track because of the blasphemous anti-christian lyrics.\n\nOverall, everything on Soulside Journey seems reminiscent of the early Swedish Death Metal scene. Early Entombed, Grave, and Nirvana 2002 come to mind. I can perfectly understand why Peaceville would disagree with their sudden switch to Black Metal after SJ, it may be the biggest mistake they\u2019ve ever made. Darkthrone will always remain a huge name in the Black Metal underground, but they could have been much much more had they stayed a Death Metal band. The production is there, but can\u2019t be said for the latter releases by this band. Soulside Journey was often dismissed as being trendy by the Black Metal elitists who only favor the lo fidelity Black Metal and Crust stuff. However, to those with an open mind, Soulside Journey remains a technical Death Metal masterpiece.\n",
        "\nOf all the albums I have encountered in the metal scene, I don't think there's one which inspires more hypocritical and irrational defenses than this one: \"The Cult is Alive,\" the album which announced Darkthrone's final, biggest sellout. This is, for all intents and purposes, Darkthrone's \"Load\" or \"Cold Lake.\" Attempting to justify it on any sort of artistic level is not just myopic but completely laughable. Not only is it one of the most ideologically and artistically bankrupt stylistic shifts in the history of metal, but on its own terms, \"The Cult is Alive\" is a truly awful, unlistenable album that anyone in their right mind should disown without a second thought. When someone says that they think \"Transilvanian Hunger\" is a bad album, it's one of the few opinions I hear that make me massively rethink the musical intelligence of the person I'm speaking to. Approval for this album works in much the same way.\n\nI don't find this album so shameful due to thinking that it somehow murdered Darkthrone's career- hardly. Darkthrone had been making basically irrelevant, disposable music for a full decade before \"The Cult is Alive\" dropped; it's not as though this album (or any of its followers) are taking the place of some sort of mythical \"Under A Funeral Moon\" part two which would otherwise have been crafted. No- Darkthrone's been pretty much artistically done for a long fucking time, so don't ever think that I'm complaining about a particular loss due to this album's failure. But the crucial element to remember is that even though all those fairly bland, generic black metal albums did very little artistically, they were legitimate pieces; at no point do I think that an album like \"Ravishing Grimness,\" mediocre as it might be, is a cynical play on the metal scene's standards, a cash grab, a resignation to irrelevance, or anything else as shameful. Even at their worst, before \"The Cult is Alive,\" Darkthrone were always TRYING- even on something excruciating and half-assed like \"Goatlord,\" there was a certain zeal to the music. And herein lies the difference: \"The Cult is Alive\" is the sound of Darkthrone getting old, fat, comfortable, and smug. It's a transparent fuck-you to the metal scene, and even more disappointingly, is an instance of the band willfully vomiting on their own legacy.\n\nThe party to blame for all this, though, is Fenriz. Much in the same way that Morbid Angel's latest excretion was dissected in order to assign proper blame, I've taken a look at the (admittedly smaller cast of characters) involved in this macabre dance, and Fenriz is quite clearly the snake's head manufacturing this horror. To be perfectly fair: Fenriz has always, to a greater or lesser degree, been the public voice of Darkthrone. Nocturno Culto, for all his contributions to the band, has really always been content to rest in the background of the band's natural celebrity status, leaving Fenriz out front to soak up much of the glory and attention. Unfortunately, I think \"The Cult is Alive\" signifies the exact moment where Fenriz began to believe his own hype. Always an abrasive, sarcastic, somewhat tactless character in the past, Fenriz' attitude regarding Darkthrone's musical shift isn't exactly an entirely new phenomenon, but the sheer degree of his pig-headedness, arrogance, and obsessively self-congratulatory posturing most certainly is. All the more remarkable given the band's madogiwa zoku status in the metal scene, but I'll let that aspect slide.\n\nHalf a decade after its release, you've likely heard this already, but I feel the need to clarify some of the (in my mind) massively misguided points made about this album by many critics. The most glaring and crucial: this is not crust-infused. This does not have substantial crust influence, it is not a hybrid of crust and metal, and it's certainly not a straightforward crust punk album, as some have somehow managed to express. I'm not entirely sure what sort of music those describing this album as such have been listening to, but \"The Cult is Alive\" quite simply doesn't sound like crust punk. I don't hear a trace of Amebix anywhere on here- no Discharge, nothing else from the d-beat category, and certainly none of the more brackish crust bands who would go on to influence grindcore. The d-beats, simple, strummed riffs, and somewhat punky vocal delivery that litter this album do not on their own make this crust punk, and even when isolated on their own are not particularly similar to crust. I'm sure my reiteration of this is tedious, but it's equally tedious to see people express with such conviction that this is somehow in the same pantheon as Siege or something. It's not.\n\nWhich I suppose begs the question of what this is, if not crust punk. Well, while I wouldn't describe this as crust, punk is a fair enough descriptive term- or \"punky,\" rather. Not a particularly intense or savage variety of punk either- apart from the d-beats and occasionally more aggressive riffing or drumming, this doesn't even substantially sound like old hardcore (which early Darkthrone did much better.) Many moments on this disc remind me more of the Sex Pistols than Black Flag. More overt than the punk, though, and probably the more substantial influence, is plain and simple rock and roll. Cut from the same cloth as Mot\u00f6rhead's more restrained moments and beefed up with the sort of Celtic Frostisms the band cribbed from way back in the \"A Blaze in the Northern Sky\" days, the bulk of this music has more in common with rock than any sort of metal, much less black metal itself. All the black metal on this release really comes out through aesthetics and not through composition: buzzy guitar tones, rasping vocals, and simplified drumming. Strip away the distortion, though, and what are you left with? Something even remotely comparable to \"black metal\" proper? Of course not.\n\nBut all this idle chatter about how to classify \"The Cult is Alive\" is ultimately meaningless, as simply \"being black metal\" is not an indicator of quality or value, nor is rock influence necessarily the death knell for those either. But even when taken on its own, devoid of the influence of the scene, the band's history, or Fenriz' attitude regarding the music, \"The Cult is Alive\" still manages to be despicably lazy, inarticulate, and bland. The truly amazing thing about this album isn't just that it's an utter sellout, openly capitalizing on hipsters migrating into black metal in droves, but that it manages to suck so badly from a simple craftsman's perspective. None of this music is interesting, stylish, or even merely catchy: in addition to failing as art, it fails miserably as entertainment, which only serves to make the whole package more shameful.\n\nAstute writers have noted that, pound for pound, most of the musical techniques on this album aren't especially new for Darkthrone- really, it's more a matter of what's been removed. Complex melodies with unusual chord shapes- gone. Thrash beats and tremolo riffs- gone. Any sort of variation from track to track: especially gone. \"The Cult is Alive\" basically relies on a handful of very simple riff paradigms: uptempo, punky strumming, slower open chord chug arrangements (ala \"In the Shadow of the Horns,\") and the very, very occasional dip into some traditional black metal arrangements, such as on \"De Underjordiske (\u00c6lia Capitolina).\" Unsurprisingly, when Darkthrone goes in a more substantially black metal direction (like on that track,) the music becomes at least somewhat tolerable. Not great, not interesting, but listenable enough that it doesn't bother you. Unfortunately, this sort of thing is the exception rather than the rule, and for the most part Darkthrone are content to swim around in a fetid pool of rock-based drumming, awful guest vocal spots by Fenriz, and an array of half-assed punk/rock/metal riffs which somehow manage to all sound identical to each other. Nothing conveys anything on this album; the songs just exist to be themselves.\n\nAgain, if this album appeared to have effort put into its construction, I wouldn't be as horribly frustrated by it as I am. But the reality is that you can clearly tell through the songwriting that these tracks were rushed out, slapped together, and barely looked over before recording. From a technical perspective, the songs are flawed: riffs transition into each other extremely awkwardly, and rhythms tend to interchange with no real subtlety or flair for organic development. While the obvious, simple alternation of riffs is a pattern that Darkthrone did great things with in the past, in those cases the riffs went together naturally and created a greater sense of the song's structure. On this album, riffs just go into other riffs regardless of how they might flow together because there's no greater sense of interaction between parts. Darkthrone are simply firmly aware that with enough style, attitude, and brand recognition, they can coast through basically anything without criticism- I mean, who's going to bother leveling the barrel at Darkthrone, after all?\n\nAnd herein lies the truly odious, repugnant part of this album: the adolescent transparency of Darkthrone's goals and the fans who will eagerly lap it up. Even bothering to rebut the points of defense for this album would be dignifying it too much, but those points themselves are enormously indicative of the sort of audience that Darkthrone has decided to attract with this sort of music. Numerous (generally idiotic) people like to say that what Darkthrone is doing here is \"authentic black metal,\" because they're displaying that \"they don't give a fuck about anything.\" Well, I'm sure that's neat when you're thirteen and still gazing slack-jawed at the cover for \"Butchered at Birth,\" but after then, you should have some standards. Yes, that general statement is ideologically in line with black metal- it's supposed to be a genre about independence, a rebellious and romantic perspective on life, and a distaste for \"the crowd,\" whatever that may be. But is Darkthrone's \"response\" to the perception that black metal has become its own crowd really logical? Becoming a part of another crowd that's just as arbitrary but even more ironic about their appreciation?\n\nMore disturbing than this are the large numbers of people (who typically don't listen to metal) discussing this and later Darkthrone albums as being superior to their early work, or even the first Darkthrone material which has appealed to them at all. Now I'm the sort of person who rabidly defends \"low culture\" as being no less significant than \"high culture,\" but this hipster elevation of beer-swilling, inarticulate, plastic rebellion is nothing short of ludicrous. \"Low culture\" and its relevance rely on authenticity- and what authenticity is there in summarily disowning the genre you helped create (and the records which brought you all your artistic credibility) in order to grasp at some sort of blue collar aesthetic which is as far removed from your artistic roots as possible? Really? This is what passes for authentic these days- abandoning nearly two decades of incisive, sardonic commentary on life, youthful passion and vigor, and a clear ambition to make something beautiful, compelling, and truly artistic in order to do songs like \"Graveyard Slut?\" Of course not- it's an embarrassing defense mechanism constructed by people who are afraid their friends will think less of them for listening to an album called \"Under a Funeral Moon\" without the appropriate level of ironic detachment.\n\nOver the past half decade, \"The Cult is Alive,\" just as much as Velvet Cacoon, Wolves in the Throne Room, or Amesoeurs, has been responsible for bringing a whole sect of people into black metal whose appreciation for the genre begins and ends at how much it can resemble something else. \"The Cult is Alive\" simply did it in the opposite way as Clair Cassis does today: instead of flattering the sensibilities of a person who wants to listen to black metal without any of the abrasive things that define it, this album constructed a false narrative of blue collar authenticity for those who like to \"be metal\" on the weekends. \"The Cult is Alive\" is the musical equivalent of the phone call a trust-fund anarchist makes to his parents to get more rent money: shameless, embarrassing, pathetic, and dishonest beyond belief. Darkthrone not only murdered their legacy with this album, but managed to dig a shiv into the side of black metal itself out of petty resentment for the very community who helped make them who they are. I always knew that albums like \"Age of Winters\" would always exist- I just never expected the well to be poisoned from within.\n\n(Originally written for http://www.trialbyordeal666.blogspot.com)\n",
        "\nTo be honest, I bought this album completely on a whim. I had just decided I wanted to delve into black metal, since a few friends of mine listened quite frequently when I was around, so I decided to go a bit deeper than just the tidbits I heard from them. I knew Darkthrone was supposed to be some excellent BM, I decided to pick up [i]Circle the Wagons[/i], figuring I\u2019d be getting some pretty dark and frostbitten stuff. I had no clue that Darkthrone had written anything but BM. I was shocked when I put the album into my CD player on the way home from my shopping excursion, and had no idea what to think. I didn\u2019t dislike the music at that time, but it certainly wasn\u2019t what I was looking for then. I immediately shelved it and forgot about it for a few months. I had run out of things to listen to and noticed [i]Circle the Wagons[/i], and decided to give it another shot. I listened to the album at least four times a day for almost two weeks after that. A blind buy quickly turned into one of my favorite albums. \n\nOne of the first things I noticed about the over sound was the production: The level of the vocals, guitars, and drums, perfectly complimented each other: Nothing was overpowering anything else, and I found that this particular type of balance that the album provided was something I hadn\u2019t quite heard before, and something I immediately wanted more of. The energy that the album was recorded and written with is almost tangible while the album is blasting through the speakers, and fills the listener with that same energy, this positive, raw energy. Not very many albums, metal or non-metal, have made me feel the way [i]Circle the Wagons[/i] did. \n\nUpon the first spin, I was shocked to hear these punk/heavy metal inspired riffs. They are a perfect balance in between punk and heavy metal that I\u2019d never heard before, creating a totally unique sound. Along with the riffing, I loved the guitar tone that was used; it sounded very raw, and a little muddy, but with just enough bite to it to really cut right through and sink in. The drumming was good, a bit simple, but I really don\u2019t think it needed to be anything more than what it was, and definitely nothing less. The only thing I had any real issue with was the vocals. I liked the tone of Fenriz\u2019s voice , but some of the harmonies he chose were a bit odd, and some of the raspier/shouted vocals sounded a bit too forced. Other than those few things, I really liked the vocals. \n\nOver all, this album was a complete surprise, and a great one at that. I went in expecting one thing, and got something totally different, yet better than I could have hoped. \nStand out tracks: \nThose Treasures Will Never Befall You\nRunning for Borders\nCircle the Wagons\nI Am the Working Class\n",
        "\n\"A Blaze in the Northern Sky\" is the black metal album to own - there is no other. When I was younger, when I still thought that Satan was the ultimate personification of rebellion, this was the album that I blasted with car windows rolled down in freezing rain, driving around at 3AM and letting the music freeze my soul into a shard of ice. \n\nLet me restate my point - there is no other black metal album, at least in the satanic/secular scene. Though our lads in Darkthrone have gone on further back in time to play even more 80's sounding black metal / punkish sounding music, this album is pure blood-freezing, ice cold black metal served straight, no chaser. \n\nBeginning with bizarre satanic chants courtesy of Fenriz, the album descends into utterly barren and bleak madness. Guitars are as thin as reeds frozen solid in a field drenched with snow and permafrost, the atmosphere is autumnal and cryptic, the air outside becomes hazy with coffin dust and ice winds. \"Kathaarian Life Code\" still boasts the most grim-sounding riff of all time near the end of the track. Two notes, utter apocalyptic decay.\n\nFrom there, one continues to trek across the most frozen fields of complete and utter misanthropy and evil. Nocturno Culto's cries echo across the steely mountains and shriek through the old cemeteries, haunting the listener like a ghost long forgotten and newly-resurrected. \n\nUnlike later efforts such as \"Under a Funeral Moon\" and \"Transilvanian Hunger\", there is a lingering death metal influence here, and Fenriz's drumming is not relegated to the sound of clicking turn-signals just yet. In fact, his furious rhythmic drumming is quite front and center with the music, whereas the guitars buzz away viciously in the background. \n\nThere is no way around it - if you are a self-respecting black metal fan, and you do not own this album, you are not a black metal fan at all. This is the penultimate record, the best there is. \n\nOf all the albums that I loved the most in my days within the satanic black metal scene, this was the one I cherished the most. I can still feel the winds outside at night, I can still feel myself driving in the deep of the morning, blasting this album at full tilt. \n\nThanks for the memories lads...\n",
        "\nIt is here where DarkThrone master their diabolical craft and fully seize and present the fundamental elements of \"True Norwegian Black Metal\". Having rerouted their approach on 1992's A Blaze in the Northern Sky, an initiation into the beginning steps to achieving ultimate representation of the core of this grim art, DarkThrone now embody the total, complete essence of the intentional definitive vision of the cold and dark ideology behind black metal music. \n\nStructural variation operates within a minimalist aesthetic now razor\u2011sharpened in execution and extreme expression of violence. Guitars form riffs as frozen streams, a chilling buzz of distorted currents anchored by Fenriz\u2019s merciless pummeling, a rhythmic simplification intensified through diversity of compositional representation. Nocturno Culto\u2019s infernal shrieks, arranged here with a higher awareness of harmony with riff phrase and rhythmic patterning, bleed with an intoxication of venomous furor, the voice of demonic murderer of hallowed virtue, a contradiction in hateful affliction and indifference, a torn soul lashing out against the feeble and unacceptable.\n\n\"You must know that I can no longer see the difference of dream and reality\"\n\nThese songs are not the dynamic black epics of A Blaze in the Northern Sky, nor do they intend to be. Rather, these are reductive works of abyssic descent towards cold and unforgiving forests in the depths of being. The music is cutthroat, frigid and grim in a tone unrealized to this degree in any previous form of metal music. Instead of choosing the stone over the sun and considering the grip on the stone as a destination in itself, DarkThrone exist through the stone in violent defiance of the sun.\n",
        "\nI don't know if I'd exactly say that Darkthrone gave up here, but this is a pretty lazy album, and probably the first in the band's career where that word could be used as a descriptor. Even the sort of hasty, seemingly slapped-together 'Panzerfaust' had more energy behind it than this one- a sort of needful impulse to it that defined all of Darkthrone's work. With every other Darkthrone album up to this one, it feels like that band really WANTED to release something extreme, unusual, and interesting; they were driven by a passion to create. On 'Total Death' they seem to be driven by a passion to churn out another album and call it a day. Defend it however you will, but farming off the lyric-writing duty on this album to different celebrities in the black metal scene doesn't bode particularly well for the overall presentation of the album.\n\nWhile it's hard to say that Darkthrone's essential style is lost on this album, it definitely feels as though the edges have been rounded off- the songs on this album are much closer to modern ideas of 'standard black metal' than Darkthrone ever were up to this point in their career. The riffing style is a very stripped-down, evened out mixture of 'Panzerfaust' and 'A Blaze in the Northern Sky', bouncing between the melodic tremolo picked strains of 'Transilvanian Hunger' and a more overtly oldschool, Celtic Frost style of crunch riffing. Much like the previous album, the tracks on this one are clearly divided between melodic and raw, and as a result the album falls prey to the same problems as 'Panzerfaust'- it feels like a weird, uneven compilation of tracks. The more overt problem with these riffs, though, is that they're simply not memorable, which is a huge hit against the band- the melodic riffs aren't particularly gripping and the Celtic Frost inspired riffs sound like bland rehashes of 'A Blaze in the Northern Sky', without any of the dark, subtle undercurrents which made that album so great.\n\nIt feels more repetitive, too, or perhaps not repetitive but transparent. The songs all move in very obvious directions- there's no structural surprises or complexity to be found, and a lot of that occult atmosphere Darkthrone worked so hard to cultivate has been lost in favor of a much more generic sort of darkness. I don't get the feeling of menace and magic from this release as I do from previous albums, even weaker ones like 'Panzerfaust'- this is very clearly the work of a band simply going through the motions to make another album. On top of the general lack of inspiration involved in this album, there's a lot of minor problems: the songs are too similar, the production is very flat, the vocals aren't very engaging, among numerous others. All in all, the album isn't unlistenable in any way, and on occasion stumbles onto a pretty neat riff or musical passage, but overall it just doesn't stack up to Darkthrone's impossible to replicate early career.\n\nI guess this is basically the beginning of the end for Darkthrone in my mind (though some of their mid-era material is certainly worthwhile), and it probably is for a lot of other people as well. 'Total Death' is the first Darkthrone album that just doesn't have much personality, which is something the band has always had for better or for worse. Everything up to this point in the band's career I could comfortably recommend, but from here on out, it's a lot of 'fans only' albums. This is the first.\n",
        "\nSo, the first thing we notice when looking at this album is that it has 6 tracks. Did Darkthrone set the 6 track \u2018black metal\u2019 album trend? They certainly set the satanic themed, corpse-paint and bad-production trends. I think it's interesting how they are so \u2018anti-trend\u2019, when everything they do screams, \u201ccopy me!\u201d Anyway, onto the review!\n\nProduction: The production of this album is (needless to say) raw, cold, etc. Though it is poorly produced, it was done in such a fashion where all the frequencies are filled beautifully. The bass drum is punchy, and the treble is shockingly chilling. 'A Blaze in the Northern Sky' has a very full sound compared to Darkthrone's latter two albums (Under a Funeral Moon & Transilvanian Hunger). This is probably because 'A Blaze in the Northern Sky' was recorded in an actual recording studio, on actual master tapes, versus a 4 track cassette recorder in their basement. The guitars are the dominant sonic force on this album, having a distinct buzzing characteristic to them. The stereo imaging on this album is excellent, so is the instrument separation. The drums are 'big' sounding, tons of reverb. The bass guitar is pretty much non-existent.. \n\nMusical Quality: Here's where it gets a little odd. I'm sure these guys are good musicians but their sessions on this album sound pretty sloppy. Almost as if the recording process was rushed or done poorly on purpose, I can't really tell which the culprit is, but you can hear audible mistakes in their playing, as if their guitar/drum tracks were done in one take. Either way I enjoy the playing, the subtle mistakes give the album an organic edge that I crave. The vocals are superb, extremely haunting and just pure evil sounding. \n\nLyrical Content: This is the part of the album I enjoy the most. Fenriz is out there when it comes to laying lyrics down. I mean come on, what the hell is a \u201cSuperjoint Ritual\u201d? Whatever it is, I want to be apart of it! The lyrics are mostly hateful, satanic and nihilistic type rants. These lyrics set the mood for this album quite nicely.\n\nOverall: I would have liked to see a bit more effort put into the guitar parts in terms of tightness. The drums as well seem to fall behind in some spots. I also feel like some of the songs could have been a bit shorter, some of the riffs are played over and over so many times you feel like your ears are going to fall off. This is one of my favorite black metal albums, which of course makes my review a little biased, but I tired to point out flaws where noted. Either way, this is an extremely influential album that is a must have for any black metal fan.\n",
        "\n\"Into the abyss I fall...\"\n\nAnd with those words we begin our own soulside journey into What Once Was (sorry Varg.) Darkthrone will forever be known as a second-wave black metal band but in my opinion they were much more interesting as a death metal band. Raking in sounds from such sources as Bathory, Death, Celtic Frost, and the nascent Swedish death metal scene, this record is a love letter to the entire death metal underground.\n\nYou know, despite not being Swedish, Darkthrone wipes the floor with the faces of Entombed, Grave, Grotesque, et cetera. The closest parallel I can find to this album is perhaps At the Gates' Gardens of Grief EP. Both showcase atypical song structures, tremolo riffs out the wazoo, use of synths for atmosphere, and both releases being so much better than both bands' later works.\n\n\"Cromlech\" opens the album and off we go. Ted's solo near the end of the song is very much like Schuldiner circa-Scream Bloody Gore, technically unimpressive but packed with lots of emotion and perfectly fits the context of the song. His vocals however aren't as impressive, it suits the music but isn't remarkable. Hank Amarillo is a fine drummer, particularly on \"Accumulation of Generalization\" (also check out that reverberated, multi-tracked, straight-from-ye-bowels-o'-hell RAUUUURGH around the 1 minute mark.) Ivar Enger is a terrific rhythm player and that's all I have to say about that.\n\nSpecial mention must go to Dag Nilsen. This guy is one of the few people in death metal that can actually PLAY the bass. He doesn't just follow the guitar, he adds some texture parts, contrapuntal melodies, and he even gets to solo in \"Sempiternal Sepulchrality.\"\n\nFor a debut, this album is shockingly mature. A keyboard player, as mentioned earlier, was called in to add to the dark atmosphere. \"Neptune Towers\" and \"Eon\" are shining examples on how to use keyboards in death metal. The songs on this album is diversely arranged and eschew the usual verse-chorus structure so prevalent in music. It makes one wonder how Darkthrone would have sounded if they had continued on this path. Goatlord offers a tantalizing preview of the abandoned second album, and even in such rough form it serves as a continuation of ideas first shown on this album.\n\nThe Peaceville digipak re-release offers remastered sound and an interview with Ted and Hank about this album. On board as producer is Tomas Skogsberg, soon to be catapulted to 'pimp-ducer' status with At the Gates and the rest of the melodeath scene. This album lacks his clinical sterility and thus it benefits greatly. Death metal should always have a reasonable amount of uncleanliness, not to the level of Transilvanian Bullshit, but enough 'grit' so that it does not seem robotic. Ironic that I prefer my death metal to sound alive neh? \n\nAnyway, guitar tone absolutely rules. Can't get much better distortion than that in the early 90s. Another plus is the clean tone of the bass. So many bands use distorted bass, especially in early death metal, that most ended up sounding like loud wet farts instead of, well, a bass. Drums suffer a bit though, the cymbals aren't very audible during accented sections but the bass drum sound is suitably heavy. I mentioned before how the vocals aren't remarkable, I think it has something to do with the annoying reverb and how Ted's voice isn't as loud in the mix.\n\nHighlights: \"Cromlech,\" \"Accumulation of Generalization\" The title track, \"Sempiternal Sepulchrality,\" and \"The Watchtower.\" The rest of the songs are still good but are otherwise just OK. The interview is a neat bonus, it's nice to know that Darkthrone has not turned their back on this album.\n\nIn the end we are left with a relic of what could have been. Something that showed great promise but was ultimately abandoned. It's a shame really, Darkthrone could have been gods of death metal. But hey, I guess being a legend in black metal circles is good too huh?\n",
        "\nAblaze in the Northern Sky, Darkthrone's black metal breakthrough and classic, where they scrapped Soulside Journey's completed death metal follow-up in favour of something more along the lines of what unique wave of metal was coming out of Norway at the time, helmed by the infamous Euronymous and his band Mayhem. Why Darkthrone haven't bothered recording Goatlord since it was already composed in its entirety is beyond me, even more as they knew exactly what they wanted to do with it, getting something more organic for example. And there arises the most contradictory feeling I ever had for an album of any artist, it's that while knowing they never professionally recorded it gives me a sense of loss when confronted with the thought of what it could have been - as I am a big fan of Soulside Journey - I am glad they made this very audacious and bold move. Because the masterwork, the black metal milestone that Ablaze in the Northern Sky is would never have been possible had it not been for such exceptional circumstances. Plus, we still can get our hands on the rehearsal as well as a black metal interpretation of it which is quite unique and good, both offering something satisfying that neither would've been possible without their daring action and vigor. So following the outbreak of the Norwegian black metal scene, Fenriz, Nocturno Culto and Zephirous didn't want to be associated with the now \"worthless\" death metal scene anymore, but be part of that unique new movement, alienating their very talented bassist Dag Nilsen in the process who then made his unfortunately last recording session.\n\nThe problem these youngster then immediately encountered in terminating their Goatlord project - whose original title was actually the name of the recording we got instead - was that they had a recording deal with Peaceville they had to fulfill shortly while they had nothing left to work with. Or at least that's what we could first think. What it meant, was that they had little time to experiment within that new founded style; they had no choice but to not stray too far from what they were comfortable with, death metal. Indeed, as witnessed on their Frostland Tapes compilation and unlike their first official release of Goatlord, is that A Blaze in the Northern Sky's titletrack was actually taken from that scrapped album. Additionally, if like me you watched Nocturno Culto\u2019s The Misanthrope, you may have realised too that at some point was played a rehearsal version of \"The Pagan Winter\" dated from 1991 which had a very familiar sound. It could be a coincidence, but in the possibility that it wasn't - if you take the much more dynamic, death metal-y drumming as evidence - we may even have not the complete Goatlord rehearsal, unless it is a left-over track which still got recorded at some point. Knowing that at least the 1/3 of the album is actually from the abandoned first incantation of their sophomore release makes its death metal side all the more apparent than it already was. And that's what makes A Blaze in the Northern Sky so unique and groundbreaking as that singular situation made it be; it has a black/death metal duality like none other, it is black and death metal at the very same time yet the overtly black metal aesthetics convert its entire purpose.\n\nEven if you have no knowledge of Goatlord's influence here - though there's still some notable differences in songwriting - you start to notice how untypically black metal the album can be after being more acquainted with it - though it comes off as weird saying this considering the year it was unleashed. The single most apparent untypical element would be the solos which were completely abandoned for a couple of recordings afterwards, even more considering how not unlike to those on Soulside Journey they are. Then you realize that it structurally is similar to their debut as well as the genre it is labelled with and follows a more rigorous analysis of the riffs themselves as well as the drumming. Frequently the riffs are just black metal in the way they are played - not considering the very important part the production plays - for example, the titletrack's opening riff wasn't originally played by tremolo, some other times, as seen on the other parts of the \"Unholy Trinity\", it's Bathory influenced black metal stuff which itself is not particularly similar to the Norwegian sound, but more like the thrashy sound found on Hellhammer and Sodom's early output. Fenriz' playing here is around midway between the technicality of Soulside Journey and the Bathory-like simplicity of Under a Funeral Moon, he still has that death metal playing reflex which he tries to tone down. What results is the essence needed for the perfect backbone for something as cold and evil; he strikes with conviction and purpose, grimly opening the path for the vicious winds from up North. At other times he may slow down a bit and deliver as effective punkish rhythms almost making you feel as if some malevolent spirit was keeping his dubious eye on you. Even the cymbals are a menacing force here, an essential part of his drumwork as they oftentimes evoke the sterility and cold of emptiness. This is one of his best performances and shows how much of an incredible drummer he was with all the great combinations of all of his drumkit to best fit the situation. Nocturno and Zephyrous' riffs then are the freezing air from the coldest and darkest of places, biting your face as you walk along its changing drift. The opening of \"Where the Cold Wind Blows\" is the perfect example of Darkthrone sounding as some of the most vicious wind blowing.\n\nThe instrumental side really transports you somewhere else; it is the perfect soundtrack to the freezing nightly walk during a snowstorm. I know I used the words cold and evil a couple of times, but it\u2019s really because A Blaze in the Northern Sky is the epitome of all that is cold and evil. The production really helps in this, and again it's somewhat unique due to the particular situation they were in. Peaceville were one of the big death metal label at the time, thus having the best studios in the metal realm, something Darkthrone could use to their advantage. Nowadays, when black metal bands want to sound cold and evil as possible, to sound like Darkthrone, they just record everything the cheapest way possible, and that\u2019s why it can never sound as good as here. Because A Blaze in the Northern Sky truly is very well recorded; very clear and pounding drumming, Dag Nilsen's great bass work can be heard almost at any time as the vocals don't sound as coming out of worn speakers, Nocturno using some, again, clean effects to good result. So you can very well hear how well recorded and mixed it is for its time, where they turned a potentially not so black metal release into a real one is how they made everything sound. The most apparent is the guitars, if some think the most vicious guitar tone will come out of something that greatly shows its limitations - and therefore limits the impact of the guitars along the way - better listen to the clear and sterile sound complimented by plenty of fuzz guitars, it's all the more menacing and cold. It can particularly be heard during the opener, \"Kathaarian Life Code\" when near the end everything stops except the guitars alone, playing some of the most menacing riff, resonating its coldness in the void...\n\nThis is essential Darkthrone, essential black metal. A Blaze in the Northern Sky is the essence of the black metal sound and spirit. And that's something a bit ironic considering all that has been told; that the album is pretty much only considered a black metal release at all because of its aesthetical disguise. But at the same time, it represents well what is that essence, which is the message so to speak. A Blaze in the Northern Sky remains one of my favourite Darkthrone albums, if not my favourite. While some potentially incredible albums may disappear because of several inconvenient factors, the contrary can also happen, both can also happen at the same time! And this is the case here, that's why it is so unique and good. Darkthrone had the guts to bin a whole album, particularly considering their young age and that they had an opportunity like none other to be signed with Peaceville, yet because of their passion and vigor managed to make that weird circumstance to their advantage, to make a black metal milestone and one of the very best of the genre.\n",
        "\nWith a career spanning back to the late 1980's, black metal heavyweights Darkthrone are still making music. In their later years they have developed their own precise sound, blending the lyrics and vocal aspects of black metal with the speedy fast intensity of early punk and hardcore (along with a few aspects of speed and thrash metal). With their new release \"Circle the Wagons,\" I found myself rather confused at the end of the album.\n\nOn the instrumental aspects of this album, it's pretty solid. I'd even go as far to say as it's pretty damn good in terms of staying true to the intensity and musical structure of the early thrash and punk bands of the '70s and '80s. This album provides straightforward speed riffs that don't aim to impress, or expand on the genre. All they aim to do is rock face and provide the listener something to bang their head and thrash out to. I viewed this album as an homage, of sorts, simply because it's so reminiscent of the early days of heavy thrash metal. In tracks such as \"Stylized Corpse,\" both the fast groovy riffs, and intense melodic guitar solo that closes the track almost gives you the feeling that an old Judas Priest album. \n\nThe aspect that really bummed me out, and singlehandedly ruined the album for me were the vocals. I've never really been a fan of Darkthrone's vocals, but I've always been able to see past them and appreciate the \"bigger picture,\" so to speak, of the album. With \"Circle the Wagons,\" the vocals are so overpowering and have this tendency to hang in the foreground of every song, that it is damn-near impossible to ignore them. The random touches of reverb that were applied, along with the bloody-ear educing clean singing featured on this album come completely out of left field. I'm not exactly sure what the band was going for when they recorded the vocals, but they landed far off the mark. \n\nThe production on this album enhances both the pros and cons of the album in which I just listed. Darkthrone has never been known for top-notch production on their albums. But, again, it establishes them as who they are. The grimy tinge that the mix on this album gives the guitars tones makes the listening experience feel more D.I.Y. But, the production is definitely a double-sided sword. The low-end production, in turn, ends up making the vocals sound more atrocious on the final product. It really creates a giant conflict in giving this album a grade.\n\nThough this album features so intense riffs, and a fun atmosphere for fans of early metal, the vocals overshadow all, leaving the wheels to fall of this dingy old wagon. The vocals tie it down, and leave it destined to sink, dead in the water.\n",
        "\nI find it quite humorous when people refer to such albums as Circle the Wagons, Dark Thrones and Black Flags, and F.O.A.D. as \"their punk stuff.\" Admittedly, there is an undeniably strong dosage of punk influence on the aforementioned records, but in all honesty, The Cult is Alive was the peak of the punk influence in Darkthrone's sound. Since then, the punk element has been slightly reduced (the keyword is \"slightly\") with each album since in favor of a substantial inclusion of more heavy/speed metal and 70s hard rock elements. It just seems silly to refer to the last few albums as \"their punk stuff\" (or \"Punkthrone\" if you're feeling especially creative...) when heavy metal is playing a much larger role in shaping the sound.\n\nI greatly appreciate punk rock and I think The Cult is Alive is still phenomenal to this day, but heavy metal is my first love and because of this, I couldn't be more pleased with the decision made by Darkthrone on the last few albums to make old-school metal the main focus, while still retaining that punk edge. This is precisely why I think Circle the Wagons is such a fantastic album - the heavy metal influence has never come through stronger on a Darkthrone album. In fact, I think it is a fair assessment to state that this release shows Darkthrone going even further back in time!\n\nFenriz utilizes his clean vocals quite a bit on the record and the title track features his best vocal performance ever. In fact, the title track off of the album is probably one of the greatest Darkthrone songs ever made. It's under the three minute mark, but man... it makes every second count! Think heavy metal of the early 1980s American style mixed with the stripped down nature of punk. Actually, when I first heard the song's intro, I thought of Bl\u00fcdw\u00fclf! Lyrically, I suspect the song to be against modern metal (big shock, huh?). \"I Am the Graves of the 80s\" is a little more blatant in its message and serves as another testament of Fenriz' ability to make superb old-school metal anthems complete with one of the most badass choruses in metal history!\n\nSome may complain that tracks like \"Stylized Corpse\" and \"Running for Borders\" are boring, but I disagree. These two slow-pased numbers are growers (with some awesome 1970s-sounding parts at that!) and must be given a chance. At least let \"Stylized Corpse\" run its course towards the end, as this song has a part that almost sounds like one of Dio's slower numbers! In fact, rockin' \"big riff\" songs seem to be Ted's main export in the band these days as just as they were on the last two albums. I have yet to hear a Nocturno Culto-written song top the F.O.A.D. track, \"The Banners of Old,\" but the track \"Black Mountain Totem\" comes about as close as he's going to get for a while. Fantastic.\n\nDarkthrone has an absurd ability to blend together many different elements from an arsenal of different bands and still manage to have a unique sound that is genuinely theirs. It is because of said diversity, that I felt it was a necessity to talk about individual songs so much. After all, if a band was just blasting the whole way through, it would be ridiculous to talk about every single damn track on the album, but on this album, there is really too much diversity not to. There aren't too many albums out there in which one can hear a song like \"These Treasures Will Never Befall You\" and then later on in an album, hear a blue collar punk rock anthem like \"I Am the Working Class.\"\n\nThe end result of this volatile mixture is either amazing or terrible depending on your stance on metal, punk, and hard rock. I for one, enjoyed my visit to The Church of Real Metal and I can't wait for the next sermon. As usual, no modern metal twats allowed, of course.\n",
        "\nRather expectedly Darkthrone\u2019s black metal era had to run out of steam at some point, and though, Panzerfaust is often given the derisory title as a \u201cleftovers\u201d albums - as if to denote it somehow lacked the power of the band\u2019s earlier work, on the contrary it might well be the best thing they ever did - it is actually Total Death which shows a lack of the vision and, well, the focus and drive of their past works. Yet still, this is a wholly listenable album\u2026 but the lukewarm praise I can give Total Death only goes to show a further point; this is the band\u2019s first unessential album. When listening it only becomes readily apparent that this while being quite good is actually quite shocking for being so (again, giving moderate praise makes just heightens the sense of a letdown). When compared to previous triumphs, as is so painfully necessary, Total Death just seems to be the epitome of a gentle letdown, fading out into - dare I say it - more generic black metal territory.\n\nFirstly, what strikes me most about this album is the reigned-in and comfortable vocal performance from Noculturno Culto. It has been stated in interviews that the vocals on Panzerfaust were recorded in one day, whilst Noculturno was completely drunk or pissed-up on booze\u2026 and the results are quite clear for anyone to hear. And to me that\u2019s the brilliance of it; you\u2019re forced into an position with those vocals - especially considering the album\u2019s mix - and you have to choose: love or hate. There\u2019s not much of an in-between and, for me, the spirited and deeply dramatic performance is just phenomenal. The album couldn\u2019t have had better, really, it\u2019s just one the many factors that make Panzerfaust such a mandatory album - even if it is somewhat unheralded, in places. Total Death, however, has a solid, unremarkable performance from Mr Culto; not the annoying careerist, \u201clook at my clean vocals\u201d shite like, say, mid-era Emperor as it\u2019s still pleasant. Rather it appears that by being a sort of neutral factor and not being within the realm of a \u201cmaking\u201d or \u201cbreaking\u201d the album it actually does \u201cbreak\u201d the album in a sense\u2026 just by stressing its own unessential nature. I guess raving fandom can produce a weird scenario where being simply good can actually be something\u2019s death-knell. \n\nFurthermore, as one would expect from a two-piece, it\u2019s very obvious that Fenriz has burnt himself almost completely, as his drumming is pedestrian by his standards. It\u2019s not because of its comparative simplicity - as that never hindered the previous two Darkthrone albums - it\u2019s just, once again, a lack of mettle. Though, if you\u2019ve heard Sardonic Wrath you\u2019ll know that an exciting drum performance won\u2019t ever save a bland album, so if anything, we should count our blessings that there are some decent songs on this album. Fenriz\u2019s own, \u2018Blasphemer\u2019, with its name harkening back to the embryonic days of German thrash and - predictably - it being a thrashy song is one of the album's strongest. However, I do feel it could have been far greater - given a sharper production job and a bit more spirit. Again, this isn\u2019t a slovenly, piss-weak album and I can\u2019t ever claim that\u2026 but you just wish that Darkthrone regained the spirit (or is that spirits?) to find something of their menacing vitality here. \n\nTruth be told, with Total Death it\u2019s very easy to get hung-up on the band\u2019s past glories but I don\u2019t wish this album sounded more like Panzerfaust, honestly, as its actually at its blandest when it goes for the Celtic Frost worship on closer, \u2018The Serpent\u2019s Harvest\u2019. Whereas \u2018Hordes of the Nebula\u2019 was crushing this one finds itself as sort of stinted\u2026 the same nigh-on inescapable inertia that hangs over a great deal of this album. Again, not bad, and try as they might this or its rather similar follow-up Ravishing Grimness aren\u2019t bad records. If anything it goes to show how good Darkthrone had been at this point as even when they\u2019re burnt-out, lazy and picking up the pieces of their past work they\u2019re still wholly listenable. However, that said, this isn\u2019t a magnificent record and I can safely assume that casual fans of the band won\u2019t be too enthused by this, so I can\u2019t rate it any higher regardless of me being quite able to listen to this in its entirety. Still, Total Death will always reside in the shadow of a glorious mish-mash that somehow became a holistic and iconoclastic piece in its own right, shame really. But I won't be losing sleep over it, that's for sure. \n\nWhat\u2019s the phrase? Ah, \u201cone for the fans\u201d. That\u2019s it.\n",
        "\nDarkthrone is still one of the most spectacular monuments of the Norwegian scene even after two and-then-some decades of active service. And the new millennium seems to have awoken a whole new work ethic in the duo, who have released six albums, three eps and two compilations in barely eight years. Perhaps they are hoping for World Heritage status. Even by DT's own prolific standards '08 was a treat of a year for loyal supporters of the necro. First came the compiled release of the oft-bootlegged early demos - including a sans-vocals rendition of the entire Goatlord album - by Peaceville on CD and 12\". Then to follow up they put out their 14th studio album at the end of the year. \"Dark Thrones and Black Flags\" is yet more pub-punk rock infused blackened thrash (talk about hybrid genres..!) in the style of 2007's F.O.A.D. But was the new Darkthrone sound A Good Thing, or A Bad Thing? This much was certain: we didn't know. So, with trousers wedged firmly into socks and with our crampons dangling out for all to see, we set out for a hike around Darkthrone's musical landscape once again...\n\nThe first impression of the new material is one of immediacy and drive (as opposed to the other, slow-working type of immediacy): the album flying open and the first riff coming at you from a solo guitar. Immediately. There are no Space-gothic synths or low rumblings and muttered cursings to ease you in or set the lugubrious tone this time around. DTaBF is presented as a straight-ahead rock'n'roll album. Considering the dirty word that \"R'n'R\" has become in elite metal circles, the stripped-down 3 minute song approach is probably the greatest piece of rebellion from the band since they handed the pre-masters of \"A Blaze...\" in to Peaceville all those years ago.\n\nAnd that first guitar lead itself? Well, it still bristles with enough over-clocked distortion to disguise the loose-strum twangs of an otherwise pure punk rock tone, but the wind chill factor of trebles has now gone too. The remainder - of buzzing middles and fizzling high tones - walls in the punchy riffs like a proto-hardcore band might have done in 1983, all the time preserving the clear channel signals enough to throw out a killer melodic hook when necessary. The \"...Black Flags\" part of the album title may be a none-too-subtle signpost towards the band's intentions here, but the drive-time riff shapes - and the calm aggression which permeates much of the material - is perhaps closer to the cerebral mien of the Dead Kennedys than it is to the confrontational deadlift machismo of anything Rollins himself has ever had a hand in. \n\nMarching on through the tracks; the evidence of Darkthrone's new, exoteric agenda is plain to see. Songs are built by that arcane equation of verse-chorus-bridge, which somehow makes them seem entirely organic and non-formulaic in their procession, such is the perversity of black metal's wrongheaded logic. Hearing a build up section which delivers on its promise and actually segues to a tuneful chorus with a real-life melodic line is something of a novelty in a genre that has become addicted to the coitus interruptus of verse-break-verse atonal minimalisms.\n\nThe generous selection of guitar solos smatter broken black metal melodies, whilst remaining fluent in the pentatonics of classic NWOBHM axemen and the reptilian tongue of rock-monster licks. Nowhere is this more apparent than during the final build of the instant anthem stompalong \"Hiking Metal Punks\". A brace of hard-panned duelling guitar leads - initially separated only by their contrasting textures - duet on a novice soloist's wet dream of strutting perfect fifths. \n\nAs lead guitar number one banks, and peels away into the soaring altitudes of classic Maiden fretworking, a mountain of long-forgotten metal harmonies encroaches on the horizon of Darkthrone's brave new world. Where guitar solos are no longer dominated by Slayer-worshipping chromaticisms and needling Kerry Kingisms. If more music sounded like \"Hiking Metal Punks\", there is no doubt that the world would be a better place. Grab a tennis racket - you'll be air guitaring for the duration. No, on second thoughts get three tennis rackets. You can use the other two as snow shoes.\n\nVintage techniques are rendered modern in every track on the album. Venom-ous death gallops pull up sharp for ringing, plectrum-hand-in-the-air Thin Lizzy powerchords, which in turn flatten and bend under their own Candlemassive heaviness for a brief introspection of overcast doom riffage. Throw in some boxy garage-space percussion and a spartan eight-channel mix and you have an authentic mid-80s demo tape. Bottled, stored, and buried in the cellar, to be exhumed and released as vintage goods in 2008.\n\nAnd here - essentially - lies the strength of \"New\" Darkthrone: the absolute emphasis on versatility, coupled with an understated expertise in their chosen field. As old bands jump the over-cargo'd black metal ark to reinvent or reinvigorate themselves in new musical spheres, Darkthrone have instead taken what they know already and shifted it on its axis. DTaBF is a black metal album, but black metal seen from a non-typical perspective. And this perspective has the benefit of 20:20 hindsight - it is the music that Darkthrone could have been playing in the 1980s when they first started out, if they had \"known then what they know now\", to paraphrase the late, great Rod Stewart. Wait, Rod Stewart isn't actually dead. Unless he died whilst we were out at the printers, in which case this review is now remarkably prescient. RIP Rod.\n\nWhere was I?\n\nThis album is like a reset button to black metal - something new which harks back to the old and chooses to completely ignore the barren wasteland of late-90s metal. Forget any grandiose notions of 'neoclassical rock music' concert hall fodder. Black metal's true Prometheus could be this Darkthrone album: the regeneration of a whole genre?\n\n(Originally written for BLAST! zine #1)\n",
        "\nThere was something magical about Darkthrone\u2019s original union with Peaceville Records. In spite of the latter party being drug along unwillingly in becoming a player in the birthing of metal\u2019s most obscure and rebellious of offshoots, the end result of their collaboration was 3 manifestos to a purely reformed counterculture in extreme music that are still widely imitated nearly 2 decades later. That is not to say that Fenriz and Nocturno didn\u2019t put out some fine music during their time with Moonfog, but a pretty broad consensus can be established in the musical superiority of Darkthrone\u2019s 1992-1994 era. But what there is definitely less of a consensus on is the strength of their material once rejoining Peaceville, of which \u201cThe Cult Is Alive\u201d is the first and arguably least well received offering.\n\nI personally see this album as a return to form of sorts, though not necessarily in terms of its stylistic attributes. The overt crust punk tendencies at play here essentially scoff at subtlety in all its various manifestations, and whether intentionally or not, succeed in bringing back a spirit of greatness that has been missing from their music since \u201cTotal Death\u201d. Part of it comes off in the tossing away of any inhibition regarding lyrics, rather than attempting to poetically restate the themes they\u2019ve been dabbling with since 1992. With names like \u201cShut Up\u201d, \u201cGraveyard Slut\u201d and \u201cWhiskey Funeral\u201d, it is difficult not to take notice of something new going on here. But surprisingly enough, the musical presentation actually takes it even further than such attention clasping zingers like \u201cYou call your metal black? it's just plastic, lame and weak.\u201d and \u201cYou Copy my style and you call yourself a man.\u201d, both very obvious and punchy responses to the band\u2019s past-worshipping detractors I might add.\n\nThe influences going on here are pretty well worn on the album\u2019s cover sleeve, although actually the artwork wouldn\u2019t start to conform to this newly adopted sound until \u201cF.O.A.D.\u201d. Take all of the attitude, barebones simplicity and rawness of some of the best Discharge and Black Flag songs ever heard, darken the atmosphere with some production tweaking that bears some similarity the early Moonfog recordings, insert Nocturno\u2019s guttural, troll-like barks and a slightly more technically proficient delivery, and a pretty clear picture emerges. Although this formula would get gradually better with the next few releases, this album essentially bridges the small but existing gap between black metal and hardcore in much the same way that Cro Mags and Suicidal Tendencies did for thrash and hardcore. \n\nAlthough this sonic destination was pretty well marked on the map going all the way back to \u201cRavishing Grimness\u201d, some have been taken aback by this album due to a perceived abandonment of genre. This might lay in the heavier promotion that this album got in comparison to the previous lot going all the way back to the early 90s, culminating in an EP and a single featuring songs from here. Suffice to say, for all of the assumed lyrical pretentiousness of \u201cToo Old, Too Cold\u201d and a couple of other songs on here, they are pretty damned catchy, which is an original concept in extreme music circles. Or it could be this age old stereotype that black metal shouldn\u2019t have guitar solos, which this album is pretty well loaded with, particularly in the case of the wild shred fest at the end of \u201cForebyggende Krig\u201d. If anyone out there knows this sort and you want to be cruel, force them to listen to every guitar solo on every major Norwegian 2nd wave release between 1991 and 1994, the experience will probably hit at their insecurity as pseudo-black metal elitists as much as Nocturno\u2019s and Fenriz\u2019s mocking of the band\u2019s imitators in the lyrics will. \n\nSo to all interested parties, the cult is definitely alive, although the undead corpse has gotten a bit crusty from laying around for about 10 years before getting itself moving again. Those seeking a new deviation from established genre dogmas but still wanting the raw, frosty production that mainstays such as Immortal and Emperor got away from will find a welcome home here. This is probably among the least metallic of Darkthrone\u2019s releases, and greater influxes of early metal ideas would be infused on the next couple albums, but for punk fanatics within the black metal core (no pun intended), this is probably the album to get of their current stock.\n\nOriginally submitted to (www.metal-observer.com) on June 3, 2010.\n",
        "\nJust before the cult was reconfirmed as being alive, Darkthrone managed to make one final statement of uncertainty, culminating in the pretty damned uneven opus dubbed \u201cSardonic Wrath\u201d. Essentially before deciding fully on their new direction, Nocturno and Fenris decided one more attempt at partially drawing from the well of the black trinity would be a good idea, in spite of how unsuccessful this approach was on the last 2 albums. This release sees a few better ideas getting thrown out, a greater plurality of ideas making for a generally smoother listen, and one or two pleasing surprises here and there, but a similar sense of wanting what I was induced with when listening to \u201cHate Them\u201d comes up here.\n\nAlthough the new production practices employed here have not robbed the album of any rawness, this just comes off as a really stale attempt at straddling the distance between the rugged simplicity of \u201cRavishing Grimness\u201d and the 2 previous Moonfog efforts before it, which is largely where this album tends to draw its similarities to their older and more widely acclaimed albums while on Peaceville. These influences essentially climax right near the beginning of the album on \u201cInformation Wants To Be Syndicated\u201d, which brings forth a singular theme comparable to select classics off of the black trilogy, but with a less crackled and frosty guitar sound, and contrasts it against a series of Celtic Frost inspired ideas that work quite well as a point of contrast. When combined with the darkened ambient intro \u201cOrder Of The Ominous\u201d, the greatest moments of this album are realized in this single song, and it\u2019s all downhill afterward.\n\nThe bulk of the contents that follow the first two songs are largely made up of mid paced to faster works in more of the punk direction, ranging in quality from satisfactory to tedious. Some of the riffs that filter in and out of the songs with Norwegian lyrics sound like they were lifted off of \u201cHate Them\u201d and reworked a little bit to avoid outright self-plagiarism, while the overall presentation comes off as overly predictable. Things shape up a little better with \u201cSacrificing To The God Of Doubt\u201d, which has a catchy little Speed Metal riff out of the Venom department that spiced up what is a stylistic continuation of this really plain approach to mixing black metal sensibilities with punk inspired riffs. \u201cHate Is The Law\u201d sees a full out attempt at recapturing the droning mysticism of \u201cTransylvanian Hunger\u201d, but doesn\u2019t really come that close to measuring up just sort of coasts along like a b-side reject off of said album. The album closes off with a sort of extended jam-like song in \u201cRawness Obsolete\u201d, which takes a few ideas from Burzum\u2019s playbook on \u201cFilosofem\u201d here and there, and succeeds in ending things on a fairly positive note.\n\nAlthough I would qualify this as the greatest of Darkthrone\u2019s latter trilogy with Moonfog\u2019s insignia on their album jackets, it is still pretty lukewarm and not really fit for blowing 2 \u00bd hours of minimum wage work on. This isn\u2019t a return to the glory of \u201cUnder A Funeral Moon\u201d as some may erroneously argue, or even that of \u201cPanzerfaust\u201d, and at best can be summarized as yet another failed attempt at partially resurrecting that era. But if one were to have a few bucks to blow at a local bargain bin offering this up at $7 or less, I can\u2019t say I\u2019d loudly oppose the investment provided that said person liked what was heard on \u201cHate Them\u201d. But for the older fans who are a bit more picky, things improve when Peaceville comes back into the picture.\n\nOriginally submitted to (www.metal-observer.com) on June 1, 2010.\n",
        "\nCircle the Wagons is an album that purposefully evokes a metal era where simplicity and songwriting were king. Fenriz and Nocturno Culto have succeeded mightily in that endeavor, creating a pile of tunes that I find completely addictive. Circle the Wagons has been my fist pumping soundtrack to many-a mundane activity of late. These songs all but beckon you to sing along with their preposterous vocals and twisted lyrics.\n\nCircle the Wagons is filled with elegant yet uncomplicated riffage that's rooted in a bygone era, but is ultimately timeless. The tracks feel like they rolled out of bed in 1983, threw on their denim jackets and delivered a case of beer directly to my ears. You'll find everything from traditional heavy metal chugging to punk inflected pre-thrashification to darker, proto-black metal. There's no real need to injure your brain trying to pick out the influences at work; Fenriz has annotated the album booklet with an explanation of just that. He name-drops bands like Motorhead, English Dogs, Agent Steel, Metallica, Deathside, Puke, Slayer, Omen and Savage Grace. 'Nuff said.\n\nI've been evangelizing metal long enough to know what will happen if I try to sell this album as a nostalgia trip to my conservative and traditional heavy metal friends; they'll hate the vocals. Fenriz and Nocturno Culto split the writing and singing duties evenly, alternating tracks on the album. While recognizably different, both men predominantly ply gravelly proto-death vocals, with some rousing unclean singing and pseudo-operatic sauce mixed in. Nothing about the vocals is conventional, and I can easily see this as off-putting to the aforementioned crowd. Fuck them; it's their loss.\n\nLyrically, this thing is a hoot. Fenriz sings \u201cI am the graves of the 80s, I am the risen dead. Destroy their modern metal and bang your fucking head!\u201d Do I really need to say anything else? The songwriting and composition on Circle the Wagons is what puts it head and shoulders above Darkthrone's formidable recent output, at least in my eyes. The title track is just goddamned infectious. \u201cI Am The Working Class\u201d is completely anthemic, with memorable riffs and lyrics that never cease to make me smile. Track for track, this might also be the most consistent album Darkthrone have put out lately.\n\nI don't think I need to tell you that the drumming is fantastic and the production is perfectly laissez-faire. Circle the Wagons certainly doesn't stack up to the classics of the eighties, but I don't think that's the point. It does, however, share the ethos. When I spin this album I usually follow it up with some Piece of Mind, Mob Rules, Melissa or even some Stained Class. It makes me want to rock out with those old albums as much as it makes me want to reach for a beer. That's simply metal.\n\nOriginally published here: http://atanamar.blogspot.com/\n",
        "\nSince \u201cF.O.A.D.\u201d, these guys have made blackened punk music, and this album is no exception. The production seems cleaner than ever, with audible bass. It\u2019s a first time to hear something this clean from this band. The vocals are usually harsh, but some songs have some singing too, which sometimes sound okay. Well, sometimes it\u2019s not. The guitars and drums play more punk and less black metal, just like their last album. Nothing much has changed much, so if you have heard of\" and \"Dark Thrones and Black Flags\", you know what will this sound like.\n\nI usually find the fast songs to my liking, like \u201cI Am the Graves of the 80s\u201d, for it gives a lot of energy, enough to make your head bang, since it has a lot of punk edge (than black metal) here and there. It sure is catchy, but it\u2019s quite repetitive. \"Stylized Corpse\" and \"Running for Borders\" put me in such boredom that might put me to sleep if I\u2019m not doing this review at all. It sounds like a punk version of \"Panzerfaust\", which is just weird. \"Black Mountain Totem\" a mid-tempo song I found to my liking in a number of listens. Nice song indeed. \u201cBr\u00e4nn Inte Slotten\u201d, the only instrumental, starts off by chanting the title and bored me ever since. It feels meaningless, and is lacking direction. Again, this is filler.\n\nAlthough it has more real songs than fillers, I don\u2019t think that this album is good enough. It still needs a lot of improvement. More punk maybe? But still, I think this alum has more edge than \"F.O.A.D.\" or \"Dark Thrones and Black Flags\". Buy if you like punk (and black metal, of course) or if you're a Darkthrone fan.\n\nOriginally made for http://mystifymyserie.blogspot.com\n",
        "\nSo here we are with yet another release from the iconic Darkthrone. As expected, the band has taken another step towards a blackened crust punk sound, as can be witnessed by their previous work; F.O.A.D. and DTBF. Their new sound is quite a departure from what was present in their older albums when they played black metal, but by no means should this album be ignored. If you are one of those people who believe that Darkthrone died after A Blaze in the Northern Sky or Transilvanian Hunger then leave this album alone, because in no way is this album a return to those days.\n\nAlthough some riffs seem reminiscent of the two previous albums, many new ideas and riffs are brought forward to this album. The skill of any one instrument on Circle the Wagons would not stand out by itself, as none of them are played with extreme precision or speed like some modern metal counterparts; but that is not to say the overall sound isn\u2019t great. The point of a band is not to have one person wanking over the rest of the group\u2019s background noise. You even get to hear some clean vocals on a few tracks, which aren\u2019t exactly my favourite part, but are done rather well. When placed together, all instruments do their part and contribute to some incredible music. Nothing is over-done. \n\nCircle the Wagons does at great job for what it is. Clocking in at a little over 40 minutes, it is a complete assault on the senses of pure blackened punk. The song writing skills of Nocturno Culto and Fenriz are astounding and they never seem to let you down. Inspired by \u201880s metal, the music is straight to the point. This album stands as a big \u2018Fuck You\u2019 to modern metal, and attempts to bring it back to its roots. The riffs are filled with raw power and the musicianship is aggressive. I wouldn\u2019t expect anything less from Darkthrone, either.\n\nConsidering the ever-so diminishing black metal sound in their music, Darkthrone continues to push the envelope by releasing yet another quality album. Only ignorant elitists who can\u2019t get over the fact that Darkthrone\u2019s sound is evolving should forget about Circle the Wagons. Check it out, you shouldn\u2019t be disappointed.\n\nHighlights: Running for Borders, Black Metal Totem, I Am the Working Class, Eyes Burst at Dawn\n\nWritten for http://www.britof.net/zine/\n",
        "\nA couple of years into Darkthrone\u2019s early 2000s era of flirting with punk sensibilities, but largely avoiding making up their minds on what they want to sound like, the somewhat bland and by-the-numbers release otherwise known as \u201cHate Them\u201d came into being. Unlike its very confused and awkward predecessor \u201cPlaguewielder\u201d, there is definitely an intelligible direction at play here, although it is replete with stops and starts. Fenriz and Nocturno seem to know where they want to go at this point, but their songwriting seems a few steps behind them, unwilling to fully commit to the more basic and less blackened approach that is rearing its head.\n\nFor the most part, things are kept relatively simple, as Nocturno maintains a riffs alone approach to songwriting that has little of the intrigue or flash of the early years. Most of the songs contained within are built off of 4 specific ideas, alternating between the straight power chord drive common to many hard core bands, and the hypnotic, hazy sound that the style borrowed from various ambient and new wave bands. Some such as \u201cYtterst I Livet\u201d and \u201cDet Svartner N\u00e5\u201d seek to bring back elements of \u201cTransylvanian Hunger\u201d or \u201cPanzerfaust\u201d and merge them with the warmer, frost free production quality that the band has maintained since \u201cRavishing Grimness\u201d, but lack the unique melodic contours and distinctive hooks to really carry themselves well. \u201cDivided We Stand\u201d and \u201cFucked Up And Ready To Die\u201d work in the heavy, death metal influenced tremolo riffs brought in from the early 90s and work a bit better with Culto\u2019s guttural mutterings, but struggle a little to get going due to being too simple for their own good.\n\nThe places where \u201cHate Them\u201d actually starts to work well are when the aforementioned influences are scaled back and the band keeps to the punk elements. \u201cStriving For A Piece Of Lucifer\u201d is the best example, and is primarily based on upper tempo Thrashing beats and plain strummed guitar lines, but the resulting groove that is established is far better suited to the raw, heavy character of the album. There is a healthy amount of variation, but there is an enduring theme that pervades the entire song\u2019s duration and keeps things consistent. \u201cRust\u201d and \u201cIn Honour Of Thy Name\u201d present similar stories musically, but are frontloaded with heavily repetitive intros that come off as overlong and somewhat unnecessary. The ambient parts contained in both sound a bit out of place, and probably would have been better suited on \u201cTotal Death\u201d, where the band was still sticking to creepier and darker songs that called for some parallel horror movie soundtrack material to use as detailing.\n\nAlthough a definite improvement from \u201cPlaguewielder\u201d, this is guaranteed to leave most fans of either black metal or even black punk music wanting. There are enough good moments on here to qualify this as bargain bin treasure, but there is nothing that really terrifies or otherwise entertains the way Darkthrone albums are normally expected to. You might not catchy yourself falling asleep to it in the middle of the afternoon, but it definitely will not demand weekly, or even monthly worship sessions at the church of metal.\n\nOriginally submitted to (www.metal-observer.com) on April 11, 2010.\n",
        "\nSo here it is at last, the full collection of Darkthrone's demos and - surprise, surprise - the complete (because the prior available issue wasn't) Goatlord rehearsal session in its original, unedited form. Throw in a couple of bonus songs, live tracks from Denmark, some liner notes and a priceless picture of their baby faces, and you've got along with Soulside Journey, Darkthone's complete death metal output - well A Blaze in the Northern Sky isn't totally black metal, neither death, but with the help of Goatlord, you can clearly see some songs were intended as such - this is truly essential for any fan of their debut. \n\nThe collection starts with some cold - seems so - wind blowing on Land of Frost's title track, and as you would guess, it's raw. But it's quite a surprising listen given how Soulside Journey sounds. Like I said, it's raw, it gives a malevolent feel, the vocals is very echoed death metal (?) vocals - sometimes it's some talking - and the faster drumming is more like a black metal performance. Well, even if you can recognize the death metal riffs and some doomy ones - more akin to the traditional bands than the death breed - the sound of the faster parts is strangely reminiscent of the ones found on A Blaze in the Northern Sky. Also weird for a first demo from such a then young band, is the variety of influences found. Some tracks are really different from one another, but while not perfect in execution, it's still remarkable.\n\nThen comes the treat of all the demos, A New Dimension. It's barely 10 minutes long and beside some short intro, it contains only one song. And hey, it was released the same year than Land of Frost and they already show some evolution - and one at that! The sound is already a lot better, enough so I don't have any complaints about it; it wasn't recorded at Sunlight studio, and as much as I bow before Soulside Journey's sound, the rawness really goes well with the song. But the track, \"Snowfall\", is definitely one of Darkthrone's best songs. While it was surprising how talented the band was on their first demo, here the same year, they totally outdo themselves by doing some kind of not progressive, but thought-out, evolving, not without any direction death metal. There's some doomy parts, some faster kickass headbangable ones, dark melodic riffs, some acoustic guitars, great drumming as always from Fenriz as well as no vocal presence whatsoever. It goes to different paces, moods, riffs and riffs, and the transitions are made like death metal regulars do; they know their art. Also surprising, is that it was recorded in '88, it's way ahead of its time, death metal was just in its unrefined beginnings. We all know how early death metal had a thrashy edge, but here it feels as if it is separate from the death metal sound, it is present, but as the little black metal influence and doom one, the riffs go seamlessly from one another style forming some kind of coherent and unified sound (a death metal one). Really, it is truly an underrated gem which is, as I said, way ahead of its time (there is even some Sabbat (the Japanese one) sonorities (a couple of slower melodic notes ending a faster riff) to a couple of riffs which is something I always felt unique of the band, something that gave a supplementary dark or evil edge to the riff). It's kinda ironic, \"Snowfall\" is truly the antipode of the minimal Transilvanian Hunger and it would make its die-hard fans cower in terror had this demo been released after that album.\n\nNext is Thulcandra which consists of \"Eon\", which will be available on Soulside Journey two years later, and two only available here tracks. Except for the rawer production, differences in the opener are barely noticeable. So we are served \"Thulcandra\" and \"Archipelago\" which are in the same vein of \"Eon\" and their debut but have a little punkier vibe going on. Again, it's a very worthy addition to your Darkthrone discography. To end the demo portion, we are treated with 4 demo versions of Soulside Journey tracks. While not being something new, here it is presented in a much rawer form. As I said with \"Snowfall\" even if I'm a big fan of Soulside Journey's sound, death metal era Darkthrone always sound good raw, and it kind of give a different life to these tracks, the vocals are also quite different - not as deep and more raspy - so you'll still won't skip those. Only thing is that \"Iconoclasm Sweeps Cappadocia\" was recorded in a different session and sounds noticeably better, Nocturno Culto is also closer to his style on their debut. Before Cromlech was also a bonus track entitled \"Soria Moria\", again nothing too different, only that the guitars are somewhat buried in the mix. \n\n\"We're Darkthrone from Norway. We came all the way to this show. I hope you like it.\" Are the young and inexperienced Fenriz's greeting to the audience when the live portion starts. You can hear that the band had their little sense of humour back in the day and it almost comes as a surprise they didn't particularly enjoyed playing live. Beside the raw and un-mastered (at least it seems so) nature of the recording, you can still witness the band giving a pretty solid performance, Fenriz drumming as convincingly as on the album with everything having a similar sound. Since there's no unreleased track played on that show and that the sound isn't particularly good, the recording is pretty much only there as an historical piece of Darkthrone, as their only live recording officially available. \n\nThen comes what almost stood out of whole package, the whole Goatlord rehearsal session left untouched, thus without those oh so reviled \"female vocals\". While I initially hated the idea of using an old instrumental death metal rehearsal and transforming it into a black metal record 4 or 5 years later with lyrics and vocals, I at some point found in Goatlord something really unique and enjoyable despite its awkwardness and apparent treason of the spirit of the original recording. While more elaborate thoughts on my feelings on that release is matter for another subject, I was rejoiced to be able to get hold of the untouched rehearsal. What you get here, is truly the whole recording untouched; you can really hear a difference in sound. Everything sounds less... contained, as if some sound waves escaped, it loses a little of the atmosphere that was present on the reworked version. But without the vocals, as the nature of the recording posed limitations on the quality of the whole thing when adding additional sounds, every instrument is more audible. All in all, it sounds more death metal which is of course what the recording is. Also, as worthy of mention, is that it originally featured the song \"A Blaze in the Northern Sky\" as well as a drum solo. While the later is definitely interesting and showcase how Fenriz was a good drummer, it is the former that truly picked my interest. If you are a minimum perspicacious and know a little of Darkthrone, you should've realised that it is the title track of their A Blaze in the Northern Sky album. So you can really draw a lot of similarities between the aforementioned album and Goatlord as well as death metal. A lot of the riffs in there have a certain evil A Blaze sonority, as well as similar construction. In fact it surprises me they decided to scrap the album as it isn't that different as the one they wrote instead, provided you change a little its make-up. There's of course black metal riffs and elements in there, but it was still very death metal-ish. In fact, I think the main difference between both recordings beside the black metal elements is the more linear structure of A Blaze, Goatlord being not progressive but has a more \"free-form\" songwriting style. But that is another question for another subject. \n\nSo all in all, Frostland Tapes is the ultimate death metal-era Darkthrone package, the only thing missing from that period being the debut itself. Unlike Preparing for War, you get the complete demo collection without all those filler tracks you already have. It's essential for any Darkthrone or Soulside fan. But hey, I'd get this only for the Goatlord rehearsal.\n",
        "\nIt has been widely purveyed by the more savvy of black metal enthusiasts that Darkthrone\u2019s career can be separated into 5 distinct eras, most of them trilogies. But whether this was an intentionally controlled micro-evolution of sound, or just the way that the chips fell, after the turn of the millennium Fenris\u2019 and Culto\u2019s song creation process took a pretty severe nosedive. Granted, \u201cRavishing Grimness\u201d was a small step down from 2 highly impressive yet mildly conservative preceding albums and there was also a rather unfortunate butchering of a potentially great follow up to \u201cSoulside Journey\u201d in \u201cGoatlord\u201d, but the decline that crept in when \u201cPlaguewielder\u201d was put together is about as steep as they come.\n\nLong story short, this band just completely lost their direction and focus, resulting in something that resembles a black metal album, but can\u2019t really articulate itself apart from that. There have been a number of generic sounding releases out of various acts from France, Austria and Canada that are stylistically similar to this, but even they articulate some sense of dread or sorrow. By contrast, this album just sort of coasts along, touting a fairly slick and smooth production job (at least as far as this band is concerned) and not really much else. Sometimes the impression that attempts to manifest itself within the unmemorable yet highly repetitive riff work and thrashing drum beats is a poor man\u2019s \u201cPanzerfaust\u201d, but without any of the distinctiveness or intensity. But for the most part, what comes across is a cesspool of just about every 1st wave act from Hellhammer to Bathory; all mixed together into a mushy mess, that neutralizes any of the positive and negative effects of all of them.\n\nNowhere is the spirit of this album captured more completely than in the longer concoctions that appear on the track listing. After a rather comical atmospheric intro that I am assuming is meant to invoke a similar feel as that of \u201cA Blaze In The Northern Sky\u201d, what emerges is an extremely bland tribute to a series of 80s and 90s influences in \u201cWeakling Avenger\u201d. Ideas are drawn from Venom, Motorhead, Emperor (minus the keyboards) and Saytricon; but instead of a coherent epic being the result, the song meanders from one idea to the next with little sense of structure or direction. \u201cWreak\u201d is a similar story, but longer and with some elements of Darkthrone\u2019s own 1993-95 material thrown in to add to the confusion. \u201cCommand\u201d is a little bit better, in part because it has even more ideas thrown in and a few of them consist of fairly interesting Celtic Frost inspired proto-thrash riffs.\n\nWhen things are kept a little bit shorter, \u201cPlaguewielder\u201d offers up a less confusing, but still largely uninteresting set of songs. \u201cRaining Murder\u201d is a full out homage to Emperor and Dimmu Borgir, but without any keyboards and a guttural death metal sounding vocal performance. The combination of almost perpetual blast beats and gloomy minor chords is welcoming because it is a little familiar, but doesn\u2019t do much for anyone who has already experienced \u201cIn The Nightside Eclipse\u201d of \u201cStormblast\u201d. \u201cI, Voidhanger\u201d jumps back into mid-80s Celtic Frost territory, particularly the more doom oriented aspects, and doesn\u2019t deviate too far from typical 1st wave clich\u00e9s, save the vocal performance. \u201cSin Origin\u201d shows the somewhat crust punk sound of \u201cRavishing Grimness\u201d still lingering, but largely doesn\u2019t go far beyond restating what was already heard there. Essentially, when not being completely incoherent, the most that can be hoped for here is a predictable, tried and true set of ideas that don\u2019t really do much beyond being listenable.\n\nMany have been quick to pan this as a downright awful album from a seasoned outfit that should know better, but I tend to see this more as being the epitome of mediocrity. I can\u2019t really say that I hate this album to the point that I would recommend it to masochistic metal heads who want to hate something, but there really isn\u2019t much to like here. It\u2019s not a good representation of what these guys are capable of, and it definitely goes against the steady path of stylistic evolution that was pretty well constant up until before this. It is an album that shouldn\u2019t be lauded, nor trashed, but rather forgotten for the sheer sake of being forgettable.\n\nOriginally submitted to (www.metal-observer.com) on April 7, 2010.\n",
        "\nTwo of Norway's finest releasing new albums at the same time you ask? Why of course, get me involved! While the new Burzum release may have been a more momentous event than another Darkthrone album given the productivity of both bands in recent years, I will always have time for the works of Ted Skjellum and Gylve Nagell. Exposing the kind of attitude that I profess towards elitist (black) metallers, albeit on a more public scale than I, Darkthrone have always been in a league of their own, and none more so than now around the release of their fifteenth (!) studio album. Giving the 'requirements' of BM the middle finger in the vain that the original templates of the genre did to the rest of the music world upon it's formation in the 80s-early 90s, this duo in my mind will forever be a breath of fresh air to the scene, of course ironically conducted through the medium of fetid, dirty punk-infused blackish metal, that has been needed for so many years.\n\nSince 2006's \"The Cult is Alive\" Darkthrone have been moving further from the field of black metal from which they came, with \"Circle the Wagons\" merely being another step away from the overbearing sonic limitations of the True Norwegian Black Metal\u2122 sound which they were a key part in forming. The influence of punk and early metal classics has but merely grown through each successive album, to the point of calling these guys black metal an act done through more historical referencing than anything based on this or recent releases. Tracks such as \"I Am The Grave Of The 80s\" and the albums' title song bleed such verminous dedication to a sound so ancient I doubt even the dinosaurs had died out by then, that it does make you wonder why more acts haven't jumped on this bandwagon (pun intended?).\n\nAs has been the case ultimately with all the recent Darkthrone albums, I have never found my appreciation of the music contained within each opus reaching the level of respect I hold for Messrs. Culto and Fenriz. I love Fenriz' clean vocals, however average they may be, in songs like \"Black Mountain Totem\" and \"Those Treasures Will Never Befall You\". I love too how stripped down the sound is, allowing the power of the RIFF to do the talking; but I also still believe that in this current incarnation Darkthrone have it within them to release something truly classic. The elements of old punk and classic metal, ala Saxon and Angel Witch, which are all too obvious for anyone listening and so emotionally honest to the sound, have in them the potential for the creation of a great release, if, I can whisper it gently, the Darkthrone guys spent just a little more time honing their songs. \n\nGiven the choice however I'd take any day the ethic that Darkthrone propose over the modern and plastic sound that they so vehemently oppose. Supporting Culto and Fenriz these days is as much an act of backing their crusade for the true spirit of metal as it enjoying albums like \"Circle the Wagons\" or \"The Cult is Alive\", but thankfully all their recent albums have been positively infectious pieces of dirty and crusty, yet pure, metal. These LPs have been consistently solid in quality, yet \"Circle the Wagons\" does edge it over 2008's \"Dark Thrones and Black Flags\", but if you knew that already you'd yourself already be a worshipper at the temple of that darkest of thrones. \n\nOriginally written for www.Rockfreaks.net\n",
        "\nOf all the many metal bands in the universe, there are an immense number that I enjoy, but far fewer that I consider myself such a fanboy as to 'line up' for. Or to eagerly anticipate the dropping of each album. Darkthrone is one of those bands. I'll watch or read the band's interviews in advance of the next album. I'll download the cover art and set it as wallpaper. I'll download the samples. I'll order the CD. I'll order the vinyl. And it all stems from how reliable the band has been in their delivery over the past 20 years. No rock star pedestal. No trends. No nonsense. Just two guys recording metal albums that are important to them, and typically also important to me. They've made slight developments in their formula through the years, and I've hung along for each and every transition, because I trust the band completely and they rarely fail to impress me.\n\n2008's Dark Thrones and Black Flags was my favorite metal album that year, and it's one I still have playing in a fairly frequent rotation today. From the self-referential lyrics to the amazing fabric of the vocals and riffs (the first few ringing guitar lines of \"The Winds They Called the Dungeon Shaker\" are all you need to sample to hear just how fantastic that album was), I was hooked, and I really consider it one of their very best efforts alongside the classics like Transilvanian Hunger and A Blaze in the Northern Sky (with many others close behind). For their 15th album, Circle the Wagons, they have come up with both an intriguing and original title and cover concept, with a Native American theme that seems somewhat unusual. This aesthetic is primarily reflected in the title track and cover art, however, as the lyrics cover a variety of topics and more of the band's poorly veiled references to metal music at large.\n\nThe biggest distinction to this new album is that the band have slightly shifted away from the more punk-dominated songwriting of F.O.A.D. and Dark Thrones and Black Flags towards an infusion of classic metal riffing and primordial thrash. But if you enjoyed those albums, fear not, because the sound here is much the same, there's still a touch of the punk energy, and the band continues to share the vocal duties. What's more, the band have taken their occasional use of clean vocals to a new height here, as in the title track, which serves as another metaphor for the band's path, with some extremely entertaining dual clean vocals that make for one of the most memorable bits on the album. The guitars, too, are notably derived more from a wider host of muddy, primal 80s heavy and thrash metal influences than the usual Celtic Frost/Bathory blood that has steadily beaten through Darkthrone's heart for decades.\n\nUnlike Dark Thrones and Black Flags, I didn't quite take to every single song on this album. It's a little disappointing, and it doesn't really belong in the top tier of the band's discography. But it's still a lot of fun to listen through, and several of the tracks are exceptional. \"Stylized Corpse\", one of the darker songs on the album, and perhaps the closest to some of the band's older, 90s material, was one of my early favorites, with its slow escalation of the grooving Hellhammer inspired verse rhythm and the dense jangling of the bridge riff. There are also some killer breakdowns waiting within, one leading to a majestic and minimal melodic tension. \"Black Mountain Totem\" is also huge for its unforgettable plucky thrashing and the disturbing, decaying vocals of Nocturno Culto, spackled in speed metal fervor. \"Eyes Burst at Dawn\" is another rager, with some amazing, manly clean vocals ala \"Dungeon Shaker\" from the previous album, and some of the best melodic riffing on the album (that bridge kills). And it would be foolish to not mention \"Br\u00e4nn Inte Slottet\", a very different instrumental track which begins with ritual drumming over a looped chanting sample, then picking up into simple but effective old school metal riffs akin to the rest of the album, and a little taste of doom.\n\nA few of the other tracks also satisfy, though not as strongly. \"Running for Borders\" has a cruel twist to the guitar rhythms that builds a strong momentum under the vocals, and \"I Am the Working Class\" shakes out just enough punky perspiration to inspire. As for the opener \"Those Treasures Will Never Befall You\", I enjoyed it enough as a light appetizer, but aside from the great bridge section with the somber guitar melody and the raging bass pomp, it didn't sink in as deeply into my skin. The same goes for \"I am the Graves of the 80s\", which seems like a fun enough tribute with some soaring, clean vocals, but failed to blast me out of my seat. \"Circle of the Wagons\" itself did little for me with its punk momentum, but the clean vocals are at least entertaining, especially hearing just how far these guys wanted to take it this time.\n\nYet, I still find myself singing along, even to these. And despite my failed connection with a few of the tunes, it's still a Darkthrone album. As many of us are aware, even on its worst day this band is more impressive than nearly anyone else releasing records in the 21st century. That they've so successfully let the trends of the past 15-20 years slide off their armor and kept their career afloat is a testament to both their devotion to sounds that never quite should have died, and to the fans who still celebrate them above all the awful, modern setbacks that metal has suffered (nu metal, soulless tech death wankery, commercial metalcore, bad thrash throwbacks, hipster coffee shop metal, and so on). Circle the Wagons is immensely enjoyable, provided you are open to the band's adventures and don't care that it's not a direct re-write of Under a Funeral Moon. There's no \"Hiking Metal Punks\", \"The Winds They Called the Dungeon Shaker\" or even a \"Witch Ghetto\" here. But some of the songs are mighty close. It's like a 'bases loaded' situation, with a few single hitters driving up the score, rather than the outright home run with everyone screaming from the rafters that I felt of the last album.\n\nHighlights: Stylized Corpse, Black Mountain Totem, Eyes Burst at Dawn, Br\u00e4nn Inte Slottet, Running for Borders\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nThis is a weird, polarizing album. Let's go through some of its issues point by point:\n\n1. The vocals are too loud. This is hard to dispute but it's also only an occasional grievance; it feels like Nocturno Culto kept swaying too close and then too far from the mike (though mainly the former), so they're at a very inconsistent volume. Compounding that, the instruments are pretty quiet, especially the guitars, which sucks because there's some fantastic riffs on this release.\n\n2. There's a massive, abrupt split in the songwriting on this album between stuff that naturally extends the sound heard on 'Transilvanian Hunger', with melodic riffs and droning construction such as 'n Vind Av Sorg' and much rawer, more dissonant tracks like 'Quintessence' which honestly sound like they were written in the 'Under A Funeral Moon' era but only recorded later. It would be hard to explain how such completely different tracks are found on the same album, and as a result the listening experience is choppy and moreover the album comes across as a collection of random tracks more than as a coherent work.\n\n3. Not much of the material here is as strong or memorable as that on the previous three albums. Sorry, but while this is definitely good and a worthy part of the Darkthrone pantheon, this is absolutely not as effective as the unholy trinity.\n\nWith all that out of the way, I'm not entirely sure how I feel about this release. I would like it a great deal more if the band had chosen one direction or another with the album's structure: either continue 'Transilvanian Hunger''s melodic sound or regress but elaborate on the dissonance of 'Under A Funeral Moon'. It's very hard to take this as a complete album; the very questionable recording values and structure of the album in general really does make this come off as a compilation of b-sides.\n\nThat being said, some of the tracks, particularly 'En Vind Av Sorg' and 'The Hordes Of Nebulah' are undoubtedly Darkthrone classics. The former's elaboration on the melodic ideas present in the previous album and the uncompromising Celtic Frost emulation of the latter both make for excellent songs which absolutely stand the test of time. The rest are good but tend towards the unremarkable; I suppose one could say that this album is the sound of Darkthrone settling down into a fairly comfortable pattern of songwriting, but the sheer weirdness of 'Panzerfaust', it suggests to me that the band was in a tumultuous, confused period, lacking a precise direction after the jewel that was their previous release. The fact that Fenriz wrote the entire album just increases the questions; where was Nocturno Culto on this?\n\nThis is still a worthwhile part of one's Darkthrone collection, but it's certainly not up there with the classics the band put out. If one only needs Darkthrone's essential works to be happy, the previous three will suffice, but anyone with more than a passing interest in the band or black metal in general will want to grab this as well. There's enough quality on here to make it a very worthwhile curio, even if the work's overall coherency leaves much to be desired.\n",
        "\nThis is the point where most better educated followers of Darkthrone\u2019s lengthy career agree was the beginning of their transition into what they are now known for, which is a good distance from what is considered true black metal, but not all that far from the characteristic sound of the genre\u2019s pioneers in the early 80s. It consists of a careful blending of the low fidelity character of the band\u2019s old sound, though in something of a warmer feel than the old frostbitten approach, along with a helping of minimalistic crust punk and hard rock influences. It\u2019s naturally geared towards a very different audience than that of their Peaceville Trilogy days, but it does retain enough of the darkened characteristics to be accessible to fans who have stuck through all of the changes that happened between 1990 and 1996, which were pretty massive, though gradual enough to be classified as an evolution rather than a series of abrupt mutations.\n\n\u201cRavishing Grimness\u201d is, in a subtle way, within a similar realm to the famed \u201cTransylvanian Hunger\u201d release in its simplicity, though stylistically and atmospherically it is far from comparable. The production is a bit colder than that of \u201cTotal Death\u201d, but still much warmer and smoother than that of their 1992-94 practices. The song construction retains a consistent sense of droning and slow development, but the perpetual blast beats have been fully phased out in favor of a rather groovy feel that is, if one can forgive the expression, moderated. The riffs, be they the signature 3 chord approach of the album opener \u201cLifeless\u201d, or the more involved and evolving method of \u201cAcross The Vacuum\u201d, are memorable, though a bit too predictable and sort of run together. In fact, the real weakness in this album, as well as that of several albums that followed this one, is that many of the songs run together.\n\nAs a whole, this is the best representation of this newly developing sound before \u201cThe Cult Is Alive\u201d re-established the band\u2019s credentials as a more metallic beast. It is pretty consistent from one song to the next in terms of energy, but the overall quality develops little by little with each song. \u201cLifeless\u201d, \u201cThe Beast\u201d and \u201cClaws Of Time\u201d tend to set the stage for the second half of the album, which is where the band\u2019s more blackened material resides, and don\u2019t really stand out as being above average. But as soon as \u201cAcross The Vacuum\u201d kicks in there is a reintroduction of the band\u2019s melodic character, and what ensues from thereon in is a solid 1-2-3 punch of ugly vocals and fuzzy guitar brilliance that runs pretty close to the otherworldly aesthetic of \u201cTotal Death\u201d, but in a more tempered manner.\n\nAlthough this is a notable step down from the last 2 albums under the Moonfog banner, it still shows a band with a strong sense of direction and a clear ability to keep a minimal number of ideas interesting for over a half hour. If one wanted to experience a rather interesting mixture of Hellhammer and Black Flag, but without the frequent lead guitar breaks heard on \u201cThe Cult Is Alive\u201d and \u201cF.O.A.D.\u201d, this is the best place to go out of their middle era releases. It retains a bit more of their \u201ctrue sound\u201d aesthetic, particularly in the latter 3 songs, than their current material, but it is definitely pointing away from the more commonly lauded past of this band and towards a very different future.\n\nOriginally submitted to (www.metal-observer.com) on January 28, 2010.\n",
        "\nJudging by the increased speed by which they are releasing new material (their most productive period since the early to mid 90s), it's become clear that Darkthrone are quite happy with the new direction they've taken. The Cult is Alive was only the loading station, and with F.O.A.D. (you know what it stands for) the band would move further down the tracks into a new territory. Yes, this album represents the biggest change in the band since they dropped the death metal and got their black on in the dawn of the 90s, and yet, it remains strangely loyal to all the band has accomplished to date. Change is never a bad thing so long as its a well planned departure, and the decision to let the classic metal and punk influence play a more central role to the songcrafting has opened up a new realm of possibilities.\n\nThere are a surprising number of subtleties here, through the guitars in particular, which might not have been possible on another Transilvanian Hunger or Hate Them, and the rock focus here really leads the band into a fertile pasture. They've already mastered black metal, several times in fact, so what more could they do with it? This is your answer. Equipped with the new 'Mr. Necro' mascot on the cover (Deathhammer logo in tow) and a new approach to their lyrics which is at worst forcibly silly and at best pretty cool, they strap on for nine new tracks that run the gamut from the vile and muddled to the spry and wistful.\n\n\"These Shores are Damned\" is a superb opener, with a graceful, classic sense for melody translated through subtle speed metal rhythms and groovy drumming (not unlike something Deceased might write). When Culto begins to bark out the verse, though, it shifts back to a pure, rocking Darkthrone rhythm, and there's a great, popping melodic lick which breaks out before 2:30 in the track which transforms it all into so much more. \"Canadian Metal\" is a pretty amazing song, making better use of their Hellhammer-inspired rhythmic slamming chords than they've had in years. The lyrics are a little hokey, but fun, as they name-drop a bunch of song titles from Canadian legends like Razor, Piledriver, Sacrifice and Slaughter. Being that I'm a pretty big fan of several of these bands, it is hard not to applaud the tactic, though I haven't enjoyed bands using it before (I remember Seven Witches doing something similar and it sucking awkwardly). At any rate, the song itself smokes. \"The Church of Real Metal\" follows, and while part of me thinks the band might be taking this too far, the song itself is actually not some shallow Manowar-athon, but a brooding and dimly lit doom rock anthem with some great, depressive atmosphere created through the melodic guitars (and I think a synth is in there). The term 'metal' is only uttered with the actual song title, as the chorus, so it could have been much worse...\n\n\"The Banners of Old\" is another track in which you can hear a clear influence from doom bands like Sabbath, Black Widow and so forth, but it quickly spins into a groovy, grinding speed/death riff which is extremely catchy, as Culto's thick vox slobber all over it. \"Fuck Off and Die\" is loud arena mayhem rock, similar to AC/DC but with an even more bluesy twist to it, with Fenriz performing some corny and soulful vocals that slowly pull you in, even if you don't want them to. There's a nice, melodic doom break in the middle, one of the best riffs on the entire album. \"Splitkein Fever\" has a quiet, thumping beat layered in churning, grungy gothic deathpunk guitar lines, and it's quite effective with the lyrics, though the 'flies to a pile of shit' cliche did come across a little forceful.\n\n'I have my world here\nYou think you are right\nBut you can't touch me here\nThe forest is cold and white'\n\n\"Raised on Rock\" is probably the \"Too Old, Too Cold\" for this record, the true anti-poseur anthem. Some might find the lyrics a little too blunt and obvious, but that had to have been the point here, and the raw vocals and dark punk rock riffing make it all quite sinister. \"Pervertor of the 7 Gates\" is big doom metal, and here Fenriz puts a ghastly twist on his Tom G. Warrior vocal aping, though the hooks alone are not the best you'll find on this record. F.O.A.D. goes out on a high note with \"Wisdom of the Dead\", one of the most beautiful tracks the band has written in years, with a soaring death melody and a slowly grinding central rhythm that gives way to a morose, necrotic atmosphere, and some further melodies that arrive and dazzle later in the song. Even if I were to ignore the rest of the record, this song alone is proof positive that Darkthrone's new direction is a success, because where on one of the previous albums would you hear this? Possibly on Total Death, but the production would be far different.\n\nF.O.A.D. is a fantastic album, but even at its apex, it is still only the footprint for the giant boot in the ass masterpiece to come in the following year, Dark Thrones and Black Flags, the band's first flawless work since Transilvanian Hunger. But there are 6-7 songs here that belong on any Darkthrone playlist, from the hell fueled \"Canadian Metal\" to the more lurid \"Wisdom of the Dead\" or \"The Church of Real Metal\", or even the balls deep \"Raised on Rock\" and \"Splitkein Fever\". This is some pretty intriguing shit, and honestly, if even the most stubborn expatriates of the Darkthrone camp could set aside their crockety old badger dispositions for 40 minutes, they would find something here they might really enjoy, even if just in fun.\n\nHighlights: These Shores are Damned, Canadian Metal, The Church of Real Metal, Raised on Rock, Wisdom of the Dead\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nEnter the birth of Punkthrone. Perhaps I exaggerate here, but it was clear from the mild stagnation of (the still excellent) Sardonic Wrath that some sort of change was once again inevitable in the Northern camp, and The Cult is Alive, LP #12, is where this would begin to really take place. Now, the band has always admittedly carried the punk, rock and classic heavy metal influences through their career, wearing them boldly upon their sleeves, but never has it been more obvious than the tonal shift taken with this album. Not only through the music itself, but the extremely blunt punk lyrics on a few of the tracks which are at once self-deprecating and scathing critiques of what the 'black metal' scene had lost sight of, in addition to celebrations of the very art Darkthrone had mastered numerous times already in a single career...\n\nBut if you're worried that the band has lost their identify, fear not, because this entire album still fits snugly into the black metal realm, with the same raw Culto vocals you've come to expect, and a slew of riffs which do naught but honor the roots of the genre, plus the thrash, punk and heavy metal from which it evolved. For an early comparison, think of Brazil's Sarcofago. For a modern comparison, think of Joel Grind's Toxic Holocaust, who has been creating a more frenetic mesh of these aesthetics for years. The Cult is Alive does not sound quite as fast or crazy as either of those, but you get the general idea.\n\n\"The Cult of Goliath\" begins with a barbaric rhythm reminiscent of some of the songs from Ravishing Grimness, with a savage thrust to its verse that is wholly violent slaughterpunk, and I love the breakdown, which is pretty rock & roll, with a lame but lovable guitar solo. Speaking of the rock, \"Too Old, Too Cold\" was already known to most, having its own EP release a few months before this full-length arrived. It's black punk rock, Hellhammer meets the Ramones, with some lyrics that, while a little awkward, pretty much encapsulate the feelings of Fenriz and Nocturno Culto towards the ever propagating scene of black metal hipsters, armed with irony and designs on exploitation. While fun, the song is actually not one of the better offerings on the album, and aside from the rather open lyrical call to arms, I'm not sure why it was chosen as a single over some of the others. \"Atomic Coming\" is far more of a bruising hymn, with blistering old school speed/thrash riffs that herald annihilation, congealing well with the crushing chords of the black/punk foundation.\n\n\"Graveyard Slut\" had also been released on the Too Old, Too Cold EP before the album dropped, but this is the version with Fenriz' 'Tom G. Warrior' style vocals. The song is highly entertaining, conjuring up nostalgia for teenage years of getting drunk, vomiting all over your denim jacket with all the great patches, and desperately failing to win the affections of that one semi-cool girl in your school who you mistakenly feel might accept you, even though you managed to get the car for that one Friday night. Oh, the pain! \"Underdogs and Overlords\" returns to the Culto vocal, and the second riff here is total asskicking blackened rock'n'roll, a groove that Thin Lizzy or Iron Butterfly might have conceived had they actually known and coveted the face of evil. \"Whiskey Funeral\" reaches even further back, grabbing and blackifying a raw rock'n'roll foundation, foreshadowing pretty much the entire Dark Thrones and Black Flags album. It's pretty damn cool, with a searing speed/thrash bridge rhythm and a nice melodic collapse before returning to the speed.\n\nFor the next two tracks, Darkthrone remembers that they are in fact Norwegian. \"De Underjordiske (\u00c6lia Capitolina)\" leaps between the languages, a grimy, flowing rocker with bright chords that make Culto sound all the more menacing. \"Tyster P\u00e5 Gud (Preemptive War)\" opens as total hardcore punk, which falls somewhere between Discharge and Minor Threat in tone, with a little of the band's guitar bending chagrin', and a Hellhammer-ing breakdown. \"Shut Up\" is actually one of my favorites on the album, despite the rather no-brainer song title, with some excellent, filthy rocking rhythms and amazing vocals which ooze unbridled aggression. The fuzzy solo is quite cool, and the clamoring bridge hook, but believe it or not, there is also quite an amazingly dark black/death metal rhythm here as well. \"Forebyggende Krig\" was the 2nd single for the album, a more traditional black/doom rhythm piece that venerates the previous albums of Darkthrone such as A Blaze in the Northern Sky.\n\nThe Cult is Alive doesn't start off all that great, but it certainly picks up steam as it progresses through the track list. \"The Cult of Goliath\" and \"Too Old, Too Cold\" are passable, but I had already heard the latter a number of times and was beginning to get tired on it. Once the album hits \"Atomic Coming\", the rest is basically sheer bliss, and Darkthrone perfectly translates the more widespread influence of punk and rock into their sound without losing the bludgeoning barbarity of their youth. The production here is astounding, pure and cold and raw and as perfectly plotted as most of their other work. Truly, this is one of their 'fun' albums, but it also maintains a surprisingly serious side, ala the message found through some of the lyrics. It's probably cool to hate this record by now, but that's the great thing about Fenriz and Nocturno Culto. They are the antithesis of cool, and that is why are so endeared to their efforts.\n\nHighlights: Graveyard Slut, Whiskey Funeral, De Underjordiske (\u00c6lia Capitolina), Shut Up\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nSardonic Wrath is the 11th album from Norway's beloved bastards, an extremely strong showing which bridges the morbid taint of the prior Hate Them with a blast from the past, namely a return to the overall sonic aesthetics of the 'unholy trinity' which brought them into prominence (A Blaze in the Northern Sky, Under a Funeral Moon, and Transilvanian Hunger). It is astonishing to me that a band remains so strong so late in their career...think of how many other black metal artists, or metal artists in general, that you listen to, and how solid they were by the 11th album? Most have fizzled out by that point or gone in some direction to polarize their fan base, 'selling out' or whatever hogwash terminology is being used to sate the stubborn feelings of alienation fans can feel when they are no longer the 'only' fans.\n\nDarkthrone have faced such prosecution, and survived, but Sardonic Wrath is the type of album that probably recalled a lot of the fans that left them on Ravishing Grimness, safely nestled in with their earlier sounds, but not ignorant of the minor progressions they have made with each album starting at Panzerfaust. That said, this safety net is just about the only complaint I can make for this album, because truth be told it is phenomenal, thick as thieves with classic Culto riffing and interesting lyrics that see Darkthrone in their transition towards the more bitter political and social criticism that lit the punk fire under their asses in recent years.\n\n\"Order of the Ominous\" is a drawn out dark ambient void, which unlike the intro to Hate Them, is a track until itself. Distortion buzzes off in the background over swelling black noise, with no warmth or melody, and it is this aesthetic which breeds throughout the metal tracks. \"Information Wants to Be Syndicated\" is a cold blast of holocaust, the vocals almost lazily placed at the back end of the measures, floating off into the sick violence of the break at about :30. The breakdown in the track is surefire, slow and heavy, not far off from much of the drone and sludge that was breaking out in popularity at the time. \"Sjakk Matt Jesu Krist (Checkmate Jesus Christ)\" brings in the raving lunacy of the band's Hellhammer leanings, with a raw vitriol enforced through the harsh lyrical winds and the pumping bass distortion.\n\n\"Straightening Sharks in Heaven\" is yet another interestingly titled track, with a bright, rolling bridge that seems like something Voivod, until it rings out into the glorious third rhythm, evoking that Bathory-on-a-dobby-horse motif the band have often used in the past. \"Alle Gegen Alle (All Against All)\" is dark and dank, like a pissed off alcoholic spraypainting his own blood, vomit and urine all over a sewer wall, not expecting to see the next day. It's primal and utterly simplistic, with extremely subtle hooks delivered only through the rhythmic crashing, but the meathook delivery of the bridge before 2:00 is worth listening for alone. \"Man Tenker Sitt (My Thoughts Sit)\" brings forward a little of the band's death metal influence, but the verses broil in a Bathory-like stew with a hefty diabolical impact.\n\n'Fuck hope\nMy empty stare just might make you\nwant to think twice'\n\nSo invokes Nocturno Culto in \"Sacrificing to the God of Doubt\", one of the more melodic tracks on the album, with a great sheen to the chords that feels like skirting a post-industrial wasteland of nihilistic thought. At the 90 second line, the band lurches into a total Norse crawl, complete with marrow-draining minor chords and plodding bass. \"Hate is the Law\" is like a Transilvanian Hunger track without the screaming mountainside melodies, just a grinding abyss of hostility, a bowel movement for the Father of Lies, but the chorus riff is staggeringly punk as fuck and one of the best on this whole album. \"Rawness Obsolete\" returns to the crawl the band started with \"Sacrificing to the God of Doubt\", with a more fleshed out rhythm, and a powerful, ominous crushing atmosphere, before ceding to an even further doomed segment. It's solid 'Throne, but I will admit to getting a little dulled by the rhythm after a spell, and it's likely the least interesting thing you'll discover on this.\n\nI'll admit, a little of my fire for Sardonic Wrath has died down in the six years since its release, a little rust flaked away from the morbid engines of my obsession. It's a fantastic album that I would gladly listen to over about 95% of other black metal releases, but not one of the band's very best when glimpsing back through their career. However, I think it's one of their rare efforts where fans of various eras can come together and find something in common, since it seems to sit dead center in the pantheon.\n\nHighlights: Information Wants to Be Syndicated, Sjakk Matt Jesu Krist, Straightening Sharks in Heaven, Hate is the Law\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nWhen looking at Darkthrone\u2019s career during these last twenty-two years, one is easily tempted to categorize their albums based on the epoch when they were released. The first four are almost always considered masterpieces \u2013 which is fully justified, by the way \u2013 while the subsequent albums, starting slowly with Panzerfaust but really getting there with Total Death until about eight years later and the band\u2019s newfound ability to mix punk and black metal, tend to be considered bland, uninspired and a kind of unfortunate era of stagnation for Darkthrone. While some of those albums are a bit weaker than the band\u2019s best and some are cheapened versions of what they were meant to be (i.e. Goatlord), almost all tend to be underrated and nowhere is this unfortunate truth more apparent than in the band\u2019s sixth opus of blackened music, Total Death. \n\nTotal Death is almost every bit the album that its two predecessors were, surprising the listener with an unrelenting assault of high-quality, complex black metal. The sound here is still undeniably raw, but the mixing reaches a new level, more profound than on albums such as Transilvanian Hunger. The objective is evidently not the same here, with the band aiming to create a unique atmosphere mixing the black metal atmosphere of the last few albums with a certain reminder of the band\u2019s more death metal origins. The death metal influence is indeed present here, in the back, subtle, but definitely there, be it through the aforementioned production value or the quality and style of the riffs, the drumming or even the bass playing. Alongside this there is also a slight thrash influence in the structure of certain tracks, giving the album a certain feel akin to the blackened thrash of other bands, all while keeping the unmistakable Darkthrone sound and aesthetic. \n\nThis album distinguishes itself by having a lot of recognizable and downright awesome riffs strewn all around the place. This is apparent from the very beginning of Earth\u2019s Last Picture, one of the very best Darkthrone openers ever, starting with a unique drum-based intro before the guitars kick in full force, presenting the first of many excellent riffs to be found here. Nocturno Culto\u2019s guitar playing has evolved tremendously from the much more minimalist style of the Transilvanian Hunger era which, timeless though it was, couldn\u2019t support any band for their whole career. Darkthrone needed to find a new niche for themselves and this is perfect. As if the first three and a half minutes of the opener weren\u2019t badass enough, they felt the need to slow everything down to a crawl just for a subsequent kick in the listener\u2019s teeth with a new epic riff, one of the most powerful in the band\u2019s entire career, creating a memorable atmosphere which readies the listener for the rest of this beast. \n\nThe rest of the album then proceeds at varying speeds; that is, varying around the general theme of the fast kick-ass song. Fenriz\u2019s drum work is very enjoyable here, as he abandons the heavy repetition preferred on the previous albums for a much more involved approach, working at fast speeds most of the time and using a much more varied style, which I\u2019ll stop short of calling technical, just very original and refreshing. Another element which came as a surprise on this album is the bass, which can actually be heard, and well! This is particularly true of the final song, the slow doom-oriented The Serpents Harvest, an excellent way to finish an album, linking the end with the slightly slower beginning. Nocturno Culto\u2019s vocals here are his staple sound, that black metal rasp which is unique to him. The ideal level of the production allows his vocals to soar a bit over the instruments, giving the album a truly unique feel in the band\u2019s discography. \n\nNaming highlights here is rather pointless, as all the songs are great, all have inspired titles to them, and they all go very well together to ensure this album\u2019s resounding success. In the end, if forced to pick one, I\u2019d have to say that the opener, with its never-before-seen structure and amazing riffs, probably counts as the best song on here. The lyrics are some of the best this duo\u2019s ever written, rarely have lyrics been so damn scornful and dark, just evil in a casual, everyday way, fitting perfectly to the album. One final element which adds the last bit of glory to this album, making the bridge between the atmosphere of nothingness and scorn evoked in the music as well as the lyrics, is the artwork. The cover is dark, desolate and just a vast landscape in space, well-suited to the album in question. It\u2019s a perfect expression of lifelessness as well as a subtle throwback to the artwork of Soulside Journey, an album which is also slightly hinted at here in the chilling, dark death metal influence of Total Death. This is one great masterpiece of a black metal album, complex and dark at will, and certainly one of the best things Darkthrone ever did, which is saying a lot.\n",
        "\nAfter the lukewarm reception for their previous album, something must have crawled up this duo's collective sphincter and died, leaving some residual cancer of the spirit, because Hate Them is the most fucked up and evil record the band had released since in about a decade, with a harsh, no frills production. This is the Darkthrone of the battlefield, black and white, unholy warfare captured on a still and dripping with vile humours and callous intentions, hostile enough the peel the fresh paint job off your ride and transform your life from sunshine to entropic despair. The lyrics here are seriously excellent, you can just feel the frustration that must have gone into writing them, and it translates perfectly into the rugged, hostility of the compositions.\n\n\"Rust\" opens with a minimal, ambient noise segment composed by Lrz, pulsing like a blackened quasar before the guitar chords ring out and bend northward, slowing stammering into position like a phalanx of undead, decaying soldiers in WWII uniforms. The band slowly maintains this march, hammering along with a steady drum that constantly hovers over the edge of some forward momentum, which finally arrives at 3:00 minutes into the song, but only at a marginal uptempo from the previous section. \"Det Svartner N\u00e5 (It Darkens Now)\" is blood curdling, disgusting black with the band's usual Hellhammer meets punk rock influence, a sequence of chords that a two year old chimpanzee could pick up and play, and yet it lacks no wealth of diabolism, a tangibly gut wrenching atmosphere. If neanderthals figured out how to play black metal many thousands of years ago, it might have sounded like this.\n\n\"Fucked Up and Ready to Die\" picks up the pace considerably, the fastest track on this early half of the record, with a huge death metal tone to the grinding axe rhythm and drums that charge every so slightly beneath its surface, a greatly grooving bridge, and then a segment that lapses into a monolithic, tortured doom, phenomenal with Nocturno's vocals like a monk who has just renounced his vows to finally discover Satan. \"Ytterst I Livet (On the Edge of Life)\" is a plodding, suicidal anthem which reeks of droning noise rock ala the Melvins, swerving into a dense barrage of twisted, depressive chords and rumbling blastwork. \"Divided We Stand\" is one of the best tracks here, ranging from the spikes and leather death of its opening riffs to a swelling, dank fueled punk and pumping breakdown with enough girth to fill any glory hole.\n\n\"Striving for a Piece of Lucifer\" is a cool, bruising tune packed with atmosphere, and a coy lyrical awareness that reveals the roots of Darkthrone's shift into the self-effacing scene-busting entity that they will become on albums like F.O.A.D. and the masterful Dark Thrones and Black Flags. 'Let's see who stands when the smoke clears', indeed! \"In Honour of Thy Name\" is notable for having some of my favorite lyrics in the band's entire history, taking the pseudo-condemnation of the previous track up a notch and telling you what's what. Poseurs leave the fucking hall, please. As for the riffs, they're bouncy and punkish until the expectant breakdown into total Hellhammer rocking, right beneath some of the best lines in the song!\n\n'Black Metal is the devil's fuel\nRam painted abattoirs\nHail the new born king\nand join the fuckin dead'\n\nHalf-horrified that the band might dip below their career low of Plaguewielder, I was extremely relieved by just how refreshing this album was. As they would and will do so many times through their history, it represents yet another small re-invention of their sound, drawing on the roots of their early 90s albums like A Blaze in the Northern Sky and Under a Funeral Moon but placing the murk and miasma into a new context, this one even more grim than the last. Hate Them is just another in a long line of mandatory Darkthrone recordings that I would highly advise you to purchase, unless of course you suck. Not at life, though, because these albums were written specifically for those of us who do suck at life.\n\nHighlights: turn them off. It's better to cry in the dark.\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nAfter releasing an album each year from 1991-1996, it was inevitable that Darkthrone might face some sort of burnout...I mean, really, how can a band remain that good for that long? The answer is that they were going to remain great for a LOT fucking longer. To date, almost 20 years post-Soulside Journey, there has still never been a subpar Darkthrone album... If the band should decide to take a small hiatus for a few years while they eke out the material for their next opus, so be it. Hell, most good bands require at least 3 years between their releases...and Hank Amarillo & co. had just given us 6 straight... including their genre-defining work like A Blaze in the Northern Sky, Under a Funeral Moon, and Transilvanian Hunger.\n\nIn March of 1999, the new album arrived, with a strange album cover unlike any the band had used previously (though the woods were nothing new). And let me say this: it was worth every month of anticipation since the re-release of the Goatlord material. This is a new Darkthrone, but it's also the old Darkthrone, given a vibrant, crashing production with a killer guitar tone that rings of hollowed out trees. I've heard a great many gripes about this record and its follow-up Plaguewielder, that the band had gone all out 'black'n'roll' or that they had sold out, but I'd like to dismiss such claims as tripe and horseshit. The riffs here follow the same familiar patterns they've used on most of their albums starting with A Blaze in the Northern Sky, it is simply the production of Ravishing Grimness which has shifted. In fact, this is the strongest material the band had offered since Transilvanian Hunger, wisely kept to a neat length of 37 minutes for six tracks, with no filler and no fat to trim. The duo's duties here remained unchanged from Total Death, with Fenriz rocking the kit and Nocturno Culto handling the bass, guitars and vocals once more. Talking about overworked!\n\nSome Darkthrone albums have traditionally possessed a few layers of penetration before I could come to fully revel in their nuances, but not the case with Ravishing Grimness, and I took to it immediately as the feedback and whip-click herald the writhing power of \"Lifeless\", with its cutting chords that hiss off into the darkness as the edges, before the sick bridge rhythm at :45. After another minute, the track cuts into an even simpler riff of pure old Hellhammer worship, though I had yet to hear such a rhythm with the brighter guitar tone used on this album. \"The Beast\" has another of those simplistic, proto-black/punk rhythms that had gotten the band where it was by this point; equal parts Hellhammer, Bathory and Discharge, with only subtle changes in pattern much like an old rockabilly or blues number might pursue, before the inevitable collapse into a bludgeoning groove bridge. After this, the next three tracks pick up to over 7 minutes in length, beginning with the pondering of \"The Claws of Time\", in which a searing and melodic melody is anchored by Culto's raw throat, switching off into an even more subtle and beautiful rhythm. If I didn't know any better, I would almost say this was the first 'happy' sounding song from Darkthrone (perhaps it's the real reason so many stubborn cockslugs suddenly felt the band had 'sold them out', and refuse to acknowledge their body of work post-Total Death). But this airy warmth is fused with a sadness, and before long a cruising, majestic riff embarks like an ocean liner en route to an iceberg.\n\n\"Across the Vacuum\" spans a terrain somewhere in between \"The Beast\" and \"The Claws of Time\". It has that punk heart fueling its engine, but manifests in long passages of slashing chords that emulate the rise and fall of a meat cleaver, before the 1:30 point at which the song starts to channel a more sinister cousin to their Transilvanian Hunger days. There's also a pretty powerful breakdown in the track with a dash of Satyricon or Bathory. \"Ravishing Grimness\" itself is the tune which stands out the most to me, a series of phenomenal riffs that manage to resonate through the simple ringing out of the higher tone in the chords, like a rush of cold water down a desolate fjord. The steady repetition of this passage eventually descends into a slower, fist-clenching rhythm alongside the low-riding ring of a bell (I assume), and then an uplifting, almost Viking concoction of driving chords which remind me of an Immortal breakdown. \"To the Death (Under the King)\" finishes off the album, with an early Slayer-styled riff blown into thundering chords over the steady shuffle of Fenriz' footwork, eventually rushing into an even faster charge.\n\nRavishing Grimness is an entirely level album, and though I dread to say it, probably the 'safest' they had released in the 90s. However, it is very much classic Darkthrone, and the rather reined in vibe of the compositions can hardly be faulted when the album sounds so good. This is not at the level of re-invention that some of their later efforts would pursue, it's just the basics re-organized with a new studio sound and a slightly more mellow set of lyrics (though they haven't lost all their edge, just read \"Ravishing Grimness\"). It gets a little unjust treatment due to its minor shift in tone, but I have confidence it's the type of album people will listen back on, and then kindly slap themselves in the head for having not appreciated it before.\n\nHighlights: Lifeless, The Beast, Claws of Time, Ravishing Grimness\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nIt's pretty much par for the course for 'elitist' black metal scrubs to harp on anything Darkthrone have accomplished beyond their first 4-5 albums, but of their entire body of work, Plaguewielder is the only album that might actually deserve a little flogging. No, not for the color cover art. Seriously, there were individuals who hacked this record to pieces because it had a color cover...even though the band had already used color covers...including their fucking debut album... So the band logo is also in color. Who cares? When did metal heads start getting their panties in a bunch over senseless details, and why don't they just leave the nerd rage to the nerds? This is the world we live in, folks, these are the people breeding among you.\n\nBut you've got about as much patience for my sociology lessons as I do in writing them. I had mentioned that this album may actually deserve a little ribbing, because truth be told, it is probably the worst Darkthrone album ever recorded. Gasp. Yes, this is perhaps the lowest point that the band has reached as of 2010, if you discount some of their rather useless EPs or singles. It's not that Plaguewielder is in any way terrible, or even bad. It's actually a very good record, with a few dull moments that hold it back from the greatness, and unlike so much of their work, I have not grown fonder of it through time, quite the opposite. I'd say, of the six tracks (only six, like the last album), there are four great ones, and two that have their high points and then a little lagging behind. As far as the production, it's not a lot different than Ravishing Grimness, only a bit more raw, as if the band were bridging back from its predecessor to their twilight years. Fenriz and Nocturno fill out their same roles as that album, with a few guest vocals on the track \"Command\", including Apollyon from Aura Noir, Immortal, etc.\n\nPart of the problem with Plaguewielder is that it doesn't put its best foot forward. \"Weakling Avenger\" might open with an entertaining sample of the band members groaning and creaking as they clear their throats, a strange intro before a fairly majestic carousel-sounding black metal rhythm enters the fray, soon shifting into faster territory with a pretty average Norse rhythm one would expect from many of the band's peers. This goes on for nearly 8 minutes, and until about half way through at 4:00 where the band does a breakdown, I can feel a tinge of ennui coming on when I listen to this. It's not terrible, and the sound is nice and savage, it's simply not one of the better sequences of notes strung together here. \"Raining Murder\" feels as if it might suffer the same fate until the turbulent bridge rhythm, over which a rumbling storm erupts, and the song begins to emit an air of psychotic mayhem true to the implications of its title, and the breakdown here is a lot better than in the first track. \"Sin Origin\" feels a lot more like the old Darkthrone of A Blaze in the Northern Sky, albeit in the brighter, bloodied hacking tones of Ravishing Grimness. The melody at the minute mark is excellent, with a firm, circular rocking rhythm that descends into a more disjointed take on their Hellhammer-ing doom.\n\n'Absurd hopeless rivalry\nUbertragic trinity\nthe damned one, swan and sunray\nSick engine; the piston hammers away...'\n\n\"Command\" is another of the album's longer tracks, at 8 minutes, but it carries this well, with some churning grooves that collapse into a rainbow of desolate chords, Culto's vocals springing out like a shadowcat stalking wounded prey. The rapid transition feels immediate and reminiscent of something the band would have written for Transilvanian Hunger, and the backing vocal eruption is pretty fucking sweet. \"I, Voidhanger\" reminded me a little of Voivod, if only for the stream of spacey, grooving chords and rolling footwork, which eventually builds into a solid, memorable thrashing rhythm before the blasted outbreak of its climax. \"Wreak\" is over nine minutes of utter havoc, but like the opening track \"Weakling Avenger\", it doesn't fully carry its weight. Some of the riffs are simply repeated a few times too often, and while there are numerous dynamic shifts, all of which produce positive short-term results, I feel as if it could have been two separate tracks or at least trimmed down to a more digestable form. That being said, the riffs themselves are decent, and I've definitely heard a lot more numbing waste of space in a black metal song\n\nAs you can tell, this album is not quite the disaster it is often painted as. For a career low, it's still pretty entertaining, and in fact, I can think of numerous black metal bands who have yet to even release something of its quality. The lyrics are still interesting, Fenriz and Nocturno are in fine form, but there is just something missing...some almost intangible, voracious spirit that temporarily removed itself from the studio or songwriting to smoke a cigarette this time out. Anyone can have an off day, or an off record, and it's a testament to the mighty Darkthrone that even their off days are pretty fabulous.\n\nHighlights: Raining Murder, Sin Origin, Command\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nGoatlord is actually one of Darkthrone's more interesting releases, not for the inherent quality of the material but for the history involved. Essentially, this is the album that would have, could have been the followup to 1991's Soulside Journey, so the material you will find here is much akin to their early work, raw death metal with a little groove and some influence from the obvious parties (Celtic Frost, a little Death, Autopsy, and so forth). The tracks to this album were rehearsed but later shelved when the band decided to alter their course towards the emergent black metal (if you've got the Frostland Tapes compilation, you can hear the entire thing in its original, instrumental form). In 1994, it was decided that Fenriz would record some vocals (with a little help from some friends) and release the material as a sort of posthumous 'rehearsal album' through Moonfog, and I for one am happy they did, as this is sort of a treat.\n\nIt's a messy treat though, like getting that half-melted ice cream bar from your creepy uncle, trying to grin and bear it while you halfheartedly consume the thing, wondering what he might have slipped inside it. But a treat nonetheless! Of course, as this is basically a rehearsal with a few cheaply added vocal tracks, you will have to deal with the concessions. There is a nice, bruising, raw guitar tone here which sounds at best like a tight live performance, but the drums are as tinny and the bass as plopping as you would expect from an old soundboard. Since the vocals were added later, they seem to exist in a realm all their own. You've got the standard Fenriz rasps, his manly, oddball crooning, and even some 'femme' gothic opera vocals which at times sound like King Diamond. Supposedly, it was Fenriz who did all of these vocals, though there are some backups from Satyr.\n\nNot a lot of people have given this release a fair shake, and through my first few exposures, I can kind of relate. But once you accept it simply for what it is, and not what you were hoping, you will find that there is a lattice of rather mesmerizing, grooving riffs that were written here which probably could have made for a killer album with the band's older, death metal vocals and a studio production akin to Soulside Journey. If they were one day to reincarnate this material and give it a proper treatment, I would actually buy it again, but then I'm not at all disappointed with the currency I blew on this the first time around.\n\n\"Rex\" opens with a frilly speed picked death line, and while you get the impression the track will run off at this speed, it actually turns into a stubborn groove which drifts through a number of pretty cool riffs, often bordering on a stoner death hybrid. \"Pure Demoniac Blessing\" would have been a perfect fit for Soulside Journey, though the melody stops and starts and Fenriz' cleaner, dreary vocals feel incredibly corny over the doom verse. However, when it reaches into its chest and pulls free its death metal heart, I am quite reminded of an old Death-like atmosphere, ala Leprosy. The vocals are a little wild, like a plaster of schizos recorded sessions with their shrink and simply 4-tracked onto this old recording. But you'll have to get used to them if you're going to listen to this album.\n\n\"The Grimness of Which Shepherds Mourn\" starts with a big Celtic Frost rhythm, and Fenriz even goes so far as to purportedly ape a high-pitched female vocalist just so it might sound like something from Into the Pandemonium. Personally I enjoyed it, there is this uncouth pleasure to be had from a song like this, and if it was being performed before me I would be banging my head in between opium hits with the best of them. The bass is so thick here that it borders on the post-funk of Les Claypool during the bridge. \"Sadomasochistic Rites\" is vile and evil death/doom, crawling forward under some of Fenriz' sickest vocals ever, while he wails against himself like a morbid ghost lost in the woodlands. \"As Desertshadows\" has a deeper guitar tone than the previous tracks, one of the tracks which bears the most semblance to Soulside Journey, with the added 'female' operatic vocals, and there is this great, dark crawling passage before 2:00 which would have slayed on either that album or one of the earlier Paradise Lost records.\n\n\"In His Lovely Kingdom\" has a grim atmosphere of writhing, melodic death which crashes forward over the double bass, picking up speed into a bleeding guitar line for a brief second before yet again morphing into another of the band's death/doom segues, this time a hybrid of Sabbath and Death. \"Black Daimon\" is the perfect ritual death rehearsal, with a variety of vocals that all work in conjunction like a chorus of paranoid schizophrenics. I love the catchy old school Death hook in this, and the end cycles through a painful doom crawl to some grinding death. \"Toward(s) the Thornfields\" is excellent, painful death/doom which would probably have Cathedral dripping with envy, and \"(Birth of Evil) Virgin Sin\" feels like a simplified, stretched out warmup for a Demilich recording. \"Green Cave Float\" is one of the better regarded tracks from the album, a lurching melodic groove that mutates into simmering death grizzle....it's really, really good, even when the femme vocals arrive, it's like a procession of lost souls trying to escape a labyrinth of ancient, crushing stone and slime.\n\nI'm going to say this: if Goatlord were recorded in a proper studio and released in its intended form, it would today be another album hailed in the same regards as the early works of My Dying Bride, Anathema, Paradise Lost, and maybe the debut from Amorphis. I.e. a death/doom metal classic. There are a great many quality riffs here, the only problem with this particular recording is the vocals stand out, but I'm not sure how else they would have done it due to the disparity in the sessions. Anyone who is listening to this and expecting to hear the Darkthrone black metal that they are used to is wrong, I mean, read the fucking liner notes...or do a little research before you buy something. At the same time, the vocals here can be a little distracting, and perhaps Fenriz could have reined them in so they'd match the more serious nature of the music itself. The lyrics here are not the best of Darkthrone, but consistent enough that you wouldn't find them cheesy if not for the means by which some of them are delivered. But in general, I like all the voices the guy is doing, it's just a matter of them standing out so far in the mix that it becomes obvious they come from two different eras.\n\nSo where does this fit in? Well, if you're a fan of Soulside Journey, I heartily recommend buying this, because it's quite enjoyable. If you're a production whore, avoid it, and honestly you'll probably also want to avoid most of the band's releases, since they do not exactly practice the studio sterility of the modern metal world even when they go at it with an actual budget. This is some surly, memorable old school death metal which, despite its bizarre format, manages to succeed where so many have failed, at crafting the creepy hooks and atmosphere which should always beat at the black heart of the genre. As far as the means by which it finally surfaced...hell, I wouldn't mind more bands attempting this type of release.\n\nHighlights: Rex, Pure Demoniac Blessing, The Grimness of Which Shepherds Mourn, Black Daimon, Toward(s) the Thornfields, Green Cave Float\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nTotal Death was the second album Darkthrone released through Moonfog Productions, and again we are faced with a minor re-invention of the band's sound, in particular the production. I have to admit this is one of the best mixed albums in the band's history, full of deep, resonant tones that add an extra layer of darkness to the band's already morbid aesthetic, a rich and fertile sea of evil which seems perfectly reflective of the album's cover image. The guitars are a thick and powerful morass of chords which rock hard whether they are channeling Bathory or Hellhammer. This album also marked a shift in how the band would write songs, with Fenriz performing drums and bass, and Nocturno Culto adding guitar and bass to his vocals. In addition, only half of the lyrics are written by Nocturno Culto (none here by Fenriz). For the remaining tracks, the band called upon the talents of their friends Ihsahn (Emperor), Satyr (Satyricon), Garm (Ulver) and Carl-Michael Eide (Ved Buens Ende). While the subtle differences are noticeable, all of them manage to do a little justice to this beloved band, though Fenriz is simply better in all cases.\n\nOnce the raging central rhythm to \"Earth's Last Picture\" arrives, you get an instant flashback to Blood, Fire, Death, because the song sounds like it would fit right in there, aside from Culto's more cryptic vocal style and the occasional lapses into squealing groove and huge, sludged out chords. If Quorthon and Tom G. Warrior had ever formed a band together, this might have been the result, and the nebulous darkness of this album's atmosphere only adds to the punch. It's a bloody awesome song, from the roaring verse riffs to the hooky chorus with its higher pitched chords. \"Blackwinged\" is like a high speed blackened shoegazer surf anthem, it's beautiful verse rhythm akin to the crashing of cold waves upon a rocky shore, and the shift to the bridge a wonderfully submersed grinding across a bare minimum of notes. When the track slows at around 2:30, it yet again visits the glorious pacing of Bathory. \"Gathering for Attack on the Pearly Gates\" features a familiar Transilvanian Hunger pace, but though the opening riff leaves something to be desired, credit should be given to Nocturno Culto, whose vocals really make the track until it swerves into the better pre-chorus, and eventually to a kickass, driving hyper-Hellhammer rhythm.\n\n'Souls of christ, prepare for fight\nWe'll crush your halls with bonecrushing\nmight supreme!'\n\n\"Black Victory of Death\" is amazing, another Darkthrone victory in which the duo proves that you only need two good riffs to really nail a track. When they hit the second, over the cruising drum beat, they yet again evoke their dark Swiss godz, but it is the dark and winding majesty of the opening guitar rhythm which really sells this. \"Majestic Desolate Eye\" is even better...one of the most glorious Darkthrone tracks ever and probably my favorite on this record. A driving, powerful rhythm churns into a languid, rock break, while the vocals cascade across like an extraterrestrial conqueror ordering his armies to attack Earth, and then the band erupts into a venomous blasting rhythm that delivers another beautiful payload riff, pretty chords simmering atop its climactic 4th count. That is does this all in just over 3 minutes is nothing shy of joy... \"Blasphemer\" twines about a good old school violent thrash rhythm, with an increased fuzz to the distortion, and an amazing bridge rhythm which creates a beautiful marriage with Culto's bloodsoaked vocal torture. \"Ravnajuv\" is pretty good, with a desperate woven melody that brings back the Transilvanian Hunger material, same pace and just a variation of two rhythms, though the track does break down near the climax. When summed up, this chunk of Total Death is honestly among the best material the band has written, but it doesn't last.\n\nI say that because I find most of the closer, \"The Serpent's Harvest\" a bore, with a grooving ooze doom riff that tires me out after only a few repetitions, and the first change in riff does very little but speed it up. The creepy, almost Wild Western melodies of the bridge are quite nice, but they arrive a little too late to save the remainder of the track, and in the end, this is the major reason I don't rate the album higher.\n\nIn the end, Total Death is pretty damn good, though not one of their best overall efforts. The use of guest lyrics was a nice touch, but they're not Fenriz (or Culto), and there is at least the one song which doesn't really impress me (\"The Serpent's Harvest\", and a few segments of some others). That being said, if I were to create a compilation culled from all the band's albums, \"Majestic Desolate Eye\", \"Blackwinged\" and \"Black Victory of Death\" would likely fine a place there, and this is well worth the money for any ardent Darkthrone fan regardless of your favorite phase in the band's career.\n\nHighlights: Majestic Desolate Eye, Blackwinged, Black Victory of Death, Earth's Last Picture\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\n1995 may have seen a shift from the more visible Peaceville Records to the little known Moonfog Productions (Satyr of Satyricon), but there was no shift in Darkthrone's dedication to spawning blasphemous, cold filth into the scene, which is what Panzerfaust, their 5th longplayer, represents. At this point the black metal movement was in full swing, bands choosing sides and drawing the line between 'keeping the faith' (Burzum and Darkthrone) or breaking the bank (Cradle of Filth and Dimmu Borgir), and the church burnings and murders of Euronymous were the gossip of the world. Meanwhile, melodic death metal and gothic metal were also taking off, with labels snapping bands up in a frenzy once more to cash in before the trends were spent.\n\nThus, it was only fitting that Fenriz and Nocturno Culto release their harshest record yet, an album that returns to the Hellhammer worship of their earlier years, and to some extent leaving behind the monotonous, rampant brilliance of Transilvanian Hunger. Once more, Fenriz was responsible for all the instruments here, and he sought a more dynamic, if primal tone to the tracks, grim as a family of cute forest animals cut off from their normal food and water supplies, starved and frozen to death slowly over the winter months. Where before the similarities to Celtic Frost were in the riffs alone, here the guitar tone actually sounds the closest to the source, with the band's simple, psycho bends and drudging chords, but this aesthetic is not dominant throughout the entire playtime, as there are some faster songs. The band also returned to English lyrics for the most part, with three exceptions on this album.\n\nOpener \"En Vind Av Svorg\" actually seems like a direct continuation of Transilvanian Hunger, with a faster beat and streams of haunting notes that feel like sunlight escaping through a woodland canopy, its boughs and branches littered with rime and decay. There is no change in pace until about 3:45, where the beat remains driven but the guitar transforms into this great, grooving death metal riff. \"Triumphant Gleam\" is quite derivative of Celtic Frost, to the point it feels like you just put on your Morbid Tales vinyl and realized there was a bonus track you hadn't noticed prior...save for Nocturno Culto's barking, tortured vocals. This might actually bother me if the song weren't so goddamned excellent, in particular the sparse, doomed chords that barrel out beyond 1:30. \"The Hordes of Nebulah\" continues this pace, a crawling, evil riff which sounds like a corpse evaporating, its ghost dispersing into the air while the flesh flowers with maggots and vines, all in painful slow motion:\n\n'Oh, Father Fog of Nebula\nyour faithful children have escaped\nThe Walls of Eternity\nThe Elders Curse-\nlike Snow of the Solstice of the Sun'\n\nEver wanted to get stoned to a Darkthrone track but just couldn't find that perfect track on any of the previous albums? Well, this is the one, so light 'em. \"Hans Siste Vinter\" returns again to the Transilvanian Hunger formula, a steady driving beat through about two riffs. It's entertaining for about two minutes, but this is one of the tracks I could have used less of, or rather, it could have used a little more deviation. The central riff is simply not as immersive as the material on the previous album, so it can't keep you strapped in for the entire ride. \"Beholding the Throne of Might\" has another big Celtic Frost groove, and another testament to how Darkthrone can take the most asinine, simplistic riffs and transform them into a huge, unforgettable shitstorm of torment and melancholy. As the guitar chugs over the basic fret pattern, you can feel the black ichor rising from within, ready to be retched forth like a human sprinkler. In short, it rocks, and the little descending guitar melody is perfectly placed before the 3:00 mark, before the pace picks up into a bruising rhythm.\n\n\"Quintessence\" is the album's longest track, with a majestic slower riff that recalls to me the early work of Tiamat (up to Clouds), but with the obvious difference in vocals. There are only about 2-3 shifts in the guitars throughout the track, so at over 7:30 in length, you would suspect it gets boring, but it surprisingly doesn't, since the purity of the central rhythm causes one to look forward to it repeatedly. \"Sn\u00f8 Og Granskog (Utferd)\" is something very different for Darkthrone, a martial ambient piece with some bombastic, synthesized horns and Fenriz' folk vocals over sparse percussion. I remember needing a few spins to acclimate myself to it, but it's pretty charming if you give in to it, though possibly belonging more to one of Fenriz' other projects than here (Neptune Towers, Storm, Isengarde, etc.)\n\nPanzerfaust is a pretty interesting crossroads for Darkthrone. After all, most would consider it the first album beyond their 'classic' era (1991-1994), and many bands don't survive a few albums out. Landing right in the center of the decade, i.e. the 'death of metal' years (for those who didn't know where to look), it seems a refreshing blast of black energy, completely anathema to the trend of the day, which involved more melodic guitars, an increased symphonic presence, and trying to bridge the 'accessibility gap' to bring new listeners into the fold. It was clear that one band (at least) would survive all this change and keep things to a minimum, and here is the proof.\n\nHighlights: Triumphant Gleam, The Hordes of Nebulah, Beholding the Throne of Might, Quintessence\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nAs if to infer some grim parody of the legendary KISS solo albums, the cover to Darkthrone's fourth album (and second pure masterpiece) features Fenriz on the cover, in beautiful newsprint tones with candelabra, inverted cross, corpse paint, and the perfectly placed corner logo and gothic album title font. Zephyrous and Nocturno Culto had their 15 minutes in the spotli...dark, and so now should the drummer. Surely, of their entire discography, this is the most iconic of the album art, and possibly the most memorable black metal cover of all time, even if it's not quite the best. It's the type of image that screams 'what more needs be said', and in that way, it is COMPLETELY loyal to the music of this album, a minimal masterpiece which contains hypnotic wave after wave of blissful torture, blood thirst and sorrow.\n\nBy this point the band was down to just two members, those same two that we would come to know as important personalities in the black metal scene due to their insights and tasteful endeavors through side projects. It can be argued that Darkthrone are the 'truest' of the original Norwegian black metal sect, due largely to the lack of narcissistic tendencies, and the adherence to isolation and obscurity which the musical message implies. Show me the last video this band made where the member were being lavished by goth models in leather? The cover images from 1992-1994 are about as self-centered as the band would ever get. And aside from a few rare live performances in their old days (as a death metal band), the band made the decision rather early that they would not be a touring act, not even at off-gigs in their own backyards. Though they've probably gotten a solid stash from their recorded works and tightly knit merchandising, the lack of live shows has probably put a severe dent in their earnings. But they don't care. And it is this 'nemesis of the music industry' business which I have always found refreshing in the world of superficial, idol worship that has extended its plastic fingers even into the black metal realm. Thus, I am proud to say my own obvious fanaticism for this band's work is based not only on their astounding ability to craft mood and rhythm, but on a healthy respect for the individuals involved. I can't say the same for a lot of bands...\n\nWhere Under a Funeral Moon was a slight shift from the sounds of A Blaze in the Northern Sky, this album is an even wider gyration away from its source. The lyrics here are almost entirely in Norwegian, with the exception of the title track and one other, a practice they used only on one previous song (\"Inn I De Dype Skogers Favn\"). The guitar tones are much cleaner, now that Fenriz had taken over all the instruments. You saw that correctly: Fenriz writes the music, Fenriz plays the drums, Fenriz plays the guitar, and Fenriz plays the bass here. Culto is on vocals. So you have what is essentially the 'birth' of the one man bedroom black metal act, even if they are cheating with two. At any rate, the guitars no longer maintain that same level of harsh fuzz as the past two albums, and while some might see that as a crippling mutation, it actually works in favor of the compositions, which are bleak and barren landscapes that one must penetrate before one can walk in step with its many glories.\n\nAs the melodic force of the title resonates immediately over the rather lazy tint of the drumming, you become quickly attuned to the fact that this is not the same Darkthrone of the year before. Here the guitars paint a palette of fallen majesty, of an archaic history that still stalk at the edge of European folklore and perceptions. The lyrics are rather blunt and obvious, and yet it's still one of the better vampire black metal tunes of the 90s, almost making Ancient and Cradle of Filth irrelevant for their flashier tributes to the subject matter. \"Over Fjell Og Gjennom Torner (Over Mountains and Through Thorns)\" is brief at under 2:30, but nevertheless a beautiful blast of icy northern stream water with scintillating, beautiful notes in the bridge that crash and echo against the stone walls of a mountainous atmosphere, in tribute to the band's native land. If you could bottle this track, I would gladly purchase it over Poland Spring or any other spring water I could buy around here.\n\n\"Skald Av Satans Sol (Poet of Satan's Sun)\" is a more brutal onslaught of savage riffing, like a call to warfare, each riff a razor drawing blood across the scenery and a steady pounding beat that simply does not cease, ever, until the end. Distorted, bombing basslines thunder beneath, while the chord changes glisten off the fresh viscera of organs strewn about the battlefield, the band yet again proving the power of their simplistic compositions. Rather than break for a different tempo, \"Slottet I Det Fjerne (Castle in the Distance)\" rages forward, and the bridge rhythm truly does capture the image of its title, in particular if you can imagine the sun descending, shadows beginning to dance across the stones of its foundation. This is dense, forceful and atmospheric material, aped by countless artists and yet eerily still perfect here at the source. By the arrival of \"Graven T\u00e5keheimens Saler (Tombs in the Misty Halls)\", any sane person would probably feel redundant at the familiar drum eruption and the simple replacement of the chords, but one might argue that Darkthrone isn't FOR the 'sane' person, and this song is as perfect an expression as any other on the album, with colossal, crashing chords that sweep across the neck like a scythe.\n\n\"I En Hall Med Flesk Og Mj\u00f8d (In a Hall With Meat and Mead)\" continues, you guess it, at the same passionate pace, another charge of subtleties expressed entirely through the gleaming, beautiful chords, though this one features a crushing bridge before the 1:00 mark in which the band recalls the heavy Hellhammer/Celtic Frost style they polished on some of their previous effects. Monolithic and foreboding, one can feel the tension and horror of a lodge full of Northmen, taking what could be their final supper before being claimed by a murderous grendel. The riff before 3:00 is also a suitably awesome variation, with the hypersonic bass line slugging below its sharp edge. \"As Flittermice as Satan's Spys\" is the only track aside from \"Transilvanian Hunger\" to have English lyrics here, and it's another fast, cutting piece with guitars that swell in overture to the fallen angels of hell, represented by the tiny, winged ugly rodents our civilization often fears in the night. \"En \u00c5s I Dype Skogen\" is a longing, desperate climax to the album, with riffs that feel like arms outstretched to touch the warmth of a faded sun, repeating like a ritual of futility against the onset of wintery death, with a majestic, haunting bridge rhythm.\n\nA valid criticism often leveled against this album is its unwillingness to shift up its pace, and I could see how that might affect some listeners. In fact, were the riffs and atmosphere on this album not as good as they are, I myself might see this as a negative trait. However, the material composed for Transilvanian Hunger is so bloody good that it becomes a roller coaster I just don't want to get off...even if that means I race up and down the same skeletal tracks for nearly 40 minutes. There is a such a sense of unity and semblance among structure of the songs that I could imagine the following conversation take place:\n\nNC: I love the riff you just recorded, but what if you were to shift to these frets here, and then ascend to that note there...\nF: That's great! But I've already recorded the other sequence...\nNC: Who cares? Just play the same drumbeat and write some different lyrics.\nF: But...but...people might get kind of tired of...\nNC: Fuck people.\nF: You fiend! Big hugs.\n\nTransilvanian Hunger is compulsive and addictive, like taking heroin shots while you snort lighter fluid. Sooner or later you are bound to catch fire, and sooner or later you are bound to fall for this album's monstrous level of charisma, despite the bland consistency of its surface to air missile drumming and ceaseless barrage of riffs which belong to the upper atmosphere by day, descending to the twilight world like a cloud of demons to settle upon the necks of the innocent and suckle their vitae. I can't say that i feel any less strongly about it than when I first picked it up, it is simply one of those eternal sensations which my imagination fondly drifts about with both cold nostalgia and aural satisfaction. The band's disconnect from all worthless trends continued here, another fist in the eye of the Creator and the scenester horseshit which was already beginning to poison the black metal scene of its day.\n\nI suppose this is another of the band's 'love it or hate it' albums, but I place myself at the extreme edge of the left column, beating my little angel wings and firing arrows at passersby as I tune them into its grim and foreboding luxuries. Transilvanian Hunger might be perfect in a different way than A Blaze in the Northern Sky was, but it's still perfect, and you can take that to the blood bank and cash it.\n\nHighlights: no Van Helsings in sight, kill at will and bleed to feed.\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nFrom the look of the cover art alone, Under a Funeral Moon would appear to be a redundancy after the game changing sophomore effort A Blaze in the Northern Sky, but skim below the surface imagery into the music itself, and you will find that there is a subtle transfer here from that more heavily Celtic Frost-influenced album into a fuzzed out wall of high-speed riffing. Other slight differences are that Culto uses a higher pitched snarl than his dark barking of the previous album, and bassist Dag Nilsen had left the band after recording his tracks for A Blaze, thus those duties are handled here by N.C. Furthermore, this was the final Darkthrone album to involve Zephyrous on the guitar (assuming you don't include the later release of Goatlord), so it also marks the end of an era, after which the band would consolidate into the duo we have come to recognize for more than a decade hence.\n\n\"Natassja in Eternal Sleep\" initiates the album on somewhat of a somber note, a stream of excellent, quirky, jangling guitar notes ring off into a stellar nightscape, picking up steam before the minute mark to a depressive string of chords above which Nocturno's vocals appear as hammering apparitions, frozen into the sky after each syllable parts. The track really alternates between these two riffs, a bass steadily plodding below, and it seems to end rather abruptly before the thrusting abysmal bliss of \"Summer of the Diabolical Holocaust\" rages forth. This song is perhaps one of the best of the album, an unapologetic onslaught that sacrifices nothing in its momentum, a primal channeling of energy and despair, which journeys through a series of hooks that are both barbaric and introspective, before settling into a slow, crashing rhythm more akin to much of the material on the prior album. \"The Dance of Eternal Shadows\" continues this pattern, with a dominant, trudging opening riff which sounds like any band could write it in 30 seconds, and yet in the hands of Darkthrone, it seems like an otherworldly revelation, before the pace is increased with barrage of sombering chords much like the first two tracks.\n\n'Lover of all - Face the apocalypse\nYou fade away under the black rain\nand flowers remain'\n\n\"Unholy Black Metal\" erupts immediately with a pair of repetitive chords that transform into a hammering change-up rhythm before the eventual shift into another, extremly simple riff, glazed in wailing, sporadic lead guitar abandon for a few seconds, before cycling back through the first two sections. Once again, this is the type of track that any musicians with amps and a drum kit could probably write in the blink of an eye, yet the adherence to the basics has never hurt Darkthrone. In their capable imaginations (and hands), they mutate shit into diamonds and the very atmosphere of the damned thing more than compensates for any lack of technicality. \"To Walk the Infernal Fields\" moves at a pensive crawl, with more of the band's obvious worship of Celtic Frost and Bathory, but there are delights awaiting within, like the war metal rhythm march at 3:30 and the further deceleration into a grim miasma of chords and rumbling noise that stretches across the blackness of the heavens.\n\nThe title track is another of the album's strongest, though there is hardly a track I would call 'weak'. Starts off simply enough, with more of the band's pummeling mid-paced lock-step rhythm, but becomes more distinct at :40 when it shifts tracks into a penetrating, vile speed lick like something Slayer might conceive when drunk. There is also a killer, muddy doom bridge, huge chords churning below the stagnant waters while a noisy lead erupts like a swarm of mosquitos, Nocturno crashing forward with his howls of pain. \"Inn I De Dype Skogers Favn\" spends almost 2 minutes grinding out the same, almost too simplistic rhythm, before a shift into another riff that you feel you've already heard on the album several times. I would never call the song bad, but its clearly the worst of the lot here and the prime reason I don't count this as flawless as its closest siblings. Thankfully, the closing track \"Crossing the Triangle of Flames\" comes around full circle to excellence, with big hooks that cavort through the escalating emptiness of widening ichor that Zephyrous and N.C. create through their callous riffing. The charging riff around :50 is the kind of brilliant, primal beauty this band has written the book on, and the turbulent, doomed nightmare later in the song sounds like drowning in quicksand, grasping for that last branch just beyond your reach, before the final tolling bells.\n\nTrying to choose favorites among the vaunted pantheon of Darkthrone albums is simply a matter of apples and oranges, and I tend towards those that struck me the most when they first arrived. A Blaze in the Northern Sky had the advantage of taking me completely by surprise, and I worship each of its six tracks wherever I can find privacy, sanctum and sacrificial implements. Under a Funeral Moon did not have the same impact simply because I was expecting it, and I don't feel the raw strength of the band holds up quite as strongly through the entire playtime. \"Inn I De Dype Skogers Favn\" lags behind the rest just enough that I wish it had another riff in there to really round out the sum. As far as influence, this was certainly just as important as A Blaze or Transilvanian Hunger, and several other Darkthrone fans I know venerate this above all, and I cannot fault them for it. Certainly Under a Funeral Moon is essential listening for the Norse black metal fan, and really, ANY black metal fan should probably have a copy of this on hand in their vinyl bins or CD rack.\n\nHighlights: Natassja in Eternal Sleep, Summer of the Diabolical Holocaust, Under a Funeral Moon, To Walk the Infernal Fields, Crossing the Triangle of Flames\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nIt's astonishing how something which once seemed so horrific, ugly, and niche at the time of its conception has transformed the musical landscape of its parent genre for decades, and yet that is exactly what A Blaze in the Northern Sky has accomplished. Initiating the transformation of four young Norsemen from a great death metal band into one of the flagships of the emerging black metal scene, and one of the very best that genre has and will likely ever have to offer, the album is 42 minutes of everything this style should represent, in its purest form. While previously the phrase 'black metal' was still known best at the Venom title, it was the year of 1992 in which A Blaze in the Northern Sky, Diabolical Fullmoon Mysticism and Burzum would start a fire that would burn well beyond their control, capitalizing on the direction that a few artists (like Mayhem) had already been kindling for a few years from the roots of occult metal acts like Mercyful Fate, Bathory, Hellhammer, Possessed, Slayer, and so on.\n\nOf the three, it is Darkthrone's sophomore effort which stands out to me as the figurehead for the endless thousands of cult black metal acts to follow, as it stood against just about everything that was 'important' to metal music in the early 90s. After the thrash and speed metal genres had evolved from rugged, blasphemous onslaughts to works of technical virtuosity, death metal was manifest as its more extreme younger sibling, with bands signing endorsement deals and writing complex material to impress an increasing demand for aggression. Darkthrone were themselves a death metal band, but not in that way, edging more towards the dark themes and grim vibes of that genre's roots. In 1992, upon the release of A Blaze in the Northern Sky, that changed...I would have loved to have seen the look on the Peaceville Records execs' faces when they first listened to it (though they have no doubt turned a pretty penny with it since).\n\nThe reason being: this album goes against just about all common sense for a metal band during those years. Where most are veering into more difficult compositions, and cleaner, modern studio sounds, Darkthrone are breaking down the thrash and death metal influence to a raw fundamental. Instead of simply using lyrics as implications for the themes of occultism and the cruelty of the natural world and of Man, they were conjuring music which actually FELT cold, FELT hostile, FELT like you haven't got a sliver of goddamn hope, an endless winter closing about you like a noose. Today, it might seem like old hat to most, an album like this. But when it released, individuals had a difficult time trying to determine whether or not this was even music. And yet it was. For at the heart of Darkthrone's sound is a very loyal adherence to the aim of their forebears...the plodding murk of Hellhammer/Celtic Frost, the savage and viral raw thrashing of Bathory or Onslaught, and frenzied speed of Slayer and the more extreme current of early death metal acts from both sides of the Atlantic.\n\nBut the packaging of this core aesthetic was truly something to behold for the virgin listener. Raw guitar tones which sound like poorly recorded rehearsals, a harsh barking vocal range that few were working with by this point, far more throaty than the guttural death that had been scaring mothers and Church officials by 1992, and a sound like it was recorded in a barn, or a shack in some cold forest that people had long forgotten. In short, it's life affirming, albeit in a negative light that makes nihilism seem like a warm night spend cuddling with your honey by the hearth. This unlikely little slab of icy, ripping sinew paved a road of ill intentions, with every branching path a descent into the deepest hell of possibility. Fenriz claims the album was 'rushed' to press for their Peaceville contract, so it may even be something of an accident that the album evokes such a loose, amateur endearment, but in my opinion, that's the best kind of accident...ever. Other bands may have grown over time into the 'face' or 'voice' of the black metal movement, but this album is its heart and soul.\n\nOf should I say, heartlessness? And soullessness?\n\nAs if this album could have gotten any less accessible, the fearsome quartet (yes, same lineup as Soulside Journey) decided to open it with over 10 minutes of the \"Kathaarian Life Code\". Swelling black ambiance and ritual vocals are fused with a gremlin-like, choking narrator before the blast beat surges forward at around 1:20, walls of hissing chords bristle like a storm of razor ice blanketing the surrounding earth for miles. At 2:00, it breaks into a slower, driving rock beat alongside a reverbrous death metal speed picked rhythm, then blasting forward again to a sick breakdown after 3:00 which was the heaviest fucking thing I had heard in years (and I had heard Pestilence and Obituary before this band). Everywhere, the clashing drums and fuzz of the guitars breed natural atmosphere, while the distorted bass weaves through, carving out the hearts of men. Oh yes, this is heavy, but it is beautifully goddamn vile, even as the vocals return later to spew a vomit-like pattern of groans and grunts which sound like Tom G. Warrior if he were choking on a turkey dinner. \"In the Shadow of the Horns\" shows a far stronger leaning towards the Celtic Frost influence, even with the 'hey' vocal to kick off the grooving, molasses guitar rhythm, still swelling with the cutting fuzz tone. The chugging of the bridge will also remind a little of Sabbath, or early Paradise Lost, and the melodic black charge around 4:30 feels like a tortured release from the confines of the oozing blackness, while Nocturno Culto's vocals howl the eternal mantras:\n\n'In the Shadow of the Horns only seen by the Kings\nof the Dawn (of the) First Millennium upon the Thrones!\nIn the Shadow of the Horns\nCleansed like the air in the Night\nWorld Without End!'\n\nYeah, grab the nearest dictionary, flip to the term 'epic' and scribble the Darkthrone logo over the previous definition of the word. \"Paragon Belial\" carries forward with a steady, warrior rhythm, very simple and effective chords serving as the counter ballast to the godawful, fearsome fucking vokills. The track descends into chaos after 1:00, a discordant, jangling line under which the double bass begins to roll, like a dance across skulls in a passionate netherworld night. Stick clicks, raw echoes, the band leaves just about everything right on the fucking disc, to give you the impression that you're actually present at a jam session of ghosts, witches and demon worshipping necrophiles. To anti-Christen \"Where Cold Winds Blow\", Culto belches forth a vocal line that seriously sounds like a man who just had his throat torn out by a bear, and the riffs of this track scream with a grinding, hardcore chaos into another raw as fuck break at around 1:20, into which the wind howls like an ayrie of fallen angels. Fast, messy, and second to none.\n\n\"A Blaze in the Northern Sky\" itself is the shortest piece on the album, under 5 minutes, but home to no less sheer vitriol than any of its lengthier siblings. The savage guitar rhythm emits a very subtle shift in tone and atmosphere, and again the band sounds more like an actual hellish wind or unnatural force than a group of guys recording a record. As they break into another of their fabled slower rhythms, a frosted mirror of majesty is summoned forth, each attempt to glean one of its secrets like prying a ring from a stiff, frozen corpse, ancient eyes agape in terror from the heresy it witnessed before its passing. At around 3:00 the band goes all rock and roll, and it's excellent fun (skip ahead almost 20 years, and this spirit still remains in their sound), before they return to the doomed weaving of the burgeoning chords. \"The Pagan Winter\" sounds like one of their Soulside Journey tracks put through a filter of blackness, unnerving melodies and sodden dis-chord, and if you can't appreciate the powerful, dark majesty of the riff sequence at 1:30, well then, you simply do not belong in Hell. So don't let the pitchfork prick you in the ass on the way out!\n\nEverything about this album is iconic...not only is the music as fresh today as it was in 1992, but the grim and minimal cover artwork is unforgettable, a barely discerned darkness against which guitarist Zephyrous leers in his corpse paint like a vampire closing on the kill. The band's lyrics have always been among the best in black metal, forays into their native tongue and grammatical inconsistencies excused for the exquisite agonies painted through the words. If someone not in the know were to simply ask me one day, \"What is black metal?\" I would sit them down and slide this CD across the desk to them.\n\nI really hate the cliche, as it always implies some sense of superior/inferiority relationship, but this is one of those real cases where you either 'get it' or you don't, folks. If you do get it, congratulations. You have the eyes to see. The ears to hear. Your heart toils and bleeds black, and you will probably die a pitiful death, alone in a world of strangers that could not understand the dark pleasures you found discovered just below the surface of the night. This is the best black metal album that God ever turned his fat cheeks upon, spitting more filth than a thousand snakes in a thousand gardens, and drawing more messianic blood than a Roman legion of hammers, nails and crucifixes. This is where it begins and ends, choir. Every single black metal album must be judged against it, and thus far, none have exceeded its ghastly charms and molested dreams (and when they come close, they usually bear the name Darkthrone on their psychotic sleeves).\n\nHighlights: every fucking second. And for fuck's sake, if you are not listening to this with the speakers or headphones cranked up, you are doing it wrong!\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nOne of the coolest things about Darkthrone is that they're not just one legendary band...they are actually two legendary bands. One of those is the Helen of Troy of black metal music, a pioneering force which would launch the careers of several thousand impersonators, dancing about their newsprint-colored album covers with swords, candelabras and woodland shadows as company, all ghouled up with nowhere to turn except to your stereo and shriveled heart. The other is the band that started off a fairly dimwitted, primal death/doom metal entity and then crowned that phase off with this excellent death metal debut album (there was a second Darkthrone album to delve into this region stylistically, but it wouldn't be released for years, when vocals were finally added to the material; this is due in part to the band's shift in direction). One of these legends has vastly outnumbered and outpowered the other, and to be fair, Soulside Journey is not nearly as strong as most of the band's massive body of black metal material, but how many other bands have made the shift and not only survived, but prospered with it? I can think of some who went the other way around, but not many that would succeed at this.\n\nBut we're not here to talk about all that, we are here to discuss the culmination of Darkthrone's death metal career, the album recorded for 1990 but released a year later through Peaceville Records, who were developing quite a dark roster for the time (Paradise Lost, My Dying Bride, and so forth). This debut fits in only too well with those other acts, because for all its grinding, ebon impulse, there is still an edge of melancholic doom which pervades the material. If I had to compare this directly to another album, it would be Entombed's masterpiece Left Hand Path, but you can definitely hear a little Florida influence (old Death, i.e. good Death), a smidgeon of Lost Paradise, and of course a host of the band's early black/thrash influences like Hellhammer, Slayer, Possessed, and so forth.\n\nEverything about this album simply oozes with cool, the kind of maturity I expect whenever I go into a death metal album today, even though this brand of very honest, primal brutality has been largely replaced by the interests of progression and technicality. Even the fucking cover art is amazing...who could ever forget the image of that vast machine with the shadowy figures beneath it, one of the greatest album images ever for this or any genre. These were also the days before Darkthrone got whittled down to a two piece, so Ted Skjellum (who would become Nocturno Culto) and Hank Amarillo (Fenriz in one of his early pranks) are joined here by Dag Nilsen (bass) and Ivar Enger (Zephyrous, guitar), and strangely enough, Soulside Journey could be accused of being their most 'professional' sounding record, with a solid production that could compete (and defeat) most other death metal in 1991.\n\nA lot of these tracks are not new to the album, having appeared on one of the band's four demos, but in every case, with NO exceptions, these are the best versions by far, due to the superior, crushing sound. \"Cromlech\" mixes a little of the old school Paradise Lost gothic/death/doom atmosphere into a faster paced rhythm akin to old Entombed. \"Sunrise Over Locus Mortis\" creeps like a tarantella, then at 1:00 it builds into a riff not unlike something you'd hear on Death's Leprosy. \"Soulside Journey\" itself is another mid-paced, grooving death that also slows into a somber, doomed sequence, while \"Accumulation of Generalization\" begins with a popping bass curl repeated by the guitars into a crushing sequence of death and doom that far exceeds its prior incarnation on the Cromlech demo from a few years past. The vocal effects here are entirely freakish, and the riffs dynamite on plastic.\n\n\"Neptune Towers\", which coincidentally would also become the name of Fenriz' fantastic dark ambient project in future years, is another glorious epoch of mesmerizing doom, laden in simplistic riffs that carry forth the oblique tide of the album, chords alternate with speed picked notes and an eventually incline into low, grooving mutes and more of the monolith sculpting dreariness. \"Semipternal Sepulchrality\" follows with some of the best use of chords and melodies, and one of the most classic riffs on the album at about :20 seconds in. This is a beautiful thing, a triumph of grim old death with a barely pronouncable title (the song titles were a lot smarter than some of the lyrics on this album). \"Grave With a View\" is more resonant doom, with nice choral synths layered into the opening chords, abandoning all hope as the listener begins to rot and roll in the sepulchre. \"Iconoclasm Sweeps Cappadocia\" features one of the better, fast rhythms of Soulside Journey, epic and sweeping melodic death that eventually breaks down into another moment of stunning, cryptic doom.\n\n'Crush not only our surrounding walls of curiosity,\nbut also the hordes of blind believers.'\n\n\"Nor the Silent Whispers\" has a lazy, rocking death rhythm to it which winds into the double bass rolling, and the 2nd, Death-like rhythm is decent, but this is not one of my favorites on the album. Nor is \"The Watchtower\", which has a few dull riffs in it that do not inspire nearly as much as the rest of the material here. The final track, \"Eon\" from the Thulcandra demo, is a solid execution of hope drowning, with another of those lazy beats, but this time it picks up into a decent gravestone flow with some quirky, eerie female choir synths for effect (I love it when old death bands would do stuff like this, access Morbid Angel's \"Chapel of Ghouls\" for perhaps the best example). And thus ends the 41+ minutes of the pivotal debut of Darkthrone, surely a trip into the soul searching, pseudo-intellect and imminent doom and despair implied by the cover image and the consistently evil sheen to the riffs.\n\nSoulside Journey isn't perfect, there are a few songs I don't often feel compelled to visit and even beyond that, some of the riffs on other tracks do begin to feel repetitive, and not in the hypnotic way that would become characteristic of a lot of their later, black metal albums. But in a year like 1991, which was actually a lot thinner than you'd expect for quality output, this was a welcome voyage into despair which made almost anything else that year seem happy by comparison (excepting Paradise Lost, Root, and maybe the more rockin' but similar Entombed). This is certainly deserving of its cult status as far as Scandinavian death metal, and it still sounds excellent after almost 20 years have passed, but your enjoyment may be limited if you only care for the band's black metal material. And I know that I, personally, and probably most of the world, was not expecting what would follow this...\n\nHighlights: Cromlech, Sunrise Over Locus Mortis, Neptune Towers, Sempiternal Sepulchrality\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nApart from the band's albums, there is only one mandatory purchase in the Darkthrone discography, and that is 2008's Frostland Tapes, a reproduction of the band's first four demos in their original form, plus a wealth of other material. For years, you had to trade these demos over the web, before that simply tape swapping, but it's excellent to finally have them all in one swank package. And it's a far superior product to the Prepare for War compilation, with the exception of the DVD included in that. Had Fenriz and company simply included that DVD with the Frostland Tapes, and perhaps some of their EP/single 'b-sides' and covers, you would have the perfect bargain, the complete fan collection. Alas, this is at least good enough on its own.\n\nDisc 1 takes it from the top with the title track of the 1988 Land of Frost demo, a rugged and barbaric tune with some elements of death and doom, so disgusting with its echoing vocals, sludgy chords and fuzzy, inept melodies that it seems like some psychedelic house band of fallen angels covering their master's favorite Hellhammer, after listening to too much Iron Butterfly. \"Winds of Triton\" is another bludgeon of punkish death metal, complete with bombing bass and chords that feel somewhat out of tune. \"Forest of Darkness\" reminds me of the Riverbottom Nightmare Band from Emmett Otter's Jugband Christmas, it's so raunchy and slamming brutal simplicity. This first demo is rounded out by the sludge and despair of \"Odyssey of Freedom\" and the chugging march \"Day of the Dead\". A New Dimension is simply a sampled intro piece (\"Twilight Dimension\") which runs into the 9 minute instrumental rehearsal \"Snowfall\", and then it's on to the Thulcandra demo (1989) with its three tracks \"Eon\", \"Thulcandra\" and \"Archipelago\", each of which displays a steady progression from the cruder material on the early demos and the writing that would dominate their debut Soulside Journey. The first closes with the primal, vile \"Soria Moria\", which picks up into a pretty intense speed for Darkthrone.\n\nDisc 2 continues with the entirety of the Cromlech demo, which is once again a step forward in the band's sound, very close to the debut in menace and attitude, and retaining the Hellhammer influence, though more underground death from Europe and the US is creeping into the sound (some Death, Slayer, Possessed, and so forth). \"The Watchtower\" is a deep, dark grinder, and \"Accumulation of Generalization\" and \"Sempiternal Past/Presence View Sepulchrality\" remind me quite a lot of something from Scream Bloody Gore. After the end of the fourth demo, \"Iconoclasm Sweeps Cappadocia\", we are treated to some rare live tape from Denmark in 1990, with the band playing a lot of material from their demos/debut: \"Cromlech\", \"Sunrise Over Locus Mortis\", \"Soulside Journey\", \"Accumulization of Generalization\", \"Sempiternal Past/Presence View Sepulchrality\", \"Iconoclasm Sweeps Cappadocia\", and the end being \"Neptune Towers\". This set actually sounds quite good, reverbrous vocals and a good raw burn to the distortion, and if you were there, well, let's just say you were lucky.\n\nDisc 3 is yet another huge bonus, as it features the entire instrumental set of the band's scrapped 2nd album, which later was released as Goatlord in 1996 with the added vocals. I will take a pass on reviewing this here track by track, as I'd prefer to review the finished version, but it's quite cool to hear where the band would have been headed had they not chosen a different path through the darkness. I am of course referring to the fact that with their 2nd album, they transformed into one of the first and most formative acts in the genre we now know fluently as black metal. So this must come with a warning: if you are expecting Darkthrone the black metal band, and don't care for the style of their debut album, you probably don't need this release, since the material is largely confined to their original style, and extremely crude even by the late 80s standard of death metal.\n\nI really enjoyed this package, as it meant I could scratch all those copied versions of the demos that I'd had kicking around, but it's certainly far from what they are writing today in terms of the lyrics and the riffing. If you're a completist, or a fan of Soulside Journey, then it's well worth the money.\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nDarkthrone must have enjoyed the results of the Too Old, Too Cold EP from the previous year, because as that release was to The Cult is Alive, so is the NWOBHM (New Wave of Black Heavy Metal) EP to 2007's F.O.A.D. (Fuck Off and Die), which released about 2 months after this became available. As such, there is a lot of material on this EP which has since become redundant, but for the diehard fan who buys anything this band will ever release, it isn't the least value I've seen from them.\n\nThere are two tracks here which come from the full-length F.O.A.D., but each is offered with a slight variation. \"Wisdom of the Dead\" is a great, creeping track which would seem to tout the party line here, that is to say it's pure old school Darkthrone given a classic metal injection, the Style of the Isle, as I like to put it, simultaneously breeding nostalgia for both the original NWOBHM and the dark vistas of this duo's storied past. There is an understated feel to the song which I really appreciate, in particular the moody bridge riff which conjures the mystique of the title. Kind of mellow for Darkthrone, but also captivating. \"Canadian Metal\" is fun as fuck, one of the better tracks from F.O.A.D. that channels punk fuel as it offers libations to the great obscure bands of North, North America through some simple name-dropping of song titles. The mere mention of \"Take This Torch\" in the lyrics had me fawning with admiration, but the riffs themselves are fucking crushing, especially when it hits the chorus. The difference between this and the album version is simply the vocals, but both are highly effective.\n\nThe non-album track \"Hedninger Fra Helvete\" might be the biggest draw on this recording, a cool mid-paced track with vocals in Norwegian which stylistically follows \"Wisdom of the Dead\", a mellowing track seared in great classic metal guitar tone with a great, cult Darkthrone bridge over the galloping drums after 2:00, and a somber break after 3:00 dowsed in an almost psychedelic, vibrant atmosphere. The last track is a repressing of the \"Bad Attitude\" cover from New York's Testors, which we already heard on the band's limited 7\" Forebyggende Krig. Since this EP has more value than that, it allows you to skip it altogether, rendering that release even more useless.\n\nThis EP presents me a bit of a poser, because I really love \"Hedninger Fra Helvete\", but the rest of the tracks are available elsewhere in a form just as good as they appear here. If you're going to pick up any version, I would advise you hunt down the CD, because the 7\" NWOBHM only has two tracks: \"Hedninger Fra Helvete\" and \"Canadian Metal\", good but just not worth it when you can get the CD of this and take the complete pass on Forebyggende Krig.\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nForebyggende Krig was a 7\" EP released in a very short quantity, which you had to pick up online, and it's another of the more worthless turds festering in the Darkthrone backlog. The title track was already available on The Cult is Alive, so that leaves us with only a single track of note, a cover of \"Bad Attitude\" from the New York punk outfit the Testors, which is under 2 minutes of music for your consumption. It's not as if this thing was expensive, and most people simply downloaded it elsewhere, but this is the type of release I just can't feel myself get behind. Why even label it as a 'release' at all? Just toss the track on a tribute compilation, or as a bonus track to an album, or offer the song completely free for fun.\n\nAt any rate, \"Forebyggende Krig\" is a solid anthem which was the final track on The Cult is Alive, a big, bludgeoning groove that ended in a slew of bluesy solo licks and had a wonderful slaughter house vibe to Nocturno Culto's vocals. The album brings back a lot of memory for their first few albums, a little edge of doom/death to the proceedings, but it's a little tighter and cleaner as well. I am not very familiar with the Testors, perhaps that makes me a fake punk, and not a hiking one, but though I like the Darkthrone cover with Fenriz' hilarious clean vocals, the chords are your pretty basic progression which must have seemed commonplace if you were into the Ramones, Fear, The Damned, Misfits, or other great punk of the late 70s/80s.\n\nPerhaps one day Darkthrone will clean house and just release a compilation of every cover they've recorded, with a bunch of new ones for extra value. That is something I would spend money on, but at under 2 minutes of exclusive material, this is nothing more than a promotional snippet with the cover tossed on.\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nReleased just over a month before Darkthrone's 12th full-length The Cult is Alive, the Too Old, Too Cold EP served as a satisfying teaser for the short span of weeks that led to that album's release. 75% of the material here is unique to the EP, if you count the alternate version of \"Graveyard Slut\", and while I tend to rue the shortplay format (in particular the single), there is enough value here that you should grab it if you are a fan and have a few bucks to spare; it was available as both a CD release and a limited 12\" vinyl. One thing that strikes me about the material here is that it truly marks the band's evolution into a self-identifying mockery of trends and stupidity that had overtaken the black metal 'industry' by this point, with bands exploring all avenues of hybridization, fashion, and accessibility, while every one with a guitar, a basic computer set-up and a copy of Transilvanian Hunger had already been churning out homemade black metal recordings for years.\n\nAnd thus begins the 'punk' phase of Darkthrone, which is still filthy, rotten to the core, and entirely loyal to their formative aesthetics, it simply rocks a little harder and makes you want to impale someone on your wrist spikes. The lyrics to \"Too Old, Too Cold\" are hilariously lowbrow and I might even say awkwardly awesome, but the song is oodles of fun, with a few huge black/rock riffs and a good old bendy, doomish traipse into the bridge section which is vintage early 90s 'throne. \"High On Cold War\" is the best exclusive offering on the EP, a raging black/punk piece with infernal Hellhammer grooves and a guest vocal spot from none other than Grutle Kjellson of Enslaved. What more could you ask for? I've often ruminated on just how cool an Enslaved/Darkthrone collaboration would be as a permanent fixture, and this is but a sampling, as Grutle's voice perfectly compliments the style. This track totally inspired me to start kicking things, as there were no politicians or religious figures about I had to settle for a brick wall.\n\nThe next track was completely unexpected, a rousing and filthy adaptation of Siouxsie & the Banshees' \"Love in a Void\", which had me slapping my knees it is so great. The vocals are a riot, yet strangely enough they feel completely compelling and loyal, and I like to imagine Siouxsie Sioux listening to this and enjoying it as much as any Darkthrone fan. Though the version of \"Graveyard Slut\" present on the EP is tagged as different than found on the LP, it's really not, aside from the vocals, which are far more blackish here than the Tom G. Warrior style used on the full-length. At any rate, this is a great song, dirty and smutty and dripping with underground credibility, one of the best on The Cult is Alive, so alongside \"Too Old, Too Cold\" it was enough to get the heart racing in anticipation.\n\nI personally think this is worth having, at least for the cover tune and the Grutle Kjellson appearance on \"High On Cold War\", but the value is not extremely high, especially with the album to come rendering two of the tracks redundant. If there ever were a re-release of The Cult is Alive with the two unique tunes as bonus tracks, I'd advise you to pick that up instead.\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nOf the many Darkthrone releases out there, the Japanese release Under Beskyt'telse av Morke is likely the least valuable. Not to collectors, as the CD and 12\" vinyl were released in a very limited pressing (the CD was 666 copies) with a bunch of bonus material, like stickers, badges, postcards, and a toy (as Japanese are won to do with their omake boxes). But to the average listener, there really isn't that much on offer here, simply a trio of outtakes from 1992's Under a Funeral Moon rehearsals. I may be a huge fan of this band, but not to the level at which Fenriz could spit in a handkerchief and I would buy it on eBay for $100. And Under Beskyt'telse av Morke is a creamy, wopping wad of spittle, with perhaps one exception.\n\n\"Unholy Black Metal\" and \"Under a Funeral Moon\" are both decently bloodied rehearsal pieces, and yet, they aren't nearly as vibrant and raw as the versions from the full-length, which buzz with misanthropic evil and crypt stench. The vocals for the latter are quite good, with the proper amount of vitriol that blends straight into the burgeoning guitar rhythm, the excellent half Hellhammer and half Slayer-tribute that it is, but even then, I prefer the album cut. Also...that squeal! Aaaaaagh. No, perhaps the only piece of questionable value on this release is the instrumental take on \"Crossing the Triangle of Flames\", which might have resonated with the 1-2 fans in Japan who actually wanted to use this at a karaoke, scaring off all their friends and certainly their dates for the evening. And if not scaring off that date, he or she is a keeper! I obviously prefer to have my vocals here, but I can see using this as a battle theme for a 1st edition Dungeons & Dragons game where the players are all forced to wear corduroy pants and tight t-shirts with faded prints from 25-30 years ago.\n\nAnd yet I digress, because there is nothing else to do with this EP but digress. It's a niche release for a very niche audience who will buy anything with the band's logo printed on it, and exactly the type of waste of plastic and print and resource that I am loathe to permit as I've become awakened to the benefits of digital media and less overall garbage in the universe (about as hippy as I get, don't worry). I'm guessing most people are not among the privileged few to own this, and thus have downloaded it for themselves, which is a better alternative if you are seeking to karaoke with utmost grimness.\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nIt's only fair up front to admit that, if we are judging by consistent quality and full body of work, Darkthrone is by far my favorite black metal band in the world. Not only this, but I feel they are the most influential as well. Burzum, Slayer, Hellhammer/Celtic Frost, Mayhem, Mercyful Fate, Venom and Bathory are also major direct influences on the many thousands of bands to spawn since, and important ones, but the overwhelming majority of cult underground or 'bedroom' bands, even to an extent the entire depressive scene, owes a lot to the Norwegian duo (who themselves carry the influence of several on that list). Not only this, but Darkthrone have an uncanny knack of subtly re-inventing themselves throughout their discography, without ever making a tasteless choice in direction. The band have had their critics through the years; as with any cult fanbase, a sect of stubborn young (old by now) men that, in their audio xenophobia, refuse to embrace any subtle shift in tone or style, expecting the power of their own nostalgia to convince a band to release the same, identical album forever, but in my opinion, Darkthrone have trumped all takers, as there is not a single album in their history which I don't at least consider to be great.\n\nSo, you could call me a fanboy. I really can't help it; this band represents every quality I love in musical disposition and follow through. Fuck trends, fuck narcissistic rock stardom, fuck scenes, and fuck you. This is BLACK METAL. It is not intended for corporate sponsors, groupies, fashionistas, motion pictures, cartoons, or any form of mass appeal madness. It is not intended for happiness. It is the polar opposite of brainwashing, mindnumbing feces like Lady Gaga, Avenged Sevenfold or Killswitch Engage. It caters to the few, the individual, and the listener with the rare ability to transcend the surface, to shuck the superficiality of the music industry and even to an extent, the entire shallow 'metal' image. A little hard to believe, perhaps, since people believe fire breathing, leather and spikes are all synonymous with metal, and as stage effects, they have been. But most great metal acts have a lot more to say than just to play to some fucking lightshow, and as situationally self-aware and oft comedic as they have become, Darkthrone is one such legend.\n\nAll legends deserve tribute, but I was honestly pretty surprised by the decision to release a compilation album. I'm not sure if it was more Peaceville's idea or Darkthrone's. Judging by the classy, honest presentation, both must have had an involvement here. But let's back up a second. There are TWO versions of Preparing for War, one released in 2000 which only features a single disc, and an expanded, limited release in 2005 which features two discs and a bonus DVD. You DO NOT WANT the 2000 edition. Trust me, if you can find the later version, it is worth the extra money you might pay, because there is more material offered and thus the inherent value is superior. I am not a fan of compilations, in particular collections of previously released material, and I can only imagine any Darkthrone fan worth his salt would already own the actual albums, since it's an underground privilege! At best, they will offer a lot of hard to find, rare material, b-sides, demos, and the like. The special 2005 edition of Preparing for War does exactly this, but you do have to wade through a bunch of redundant album tracks to get there.\n\nDisc 1 consists of 15 tracks (the original Preparing for War release), which collect tracks from the first four albums of the band, including Soulside Journey, which is represented here by \"Grave With a View\", \"Cromlech\" and \"Iconoclasm Sweeps Cappadocia\". \"The Pagan Winter\" and \"In the Shadow of the Horns\" from A Blaze in the Northern Sky are present, as are \"Natassja in Eternal Sleep\" and the title track of Under a Funeral Moon. Transilvanian Hunger gets three offerings: the title track, \"I En Hall Med Flesk Og Mj\u00f8d\", and \"Skald Av Satans Sol\". All good choices, but you've already heard them... Far more interesting would be the inclusion of \"Snowfall\" from the New Dimension demo (1988), a 9+ minute instrumental composed of doom, death and thrash/crossover rhythms over Gylve's drumming. It's essentially a rehearsal track, so one cannot expect much in terms of sound, yet it does develop some decent melodies and it's not bad for background noise. \"Archipelago\" from the 1989 Thulcandra demo is also present, a raw death metal track with a heavy Hellhammer and Slayer influence, and wild vocals that range from great grunts to the off resonant, silly snarl. Another treat is the inclusion of some live material from one of the band's only appearances in Oslo, 1989. The band performs \"Eon/Thulcandra\" and \"Soria Moria\", and I'd be lying if I said that hearing these did not make me jealous that I simply couldn't have been there (in my defense, I was a doe-eyed 14 year old who had yet to even heard of the band). There is another live rendition of \"Neptune Towers\" here which rounds out the disc, and this is pretty fucking excellent and the best thing on it.\n\nDisc 2 makes the package all the more worthwhile if you don't already have access to the band's demos, though the later Frostland Tapes compilation has a more orderly, completist approach to this. Most of the 13 tracks here are demos/rehearsals of material from the first three albums, including some good and raw versions of \"Under a Funeral Moon\", \"Summer of the Diabolical Holocaust\", \"Kathaarian Life Code\", \"Where Cold Winds Blow\", and so forth. Once again, everything here is redundant if you've got the studio albums, and there is no version here that I might place above its album counterpart, but at least it's not 100% riff for riff the same. The DVD (Disc 3) is probably the most worthwhile of the three, because it catalogues the band's rare lives, from their Oslo TV spot in 1989, to their Riihimaki Finland 1991 set, Lahti Finland 1991 set, and Oslo in 1996. Most of us are never going to see this band live, ever, which in a way I find satisfying...because it's pretty much as anti 'rawk stah' as it gets. But if you wanted to, you could always witness them in the early days with this. There are also some additional interviews and a photo gallery on the DVD.\n\nPreparing for War is really only worth it for hardcore fans of the band, and even then I would absolutely not recommend that you waste money on the original 2000 edition. You can get all the thrills of this material on the respective albums (and demos), but the DVD represents most of the value in this package. If you just want all the demos in their pure form, get The Frostland Tapes instead. Otherwise, if you're new to the band, I'd advise you to dig right in with some of their earlier albums, and observe for yourself the slow process by which they evolved into their more recent punk-metal style, from their bleak and beautiful past.\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nOf Darkthrone's seminal works, this is probably the most influential. 'A Blaze In The Northern Sky' has its place, but in the end is very much a blackened take on old Celtic Frost, as does 'Transilvanian Hunger', which is influential but more on the level of aesthetics and presentation than real musical content. 'Under A Funeral Moon', though; you can draw a straight line from this to what we think of as the modern black metal scene. Those haunting, dissonant riffs, pulsing thrash beat drumming, and horrendously rasped vocals are in many ways the very foundation of modern black metal, and although this is perhaps the least spoken of aspect of Darkthrone's unholy trinity, it might just be the most important from a historical perspective.\n\nDespite this, it should come as no surprise that no band REALLY sounds like this album, just as no band REALLY replicates the feeling of 'Filosofem', 'De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas', or 'Pure Holocaust'. Invariably, one thing or another gets lost in translation, but in the end it's the fact of the time period and musical context which makes this what it is. An album like 'Under A Funeral Moon' really couldn't be composed at any other moment in time. It's a stellar product of its environment, and what it lacks in the instant memorability of its immediate predecessor and successor it makes up for with a depth of songwriting possibly unequaled elsewhere in Darkthrone's lengthy catalog of releases.\n\nThe most important elements are some of the most subtle ones. In a lot of ways the overall song structures and riffing styles of this album are prototypes of the sort of thing you'd end up hearing on 'Transilvanian Hunger', but much less overtly melodic and often outright atonal. 'Transilvanian Hunger' had a great deal of repetition among simple riffs, but few of the riffs on that album would drag out individual chords for as long as Darkthrone does on this album, in many ways making this even more hypnotic and droning than the much-lauded sequel album. The atmosphere, also, is singular to this release, with a murky, droning, occult/ritualistic feel that hasn't been replicated anywhere else. The long stretches of droning chords over binary thrash beat drumming and Nocturno Culto's unusually venomous howls make for a listening experience that could be minimally described as compelling.\n\n'A Blaze In The Northern Sky' and 'Transilvanian Hunger' are infinitely more natural-sounding albums than this one. 'Under A Funeral Moon' has a potent sense of wrongness about it, with rhythms frequently lurching in strange, unsettling ways like on the last two tracks. Frequently odd repetitions of riffs will be used; three repetitions of riff A followed by only two of riff B, making for something that feels off-kilter and twisted despite being uniformly in 4/4. The production makes things that much more sinister and deranged, with a strange guitar tone that sounds like three separate, differently EQ'd instruments playing simultaneously grinding across a dry and lifeless percussive set, which is occasionally bolstered by inexplicable, sudden explosions of bass, like the striking of a bass drum with the circumference of Jupiter. Very weird stuff indeed.\n\nIt's understandable why this album often gets shoved aside in conversation in favor of its siblings; this is not an easy listen. Apart from the pseudo-throwaway track 'Unholy Black Metal', the songs on this album are challenging, frightening, and bizarre slabs of genuinely occult music. It would be difficult to say whether this or 'Transilvanian Hunger' is my favorite Darkthrone album, but in the end, it's really an apples and oranges sort of situation. If I want something frozen and melodic, the latter reigns supreme, but if I'm looking for something darker and more disturbing, well, here's the answer to that question. Essential.\n",
        "\nIt seems that in recent years this album has made a shift in popular perception from 'that one album Darkthrone did before they were black metal' to 'forgotten oldschool death metal classic'. As usual, the answer is somewhere in between. Suggesting that this is in any way as important or enduring as the following three albums is a pretty massive exercise in historical revisionism that probably isn't worth undertaking, but sweeping it under the rug as many did for a long while is equally misaligned. In the end, 'Soulside Journey' is altogether a solid album that was unfortunately made by Darkthrone; had it been any other death metal band from the same period, this would probably be heralded as a second-tier gem from that era of death metal, but coming from such a legendary band it enjoys a more aggravating reputation.\n\nThis is not really as influential or unique as some would lead you to believe; most of the material on 'Soulside Journey' falls pretty neatly in line with material that other Swedish death metal bands were turning out at around the same time. Most of the lauded atmospheric and melodic touches were done elsewhere; a lot of the melodies owe plenty to Dismember (though the bulk of the riffing style is more along the lines of Entombed or maybe a bit of Morbid Angel), and the keyboards are hardly unprecedented even in death metal with Nocturnus coming into their own just a bit before this release. Now with all that out of the way, we are still left with a pretty engaging and enjoyable death metal album with just enough prog touches to keep things interesting and a solid sense of pacing preventing anything from getting too still.\n\nThe quality of this album probably owes more than a bit of itself to the production, which is cold, somewhat thin, and not entirely dissimilar to the band's later black metal works. The cover art is a pretty good representation of the album as a whole: frosty and somewhat mechanical. The riffing on this album is rather tremolo-dominated apart from occasional forays into doomier or thrashier territory now and then, and they have that moderately memorable but still fairly atonal quality that a lot of Swedish death metal bands had in spades. It's relatively technical music; the bass is about as good as everyone says and drums are rather notably musical, though the riffs are pretty typical single-string tremolo affairs for the most part minus the solos.\n\nI think the biggest thing that hampers this album is a sort of undefined personality; there are seeds of something more precise here with its regular forays into less traditionally death metal territory, but they're in a very fetal stage, and I almost get the impression that the initial idea for this album is fairly different from how it eventually turned out. This isn't to say it's bad; 'Soulside Journey' is eminently listenable and very enjoyable, a great deal moreso I'd say that even certain Swedish superstars like Grave. It is not, however, particularly crucial in the long run and ends up being sort of a historical footnote more than anything.\n\nAfter you've gotten Darkthrone's main three albums and maybe 'Panzerfaust' is when you should investigate this one; on its own it doesn't really tend to mean much without the historical context and the music just seems to carry more weight when juxtaposed with 'A Blaze In The Northern Sky'. It's certainly a good album, just somewhat buried and forgotten in the wake of what would come.\n",
        "\nOf all the Norwegian Second Wave black metal bands, Darkthrone has one of, if not the biggest, discography out there, putting out albums almost each year. The last few of those have taken the band on a unique path, unknown to any of their fellow bands: black metal mixed with punk, all in an unmistakable old-school shell. Although somewhat apparent on albums such as Sardonic Wrath and Hate Them, the punk sound truly became obvious on the subsequent album, The Cult is Alive, and on this, the preceding EP, Too Old Too Cold. \n\nFrom the first few seconds of this EP\u2019s title track it\u2019s obvious what this is going to be: black metal morphed into a rocking, punk-influenced form of music that is so unique to modern Darkthrone. The riffs are rather catchy throughout, driving the music forward and showing Fenriz\u2019s fascination with old thrash, punk and even rock and how he was influenced by said genres during these last few years. Here Fenriz\u2019s drumming has nothing more to do with the droning, repetitive style of Transilvanian Hunger, instead being quite varied and highly reminiscent of 80\u2019s punk and metal, mostly thrash. \n\nHigh on Cold War is much less catchy and a lot harsher than the title track, as well as having vocals by Enslaved\u2019s Grutle, who fits into the music perfectly. It starts off with a weird-sounding guitar solo and then continues as a sort of harsh punk/black metal hybrid song with a rather noisy guitar tone throughout. Like the title track, this is played very fast until around the last minute of the song, when everything slows down to a quasi-doom atmosphere. \n\nThe third track is also the definite highlight on the EP: Love in a Void, a cover of an old British punk rock band from the late 1970s, Siouxsie & the Banshees. The original is pure punk from the band\u2019s early years, complete with female vocals and all. The Darkthrone version is rather different, obviously so from a vocal standpoint (Nocturno Culto may sound like a lot of things, but a woman is not one of them) but also in other respects. The instrumental work is louder and faster but the production\u2019s a bit worse and it sounds, well, a lot more black metal than the original, which really have a 100% punk vibe going on. All in all the cover is significantly different from the original: production, vocals, tempo, drumming, guitars, everything really. That said, the song still rocks pretty damn hard and it\u2019s nice to see Darkthrone covering stuff one wouldn\u2019t expect from a black metal band. \n\nFinally we have Graveyard Slut, here a different version from the one on the album. From the moment I\u2019d heard it I wasn\u2019t terribly impressed with this song\u2019s approach but I must admit, the instrumental work is exemplary, very well played and the riffs are fun to listen to. It\u2019s just the whole yelling of \u201cGraveyard Slut!\u201d with the occasional \u201cGraveyard Bitch!\u201d thrown in for variation which makes this song seem a bit\u2026 too simple, even stupid, although this is new Darkthrone and I guess that it\u2019s meant to be that way. \n\nToo Old Too Cold can be considered the first example of Darkthrone\u2019s new side and as such it\u2019s significant for the band\u2019s history. Additionally, the EP is pretty damn good, fun to listen to, and, for myself at least, an indication that modern Darkthrone is something worth checking out because it rocks. Hard.\n",
        "\nFirst off, I know this is practically blasphemy to say, but this is my least liked Darkthrone album. My reasons are as follows. It is unimaginative, ill-produced, and finally an overall chore to listen to.\n\nI would label this album unimaginative, for no other reason than, unlike the other Darkthrone albums, its riffs are boring and repetitive. We all know that repetition is the essence of Darkthrone, but repetition is only effective when the riffs being repeated are good. The riffs on The Pagan Winter are great, along with Paragon Belial, but the rest of the album lacks this quality. Every song starts in the exact same way, except Kathaarian Life Code, and this gets tiresome quickly. One can definitely tell it is death metal tailored to be black metal, listen to the riffs on The Pagan Winter for proof of this. To me this is cheating in a sense, and is thus unimaginative.\n\nNext, I see this album as ill-produced, not because I can't tolerate raw, but because it has to be at least listenable. This is by no means listenable. Half of the album is just meaningless, begrimed, fuzz. It sounds good as bleak winternoise in the background, but is impossible to analyze beyond that. The production on Under a Funeral Moon and Transylvanian Hunger retain the raw grimness of this album, but through the tinniness and fuzz, one can at least decipher what is going on musically. \n\nThis is an overall chore to listen to because, while the album certainly has high points, the meat of it is mediocre. Kathaarian Life Code starts the album off very well, but the second In the Shadow of the Horns comes on, it takes a severe dive. I cannot exactly describe what it is, but this song is just annoying, perhaps because of the sub-standard vocal work. Fortunately, Paragon Belial is amazing, and quite-possibly is the redeeming element of this album, at least in my eyes. Now, for the chore part. Where Cold Winds Blow is awful. It is just rawness and feedback playing through speakers, masquerading unsuccessfully as music. This leads into the title cut which is another sub-par song, that contributes very little to the album, other than taking up space. Finally, the outro is good, but, to me, it sounds closer to death than black metal. The riffing is very death metal-esque, and some of the slower bits in the song have a droning death metal feel about them.\n\nWhile i realize the importance of this album to the genre, and the influence it has had, I think the band should have nit-picked a bit more, gotten this album more ready for release, and released a true masterpiece. Perhaps using new material instead of old recycled death metal ideas would have helped as well. Although I do not find the vast majority of this album pleasurable, I respect the band for releasing something so gritty and raw, without regards to public opinion, and for being one of the first to publicly display their use of corpsepaint. I see this album not as the epitome of Darkthrone (or black metal for that matter), but as a vehicle used to achieve the greater things that were to come. For this reason, this is a piece that I would reccommend for its historical significance, not for its musical value.\n",
        "\nBefore I heard this LP \u2013 the only Darkthrone's full length I really liked was their debut, which is a Death Metal masterpiece that has nothing to do with BM. When I heard about the NWOBHM (New Wave of BLACK Heavy Metal) single and heard the song \u201cCanadian Metal\u201d, I knew that this time there\u2019s something very different to expect from this duo, so I bought a copy blindly. I was surprised when I saw these guys praising epic bands like Manilla Road in the booklet, but I knew that I couldn\u2019t go wrong with an album that features \u201cCanadian Metal\u201d! I was also impressed by the great cover, made with simple black ball pen by the great artist Dennis Dread, which also supports the young Norwegian Thrash duo \u201cDeathammer\u201d, whose patch is drawn on Mr. Necro\u2019s vest! Like the cover, the music is primitive, Punkish and simply screaming Fuck Off And Die!\n\nThis LP is not about humor, but straightforward honesty! You can feel it in the riffs, the really cool solos and in the frustrated and angry vocals as well. It\u2019s still Darkthrone to the core, the basic (not as basic as in Transylvanian Hunger though) drums and the utter grimness can still be felt in this raw music, but you can hear that it\u2019s done from the heart! It\u2019s written and played by adult people who dedicated their lives to Metal, not people who try to sound grown up by mixing other genres that don\u2019t fit!\n\nIt\u2019s easy to notice already in the 1st song \u201cThese Shores are Damned\u201d. Angry and most important \u2013 sarcastic mixture of Metal and Punk! Then \u201cCanadian Metal\u201d kicks in, featuring some slight \u201cMorbid Tales\u201d touch in the music, which is far from sounding like the cult Canadian Thrash bands they praise in this song (Piledriver, Slaughter, Sacrifice, Obliveon), but who cares? The main riff is catchy as Hell and the solo is cool, and even Fenriz\u2019s high pitched screams fit the atmosphere! These guys know how to play, when they want to! The song \u201cThe Church of Real Metal\u201d is slow paced and has its epic feeling, especially in the solo. Manilla Road and Manowar should be proud! \u201cThe Banners of Old\u201d has a similar structure, starting slowly and dramatically and later being played at slow-mid-temps. \n\nBlack Metal? Heavy Metal? Speed Metal? Punk? No boundaries exist here, everything is mixed, creating together the angry shape of the beast called DARKTHRONE! The last song on side A is \u201cFuck off and Die!\u201d, which is probably the most catchy and memorable here. A great collaboration of hatred and sarcasm with raw and simple Rock N\u2019 Roll and pure Punkish \u201cFUCK YOU\u201d attitude!\n\nSide B opens with \u201cSplitkein Fever\u201d, another anthem of frustration. Songs like this should be listened to while being alone in a forest, far from the majority\u2019s idiocy. Welcome to planet Darkthrone! A world that these 2 peculiar personalities built long ago, a place to rest from the crazy everyday life! An anvil to forge their ideas, without giving a flying fuck about what others might say! \u201cRaised on Rock\u201d is another old-school anthem, praising pre-94 Metal! Could it be more Rock N\u2019 Roll than the scream \u201cLet the strings burn!\u201d, followed by a riff a la Twisted Sister\u2019s \u201cTear it Loose\u201d?! No way! \u201cPervertor of the 7 Gates\u201d and \u201cWisdom of the Dead\u201d have similar structures to those of TCORM and TBOO from side A, which are pretty calm, but impossible to bet bored with. And now it\u2019s the time to switch the side and give this masterpiece another listen, hehe!\n\nWhen all is said and done, this is in my opinion best Darkthrone\u2019s album since SSJ, if not the best EVER! Honesty is in season in Norway nowadays, when every once mega-satanic Norwegian BM band plays music that has basically nothing to do with the 2nd wave BM they used to play in the 90\u2019s. I heard that those who know Fenriz well, say that he is a person with a great dose of humor, so I guess that what this band created in the 90\u2019s should not be taken too seriously, whether you like the music or not. This album though, sounds like a confession, without trying to hide anything from the listeners. Give this album a chance, or just FUCK OFF AND DIE!\n",
        "\nBefore Darkthrone, the influential second-wave Norwegian black metal band, there was a band called Darkthrone. THIS older Darkthrone championed a new approach to death metal mostly coming out of Sweden and England at the turn of the 1990s. Known mostly as \"Swedish progressive\" death metal, the new tendency was to combine the thrash-derived sounds of 1980s American death metal with motifs and playing techniques from doom metal and grindcore, resulting in a lower-tuned, more bass-intensive, sonically more aggressive, and more atmospheric approach to the genre.\n\nThe first Darkthrone LP is all these things in spades. Soulside Journey is good enough of a death metal album, that I would argue they'd still be remembered as a good and influential band even if they hadn't decided to forge into black metal after this record. The recording quality fits the Swedish progressive style well. The guitars come from the extreme sides of the stereo, pouring right into your ears rather than sounding diffuse, and the equalizer definitely favors the heaviest and most carrying of the bass frequencies, giving the music the sensation of physically striking the listener. The drums, especially the snare hits, are prominent.\n\nThe music itself is classic Swedish prog death metal- crushing, heavily downtuned power chords, near-atonal arpeggios, and pseudo-gothic doom metal melodies in a pace that varies from ponderous and lurking to a rapid gallop. It can get a little \"samey\" or meandering at times, but at its best it's a good variation between ass-kicking death metal and brooding atmosphere. The guitar solos are fast, atonal, and full of urgency, and occasionally there's even a little synthesizer for extra atmospheric oddness. The bass guitar is usually submerged behind the guitars, but gets a few good solo moments here and there.\n\nFor me, what really carries this album is the drumming, though. As mentioned before, it's given priority in the mix, with a very punchy and aggressive snare drum and emphatically played ride cymbals. There is a lot of the typical death metal style riff drumming, but also a lot of rhythmic elaboration and syncopation. The style is not only driving and energetic, but almost...jazzy. In my opinion, it's what gives this album its drive, uniqueness, and a lot of its musical depth.\n\nOverall, I'd say Soulside Journey is a great recording for anyone into the \"Swedish progressive\" style of death metal- solid, driving, well paced, and full of great rhythm.\n",
        "\nFunny how having a sense of humour in metal can be so very dangerous to how you are perceived. Darkthrone give some hint to their tongues moving in slyly humorous manners and we, black metal\u2019s fan-base with our inclination to analyse and dissect every movement every musician from Scandinavia has made in the last twenty-five years, can\u2019t make heads or tails of it. Just gaze upon the abject repulsion Darkthrone have created by seemingly turning their backs on their early works (again, I suspect the pulling of limbs), and giving you a CD that recommends albums by Trouble -- one of the Rick Rubin produced ones, too! -- in its sleeve rather than solely featuring pictures of snowy landscapes. Apparently, in some circles having more overt fun with your music negates everything you\u2019ve done to a slowly winding cog in the grand scheme of some masterful satire. Of course, the said view is complete and utter bullshit; all part of that ridiculous absurdity and over-analysis that we get with black metal\u2026 taken with a side order of absurdity, more absurdity and then -- here comes the clever part -- even more absurdity. Naturally! \n\nI certainly don\u2019t profess to understand every movement and decision in Darkthrone\u2019s increasingly insular, icy little wilderness in which JD Kimball\u2019s voice provides their only warmth. No, I don\u2019t understand at all why after so many questions about certain burnings of certain wooden structures (that may or may not have lain on top of other wooden structures prior to this), and the repeated use of certain buzzwords to describe certain aesthetics of second wave black metal that Darkthrone\u2019s official spokesperson would seemingly turn his back on the whole thing. Just getting back to the music would be nice after all that, wouldn\u2019t it? I\u2019d say some are a little too keen to praise the whole \u201cfuck you/fuck off\u201d aspect of Darkthrone, -- I, personally, just happen to like the fact that it\u2019s provided us with a band that makes music exclusively for its own enjoyment, not yours (without resorting to the Lars Ulrich \u201cJoin us for the ride\u201d defence) -- but, since I\u2019m a nauseating sycophant massive fan I share the said enjoyment because I want to make Fenriz\u2019s \u201cthank you\u201d list on the next Darkthrone album. \n\nI can\u2019t really claim it to be the \u201csame old Darkthrone\u201d (which is an over-simplification; but, hey, that makes a change from the over-analysis, right?) but Dark Thrones and Black Flags has a lot of what I\u2019ve always valued about the band. Firstly, there\u2019s Fenriz\u2019s masterful drumming -- he\u2019s still demonstrating why he\u2019s black metal\u2019s best drummer; as he\u2019s still listening to what\u2019s happening in the overall picture of the song as to compliments it so wonderfully. The drums are a little more in the background that on, say, A Blaze in the Northern Sky but that\u2019s perhaps just to ram the fact home: Darkthrone are a \u2018riff\u2019 band, first and foremost. There\u2019s also that wonderful duality of Fenriz and Nocturno Culto\u2019s sort of split vision of the band (despite construction being a bit more shared this time around). Fenriz\u2019s songs seem to have become the face of the band: brisk, catchy and seemingly drunk, whereas Ted\u2019s taken a more cryptic approach with his compositions. In fact, it is rather telling that those who say Darkthrone\u2019s become a \u201cjoke band\u201d pay absolutely no heed to songs like \u2018Norway in September\u2019 or, say, \u2018These Shores Are Damned\u2019 from F.O.A.D. whilst only focusing on stuff like \u2018Hanging Out In Haiger\u2019 (which certainly is a fun song, in most respects, even if it\u2019s the album\u2019s weakest for me). \n\nYes, there certainly is a lot of old school metal here (the type that predates 1993 AD, don't you know) -- but it\u2019s never there simply for its own sake. I think there\u2019s a inescapably genuine love that\u2019s present here; less laboured than Too Old, Too Cold, and with fewer creases in its overall presentation than F.O.A.D.. You could say they\u2019re boldly marching onwards, I\u2019d probably just say they\u2019re just going somewhere! And hell, whatever the direction Dark Thrones and Black Flags sure is a thoroughly enjoyable ramble. Well worth my \u00a36! There\u2019s a lot of surprises for me, too, the melodic content is both very high and extremely welcome -- I\u2019m almost expecting Nocturno Culto to make us all jump up in excitement with a properly melodic Maiden-esque solo on the next Darkthrone album. Well, maybe not, but there\u2019s some very refreshing thrash riffs in places, too, listen to \u2018Norway in September\u2019 -- after an initially grinding mid-tempo song we\u2019re treated with some caustic thrash. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s a homage to some long-forgotten 80s thrash band, who I simply must check out (again, because I\u2019m a nauseating sycophant who lusts after that golden, Fenriz-y stamp of approval not because I\u2019ve actually got any interest in metal).\n\nYes, what with all the lauding of attention at songs like \u2018Metal Hiking Punks\u2019 you\u2019d be forgiven for missing out the more serious side of this record. But anyway, I guess we must cover that rather infamous number, shouldn\u2019t we? Now, my brother told me he heard a bit of Scott Reagers in this vocal performance; I agree with him -- but there\u2019s more! The verse riffs sound a lot like the title track of Vitus\u2019s second album, Hallow\u2019s Victim. Funny then, isn\u2019t it? That Darkthrone get stick for showing \u201ctoo much\u201d punk influence these days, and they\u2019re still taking a lot of their punk from a fucking doom band! Darkthrone is no joke, folks, but they sure love laughing at you! I mean they\u2019re obviously trying to trick me into thinking they\u2019ve become a bunch rock \u2019n\u2019 rolling simpletons with all these hidden depths that only I have the good grace of voicing, right? In the song, I guess Darkthrone are celebrating nature and a sort of outsider identity, so that\u2019s, what? Two very common -- standard, almost -- themes in black metal. \n\nSome folks are having a few qualms with Darkthrone\u2019s choice of vocal production here. Honestly, it never really struck me as anything horrid or at all detrimental to my enjoyment. They aren\u2019t too distant and they\u2019re not inappropriately reverberated; it just comes across as a rather authentic homage to the days when metal bands would get slightly odd sounding vocal production because the producers would simply say: \u201cThis guy can\u2019t sing! What are we going to do?\u201d and the answer, of course, would usually be \u201clots of reverb!\u201d. But hey, that\u2019s something I\u2019ve got used to\u2026 it\u2019s fun! Let\u2019s put it this way; if you found yourself grumbling about the production on Gates to Purgatory, you\u2019ll do the same thing here, too. You\u2019re missing the point, really. \n\nSo, all-in-all, Dark Thrones and Black Flags is a gloriously eccentric listen with more than enough to keep me actively interested for as many listens as I care to have. It\u2019s the best yet of the newer style of Darkthrone, and I\u2019m greatly interested to see where they\u2019ll go next. Of course, you can still dismiss it as a joke and an absurdly silly little album, and hey, why not tell me I\u2019ve just added another layer to the repulsive over-analysis! But then, I\u2019d be inclined to tell you to fuck off and listen to albums on \u2018Spotify\u2019. Whatever the hell that is, anyway.\n",
        "\nDarkthrone is such a personal favorite of mine that each new album is practically an event, something I anticipate every year or so with baited delirium. Contrary to the narrow views of most black metal mavens, I enjoy just about every 'phase' the band has explored, even their highly debated albums like 'Plaguewielder' or 'Ravishing Grimness'. They have never lacked for integrity or a refined sense of simple, infectious songwriting. Their latest opus continues upon the path of the previous 'F.O.A.D.', a hybrid of early black metal ethics and raw, punk fervor. And it is quite a show, each of its 10 tracks a small piece of perfection.\n\nNo, you won't find 'Transilvanian Hunger' or 'Under a Funeral Moon' on this disc. And why the fuck would you want to? They have already achieved the apex of that form, and I for one am excited that they continue to redefine and reinvent their approach. As aforementioned, all of the songs on this album are wonderful. To pick favorites is nigh impossible since I love the placement of every note and every vocal on the album. One might first be thrown off with the rather 'goofy' sound of the clean vocals on track opener \"The Winds They Called the Dungeon Shaker\", but listen a few more times. It's absolutely fantastic, and re-captures the charisma of early metal and punk when the individual voice was an important force in underground music, rather than the formulaic snarl-by-numbers you hear so often these days.\n\nBoth halves of the legendary duo have contributed equally to the songwriting here, and you can almost hear a division between the production of the tracks. And yet, despite this, they all fit wonderfully together into a grim, delicious whole. The influence of Celtic Frost, Bathory and other prototypical staples remains very apparent, yet each track embellishes with something you wouldn't quite expect. The somber melodies which illuminate the second half of \"The Winds They Called the Dungeon Shaker\". The wild vibes of \"Hiking Metal Punks\" with its inspiring, NWOBHM guitar solos. The infectious riffing of \"Blacksmith of the North\". The desolate, thrashing atmosphere of \"Launchpad into Nothingness\". Just too many moments to choose here.\n\nLyrically, the album retains the tongue in cheek self-exploration of the state of 'metal' music kick which they've been on for some time now, but not restricted to that. This is a band whose lyrics have always been worth reading, from the worst to the best, and that is a trend which thankfully continues on 'Dark Thrones and Black Flags'.\n\nYet another masterpiece from the world's greatest black metal band, even if that tag no longer strictly applies to their sound. This is my favorite release from the band since 'Sardonic Wrath', and one I will probably not cut from my aural rotation until the inevitable follow-up.\n\nWhich I will eagerly await, with delirium bordering on frenzy.\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nThis is my first real foray into Darkthrone; I've tried before, but I thought it was just blah. Now, I've started with this demo and I liked it (not love it). It's more than ok, but not really great.\n\nThe first problem I have with this demo is the vocals: they are annoying and I hate them! I'm glad that those are sparsely and rarely used (the first track doesn't have them - a relief indeed!).\n\nThe second one is about the length: if they have cut the whole demo by 2 minutes it would have been great, not that I don't enjoy it as it is! I think it's maybe because of the many mid-tempo passages. The intro's, outro's and (on the title track's) middle parts of the songs have some of them, although I like the atmospheric middle section of the title track. This track has a black metal feeling here and there, but so are the rest of the tracks.\n\nThe title track is the best one here and, although it has the holes of the other two, here they are crucial in the song structure (like that saying: \"the garbage of one is another one's treasure\"). I think I'll give this track a 9: I hate the vocals and it distracts the listeners from hearing the riffs, wich are very good (also, the drums are played by a very competent drummer).\n\nThe rest of the tracks are kind of satellites, \"spinning\" around the title track. I don't want to say that they are similar, but it seems that the song structures are kind of the same (without the atmospheric middle segment), with the occasional exclusion of an detail (like the vocals on the first track) and the atmospheric effects (made by the guitarists - not the studio or synth effects!) on the last track; also the title track's beginning is very similar, if not identic, with Mayhem \"Ghoul\" (!).\n\nOne thing I admire about this band is that, although they have released some very good records, technically speaking, they left this direction and enter the black metal sphere, proving that music is not dictated by the technicity of a song, but by the mood it creates; so, while listening to this band's later outputs, I realise what a slap in the face these guys give to the ones that listen/compose to/the music, just for the sake of complexity and disregarding the magic that the music is creating. Music isn't notes; the notes are music!\n",
        "\nI have loved Darkthrone since first listened to their music. I remember it was Cromlech, thus a death metal album and I found it really good. After I listened to albums such as Transilvanian hunger or Panzerfaust, which are for me among the best black metal albums ever. And now, as they entered a new era with their album Fuck off and die! or better the previous album Dark Thrones and Black Flags I like them even more.\n\nAlthough a legend as Darkthrone is capable of simply changing genre of music, they always have enough originality with them to expose. In fact, FOAD is not regular crust punk as Disfear and all other D-beat groups. Darkthrone brings something really extraordinary with them. This phenomenon which I have never seen or better heard before is the spirit of black metal. Naturally it is almost impossible to turn back to this music after 15 years of famous history. I like this Darkthrone\u00b4s experiment, especially this album.\n\nAs I have already said it is a crust punk with black metal spirit. How to explain? If you listened solely to drums you would say it is crust punk, perhaps a bit slow but technically accurate. On the other hand, if you listened merely to guitar or voices, or better, if you felt the atmosphere of them, the sounds, tones and power you would call it black metal. \n\nThere is much to highlight in this album. It is not a boring one, not at all although the guitar riffs are rather simple and there are not much of them in each song. But the composition of each song, short but nice solo in almost every song, variations of the rhythm, nice play with stereo and a lot of originality in lyrics make this album a masterpiece among crust black metal punk albums, not only because this is perhaps the only band to play this genre but also because this much of great music at one CD is difficult to find. \n\nSomething for which I didn\u00b4t give 100% to this album is a fact that majority of songs\u00b4 melodies and atmosphere are always more or less pessimistic. I know this is a proviso of black metal music but crust punk songs are rather fast, powerful, happy perhaps and this album seems to me as if it was recorded after 10 hours of digging a grave for your loved relative, i.e. as if the guys were really exhausted and sad of something. Perhaps I shouldn\u00b4t have praised the influence of black metal although I find it quite interesting. On the other side there are songs that make you move so there is enough to chose from.\n\nTo conclude, I find necessary to say that this album is really only for those who like black metal AND crust punk because I don\u00b4t think liking but one suffice.\n",
        "\nForgive my touch of fanboy worship here but I'm willing to argue that there is no one cooler in the world of Metal than the duo of Mr. Ted Skjellum and Mr. Gylve Nagell, Nocturno Culto and Fenriz to you and I, than perhaps Lemmy Kilmister. As I should hope you know of my dislike for elitist black metallers by now that statement infact means I don't worship at the altar (great that it may be) of 1994's \"Transilvanian Hunger\" like the thousands of identikit bands out there, but more appreciate the 'realness' of said duo, who speak their mind and have their balls to do what the fuck they want. You'll see many bands who say no outside influences have affected their output yet they have 'conveniently' jumped ship to the current trend, but with Darkthrone you know it's true. Not giving a toss about the elitists out there and willing to accept their non-black metal and even non-metal influences, Darkthrone have found themselves a new identity and direction the latter half of this decade by combining the raw and harsh black metal that has always been their forte (excluding the death metal debut \"Soulside Journey\") with punk and classic metal influences in recognition of from whence they, and black metal, came.\n\nAlbum number 14 \"Dark Thrones and Black Flags\" simply expands on what \"The Cult Is Alive\" and \"F.O.A.D.\" have laid out in the most unpretentious of manners, featuring no irony in a sound terrifyingly 'amateur' and unpolished that will instantly see the majority spit it out in derision. But give it a second please - isn't it nice to hear a band record music purely for the very simple pleasure of recording music itself, playing very much within their abilities and not layering it in special effects and undignified sounds and samples? Listen to \"Hanging Out In Haiger\" - it has the essence of the classic NWOBHM/Accept template with the added bonus of some serious crust and the smell of last night's whiskey that should surely contain nothing anyone into raw black metal or NWOBHM can't tolerate. Much the same can be said of the rest of \"Dark Thrones...\" - there is no overt technicality, no polish and nothing pretty about it, but the glory of Darkthrone is precisely in those packages.\n\nOpener \"The Winds They Called The Dungeon Shaker\" is symbolic of the pace and metallic nature of Darkthrone these days, with more than competent riffs seizing the moment from Nocturno and Fenriz hammering out simple but effective drum patterns resulting in an album that is pleasurable from the first listen. \"Death Of All Oaths (Oath Minus)\" hones the darker, grizzlier (to steal a Darkthrone term) nature of their output due mainly to Nocturno's coruscating howl, while \"Hiking Metal Punks\", based on Fenriz's passion for hiking in the Norwegian mountains, is punk to the T. More punk infact than most 'punk' bands I've heard in recent times.\n\n\"Dark Thrones and Black Flags\" is no great departure from \"F.O.A.D.\" and to choose a favourite is very much a personal choice. For me, \"F.O.A.D.\" edges out \"Dark Thrones...\", but not without album 14 giving it a run for it's money. Darkthrone make fun, caustic black metal for those who live life eternal and have the balls to show it. \n\nOriginally written for Rockfreaks.net\n",
        "\nThis might be the first real black metal record ever recorded. However, it does not have all the aspects that define a black metal album today. \u201cA Blaze in the Northern Sky\u201d lacks time signature changes, raspy vocals, constant blast beats, and classically structured music. This album does contain distorted guitars, some blast beats, and somewhat raspy vocals. In all, \u201cA Blaze in the Northern Sky\u201d definitely defined the black metal genre.\n\nThe vocals on this album are provided by Nocturno Culto. Although his vocal style hear is not high-pitched rasps, they are not exactly velvety either. They kind of sound like Maniac from Mayhem on Deathcrush but much fuller. They are maniacal screams that sound like a mad person about to kill a small poodle. One can see how the classic high-pitched rasps evolved from this.\n\nGuitars here are terribly distorted. Not nearly as bad as \u201cUnder a Funeral Moon\u201d, but they are getting there. Nasty riffs played in a death metal style dominate the album. Songs like \u201cParagon Belial\u201d and \u201cThe Pagan Winter\u201d include creeping distorted riffs that crawl up the spine. \u201cIn the Shadow of the Horns\u201d is played in 4/4 and really has a crust punk sound to it. Guitars are very energetic on this song and most songs here defy what today\u2019s black metal guitars tend to play. This album is filled with energy and is not a good representative of today\u2019s black metal sound. Darkthrone really took a turn for the best with their next album removing the rocky environment from their songs and replacing it with a classical atmosphere.\n\nDrums are genre defining here. They are not nonstop blast beats like the next three Darkthrone albums, but still are groundbreaking. Mostly set in 4/4, the drums are also energetic rock beats. However, in songs like \u201cKaatharian Life Code\u201d they completely stop the energy and substitute it with blast beats. Possibly the first real blackened blast beats done. After this album, Fenriz does not stop blast beating until their heavy metal sound sets in.\n\nSongs that stand out are every song that I mentioned earlier. \u201cWhere Cold Winds Blow\u201d and the title track are good songs, but not as memorable as the remaining four (IMO). \u201cKaatharian Life Code\u201d is probably my favorite here. It starts with haunting chants provided by Fenriz, and sick high-pitched guttural vocals from Nocturno Culto mixed together. A disturbing beginning to black metal\u2019s sound. The song kicks ass for ten full minutes and ends with blasting. \u201cThe Pagan Winter\u201d ends with the haunting chant of Fenriz atop of rasps of Culto which is a very cool part of the album. It is cool because \u201cKaatharian\u201d is the opener of the album and \u201cWinter\u201d is the closer. So the album begins with the chant and ends with the chant.\n\nThis is an essential album for all black metal fans. It pretty much strengthened the black metal sound created by Bathory and Mayhem and was the force behind the whole second wave. A must have! Get it now!\n",
        "\nPreceding Transilvanian Hunger, Darkthrone were able to conjure up some of the best and most important black metal of the second wave. Their unique take on the music put forth by bands like Venom, Hellhammer/Celtic Frost, and Bathory created the gem that is A Blaze in the Northern Sky, and finding their own niche they developed their signature sound with Under a Funeral Moon. According to interviews, drummer and main force behind TH, Fenriz claims that it took a mere two weeks to record Transilvanian Hunger. Usually a fact like that is not enough to pass judgment on the album, but when listened to it, it makes perfect sense that the album was recorded in such a small passing of time.\n\nRight from the beginning of the album changes should be apparent to listeners. Darkthrone stripped themselves down to a level of minimalism practically unmatched at the time. Creating a large schism amongst fans, Transilvanian Hunger has constantly been heralded as a development, and perfection in minimalism, while others lay claim that it is a piece of music that anyone could of done and that it acts a ploy because of the musician's understanding of what would be accepted and how people would perceive it. Much like the well known painter Jackson Pollock, this work is fiercely debated and often sold to people as something they would not conceive on their own. \n\nTo claim, in anyway, that this album is mature, developed, or complex in anyway is a huge overstatement. Technically speaking this album is painfully simple: a constant drumbeat, an average of two to three riffs per a song and your run of the mill vocals. The riffs used are often simple, but catchy and enjoyable, they work greatly on songs like \"Transilvanian Hunger\" but fall completely flat on songs like \"Over Fjell Og Gjennom Torner\" and others are mediocre and become a chore to listen to.\n\nThe fault of this album is that at its heart, it is a good idea and something that could greatly work, but much like other early works of minimalist black metal (Filosfem) it suffers from some really poor choices and when thought about too much comes off as childish and uninspired. Part of me edges towards the notion that Fenriz and Nocturno Culto knew fans would eat this up and set out to task, not a passion, to create something that would raise their reputation; for the most part i disregard such a notion, but it's not a good sign that it floats around.\n\nBeyond the stagnation of many songs, another sore aspect of this album for me is the production. The production is horribly weak and really hinders a lot of the atmosphere that many claim is present. I would like to say this album acts as a melodic response and nod towards a style of black metal bands like Von pioneered, and i guess that would make sense.\n\nGiving way to countless imitators, Transilvanian Hunger has become a staple in black metal. Part of my disdain that surrounds this album is the fact that people are so head over heels about it. When it boils down to it, the album is mediocre. An album like Hvis Lyset Tar Oss, De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas, or Vikingligr Veldi deserves so much more praise then the monotonous workings of Darkthrone's fourth album. The fanaticism and fanboyism that surrounds this album acts a miasma of ignorance and submissiveness. While I, like everyone else, have no right to impose my views as facts upon anyone else, I can't help but feel that people think that they should like this album and follow in a sheepish trend as an attempt to seem \"true\" in the underground's most judgmental eyes.\n\nMany, as a reaction to the overwhelming fervency of this album, dismiss it as complete crap, while others adhere to that said fervency and just as mistakenly as the other party, build the album up to a gluttonous level of praise. The \"goodness\" of this album, as with any work, is in the eye of the beholder, and try as I might I cannot enjoy this album as others do. While I dislike the album in question, it is hard to deny its importance, and it is that importance and the influence it has espoused that I do not write it off as complete crap. A testament to its influence is a lot of modern black metal, a good example is Demony's Joined in Darkness, which takes the ethos behind Transilvanian Hunger and creates something a lot more powerful (and something as to which I greatly enjoy).\n\nListen for yourself, if nothing else, the album serves as an interesting point of reference and evidence to the Norwegian scene. I keep this album around in hopes that I someday will stumble upon it and fall in love with it, but that day has not come, and probably never will. In no way should this album be built up as some heavily inspired and thought provoking piece of work, if anything it should be a simpe enjoyment. Make of it what you will.\n",
        "\nWith this release we see Darkthrone stepping away from the rhythmically involved and more dynamic song writing of their black metal debut and see them honing in on their most recognizable sound. Under a Funeral Moon shows Darkthrone's new found adherence to the old axiom \"less is more.\" \n\nThe production offers the guitars and vocals, as well as the cymbals in the forefront, but gone are the powerful and compelling drum production that added so much to A Blaze in the Northern Sky. The production as a whole is a bit subdued and less intense than their debut, but works nonetheless. The crackling guitar and echoing vocals maintain their prominence throughout the album, from time to time. Whilst blast beats the drums fall to the wayside and become a mere blur. While these conditions would never be ideal, they work exceedingly well to create the sound that Darkthrone has made famous.\n\nThe departure from their debut is obvious, long and structurally diverse songs like \"Kathaarian Life Code\" are lost. Something like \" Natassja In Eternal Sleep\" foreshadows their next highly revered album, \"Transilvanian Hunger .\" the attention and repetition of catchy and powerful riffs is the meat and potatoes of this album. Songs like aforementioned \" Natassja In Eternal Sleep\" and \"To Walk The Infernal Fields\" are completely absorbing and majestic in their simple nature, but involve enough spark behind them to avoid the tepid minimalism of their next release. What this album offers is charm, and it's got more than enough of it.\n\nIt's undeniable to cite Darkthrone's quintessential status in modern black metal, and such a status was built on albums such as this. Where ABITNS bore a resemblance to the previous bands of the first wave, Under a Funeral Moon displays a completely Darkthronesque vision of what black metal is. If a textbook were to be made in regards to black metal, surely this album would have endless citations in the bibliography.\n",
        "\nOne of the seminal releases of the infamous second wave of black metal, A Blaze in the Northern Sky serves as a stepping stone for Darkthrone to their own particular niche in black metal as well as a guide for the less inspired as to how to create phenomenal black metal. ABITNS is a funny album because Darkthrone obviously wears their influences on their sleeves and the album obviously owes much to CF/Hellhammer, yet at the same time ABITNS contains its own unique voice and there simply has never been an album like it.\n\nSetting themselves apart from their contemporaries, Darkthrone strived to achieve a catchy and 'metal' album. Not forgetting the importance of riffs from the forebears of black metal, and the thrashy/groove elements championed by Morbid Tales Celtic Frost, Darkthrone implements guitar solos (something many second wave, as well as modern black metal bands, tend to overlook), mid-section groove stomps and countless rhythm changes. When comparing ABITNS to contemporaries of the time it is interesting to see how Darkthrone retained a death metal/trash sense of composure and time. Immortal's Diabolical Fullmoon Mysticism is a good, but wholly inspired by Bathory effort which offered little variance amongst its tracks and seemed much more restrained. ABITNS also abstains from the absurdly fast-all-the-time style of De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas or the dreary slow dirge of Burzum. ABITNS really comes out as its own and as a unique vessel in the second wave. Like a good thrash album, ABITNS offers a sense of fun and invigoration, something like DMDS feels more foreboding and moody.\n\nThe instrumentation, attention to detail, and overall vibe given by ABITNS seems to make their contemporaries look childish, Darkthrone were musicians and creators of music first and foremost, while they paid great attention to their appearance, it wasn't until Transilvanian Hunger that they begun to exchange creativity and performance for image and reputation.\n\nThe drums are so powerful and authoritarian on this album, I love it. They guide each song with such brute strength and have a great tone. Fenriz's performance is one of my favorites and is very fun and interesting to listen to. The guitar work is top notch and countless riffs are undeniable classics. Every song is a classic, its hard to skip anyone of them, and downright unfair to say anyone of them is unimportant.\n\nDarkthrone have defiantly established themselves as one of the most important names in black metal, and much of that credit is given to Transilvanian Hunger. But it was with ABITNS that Darkthrone modernized the music they had been influenced by and were able to create many of the variables that have characterized the scene since. The album surges and jumps, contains a vibrant and robust production that really emphasizes the power behind every instrument, another element they lost to the muffled and lifeless production of Transilvanian Hunger.\n\nFor me, it is a tough debate between De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas or A Blaze in the Northern Sky as the king album of the second wave. They offer radically different approaches to the genre in question, and are amazing in their own right. ABITNS always seemed like a good stepping stone from thrash and death metal to black metal, DMDS feels like an album that requires a lot from the listener and isn't as simple as just picking up.This is one of the few albums i actually have fun listening to as an activity in of itself. If this album doesn't catch your fancy the first time around, put it down and come back to it, because it really is a marvel and gem of music as a whole.\n",
        "\nLiving in the past is something that too many seem to be content with, and no clearer of an example of this can be articulated than the religious devotion that many have to the Peaceville black trilogy that made Darkthrone a household name amongst adherents to the Norse black metal movement of the early 90s. This attachment has led to the blanket dismissal of a lot of good music as a result, which is nothing short of absurd, particularly given the number of quality albums that this band and others have put out since. One of those is the very different follow up to \u201cPanzerfaust\u201d dubbed \u201cTotal Death\u201d, which sees the band continuing to distance themselves from the once innovative but rapidly becoming dogmatic trappings of the beast they\u2019d created in \u201cTransylvanian Hunger\u201d.\n\nMany are quick to point out the reestablishment of a Celtic Frost/Hellhammer character on this album, something which was heavily present on the two earlier offerings within the black trilogy in varying degrees, but not in this manner. There is still a lasting influence of the band\u2019s droning, blasting minimalism that came to a climax in 1994, but it now is made to compete with a much larger amount of thrash and doom elements. The presentation is somewhat theatrical, both because the production has been smoothed out due to the guitars taking on a much mellower and warmer character, while the bass and drums are much more prominent and heavily ornamented with reverb, and the vocal presentation is dark and sinister rather than haggard and frostbitten. In fact, the dark yet more otherworldly character of the sound is almost like a lower fidelity and blackened version of the band\u2019s death metal past, albeit without all of the technical gymnastics.\n\nUltimately, this album functions as a simplistic, yet varied rebuff to those who wanted this band to pigeonhole themselves into a one-dimensional sound or die off after recording a mere 4 or 5 albums, and a much needed one at that. It reasserts the fact that in spite of the primitive nature of this variant on the style, it is still capable of being multifaceted. Songs such as \u201cEarth\u2019s Last Picture\u201d and \u201cThe Serpents Harvest\u201d brilliantly combine a slower and denser doom element into their twisted narrative format, while also making time for some thrash sections and droning melodic sections that are familiar to those who loved the previous 3 albums. There is something of a Celtic Frost nature to the presentation in some respects, but what is accomplished here is a bit more progressive and a bit more aggressive than anything than that band ever conceived of back in the early to mid 80s when they were putting out classic, venomous heavy metal.\n\nThere are often complaints about the lack of participation by Fenris in the lyrical and instrumental aspects of this album, which is something that I personally view as a good thing. As much as I like Fenris\u2019 lyrical and compositional efforts, he basically became all but a one trick pony when he dominated the arrangement on the previous 2 albums. Nocturno is the more proficient guitarist, as anyone who has heard \u201cSoulside Journey\u201d will obviously know, and is thus more capable at putting together quality and varied riffs. Fun blackened thrash songs like \u201cBlasphemer\u201d, which reminds me a little bit of some material off of Manilla Road\u2019s \u201cOut Of The Abyss\u201d actually, and the classic \u201cBlack Victory Of Death\u201d would not have been possible with Fenris playing the guitar. There aren\u2019t any solos to ornament the songs on this album, but Nocturno\u2019s keen sense of riff construction makes them all but unnecessary.\n\nThough this will undoubtedly be a controversial opinion to hold, I think that \u201cTotal Death\u201d is the best album that this band put out during their Moonfog era, and also a more involved and quality work than that of \u201cTransylvanian Hunger\u201d. It\u2019s loaded with well constructed, clearly defined songs that reasserts a generalized take on black metal\u2019s potential, rather than focusing exclusively on one or two aspects. It is very different from most of what they\u2019ve done, but it is still well within the standard parameters of the genre and doesn\u2019t veer anywhere near the crust punk and rocking material that the band would start to delve into later. In short, this is the last true black metal album put out by the band, and one of their greater works. So ignore the cult of 1994 in this particular instance and experience a slightly more colorful take on things, with an excellent album cover to match it.\n\nOriginally submitted to (www.metal-observer.com) on May 15, 2009.\n",
        "\nOne could say that this album was born out of controversy, or more specifically out of Darkthrone\u2019s inability to avoid the controversy that had exploded within the scene they helped pioneer. It tells the tale of a band that essentially had to start over almost at square one without label support and continue on without the means to lead a music scene that had spread far beyond their little slice of frozen heaven in the tree ridden land of Norway. But with a little help from good old Satyr\u2019s small label and a strong dose of convention destroying, rebellious energy, \u201cPanzerfaust\u201d was put together.\n\nThe general approach taken by most bands who attempt to reestablish themselves is to take a sort of compilation approach and play up the glory days of their past, usually discovering a new sound in the process. This album essentially does the same thing, taking bits and pieces from each of the 3 parts of their Peaceville black metal trilogy and merging them into a dark and chaotic, yet very much methodical album that demonstrates the raw spirit and versatility of black metal. Not a whole lot of new ground is broken on here, but in terms of songwriting this is definitely among the finer moments of their post-Peaceville career.\n\nOne of Darkthrone\u2019s unique qualities is that in spite of the general approach of rawness in their production practices, there is a good deal of variety from album to album in terms of sound character. \u201cPanzerfaust\u201d is probably the rawest and most animalistic of the band\u2019s offerings, owing to an extremely dry, heavy and very much present drum production, which is a big departure from their last 3 albums. The guitar sound is a little bit warmer than previous efforts, coming to something of a middle heavy tone that brings to mind the dew on an early autumn morning rather than the permafrost, dead of winter character of \u201cUnder A Funeral Moon\u201d and \u201cTransylvanian Hunger\u201d. Nocturno\u2019s voice has also been brought into greater prominence, just falling short of crossing the line between being aggressive and being overbearing, coming off as a crazed wolf, frothing at the mouth before a kill.\n\nAlthough this definitely takes a step away from the rabid simplicity of \u201cTransylvanian Hunger\u201d, this album still exhibit\u2019s a dominant character of droning. Riffs are repeated heavily and are few in number, although the riffs themselves do not sit only on a melodic tremolo drone but also incorporate Hellhammer styled pre-thrash riffs in a similar manner as \u201cUnder A Funeral Moon\u201d, though the radical difference in production here makes the songs come off with a bit of a traditional doom feel. \u201cEn Vind Av Sorg\u201d sounds mostly like a more elaborate and technical variation on the title track of the previous album, while \u201cHans Siste Vinter\u201d is a little plainer and closer to copying the model on said album. \u201cThe Hordes Of Nebulah\u201d plays off the elaborate tempo changes that made \u201cUnder A Funeral Moon\u201d so intricate, though the tempo changes have been exaggerated a little. \n\nMost of the rest of the music contained on here sort of reaches back to the Celtic Frost character of \u201cA Blaze In The Northern Sky\u201d, albeit without the technical detailing that made that album as strong as it was. There\u2019s a nice little guitar solo on \u201cTriumphant Gleam\u201d which showcases Fenriz\u2019s ability to break out of repetitive riff work when he feels like it, although it goes nowhere near the intricacy of what was heard out of Zephyrous and Culto on the first 2 albums of the black trilogy. But otherwise, things sort of stay in a droning variation of the style that was heard in 1992. The formula breaks into an odd interlude before ending on the final song, where Fenris shows off his interest in ambient music with a little poem reading over top a series of synthesized brass sounds and drum noise. It\u2019s not so much a menacing narration in the same way that the intro to \u201cKathaarian Life Code\u201d was, but more of a mysterious and somewhat bizarre auditory experience.\n\nGenerally speaking, there are three conclusions that are usually drawn by those who encounter this album. The first is that it is the last worthwhile album by a band who had a short run at glory in the early 90s and is now irrelevant. The second is that it is a sort of amazing masterwork that successfully combined all of the strongest elements of the 3 previous albums. The third is that it is a weak afterthought by a band that lost their steam after being ejected from their label. Essentially all of these viewpoints are wrong. This is more of a new beginning for a band that saw the old ways of black metal coming to an end and began searching for a new sound. It\u2019s not their greatest work, nor is it by any standard a weak work, but more of a strong work that would pave the way for a series of stylistic twists and turns. Like many in the original Norwegian 2nd wave, this band is made up musicians who are not content with repeating themselves or hanging up their nail spiked gauntlets, a band who seek to explore the limits of their genre rather than live in the past. \n\nOriginally submitted to (www.metal-observer.com) on May 2, 2009.\n",
        "\nThis is widely regarded by both fan and detractor alike as Darkthrone\u2019s crowning achievement, and insofar as their black metal releases, I am not one to disagree. It is a notable departure for a band that spent the bulk of their early days attempting to outdo themselves technically, although it still retains a good degree of the competency that made their death/thrash influenced works so impressive. The character of the band\u2019s production has taken on an even colder and more fuzz driven nature than the previous release, exaggerating the practices that were observed on early Celtic Frost and Bathory albums to the point of sounding like all the microphones and amplifiers are buried under 2 meters of snow. But the overriding ingredient in this frost coated brew is the melodic contours that shape many of the riffs and how well they play off the more thrashing ones.\n\nIn the eyes of many \u201cUnder A Funeral Moon\u201d is seen as slightly inferior to their more renowned follow up \u201cTransylvanian Hunger\u201d, much in the same way that many see \u201cReign In Blood\u201d as Slayer\u2019s crowning achievement while its predecessors were rungs on the ladder leading to it. However, if one looks at it from a stylistic viewpoint rather than one of catchiness, there is a good deal more going on here. It\u2019s somewhat closer to the droning nature of Burzum\u2019s albums at around this time if you look at certain individual riffs and songs, but there is still an overriding sense of structural development and contrast the keeps it outside of the drone realm. Probably the closest song on here to that minimalist sense of moving yet standing still is \u201cUnholy Black Metal\u201d, which essentially has 3 riffs that are drawn out to their fullest extent and ride over a continuous blast beat, but even here the band\u2019s technical past still bleeds through with a couple of well placed guitar solos.\n\nIn some respects, this album could be seen as a precursor to the mid-90s work of both Immortal and Gorgoroth, though the influences are a bit more overt in the case of the latter while the former only shares a general similarity in their song structure approach and technical work. The melodic contours of the tremolo riffs heard on \u201cNatassja In Eternal Sleep\u201d and \u201cUnder A Funeral Moon\u201d have this biting sense of coldness to them, not all that far off from some of what can be heard on \u201cPentagram\u201d and \u201cAntichrist\u201d just a few years after this. It takes a somewhat less thrash oriented approach than said band\u2019s works and mostly tends to rest on a more linear style of riffing that\u2019s in line with pre-thrash NWOBHM work, but avoiding the chord progression clich\u00e9s of the early 80s and going towards something a bit more dissonant and rhythmically disjointed.\n\nAlthough the sound quality here is extremely raw and low fidelity, there is still a very clear set of boundaries set between the instrumentation. Zephyrus\u2019 guitar tracking is crisp enough not to bleed into itself and done in a precise enough fashion to sound like one cohesive whole rather than 2 separate guitars fighting each other for prominence, which can sometimes happen with black metal bands that have multiple guitarists. The bass still plays a significant role in shaping the arrangement, though the absence of Dag Nilsen\u2019s active lines and a greater concentration of root note bass lines does take this well out of the realm of the previous two releases. But Fenriz\u2019s drum sound contrasts the most from the rest of the arrangement, as instead of being soaked with reverb, his kit is basically dry and free of effects, putting a greater burden on the guitars to give the album its characteristic sound.\n\nMany have pointed to this album as being a large influence on the concept of bedroom black metal, mostly due to it\u2019s really rough production, which is rivaled only by \u201cPanzerfaust\u201d insofar as the band\u2019s discography is concerned. It is important to note that although many of these hack bands attempt to imitate the general sound of this album, none of them possess the competence to match the guitar work on here. Even though by the standards set by \u201cSoulside Journey\u201d this is a pretty basic album, the Jeff Hanneman inspired guitar solos heard on \u201cSummer Of The Diabolical Holocaust\u201d and \u201cUnder A Funeral Moon\u201d are well out of the league of any first or second year guitarist looking to show how cool he is for playing with a poor sense of rhythm. Likewise, the Quorthon-like vocal ravings of Nocturno Culto and the depth of the atmosphere that is established on here behind them are not something that just magically spring out of a rough take on an analog 4 track, but a careful refinement of volume levels and timbres that lead to a cohesive whole.\n\nAlthough I still hold a slight preference to \u201cSoulside Journey\u201d for its unique charm and forward looking approach to death/thrash, this is deserving of the legend that it has attached to it. It carries a quality of rawness and coldness to it not all that dissimilar to Burzum\u2019s \u201cHvis Lyset Tar Oss\u201d, along with a symmetrically structured approach to songwriting not all that far off from Gorgoroth\u2019s \u201cPentagram\u201d, although the style does hint at a little bit of a throwback to Celtic Frost at many points. It\u2019s not quite an album that could be considered ahead of its time like \u201cA Blaze In The Northern Sky\u201d was, but more one that was in the right place at the right time. It\u2019s the hardest of all of their releases to like, yet once fully understood, is the easiest one to completely love.\n\nOriginally submitted to (www.metal-observer.com) on May 2, 2009.\n",
        "\nThere had been many consequential releases under the black metal moniker dating back to the early 80s, but it wasn\u2019t until the early 90s that the style had really become whole and fully defined. Darkthrone\u2019s sophomore effort is arguably the first in a series of powerful catalysts that set things into motion for what became the musical explosion that was the 2nd wave, being the first full length release in the style to have label support. But all things considered, \u201cA Blaze In The Northern Sky\u201d is essentially a masterpiece caught between two different musical worlds, though ideologically speaking its intent is quite pronounced. \n\nEven before the band had elected to shift their production practices towards the character embodied in the then gestating black style, this outfit had a blackened tinge to their sound. At the time it was likely commonplace to peg the band\u2019s debut \u201cSoulside Journey\u201d as an occult-oriented death metal release in the Morbid Angel or Possessed vain, while the riff construction might have come off as a technically impressive variant on Bolt Thrower. But the cold and picturesque atmosphere that the album carried was well removed from what most even in the Scandinavian death scene were up to. Perhaps this could be attributed to the influence of Norway\u2019s cold and dark climate, or maybe to the band always having an affinity with early black metal bands. But regardless to how this came to be, the transition between this album and its predecessor is not quite as steep as it is often made out to be by those favoring the band\u2019s death or black metal releases exclusively.\n\nAll of this is relevant because absent the cold, frosty, fuzz driven atmospheric aesthetic, this album listens closer to a death metal album than what most today associate with the general scene and with Darkthrone in particular. The somber melodic qualities of Emperor, the dreary symphonic elements of Enslaved, and the droning beauty of Burzum are nowhere to be found on here. Instead, what emerges is a riff based and fairly technical display with a vocal delivery that is a little more guttural than it is sepulchral, like a deeper version of what Quorthon put forth on \u201cUnder The Sign Of The Black Mark\u201d. \n\nBut the two largest transitional blots on this pioneering effort are the auspicious guitar solos and the enduring prominence of Dag Nilsen\u2019s bass. Although there may have been a drop in the level of technical showmanship since this album, the differences between Nocturno\u2019s lead chops here and on their death metal songs are miniscule at most. The album\u2019s title track \u201cA Blaze In The Northern Sky\u201d, which was composed at around the same time as the later scrapped \u201cGoatlord\u201d material, has a lead slot that is just as intense as anything the band had done at this point. Similar brief bursts of death/thrash inspired speed shredding can be heard on basically every song on here. Nilsen\u2019s bass doesn\u2019t have quite the level of prominence and latitude that it did before, but when compared to most releases confined to the Norwegian scene, his work on here has a greater presence and overall impact on the character of the sound than most would in the years that would soon follow, as a quick listening of \u201cIn The Shadow Of The Horns\u201d and \u201cThe Pagan Winter\u201d will demonstrate.\n\nProbably the most common criticism of this album within black metal circles, aside from it still having one foot in the death metal paradigm, is that it comes off as rushed. This was further noted by drummer Fenriz himself in corroborating interviews, as the band sought to meet contractual obligations with Peaceville Records. Thus in addition to still carrying a lot of similarities with their \u201cGoatlord\u201d material, all of these songs carry this heavily through composed sense of structure, as if several separate ideas were pasted together in a jigsaw puzzle fashion. The primary anchor that keeps the album together is the densely atmospheric and creepy intro and epilogue, where a collection of garbled ramblings lay out the rabid individualism and non-conformist attitude that this album embodies. The resulting sound that occurs in between could be comparable to what might be heard when a half hour jam band decides to try and record something with a defined structure. The riffs themselves are very cohesive, the solos very idiomatic and memorable, but transitions between differing sections come off as abrupt. But ironically, this proves to be one of the album\u2019s charms as this off the cuff approach to songwriting gives the songs a sense of spontaneity that most drone and symphonic black metal albums lack.\n\nIt is very difficult to downplay this album\u2019s significance, though there tend to be varying opinions on just how well it stands on its own. Some within the black metal core fan base write the band off as trend hoppers, though this viewpoint tends to ignore the fact that this style didn\u2019t really take off until a couple years after this was put together and that Darkthrone\u2019s early demos were stylistically ambiguous enough to be qualified as either of the two extreme styles the band exists under here, depending on the individual song in question. This carries the spirit of the scene and it is an intense listen no matter what standard you go by, though it is so evenly mixed that purists within both black and death/thrash circles may have trouble fully embracing it. But regardless of its transitional nature, it is an excellent album and the best of both worlds for those who can embrace both eras of this band.\n\nOriginally submitted to (www.metal-observer.com) on March 16, 2009.\n",
        "\nAhh, the almighty Darkthrone. I could take both recent albums, filter out the good stuff, put aside the cheesy bullshit and make one cool disc. Darkthrone\u2019s saving grace as a band these days is their ability to write surprisingly creative and original riffs and hooks, as well as the infectious energy they infuse their music with. \n\nThe D-beat driven black punk metal they have adhered to since releasing \u201cHate Them\u201d 6 years ago is here, no surprise. If you enjoy it, great. If you don\u2019t, pull out your copy of \u201cTransilvanian Hunger\u201d and weep. Good bands evolve, you can\u2019t fault them for that, and Ted and Gylvie are well into Darkthrone phase 3. Nobody would recognize the same band who did \u201cUnder a Funeral Moon\u201d any more than \u201cSoulside Journey\u201d. \n\nApparently the boys have shared all songwriting duties this time, but how the hell can you tell? It sounds exactly the same as their previous outing, \u201cFOAD\u201d. And does Nocturno have throat cancer or something? He always had a great sound and style\u2026 listen to \u201cTransilvanian Hunger\u201d and feel the chill in your soul. But now? He sounds like my chain-smoking uncle coughing up the night\u2019s lung deposit. But he still sounds better than Fenriz. Listen buddy, just drink your beer and stop singing for fuck sake. And if there is one thing I despise the most about their recent work, it\u2019s their damn cheesy bullshit lyrics praising the glories of metal. Fenriz, having always been a very good wordsmith, is mocking us. Many examples of this are here: check out the lyrical laziness of \u201cThe Winds They Called the Dungeon Shaker\u201d, \u201cHiking Metal Punks\u201d, \u201cHanging Out in Haiger\u201d and \u201cWitch Ghetto\u201d. Eeesh. Here we have both puke and crap. Thankfully some of these tunes are actually saved by some cool riffs and tempo changes, like the old school tremolo picked theme of \u201cDungeon Shaker\u201d, the kick ass energy of \u201cWitch Ghetto\u201d and the melodic breakdown at the end of \u201cPunks\u201d, alluding to Aeolian minor, rare these days for the band. And refreshing.\n\nThere are definitely some good things here, most of all some truly original and righteous riffs. Darkthrone shines brightest when paying tribute to 80s thrash, which they seem born to play. \u201cDeath of all Oaths\u201d, \u201cLaunchpad to Nothingness\u201d and my favourite track, \u201cNorway in September\u201d, with a cool main riff, sloppy but very effective, and a second section that is roooaaarrr! perfect raw 80s thrash.\n\nI feel I should mention-- What\u2019s with the title track? An instrumental that goes absolutely nowhere, that only sounds like the intro to a song that was never born. Again, the boys are laughing at us. Hehehe. \n\nI get the impression Darkthrone fans generally feel the same way I do. Despite its faults, I still like listening to this disc, and to this band, one of my all-time favourites. And I accept their new sound. I just wish they didn\u2019t wipe their asses with it so much.\n",
        "\nI didn't know about this one at first. There are almost too many contradictions, but in the end, it all sort of makes sense, mainly after the glue takes hold. Darkthrone are best know as the proto-typical evil Norwegian black metal band, a band known as the Ramones of Black metal for their minimalist three chord all corpse fucking approach. They have evolved into an evil band for wise-ass misanthropes, smirking metal gods content to piss off their fan base by calling attention to the punkisms that were always inherent to their sheets of white noise.\n\n\nThis album is not Transylvanian Hunger by any means. The title should tell you that this is not a grim blizzard beast, but an obvious nod to punk. Old school black metal riffs pop up from time to time, but this is scuzzy crust punk for than anything. It's kind of hard to put a label on it, really. Jokey Manowar we love our metal so much that we border on parody lyrics; sloppy musicianship; simple 4/4 mummy daddy mummy daddy drum patterns; mighty riffs tinged with square peg sounding hardcoreness; I don't give a fuck English as second language vocal stylings; the occasional power metal howl; raw but clear production values, with more bass than a band that has gone for years without a bass player should legally be allowed to have.\n\n\nHiking Metal Punks is the straight up punk rock song. Norway in September is a bargain basement metal epic with a fantastic riff. The Winds They called Metal Shaker is one of the strangest songs in their repertoire, featuring an slow building, old school riff, jokey power metal vocals, and sets the shambling feel that most of this album displays. Grizzly Trade is Celtic Frost worship that would not be out of place on Panzerfaust.\n\n\nI think this is a band trying to reinvent itself by playing up it's eccentricities while staying as close to the minimalistic formula they invented. All-in-all, a likable concoction from a band that has always strived to be the opposite.\n",
        "\nWith Under a Funeral Moon Darkthrone have put out one stellar album, and in their later works snapped in to a more atmospheric approach, which was first on display on Transsylvanian Hunger. While Transsylvanian Hunger was by no means a bad album, the works that followed showed a continued entrenchment in this style and turned out to be increasingly formulaic. After Total Death I felt no urge to closely follow their path anymore and restricted myself to reading reviews about the band's output, so that I would realize when they had possibly found a new direction. Their most recent releases finally caught my attention, and I was positively surprised.\n\nThe band's latest output is fresh, varied, gritty and angry, features a wide variety of riffs and unscrupulous changes, is executed with precision and doggedness, and at the same time features a punkish vibe and production, something which was already present on Under a Funeral Moon. The music stays true to Darkthrone's greater take on Metal. There is no big departure to bemoan, this is neither Rock nor Punk, and it's not as far away from works like Panzerfaust for example as some reviewers seem to think. The difference is that the makers have developed a rejecting mindset again and recharge their creativity with an opposition now targeted at stereotypes and some of the recent atrocities in their own genre. Add to that a suprisingly fruitful integration of stylistic ideas from the classic Metal handbook especially in the vocal department - of course Darkthrone are clever enough not to overuse them - and this old/new approach seems to infuse fresh hate and vigor into their music. Channelling their disgust for today's state of the Metal world was by far not the worst concept they could come up with at this particular point of time.\n\nDenial and a return to traditional Metal virtues is also the message that this album (and its predecessor) communicates lyrically and through its cover art (which is great, by the way - the new mascot is perfectly allegoric in that it crosses classic Iron Maiden's with the cover art of The Exploited). The message part put aside, the musical ideals and ideas that may originate from Punk, Heavy Metal and first-wave Black Metal were already present on earlier works and went through several layers of Darkthrone's own musical, intellectual and production filters, and the result is inevitably Darkthrone and original, refined music, with no pattern in existance that could have been plagiarized easily, including older Darkthrone itself. The gassy, atmospheric and overly washed-out production of Transsylvanian Hunger makes no appearance here, while the music is more varied and adventurous than on the albums that followed, the guitar tone alone makes this an rewarding and very \"Metal\" listen, not to mention the top-notch musical performance, the surprising ideas in song-writing, riffing and vocals.\n\nPut shortly, this is Metal of Darkthrone's own school. The reminiscences to old Metal and Punk is something which can be seen through, this is 2008 and not 1988, and Darkthrone have taken things many steps further in the meantime. The cover art (Eddie with a Mohawk? Outrageous!) and the lyrics are pure mockery, which in itself is something perfectly in line with Metal ideals, and it may also serve the purpose of putting off people which Darkthrone deem unworthy as their fans. There's nothing wrong with that, because the music is much more advanced than the album's appearance may suggest. Few bands will be able (or tempted) to emulate Darkthrone this time. Just listen to the music, it stands on its own feet and it's quite good.\n",
        "\nHow can this album be described? Fans of it will say it is minimal. Detractors will likewise say it is minimal. Fenriz says it is minimal. I say it is minimal. Indeed, Transilvanian Hunger is a work of minimalism. Three riffs per song, generally with two alternating main riffs and a third bridge riff; little variation in song structure; simple drum beats and bass lines that usually follow the guitar riffs; and raw production. It is minimal. What this minimalism creates is a hypnotizing ambience and an atmosphere that unfolds around the listener. Every riff is tremolo-picked, and except for the first riff of Skald Av Satans Sol and the second riff of I En Hall Med Flesk Og Mjod, none of the riffs have any sort of rhythmic emphasis. This album is a continuous flow of melody with little disturbance.\n\nIt is apparent that Darkthrone is not one of the bands that hide their simple core with a flashy outer coating. Darkthrone is also not one of the bands that mistake simplicity for minimalism and boredom for ambience. They distinguish themselves as the masters through subtle manipulations. The bass guitar provides unexpected contrapuntal twists while the second guitar occasionally switches the harmonic backdrop. Howling, tremolo arm-based guitar leads and pick scrapes are also employed. Nocturno Culto knows exactly when to scream to heighten the dramatic effect and Fenriz plays some essential fills. None of these are conspicuous. Instead of disrupting the atmosphere, like some flamboyant attempt at appearing complex would, these subtleties work unassumingly to sustain the magic of the atmosphere, fueling it with small does of warm blood to keep the listener from being completely frozen, or bored, by the cold trance.\n\nIndividual tracks, however, are little more than good black metal songs with predictable structures. The true brilliance of this work only becomes apparent when the album is taken as a whole. That which once was a simple riff becomes something of a theme to be developed throughout the album. There is more than a passing melodic semblance between the second riffs of Skald Av Satans Sol and I En Hall Med Flesk Og Mjod, and most of the riff can be divided into largely two groups: the frosty, more consonant riffs and the aggressive and fierce riffs. But this is not to say that riffs are merely recycled, for the context in which each riff enters is constantly adjusted. While the basic structure of the songs generally adhere to the ABABCAB riff pattern, as perfectly exemplified by En As I Dype Skogen and Skald Av Satans Sol, and the to a lesser extent the title track (which has riff \"A\" played again at the very end), there are slight changes in the arrangement: ABC (Over Fjell Og Gjennom Troner), ABCABC (Slottet I Det Fjerne), ABABCBA (Graven Takeheimens Saler), ABABCA (I En Hall Med Flesk Og Mjod), and ABCA (As Flittermice As Satans Spys). This, however, is but a minor aspect. The way riffs interact with each other makes the album much less predictable than the individual songs, for the climaxes occur at different moments in different songs (e.g. the title track and As Flittermice As Satans Spys reaches their climaxes as the first riff enters again after the bridge and Nocturno sends out a scream, while in the case of Skald Av Satans Sol the cathartically consonant yet ambiguous third riff drives it to the climax), with some songs showing an equivocal attitude toward the concept of climax (e.g. Graven Takeheimens Saler, I En Hall Med Flesk Og Mjod). Despite of having each song clearly defined, with fully resolving cadences and moments of silence between the end of one and the start of another, Transilvanain Hunger is like a river, with songs naturally flowing from one to the next. This is mainly a result of the fact that the riff pattern is organized from a larger perspective, rather than from a point of view confined to a single track. The way the menacing opening riff of Graven Takeheimens Saler towers above its surroundings in a grim manner after a beautifully consonant riff closes Slottet I Det Fjerne, or how the cold riff of En As I Dype Skogen drives forward after the dark and heated ending of As Flittermice As Satans Spys, is even climactic in itself.\n\nNo review of Transilvanian Hunger will be complete without mentioning the production. Fans will say it is raw. Detractors will say it is raw. I say it is raw - and perfect. Each instrument is clearly audible, yet they all come together as a singular force. Nocturno Culto's vocals feel ventriloquial, with the component of human throat almost being removed from the voice - thus the vocals feel abstract, like evil itself personified, rather than a voice coming out from a human being. The guitar tone is very fuzzy and inflated, but lacks the aggressive sharpness from the previous album. It is harsh and raw but not filthy or ugly. The cold treble is there, but it feels more like snow than ice. The lyrics of the title track really described it best: \"So Pure...Evil, Cold.\" This also applies to the music at large. It is remarkable that the two albums that represent the pinnacle of Darkthrone's artistic achievement are, while technically similar, almost like polar opposites in mood. Whereas Under A Funeral Moon was utterly demented and eerie, Transilvanian Hunger is the essence of pure beauty, transcending the mere ear-pleasing aesthetic and arriving at a state of meta-beauty through the juxtaposition and the mutual struggle of the beautiful and the ugly. Transilvanian Hunger is minimal, but not simple; it is complex.\n",
        "\nListening to Darkthrone's \"Dark Thrones And Black Flags\" is kind of like gleaning through the remains of a feast held two days ago. Occasionally you may come up with a half-decent riff or semi-satisfying arrangement (Darkthrone's song-writing is never totally crap), but it's not the same as getting stuck into the origional thing. While this album is certainly an improvement over the dreadful \"FOAD\", that's not saying a lot; it's difficult for me at least to imagine the band getting more boring than that. This album is as listenable as \"Sardonic Wrath\" at first, but unlike that album doesn't seem to improve with repeated listens. They've lifted their game riff-wise, certainly, and as usual, every now and then a certain catchy riff comes through. \n\nThere's nothing that jumps out, grabs your throat and threatens you with death either instant or slow and lingering, and for all their \"sometimes you need just bread\" excuses and \"old school\" nattering, this is Metal and Metal is not supposed to be ordinary music. You can still have straight, down-the-line riffing and song-writing with impact and power, but Darkthrone are settling, once again it seems, for mediocre. Very little is memorable, very little makes me want to go back and listen again, and nothing makes me want to rate this as an album to remember. And I think it's fair enough to expect better from a band that's been around so long and has been so instrumental in Black Metal. \n\nBut by now, Darkthrone have set their style in concrete enough for it to seem permanent until the next time they re-invent themselves, disown their recent past and pretend they where about what they're doing right now all the time. And it may well be that this is as good as it gets from now on; I tend to think the reason they keep putting down people who dig \"Transilvanian Hunger\" is because they know their best is behind them (they need to be reminded that there's a reason people keep going back to that album; it's their only consistantly good one). The fact is, Darkthrone today are what they always where, a patchy group who just happened to be in the right time at the right place. \"Dark Thrones...\" may win back a few fans who, like myself, stopped actually buying their albums after \"The Cult Is Alive\" and just downloaded them. It's not a terrible album, not even a bad album, but we can no longer expect \"great\" from Darkthrone anymore. \n\nPS What lyrics?\n",
        "\nFirst I must say, \"HIKING METAL PUNKS! FOREVAH!\"\n\nOne could easily imagine a young Fenriz, clad in his requisite denim, leather, and Hi-tops in the 80's. He skips school to go hang out with his best friend, Nocturno Culto and drink some beers while listening to Motorhead. That's what this album brings to mind. I don't think they had ever dreamed that they would release the first Norwegian black metal album ever. And here it is, over 15 years later and they're still at the top of their game.\n\nI've been tackling Darkthrone's music for a while now. I never really \"got it\", I guess. Sure, there are lots of good moments on the big three Peaceville records. However, there are many bad moments as well. I tended to lump this band in with others I considered \"more historically important than good\". Dark Thrones and Black Flags has changed my mind.\n\nThis may be the best rendition yet of the style that began with The Cult is Alive. It's got old school rock, heavy metal, and punk written all over it. One thing that always bothered me about early Darkthrone was the garage rock/punk feel. I also despised the vocals. THIS album is a completely different story. In the old days, it seem that they were trying to cover up poor instrumentation, forgettable riffs, nearly non-existent percussion, and lack of songwriting with \"necro\" production. Fenriz and Nocturno Culto are now embracing their influences and shitty musicianship rather than mask it with overdone aesthetics. The vocals have also gotten much stronger as they've went along and this represents their best approach yet. According to what I've read, they split songwriting duties 50/50 and it worked great! They each have some vocals on this album, too.\n\nIt could be argued that they've learned to play their instruments better or at least use them now. Either way, this is very minimal ROCKING DA FUCK OUT. The drumming is much more alive and upfront than in many previous releases...which is the instrument I was mainly thinking of regarding their apparent skill levels.\n\nThe production is far from clean. The guitars have a slight rawness and the drumkit has a garage quality to it. There is some bass impact to the sound, thankfully. Those who have seen the YouTube video \"Darkthrone Studioreport\" may remember a certain oven, along with comments of pizza and \"necro\" production. These are two metal musicians I'd definitely get along with great and that's part of the fun here. They're just average dudes with a sense of humor doing what they love.\n\nCheese is in abundance on this album. I didn't think I'd like it when I first turned it on. But then something strange started happening. I smiled. It was a big smile and it kept happening during the rest of the album. God damn it. I even laughed a couple times. Yet this obviously isn't a \"joke\". It's just really fun music! I guess some people might be upset that they stopped attempting to capture the magic of the \"Peaceville Three\", but I for one am very glad they went this way. This is one of the few Darkthrone albums I can legitimately enjoy from beginning to end. The riffs on Oath Minus are absolutely godly! Or would that be UN-godly?\n\nBasically, instead of rehashing the same bullshit over and over in total failure, Darkthrone has possibly invented a new fucking genre with their last three albums. Heavy Blackened Speed Crust n' Roll. I guess that's a weird phrasing. I just conjured myself up an image of burnt, lead-infused biscuits strapped to a jetpack. I suppose it actually works...\n",
        "\nUnder a Funeral Moon, great name for a BM release. This album has, up today, 12 reviews and an average of 92%, I guess it\u2019s all said, so I\u2019ll do the same I did for \u201cA Blaze in...\u201d, I\u2019ll talk about my feelings about this release. I consider Darkthrone one of the most important metal band of the last 25 years, and that is because of their first 5 albums, the rest is disposable. In fact they should split up after \u201cPanzerfaust\u201d and remain as a cult band for eternity. But hey, they are fucking Darkthrone and don\u2019t really care about these things.\n\nNow on the album, the first thing I\u2019ve noticed when listened to it was that the production was even worst than in A Blaze..., I know BM is all about dark and evil atmosphere and that low production helps a lot to create it, but in this case the guitars sound too buzzy, to thin, and this, on a first listen, really defies the seriousness of the release. This is the reason why it took me so long to understand the music inside, I had to get used to the veil covering the main idea of this release. After that I understood that this is one of the most hateful albums by Darkthrone. \n\nThe riffs, oh the riffs are so great, now you have pure Black Metal riffs, not DM disguised as BM, and the difference is quite clear. I don\u2019t really know id Zephyrous was important at this time, according to the music it doesn\u2019t sound like he was, but if he has something to do in the creation of the guitar work in this album, he should come back (and by the way, erase this entire new crust punk thing Darkthone is on right now). The drumming is rather simple but effective, as usual, plenty of blast beats and some slower moments. Note that slower doesn\u2019t mean bland, there are no bland moments on this album. \n\nOne aspect that is to stand out is the vocal work. I\u2019m not sure who sang on this album, but he did a hell of a job, I love the power these vocals have, and the intense hatred they transmit. The entire atmosphere created by the melodic approach of the guitar work is destroyed (in a good way) by the vocals and the relentlessness of the drums.\n\nStand out tracks, mmm, once again all are good tracks, but special mentions for the mid paced strength of the over seven minutes \u201cTo Walk in Infernal Fields\u201d, the power of the track that gives the name to the album, and finally, the nice drum pattern in \u201cCrossing the Triangle of Flames\u201d\n\nThis is another album to have in your collection, if you don\u2019t have it, you are a fool, dare to discover it, and if you already have it, give it a spin once in a while, you\u2019ll see it can still surprise you.\n",
        "\nI don\u2019t think Darkthrone just changed two times its genre during the career. The first demo was unquestionably black/thrash in old Hellhammer style but with the shrieks and the a bit heavier black metal component. So, they already had a sort of knowledge in this genre that was far before the release of their second full-length in 1992. After awhile I believe they were so fascinated by the new direction metal had taken that they decided to follow it, filling their sound with the death metal elements. The death metal groups, at the time, were coming also for the near Sweden with the very first demos by the end of the 80s and thanks to them, Darkthrone passed in the death metal side, before, as you all know, turning black again with the second album. \n\nThis last demo in their career was a sort of prelude for the first album to come and shows several similarities in songwriting and style. We begin with \u201cWatchtower\u201d and its first, heavy and mid-paced section to restart on the brutality of the up tempo. The various stop and go parts acquire a lot of power while we can already notice the chainsaw guitars distortion. The vocals are generally on the borderline between the death and the black because they always conserve a hint of the past influences and they are not easily labelling. However, the power at the instruments by this band is truly remarkable, even during the various doom parts that fill the songs here. The very first gore/death metal influences of the time play a truly important role. \n\nThe musicianship of this young band is also well-displayed in several duets by the guitars and the less impulsive sections. \u201cAccumulation Of Generalization\u201d has a lot of evident solo bass sections and the more energetic riffage of the guitars. Here the complexity is more present and it comes along the natural fast restarts. By the way, on this song what really counts is the doomy and massive atmosphere to create a truly dark scenario. \u201cSempiternal Past / Presence View Sepulchrality\u201d has a lot of riffs and tempo changes and marks the return of the vocals. The vicious fast parts are really out of the blue and we always don\u2019t know what to expect because they are always well-stuck among a forest of more complicated and less impulsive riffs. \n\n\u201cIconoclasm Sweeps Cappadocia\u201d was not included on the first press of this demo and we can hear the difference in terms of production. The tracks before weren\u2019t astonishing in sounds and here we have found a sort of fuzzy and dark production. Everything is a bit \u201cdistant\u201d in sounds and with a strange, almost ritual reverb. The vocals are growly and always surrounded by the echo. The style and the music is more or less the same in structures for the duets and the furious, sudden restarts. All things considered, I still prefer the first demo for its catchiness and originality, but this one too is not bad! Here they play death metal and it\u2019s quite different but the structures are now mature and they were ready for the first album.\n",
        "\nDarkthrone are one of the original Norwegian black metal bands, responsible for forming far too many imitators. In recent history, they have polarized their fanbase by converting to a black \u2018n\u2019 roll sound over their raw black metal. Dark Thrones and Black Flags, as the reference to the band Black Flag suggests, is a continuation in their musically controversial path. With punk rhythms and reckless black metal riffing, Darkthrone have orchestrated yet another black \u2018n\u2019 roll full-length.\n\nThis album differs to the previous album F.O.A.D. predominantly because the black \u2018n\u2019 roll is substantiated by heavy metal influences in the guitars and even Nocturno Culto\u2019s vocals, as evident on tracks such as \u2018Oath Minus\u2019, \u2018Blacksmith of the North\u2019 and \u2018Hanging Out in Haiger\u2019. Fenriz varies his drumming technique throughout, employing common black metal skills, simplistic punk rhythms and catchy beats. The title track is an unpredictable instrumental, threatening and straightforwardly the most atmospheric song on the release.\n\nThe weakest point of this album is a deficiency in fresh ideas. \u2018Hiking Metal Punks\u2019 sounds suspiciously similar to \u2018Canadian Metal\u2019, although retains a fair dosage of identity in other ways. \u2018Norway in September\u2019 is secure as the most black metal anthem on this album but offers nothing to seize the listener\u2019s interest. Similarly, \u2018Witch Ghetto\u2019 is typical of Darkthrone\u2019s black \u2018n\u2019 roll legacy and, whilst memorable, fails to accomplish more than filler work.\n\nDarkthrone have formatted their sound differently, paving further progress in their development by splicing their punky black \u2018n\u2019 roll with traditional heavy metal. The results are commendable and the album overall is a catchy affair with sing-along choruses and highly entertaining lyrics. This is a definite recommendation for fans of these Norwegians' later endeavours.\n\nOriginally written for www.soundshock.net\n",
        "\nTransilvanian Hunger, one of the most cited works in the black metal genre. The sound on the album is without a doubt one of the most replicated in black metal, along with Burzums black metal albums. Anyone interested at all in the genre would do well to give this album a thorough listen for it has influenced many bands, though the sound and atmosphere has never been fully replicated to sound quite as good as the original.\n\nThe formula of this album is very simple, and also very effective. This is one of the finest examples of riff based black metal. Songs feature a very small amount of riffs, usually two main riffs (verse and chorus) and sometimes a bridge or middle section riff. The riffs don't vary, they aren't expanded upon and they are just repeated ad infinitum. With such a simple formula I think it is safe to say that the success and effectiveness of this album are not derived from the song structures nor the song writing, but rather from the riffs themselves. The repetition is an essential factor to the album, but without the excellent riffs we would not have the classic that Transilvanian Hunger is.\n\nThe riffs are perfectly written, usually extremely simple in nature. The whole albums centers around simplicity. There is never an unexpected moment (perhaps the ending of Over Fjell Og Gjennom Turner is a little abrupt) and all the songs follow the same formula. Mid to fast paced tempo, a simplistic blast beat and some riffing over the top. The riffs are mainly tremolo picked diads (two note chords) and usually change about once a measure, in other words nothing really amazing. Except that the actual result is amazing. I don't think I could find a better riff than the main theme of Transilvanian Hunger, a riff that is so simple it is amazing how well it works. The riff basically does a harmony on one pedal note (the lower note) and then for the second half of the riff switches the pedal note, giving the harmony a dark twist that is ingenious in its simplicity,\n\nThe drumming is something that should be noted as well. It is perfectly in the pocket, and what is more it sounds extremely natural and organic. A lot of modern black metal is grossly triggered, especially the kick drum, and the authentic low and round sound of the kick is a wonderful sound in the mix of this album. The snare drum is mixed very low and meshes in with the hats and ride. Cymbals stand out to call attention to changes in riff or to mark where a riff repeats. The drumming does little more than play the same blast beat throughout most of the CD, adding more monotony and repetition to the sound, and also giving all eight songs a very cohesive sound. Vocals are similar, they sound extremely organic and raspy, probably the best performance of Nocturno Culto captured on a record. The range is pretty low, no annoying high shrieks of any sort, and once again the range is rather monotonous, not varying much in pitch.\n\nSo why does all this monotony work? Apart from the excellent riffing and vocal delivery the reason is the production. As I have already stated the album is extremely organic in sound, and is centered mostly around the mids of the frequency range, which is why I encourage you to seek out an original recording of this album. The remaster (from 2001 I think) has made the treble levels higher and has made the album sound to synthetic and electronic for my taste, which is why this actually one of the few cases where I listen to the actual CD and not mp3, because simply put, I think this is one of the few cases where listening to the original release in the format it was meant to be listened to makes a difference worth paying attention to. The production is so important to the atmosphere that it is worth getting out your cd player to listen to this one.\n\nPut in another way, this is an atmospheric masterpiece. Not in the same way that some bands are atmospheric with the whole string ensemble orchestral sound, but because the production and sound of the album are such an integral part of it. The riffing is superb, the drumming is furiously consistent, and the vocal delivery is on par. Essential listening for all metal fans.\n",
        "\nLet me first say that I am a heavy metal fan. Black metal may be my sub-genre of choice but I'm just a heavy metal maniac in general. And to an extent I agree with Fenriz's whole 'modern metal sucks' attitude, but there comes a time when enough is enough. I absolutely love the old Darkthrone records, everything from Soulside Journey to Sardonic Wrath. All of them have their charm. Then when The Cult is Alive came out I listened once and immediately loved it. It was so catchy and the riffs were fucking grand. Nocturno Culto sounded great. His vocals were as raw and harsh as ever and Fenriz's drumming was outstanding (for him anyway.) Every song was bad ass. I was hoping the next album would be just as good, but goddamnit if I wasn't wrong. F.O.A.D. was for the most part, crap. There were a few good songs on it. Canadian Metal was awesome, so was These Shores Are Damned and Wisdom of the Dead. The rest was just pure garbage. Look, I know Fenriz loves metal but does he have to fucking write about it EVERY FUCKING SONG?! \n\nI tend to dislike bands that write about the greatness of heavy metal in their lyrics. Manowar is a good example. I cannot stand Manowar. Their music is alright at times, but their lyrics kill it for me. The same is happening with Darkthrone. The music is ok but for the most part the lyrics are really bad. Fenriz used to be a really good lyricist. Just read his lyrics on anything from A Blaze in the Northern Sky or hell, even Plaguewielder or Hate Them. The man knew what sounded good. Now he just sits and drinks beer all day, smokes five cartons of cigarettes and writes about how much he loves metal, just in ten different ways. \n\nNow here is the new Darkthrone album. I knew immediately what it would be like, but I still decided to buy it. I pop it in my stereo and the first song starts. Well this is a good riff. It sounds similar to something they would have written back in 94. The drums come in and it still is kicking ass. Then Fenriz's vocals start and I know it is the same shit. With lyrics like \"In the depths of the underground, through the nurseries of real metal sound\" you know what you're in for. Not again. Oh god not again! Don't get me wrong. The music is fucking brilliant, but it's the damn lyrics that ruin it. Vocals/lyrics are, to me, important to an album and I'm sorry, but I just don't like this. You can say that I'm stuck back in 1993 but damnit, this is just bad. Death of All Oaths is up next and this is a Nocturno Culto song. I've noticed that he tends to write better lyrics these days. This song sounds like old school thrash and I'm really liking it, but... what happened to his vocals? Nocturno Culto used to have maybe the harshest voice in all of black metal, and he sounded his best in a decade on The Cult is Alive, but now he sounds, dare I say it, yet again, utterly crappy. You could notice it starting on F.O.A.D. but even then he still had that harsh, gravelly tone to his voice, but now he sounds bad, really bad for the most part. Damnit! \n\nThe rest of the album follows suit. Hiking Metal Punks is a decent song, but yet again the lyrics are shit. The chorus is ok though, I'll give em that. Nocturno's songs tend to be the more serious ones and for the most part, the better ones musically. Fenriz needs to stick to drumming and let Culto write all the music. \n\nIt's funny, but everything I just said about this album, and the last one for that matter, is exactly what the band want you to think. They could care less about what we think. They just keep on doing their thing, and I can respect that, because after all, if you're not creating music for yourself you are just a slave to commercialism, but come on guys, the gig is up. Writing, recording and releasing a new album every year is the major pitfall of this band. Maybe if they took a little more time to write the albums they would be much, much better. Oh and Fenriz needs to stop singing, NOW! I don't want to listen to drunk Elvis impersonators, really I don't. You know what else is funny too? When the next Darkthrone album is released, I will buy it. I do not know why, I just know that I will end up buying it. Maybe it's in the hope that they will find the spark again to write an album at least along the lines of Sardonic Wrath. I would be most happy with that. But until then, I have only one more question. Who the fuck is the dungeon shaker?\n",
        "\nWhat the hell? The Winds They Called The Dungeon Shaker is a very odd song! It's filled with ATMOSPHERE, that's right, Atmosphere. It's a strange Atmospheric Post-rock version of later Darkthrone, with the added influence of \"The trilogy\" of classic Darkthrone albums in there. As the first song it's hugely misleading, as if Darkthrone sort of said \"Look! It's Black Metal! Now listen in dissapointment, all you Transylvanian Hunger obsessives as we completely ruin your hopes by changing the entire album.\" It's odd but utterly fantastic. Death of all Oaths somehow reminds me of 80's Metallica, vaguely. Metallica which had been mangled through the Darkthrone mincer to achieve that odd sound and straggled production. A great song.\n\nI should probably stress right now that is about the end of the experimentation on this album. After this is good old new Darkthrone (If that makes sense)! The album toes the line that \"F.O.A.D\" drew in the sand so well, that every song on this album could've been off \"F.O.A.D.\", it is a natural progression (Or is that regression, in Darkthrone's case?). The only new factor is the increasing Doom element. Most of the songs have slower, more heavier parts than usual. It could be said that the line toed here is smack bang in the middle of Thrash and Doom metal (But not groove).\n\nHiking Metal Punks is utterly amazing. Nothing else for it. This song is the \"Canadian Metal\" of this album. The one that will get all the press and attention as well as getting a lot of criticism for the \"Punks\" part of the title. It is such a great and catchy song, possibly my favourite on the song. The solo is very Maiden-like which is surprising. It's such an awesome harmony and nice to see a bit of melody in a Darkthrone song!\n\nBlacksmith of The North starts with a bit of ambience, which is nice and certainly adds something to the song. The song is good, but not a stand-out, I'd say. Norway in September, written quite obviously in Norway in September, is a great song, the black metal riffage on show is quite awesome. The title strikes me as odd, and will probably take a lot of flak. I was expecting a more Dunkelheit-y doom song, which it provides near the end of the song, with yet more Atmospheric, slow guitar work. But the false ending, with the double bass is simply awesome, and the small thrash segment after it is simply amazing, so intense, and just makes you want to headbang furiously. One of the standouts, definitely.\n\nGrizzly Trade is yet another song with slow-burning doom elements. With tribal drumming and haunting riffs, it's utterly astounding. I wish they could just do a whole song of this stuff, they could pull it off so well. Not only that, but maybe a song in the style of Reverend Bizarre or Electric Wizard. With Darkthrone's grim production, it would be an utter revelation. This song is about the closest you're going to get to a full blown doom metal song by Darkthrone. Hanging out in Haiger starts out with an loveably crap drum solo. The drums just seem oddly out of time quite a bit. The riffs are good, but a bit disjointed if you ask me. It feels all very funny to me. More of a riff-collection then a song.\n\nDark Thrones and Black Flags is, sadly, an instrumental. I was hoping for some lyrics about how Metalheads can like Punk and vice versa, in that typical Fenriz manner. But it is not to be. This continues more of the doom element, this is ALL slow, seeing as it's only one riff and is only 2 minutes long. Launchpad to Nothingness is a good song, continuing to plod along in the same style as the rest of the songs, with more of that dreaded Doom element, and fuckloads of atmosphere. The ending is chilling, so repetitive, yet hypnotic. It's 2 notes but that's more than enough to take you into a trance, another world.\n\nWitch Ghetto, apart from having the greatest track title of all time, is AMAZING. It takes a while in coming, but when you get to Witch Ghetto, you are rewarded. This is possibly the most punky song on the album. Before this album's release, the album title had many people thinking that this was going to be an exercise in Punk along the lines of \"The Cult Is Alive\", but it has been contained to the confines of this song along. Along with HIking Metal Punks, this is my favourite song on the album. It's so bang-your-head-alongingly good. It's good to see Darkthrone keeping up the speed for a whole song here.\n\nAlthough, there are a few cons. The fade out is very fucking annoying. The first 3 songs all fade out. It's annoyingly consistent. This doesn't help the fact that some of the songs seem to mush together, all sounding the same. Hell, they all sound like songs off \"F.O.A.D\" which is even more fucking confusing!\nAlso, actually, I can't really think of many cons at all to this album. I fucking love it.\n\nAs a whole, this album is very good. VERY fucking good. There is so many great songs, it's unbelievable, and Hiking Metal Punks and Witch Ghetto are two of the greatest songs Darkthrone have ever fucking made. But is it as good as \"F.O.A.D.\"? No. I think when \"F.O.A.D.\" came out, it was such a shock to my system that I instantly fell in love with it. This isn't as shocking, despite having some new elements. Maybe over time it will ascend the ranks. But for now, it's 3rd in the league of Darkthrone, behind \"Soulside Journey\" and ahead of \"...Hunger\". Yes, that's right, ahead of \"...Hunger\". \n\nNew Darkthrone kicks old Darkthrone in the stones, to be honest. To all you people suffering the Transylvanian Hangover who still think good music ended in 1996 with \"Filosofem\", it might seem an unorthodox concept. But, to be honest, that's when Black Metal really got going. The paths taken by each individual band (Such as Mayhem's ultra technical, darker turn or Satyricon's foray into rockier territory) is infinitely more interesting than the crummy old demos and debut albums which all followed a very basic format. I still believe Burzum's greatest album was \"Daudi Baldrs\", always have and always will. I worship at the realm of \"Grand Declaration of War\" and \"Now, Diabolical\". So, it will come as no surprise to you when I say that I prefer new Darkthrone to old, as it's an infinitely more interesting concept. It's nice to see the slower side to Darkthrone, and the addition of atmospheric and melodic parts is very welcomed. Variety, as they say, is the spice of life. Well, in Black Metal terms, this is a full blown Chicken Vindaloo.\n\nDownload; \"Hiking Metal Punks\", \"Witch Ghetto\", \"Norway in September\", \"Dark Thrones And Black Flags\", \"The Winds They Called The Dungeon Shaker\".\n",
        "\nThe masters of the riff are back again. So soon, you ask? Well, it appears that Fenriz and Culto have taken the whole old-school values thing completely to heart, and are going to give us a new album every year. But hey, who's complaining other than Transilvanian Hunger purists?\n\n'Dark Thrones and Black Flags' follows on pretty closely from last year's 'F.O.A.D.', and if you enjoyed that last blast of black aggression, you're going to find plenty to love on this new disc. It's all still here: the low-fi \"Necrohell II\" production, the black metal-tinged with-old school metal-tinged with-punk-tinged with-whatever the hell the gruesome duo feel like, and the great 80s-esque cover. I'm wondering whether this fellow on the front is going to become some kind of Darkthrone Eddie...\n\nStill, as far as the music goes, you can expect to hear a pretty similar bag to 'F.O.A.D.', but everything here appears somewhat more refined and consistent than the last record. That's not to say all these tracks sound the same - they most definitely don't - but the whole thing just feels a bit more polished and complete than on 'F.O.A.D.' (an album which I also loved). \n\nApparently, for 'Dark Thrones and Black Flags', Fenriz (here credited as Gylve Fenris \"mao tse tung rock\" Nagell) and Nocturno Culto pretty much split the writing of everything 50/50, which results in a pretty damn varied, interesting record. From the get-go, you can tell which tracks Fenriz had the biggest hand in penning, with a succession of 80s headbangers peppering the disc, usually revolving around his favourite lyrical topic: \"REAL METALLL!\". These are amongst my favourite tracks on the disc, kicking off with the tremolo-riffing of 'The Winds they Called the Dungeon Shaker', through 'Hiking Metal Punks' (a great drunken shout-along if ever there was one), the demented screaming of 'Hanging Out In Haiger', and the closer, 'Witch Ghetto'. If you hated Fenriz's previous yells and Tom G. Warrior stylings, this album definitely isn't for you, because you're going to hear a whole lot of them. For the rest of us, you won't be able to get enough!\n\nThe Culto-centric, more traditional tracks are also great, with plenty of icy riffing and sparse drumming to keep most black metallers happy. These tracks are similarly strong, and I really can't find any weak spots on the disc. My personal favourite of these is 'Norway in September', the longest track here, and a real work of black art. The song incorporates a variety of interesting parts and riffs, including a creepy atmospheric section in the middle which could have come straight from the soundtrack of Culto's recent film project 'The Misanthrope' (you'll know it when you hear it).\n\nOverall, this is probably the best output from the Norwegian veterans we've seen since the heady early Peaceville days. It takes everything that makes Darkthrone's newer approach so great, and hones it to perfection. Of course, those of you stuck in '93 waiting for a new album in that style aren't going to like this record, as it won't be \"grim\", \"tr00\" or \"kvlt\" enough for you. But if you have more diverse tastes and are open to Darkthrone's recent output, this 40-minute thrasher will have you banging your head like a trip to Haiger.\n",
        "\nDarkthrone is a band that is not at all opposed to tweaking or even completely changing their sound from album to album. As many know, in the early years of the band they changed from technical death metal to black metal and then years later they turned into more of a heavy/thrash/old-school black metal/punk/\u201devil rock\u201d band. There are many fans of the band that enjoy practically every era to some extent, but for the most part, Darkthrone fans today are typically divided into groupings of fans of the three above eras. Personally, I enjoy all three eras of Darkthrone, although that is not to say that their discography is flawless as they have a couple releases in the middle of their discography that I am not exactly a huge fan of.\n\n\nWith that said, if you enjoyed what you heard on F.O.A.D. and The Cult is Alive, there is a decent chance you\u2019ll like what you hear on Dark Thrones and Black Flags. However, if you\u2019re still bitter that Darkthrone dropped the corpsepaint and/or the traditional second wave black metal style (that they helped create) behind and didn\u2019t once crack a smile in agreement while listening to the last couple albums, then you, my friend, will find nothing to smile about this time around either as this album more or less continues the tongue and cheek, old-school metal and punk worship of the last two albums.\n\n\nOf course, calling Dark Thrones and Black Flags a carbon copy of the last two albums would be a mistake as I see plenty of differences between this album and its two older siblings. For example, The Cult is Alive showed the band increasing their already huge punk influence to new heights and F.O.A.D. added onto this sound by including a great deal of old-school heavy metal into the fold as well. Dark Thrones and Black Flags doesn\u2019t necessarily add anything \u201cnew\u201d to their sound in a major way this time around, but rather shifts their emphasis to different parts in their sound that they created on F.O.A.D. by way of becoming even more of a heavy metal/punk rock band. This would be 100% okay with me if the album turned out to be near the same quality as the last album, but sadly, I found Dark Thrones and Black Flags to be inferior to F.O.A.D. but that does not mean that this album is bad at all, but rather that F.O.A.D. was just that great of an album.\n\n\nBut what did I find so appealing about F.O.A.D.? I believe what I found so appealing about the previous album lies in the awesome anthem-like songs, brilliant riffs, highly atmospheric moments, and beautifully minimalist, yet headbangable lead guitar work. The sad thing about Dark Thrones and Black Flags though, is that all of these elements I loved so much about F.O.A.D. are not in abundance on this album. A major difference in the writing process this time around is that both Fenriz and Nocturno Culto have an equal amount of songs that they have contributed to the album. While both writers typically deliver badass riffing, I believe that Fenriz is the one typically responsibly for the anthem-like songs whereas Nocturno Culto is the one usually placing more of an emphasis on the above-mentioned songs with heavily atmospheric moments and beautifully minimalist, yet headbangable lead guitar work that often ends up in trippy territory. I\u2019m typically against album reviews that describe every song, but I believe due to how different most of the songs sound from one another on this album, I find this to be exceptional.\n\n\nDark Thrones and Black Flags begins with a Fenriz song called \u201cThe Winds They Called the Dungeon Shaker\u201d which follows the tradition of kick-ass opening tracks on Darkthrone albums. This pro-metal anthem is also notable as the chorus is not only simplistic and catchy, but also features Fenriz breaking into a vocal styling that may remind some of his days in Isengard as he shouts \u201cthe Dungeon Shakerrrrr.\u201d The song also breaks into a really atmospheric part that breaks into some nice guitar leads. \u201cHiking Metal Punks\u201d is another awesome, anthem-like song, complete with a catchy chorus, Venom/Warfare-styled riffing, and an awesome Iron Maiden-esque solo. \u201cHanging Out in Haiger\u201d is another anthem (noticing a pattern?) as well and while it is a fun song complete with vocals reminiscent of King Diamond at his most \u201cnormal-sounding,\u201d and even features some sweet melodic riffing that sounds right out of a late \u201870s/early \u201880s heavy metal record, it somewhat pales in comparison to the two previously mentioned songs written and sang by Fenriz. The other two songs that Fenriz contributed to the record are \u201cDark Thrones and Black Flags\u201d and \u201cWitch Ghetto.\u201d The instrumental title track isn\u2019t bad by any means, but it just didn\u2019t serve much of a purpose to my ears and the oddly-titled \u201cWitch Ghetto\u201d is a pseudo-anthem of sorts that closes the album and would make a 1980s Tom G. Warrior proud.\n\n\nAnd then there are the songs written by Nocturno Culto; the source of the drugged out songs that sometimes feel as if Tony Iommi and the trippiest of doom metal and NWOBHM guitarists have bestowed upon him their magical knowledge of the riff! Nocturno Culto\u2019s best offerings on Dark Thrones and Black Flags are \u201cDeath of All Oaths (Oath Minus)\u201d and \u201cNorway in September\u201d which both make me involuntarily grin like a jackass due to the amount of badass riffing and atmosphere. Actually, I must say that \u201cNorway in September\u201d just may be my favorite song on the album as it in some ways reminds me of \u201cThe Banners of Old\u201d which was probably my favorite song off of F.O.A.D. The two songs are similar due to both songs having slow doomy riffs that build up into really simplistic, yet powerful guitar leads with very atmospheric moments surrounding said guitar work. The main difference between the two is that \u201cNorway in September\u201d rips into an all-out thrash metal assault! Try not to hurt your neck listening to this one! \u201cBlacksmith of the North (Keep that Ancient Fire)\u201d, while having an undeniably awesome song title, somehow fails to live up to said awesomeness. The riffs aren\u2019t bad or offensive to my ears by any means and it even features a really nice, almost psychedelic-sounding part for a very brief period. It just\u2026 lacked something that stopped it from being anything more than just \u201cokay.\u201d \u201cGrizzly Trade\u201d is also fairly notable as it is a catchy little song that at times sounds like a bizarre mixture of Under a Funeral Moon with Darkthrone\u2019s newer sound! The last song that Nocturno Culto contributes to the album is the slow-paced rocker \u201cLaunchpad to Nothingness\u201d which has a really cool main riff and while not a bad song at all, compared to some of the other songs on the album, it\u2019s quite forgettable.\n\n\nIn short, Dark Thrones and Black Flags is a great record that escapes reaching a slightly higher level of quality due to a lack of consistency amongst some of the songs. So, if you enjoyed the last two albums, more specifically F.O.A.D., there is a chance you may not like this album as much as those, but by the same token you may like it a lot more than F.O.A.D. in contrast with me, but you\u2019ll certainly enjoy it more than all of the zit-faced basement dwellers that don\u2019t like black metal (or metal in general) made before 1991.\n",
        "\nDarkthrone seem to be one of those bands where it takes a while for people to catch on to what is going on with them. After their change from death metal to black metal it took several albums for Darkthrone to assert themselves as a force in the Norwegian Black Metal scene among legendary names such as Burzum and Mayhem. Once a few albums had been released in the new black metal style most people began to appreciate the new direction. I would have to say that F.O.A.D. is a new starting point for Darkthrone, and that I would not be surprised if after a few albums the bands new style is being praised throughout the (pathetic) black metal scene.\n\nLets face it, Darkthrone have been ripping themselves off for years, since Panzerfaust in fact. Of course albums like Ravishing Grimness have been genuinely good efforts, but in general the band has only been able to maintain a mediocre (by their own standards) level of quality on their albums since Panzerfaust. The change in direction is a welcome one, since we all know there will always be hundreds of bands trying to be Darkthrone anyway, so there will be no shortage in albums that copy the old Darkthrone even though the masters themselves are moving on.\n\nThis album is very decidedly not black metal in the modern sense. Perhaps Darkthrone are going back to what the genre evolved from on this album. The music is dirty, ballsy, and heavy, often with some thrash influences. This can be easily supporter by the fact that most of the music that Fenriz listens to these days is (said by himself) old thrash and heavy metal, mostly from the 70s and 80s. The sound comes through here, and the influence is welcome. Sure the people duped into thinking Xasthur is what black metal has always been will be confused by this album. But if we look at albums from the earlier days of black metal this CD may not seem as odd as most think it is. Just look at Quintessence on Panzerfaust, it is a very similar song to what can be found on this album.\n\nThe production is typical Darkthrone, drums sounds as if they were recorded with no more than two mics with loud open hi hats and very basic rhythmic patters. The tempos are mid paced and fully suited for headbanging and having a few beers to. Some are a bit slower, and this tempos give us a chance to hear some bass work, something not very common in a Darkthrone album. The guitars are dirty and distorted, playing simple riffs that use their basic driving rhythms to really make songs heavy. The vocals are the most interesting aspect, they are pretty high in the mix, and are not the usual growls of Nocturno Culto. The growls are still there but there are also some clean vocals that appear and are used to make the old school sound even more apparent in the mix. There is a falsetto part on \"Canadian Metal\" (I think it was this track) that is so kick ass I can just see Nocturno and Fenriz rocking out in their cabin with a couple beers playing old 80s vinyls.\n\nMaybe this new attitude of the two is what has been such a hard thing to accept for new fans on this album. It seems they are not trying to make \"grim\" albums anymore (they always were two of the most laid back guys in the black metal scene). They are trying to instead pay some homage to the music they listened to back in their early days that inspired them to start their musical career in the first place. Doing this, they may have anticipated a backlash from the strictly black metal part of the fanbase, and perhaps this albums title is addressed to those listeners \"Fvck Off And Die!\".\n",
        "\nIf there is one thing that would appear to be an oxymoron it\u2019s the idea of Darkthrone putting out a best of compilation. A self-respecting fan of this band would sooner sell himself on the streets of Soho at 6 pence a pop than be without their first 4 albums at his immediate disposal. However, a compilation carrying a large collection of songs that can\u2019t or, at the time, couldn\u2019t have been acquired is another matter. When approaching this particular album, you have to see it more as a collection of rarities than a best of; the fact that some of the band\u2019s classic tracks from their more famous albums thus becomes something of a nice bonus to aid the listener in getting into the concept of the band\u2019s pre-black metal demos and performances.\n\nInsofar as the best of portion of this release, the band did an excellent job of selecting the stand outs of each album, particularly the \u201cTransylvanian Hunger\u201d selections. The principle flaw in that album was that when taken as a whole, it was a flat and near one-dimensional listen. But when taking these songs individually, they are a lot easier to appreciate in their unique blend of melodic minimalism and darkened atmospheres. \u201cI En Hall Med Flesk Og Mj\u00f8d\u201d in particular takes on its own individual character as it stretches out a singular chord for 80% of the extended main riff, frustrating the listener\u2019s desire for harmonic cadence until the very end where a sudden three chord pass marks the end of the idea. When heard without the other seven similar sounding songs, each song establishes its own identity, as they contrast very heavily with the surrounding songs from the other 2 albums of the black trilogy and the pre-black material.\n\nIndeed, the pretense of pointlessness that this album might otherwise carry completely vanishes when you take note of how heavily the material from the 4 various albums contrast with each other. The clean cut yet vintage 80s sounding death/thrash of \u201cSoulside Journey\u201d has a sense of commonality with the black metal material, particularly with \u201cA Blaze In The Northern Sky\u201d, despite the radically different approach in mixing technique. Nocturno\u2019s lead breaks are a good deal shorter and simpler on the latter album, Dag Nilsen\u2019s bass is not as heavy and raunchy but it\u2019s still recognizable, and Fenriz\u2019s drums employ more blast beats than thrash beats but still sound pretty close in both cases. The material from \u201cUnder A Funeral Moon\u201d is actually the most distinctive of all in its snowy, almost entirely static oriented delivery, and harkens back heavily to the primordial origins of the genre established on the Bathory\u2019s debut and Sodom\u2019s pre-1986 releases.\n\nBut the real point of interest here is the non-album rarities that have been included, particularly the live recordings. Most of these are in instrumental form, save the live version of \u201cNeptune Towers\u201d, but all of them prove unequivocally that the reason this band never plays live has nothing to do with an inability to pull the stuff off in that venue. Even without all of the mixing and vocal doubling that probably made his voice sound so much like a demonic tyrannosaurus on a few select spots of \u201cSoulside Journey\u201d, Nocturno\u2019s vocals sound really large and powerful. The music is pulled off perfectly, including the agitated guitar solos, and is thankfully without all of the crowd noise that you often get with live recordings. The stuff from the demos is very different from even the \u201cSoulside Journey\u201d material, almost becoming technically oriented enough to sound like an instrumental 70s progressive rock meets Sepultura\u2019s \u201cMorbid Visions\u201d style, particularly in the case of the 9 minute riff fest \u201cSnowfall\u201d. Even though in a few places the guitars either phase in and out or even cut out completely on one side from the flawed recording methods of the day, the song is highly enjoyable and a necessary step in the evolutionary ladder that led to their ingenious debut studio effort.\n\nAlthough this is a great listen when taken by itself, rather than a compilation of material from other albums, the only point in picking this up is the live material. The demo tracks were another reason until the release of \u201cFrostland Tapes\u201d, which is definitely an essential pick up for anyone interested in the origins of this pioneering 2nd wave black metal outfit. This is more of a sample pack for some newcomer to the band who may or may not actually get into the black material than anything else and is only recommended as such. If you\u2019re too poor to own the entire discography, at the very least, pick up \u201cA Blaze In The Northern Sky\u201d, as it provides a versatile listen and can function equally well as a gateway to appreciating the later material put out by this band.\n\nOriginally submitted to (www.metal-observer.com) on October 12, 2008.\n",
        "\nThe first Darkthrone demo is one of the very first examples of primitive black metal. In those years any band that wanted to play this genre must look back to bands like Hellhammer and Bathory and so it was for this young band too. Despite being mostly swedish death metal with the first album, here the major influences are from the early black metal. They didn\u2019t know what this demo would have represented in the future and I think they were more worried about having fun at playing this necro stuff. The fact is that now this demo is a true rarity and a almost obligatory stopover to understand the meaning of \u201ctrue black metal\u201d in the 80s.\n\nThe title track is at the beginning and begins with a sort of intro made of scary growls and screams to turn into music with doom passages and fast restarts. The production is not awful, but surely not a good one; everything sounds so cold and primordial but listening carefully each instrument is well audible. The doom passages are still bound to a raw Black Sabbath style, but with a heavier guitar tune and more morbid passages. The vocals are screamed and so echoing. This is the thing that could annoy a bit because the reverb is an obstacle to the music and it\u2019s difficult to hear it well.\n\nThe fast parts, like also in \u201cWinds of Triton\u201d are made of fast up-tempo parts and they almost reach the level of blast beats but not yet. Everything is made to be primordial and it\u2019s great like this. Some of the drums beats on the mighty \u201cForest of Darkness\u201d are echoing too and this time the vocals are truly distorted. Here the Hellhammer influences are truly heavy and evident. The riffage is essential in these songs and more in open chords style, conserving a punk attitude in lots of parts. The atmosphere these young guys (16-17 years old more or less) create it\u2019s unmatchable and who cares if they are not technical or smart. They are Darkthrone and only posers and wankers can criticise them for being impolite. \n\nFenriz and Zephyrous are great and the following \u201cOdyssey of Freedom\u201d shows some thrash metal passages too, mostly referred to the drums parts and the bass drum. There are always the doom passages but the songs\u2019 structures are always quite catchy even if not too dynamic yet. Actually, some parts seem to be bound together with the glue but the clean arpeggios we can find in each song are truly cold and amazing. They already had the will and the skills to put out primordial and cold pieces of extreme metal. The last \u201cDay of The Dead\u201d is hyper doom. The refrain is one of the sickest things ever at the time while the rest is like a slow march by the instruments with the omnipresent arpeggios and freezing stops where the lead guitars parts are more evident. By the end we can find also amazing and unexpected more melodic and melancholic passages by the guitars.\n\nAll in all, this is a very influential release. It doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s too raw, too bounded to a certain form of early black/death because at the time that was the genre you had to play to be extreme. This little demo, like the other ones by this band, was very influential for the bands in the northern countries that would have wanted to play heavy stuff in the following years.\n",
        "\nThis was the very first album I heard by Darkthrone, many years ago.\nUpon first hearing the album I knew that this was an album that I would come to love. Ironically though, I didn't quite get it at first. It hasn't got the apparent brutality of other iconic second wave black metal releases (such as Mayhem's \"De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas\") which is mainly due to a very thin production of the guitars and a heavily unbalanced drum-mix (one single drum microphone the rumours say).\nThe album starts out with a bizarre tune, dissonant and hypnotic, and sets the mood which I would describe as lugubre, unsettling, very dark. The mere implication of when \"Natassja\" ought to have lived adds a quality of immortality or longevity and I can't really describe how important this song (or rather: it being the opening song) is to the rest of the album. \n\nAs a side-track I might add that it wasn't until I, some decade ago, heard \"Over Fjell Og Gjennom Torner\" on the Transilvanian Hunger album that I suddenly understood what Darkthrone was all about. That song's bleak minimalism and stark absence of any normal sounding production really evocates a feeling of complete abnormality, like both a fist in the face of humanity (not in a provocating way; rather in a non-human way) and yet that weird sense of retrospection - the remembrance of 'once being human'.\n\nAnyhow, Under A Funeral Moon really came as a revelation of true black metal to me when Over Fjell Og Gjennom Torner had shown the way.\nThe album captures a sensation of exclusivity, like a soundtrack to the fraternity of what/who once was/were actual black metal with songs such as Unholy Black Metal - which, if not particularly good in matters of musicality, is really invigorating and actually lifts up the rest of the album from what elsewise could've been a dangerously depressing (and I mean that in a bad way) set of songs.\nIn a way, Under A Funeral Moon is iconic to me because it truly marks the point where black metal no longer seemed an offshoot of it's thrash origins but really something very different.\n\nMusically, this album is much in the same fashion as it's predecessor A Blaze In The Northern Sky, yet strangely different. I think this is much because whereas \"A Blaze...\" strives for brutality in combination with truly haunting, dark atmospheres (just take Kathaarian Life Code for example), Under A Funeral Moon - although similar in pace and overall execution - doesn't have as much of a Celtic Frost influence, and ultimately lacks any resemblence of death metal.\nThe truth is (according to me) that the nature of the album is defined not only by what it actually contains but (perhaps even more so) also by what it is lacking.\n\nWhat is it that it is lacking then?\nFIrst of all, it lacks the feeling of competition. Fenriz is not playing as complex or fast as he could, because he realizes that that is not what it is about.\nAlthough fastpaced it never feels as if they're trying to play fast. Also, the general lack of bass (some occasional floor drum hits represents the only 'heavy' side of the whole album) and the thin, buzzing guitars creates something very different. Whereas most other bands at that time in a sense could be seen as representing urban atmospheres and minds this truly is the pinnacle of something more rural - and I mean that in a deeper sense than most people would understand. It is as if they truly have broke loose from human bonds, now being amongst the ancient entities which roam the primordial woods. Of course, this is not the case but the music is at times ever so convincing.\n\nAlthough minimal on the verge of monochromatical the album is driven by melody and timbre, which are it's main components.\nThe guitars are in centre, displaying melodies that are much more of a feat to compose than to actually play (again that apparent lack of competitiveness).\nThe timbre then; again we could speak more of what is lacking than what is actually present. The guitar production seems to be made without any care for 'good sound', with buzz and static noise further putting the focus on the melodies. This is not mindlessly executed though, the lack of good production is not equivalent with lack of any production. The vocals are cavernous and bleak - raspy but not brutal per se.\nThe totality of the instruments - the actual sound - is very consistent, non-dynamic in a way, like a being of it's own.\n\nIt remains a true icon of Black Metal, perhaps one of the very best albums of the genre ever because it's an archetype in itself, self-defining. If you haven't heard Darkthrone (or any of their clones) this might be hard to grasp at first (I don't think it's for everyone, and I am absolutely certain it is not meant for everyone).\nHowever, one should not dismiss the album as a mere antithesis, it truly dwells in a world of it's own.\n",
        "\nIf there is a single album that truly captures the very spirit of darkness, it is this somewhat underrated and definitely underappreciated death metal debut by later, 2nd wave black metal pioneers Darkthrone. Whether it was the dark and gloomy climate of Norway, the continuous historical states of bondage and struggle for independence that likely influenced the country\u2019s metal culture, or just the will of the stars, something was brewing in the late 80s as Fenriz, Nocturno, Zephyrous, and Dag Nilsen began developing the unique pre-cursor to blackened death metal that is \u201cSoulside Journey\u201d.\n\nIn many respects, death metal became the victim of its own multi-faceted uniqueness in the later 90s as bands began to take segments of the progressive format exemplified by Death and Morbid Angel and developing more limited sub-genres such as brutal death, technical death, melodic death, doom death and death thrash. Darkthrone\u2019s pre-black metal sound does the exact opposite of what later bands did and put forth every element developed by the originators of the style and actually added a dark, atmospheric, keyboard happy quality that was not explored very heavily by even the forward looking Chuck Schuldiner. All of the aforementioned death metal sub-genres can be applied to parts of this, and would still not do justice to its individualistic character.\n\nEverything on here just breathes metal eclecticism, from the fast paced Slayer/Kreator inspired thrashing lead breaks to the dissonant, quasi-epic doom metal riffs that wander in and out of the majority of these songs. You\u2019d swear that Black Sabbath and Death teamed up to perform the amazing mishmash of progressive death/thrash and traditional doom that is \u201cGrave With A View\u201d, or that the former got together with Iron Maiden and Sodom to nail together the bass happy doom/thrasher \u201cIconoclasm Sweeps Cappadocin\u201d. The bass intro of the latter, in particular, is one of the most unique superimpositions of Steve Harris\u2019 approach to patterned bass work on the more neo-tonal death metal style.\n\nThings really start to get avant-garde with \u201cNor The Silent Whispers\u201d, which basically marries vintage traditional doom metal with the tremolo picked riffing death style that Amon Amarth continually refers to when constructing their melodic fanfares, without the complex sensibilities of course. Meanwhile, mellow sounding atmospheric works like \u201cSempiternal Sepulchrality\u201d and the melodic yet thrashing \u201cThe Watchtower\u201d carry some elements of melodic death metal ala Gothenburg, but without the watered down Iron Maiden references. Likewise, the album is essentially devoid of all the slow section interruptions that plagued the later Gothenburg scene, as well as the sloppiness often exhibited in the tremolo riffs.\n\nBassist Dag Nilsen basically deserves his own review for the amazing performance he puts on here. Just about every even numbered track on this black frosted opus is loaded with well timed references to past figureheads, from Geezer Butler to Joey Demaio. Points of interest are found in the raunchy toned, minimalist intro to \u201cAccumulation Of Generalization\u201d which sounds like it could have occurred during Sabbath\u2019s glory days in the early 70s, while that wicked bass solo towards the end of \u201cSempiternal Spulchrality\u201d, which presents a shorter version of the bass shred insanity heard on Manowar\u2019s \u201cThe Triumph Of Steel\u201d. It\u2019s saddening that this guy didn\u2019t stay in the band, because even after the changeover to black metal, his input could have radically impacted the band\u2019s style and perhaps even the greater black metal style.\n\nIn the same respect, credit should definitely be given to Nocturno for one amazing job on the leads on here. The list of various death and thrash metal guitarists whose influences can be heard smattered on every wild solo thrown into every single one of these songs is too long to get too specific, but definitely points away from any assertion of a one-dimensional character. The influences definitely tilt heavily towards the loose, agitated and chromatic nature of extreme thrash players in the German and American scenes, though hints of Schuldiner\u2019s idiomatic sense of melody and structure temper it away from being pure Kerry King or Mike Sifringer worship. There aren\u2019t any real highlight solos to pick out of any particular songs; every solo deserves your undivided attention and unending praise.\n\nIn retrospect, it\u2019s difficult to say how I feel about the band\u2019s break from the death style in favor of the 2nd wave of black metal. In one respect, I\u2019m a little bummed because this continues to be my favorite album by the band, though several of their later releases come pretty close to matching it. But at the same time, given what ended up happening to the death metal style in subsequent years, maybe Fenriz and the others got out while the getting was good. Who knows, maybe it might truly be better to reign in black metal hell than serve in death metal heaven, it\u2019s all relative to what sort of company you want to keep and what ears you want hearing your music. \n\nOne thing is certain though, any self-respecting fan of death metal, particularly the older, more eclectic style put forth by the pioneers should not be without this. It models itself after a rabid sense of individual expression that embraces the somber melodic character that was adopted by the Scandanavian black metal scene of the early 90s, while maintaining the complexity and brutality that typifies vintage traditional death metal. In my personal opinion this is not only one of the greatest offerings to bear the death label, but also one of the finest collections of complex musical works to every grace my ears.\n\nFirst submitted to (www.metal-observer.com) on August 14, 2008.\n",
        "\nFor the last couple of full-lengths, Darkthrone has made it pretty clear that they are no longer much interested in playing straight black metal. If The Cult Is Alive was a charred serving of sheet fed crust, then F.O.A.D is pure sludge funneled from the mighty \u2018Throne. The resulting commodity is pure black gold, plain and simple. While other bands are busy trying to \u201cbake a cake\u201d with their black metal, Darkthrone is only concerned with \u201cmaking bread\u201d as the band once famously stated. This album is the breaking of that bread, however sweet but succinct. \n\nFans still waiting for another Transilvanian Hunger will be left waiting in the \u2018forest cold\u2019. Let them freeze. And if those listeners have already gone on their \u201cHunger\u201d strike by not picking up this delicious piece of pastiche by the dark duo, may they starve in that forest white because this is no St. \u201cHunger\u201d. This is back-to-the-basics metal by a band who blackened the line between the thrash and black genres. In the early 1980\u2019s, the space between that line was a dark yet dingy gunmetal grey area. With Transilvanian Hunger, they took black metal to a 180. With F.O.A.D they do a 360 to dwell in the dingy grey where it all started. Now, for most bands, this kind of skating is on a slippery slope on the thin ice of pretentiousness. But Fenriz and Nocturno Culto have demonstrated on this album that their influences are as immovable and crude as the Norwegian tundra itself. \n\nThe album kicks off with These Shores are Damned. Not only is this one of the best openers that I have heard in recent memory but this track, guitar-wise at least, is a thesis statement for the tone that will be set for the rest of the album. It contains a doom metal riff in the middle and towards the end of the song. Classic doom that is, none of the ridiculously down-tuned nonsense that pervades so many bands of the \u201cdoom death\u201d metal variety. Those types are damned. Listening to this song, I only realized that These Shores Are Damned awesome and the metal marines have landed with a vengeance. \n\nBesides being a fistful of hammy (Canadian Bacon?) dynamite that is Canadian Metal, Darkthrone messages two things with this song: 1.) Tom G. Warrior is a pure metal svengali and anyone who disagrees can jump in a cold lake. 2.) After 14 years, anyone who is stupid enough to expect F.O.A.D to be an exercise in puritanical grimness is as fickle as a Quaker during a Pennsylvanian hunger. \n\nUpon hearing Church of Real Metal I thought to myself that this song could be called Cities on Flame with Black and Roll. This cut is just another sign of what the following songs will offer in attitude. The next song is Banners of Old. This track along with Splitkein Fever is as close to straight on black metal that you will hear on the album. Banners of Old is more black metal in its lyrical content than its structure. Splitkein Fever has the traditional cold tremolos that define the more characteristic works by DT. But if you listen closely to the bass and drum pacing along with the intentionally off key vocals, it still is very much an old hardcore punk song at heart as much as it is traditional black metal. \n\nThis brings us to Fuck Off and Die which is also the meat of the mantra on this record. This is also a song that never ceases to bring a smile to my face. If you don\u2019t know the tribute here on this one, you better go back and listen to it again. Fenriz takes the vocals on here in what is one of the most genuine attempts at crude inspiration that I have had the pleasure to listen to on a metal record. Could we be seeing more of the enigmatic Hank Amarillo in future releases? Only time and tribute will tell. \n\nRaised on Rock is another ubiquitous nod to Celtic Frost. It\u2019s almost as amusing as the title track and it makes a good companion piece to it. It\u2019s a fitting track to guide the caboose of the last two songs on this frozen freight train. If you listen to Pervertor of the 7 Gates and Wisdom of the Dead, you will be most pleased to discover the brilliant to-do-list: Give an IOU to you know who. Tip the Butler. Pay the Bill. Praise the Prince. If I need to spell that out to you then you shouldn\u2019t be listening to metal.\n\nF.O.A.D may not be as grim as the ashes but it\u2019s as brash as the remnant chimney of a stave church that stands over them. And it\u2019s still as black as the soot that lines it. Then again, Darkthrone needs no justification or apologists for their newest material. It is well known that they play music for themselves. I am only too happy to go along with their offerings of old school influences. No one has toppled the \u2018Throne and it\u2019s lonely at the top.\n",
        "\nI usually hate \"best-of\"s, especially in this age of digital piracy, because there's no need to repackage songs that have already been released in another form. Let the people rip the songs to their computers and burn their favorites to disc. Usually, to be worth anything, there has to be something new. Most best of's don't have anything new. They're just cash grabs.\n\nPreparing For War, for the most part, is no different. Now, I'm analyzing this as if I were a tried and true Darkthrone fan (I'm not). If you want my opinion on the actual song material, read the reviews for the respective albums. I'm just reviewing the usefulness of this compilation. And on that note, I really don't get the point of this, other than a cynical cash grab. It appears to be made for a darkthrone beginner, because it mostly consists of already released material. In that case, what's the point of the 2 unreleased demo songs? If you're just trying to get into black metal, why the shoddy death metal demo tracks? Unless, of course, this was meant for the Darkthrone enthusiast, in which case, what's the point of re-releasing all the \"classic\" material, which was already on albums that any black metaller, Darkthrone fan or not, should at least have already had in one form or another? Seems pretty sketchy to me.\n\nSeriously, this \"best of\" is too unoriginal and contrived for there to be any other reason for its existence. It seems to be a blatant cash grab by Peaceville (or Darkthrone, I'm not sure which). Or a joke, in which case the joke is on the saps who bought this. I would say download it (not buy it) just for the 2 demo songs, but they're already released, along with ALL of Darkthrone's demo material, on the Frostland Tapes, so in that case, don't even bother. Just buy the Frostland tapes if you're a Darkthrone enthusiast and want \"unreleased\" material, and if you want an introduction to Darkthrone, simply get Under a Funeral Moon or Panzerfaust.\n",
        "\nMany closeminded Darkthrone fans who hailed the \"black metal trilogy\" as absolute pinnacles of human achievement dwarfing even Metal Heart era Accept and Powerslave era Iron Maiden, as well as fellow contemporaries Emperor and Dissection, have also been quick to trash everything made since Panzerfaust. \n\nWell, Plaguewielder isn't bad. It isn't good by any stretch of the imagination. It's noticably doomier than their past efforts, which gets plus points in my opinion, but it's darkthrone, and we all know Darkthrone never do anything resembling innovation. It's usually just something resembling 0-0-0-1-0-0-0-1-0-0-0-1-0-0-0-1 repeat. Basic 4/4 stuff. Plaguewielder is no different. Sure, the songs are longer. That does mean I have to listen to it more, which, knowing Darkthrone, is a bad thing. But the good thing is that the production is mellow enough that I don't have to really pay attention to them. The good thing is that these are probably the most listenable riffs Darkthrone has presented to us since Under a Funeral Moon. Let's face it, guys, neither Fenriz nor Nocturno Culto is Zephyrous, and it's Zephyrous that's written all the good Darkthrone riffs. That's why Transilvanian Hunger sucked (or at least part of it) and why Darkthrone have failed to come up with anything good after Panzerfaust, which was ok as well. Here, given Nocturno Culto's inability to come up with the thing known as \"riffs\", the riffs are comparitively good. Note, comparitively is the key word. They're still painfully average. \n\nThe drumming is mediocre, but Fenriz was never a good drummer, even on the album everybody said he drummed well on (Soulside Journey). However, I figure if anybody wanted quality music, they'd look elsewhere than Darkthrone.\n",
        "\nDarkthrone are one of the longest standing black metal gods around as most know already . Most of their early stuff is hailed as unquestionable triumphs and held in the highest regard by most fans of this genre . Their quote unquote unholy trinity being A Blaze In the Northern Sky , Transilvanian Hunger , and Under A Funeral Moon which makes up their first three releases after changing over from being a death metal band is absolutely necessary in anyones black metal collection and Under Beskyttelse av Morke fits right in .\n\nWhen hearing of this release before getting my hands on it on vinyl (666 copies pressed and only sold at a japjanese black metal convention there) me being from the U.S i figured thats exactly what a Darkthrone fan needs , a crappy washed out obscure rehearsal done in a basement that's in a limited press and will no doubt sound like sheer crap . Three rehearsal tracks from Under A Funeral Moon in 1992 recorded in Fenriz's living room cannot be good right ? Wrong ! \n\nThe sound here is very clear . The tracks being Under a Funeral Moon , Unholy Black Metal , and an instrumental only version of Crossing The Triangle Of Flames is actually really freaking heavy .Nocturno Culto's vocals are just as sick as anything he laid down in the studio on the aforementioned three albums , raw evil and black sung with total conviction he does not disappoint here . Zephyrous's guitar is blazingly fast , well played and totally brutal , dare i say even better than on the actual album itself . Last but certainly not least is the drums . Fenriz is dead on in this rehearsal , drumming at a frantic morbid pace , never missing a beat , all the fills , cymbals and grinding black metal fury is there .\n\nOne almost feels as if they are sitting on the couch watching Darkthrone when hearing this and most would have loved to have been . For an obscure little moment in history when the evilest of the early Norwegian black metal bands was still a rare trio , you can thank whoever decided to record this rehearsal , because it easily fits in with any Darkthrone collectors discography . For once also it doesn't sound as if the annoying neighbor decided to press record on an old boom box in the apartment next door when this was going on so they would have proof for the cops that these kids were being way way too loud . This is a really enjoyable raw rehearsal . Pray for a repress because this is a great one !\n",
        "\nFinally, a compilation that is worth buying \u2013 from Peaceville, of all labels! What we have here is all of Darkthrone\u2019s demo output, with the added bonus of a mildly messy live recording, a couple of forgotten studio pieces and, as a surprise move, the whole Goatlord session in its instrumental form \u2013 that is, without ANY of the infamous \u201cfemale vocals\u201d so many of us have come to love or hate. A good amount of material is packed in a sturdy hard-covered book that should at least weather a few stray drops of beer at your local underground party. The innards of the beast contain a booklet with some intriguing bits of history from the 1988-91 days, as well as a large photo of the lads at their cuddliest (true babyfaces, the lot of them!). Overall, the chosen content pleases me; apart from the generic cover picture, I find things to be in order here. \n\nNothing important is omitted, so we turn to ponder whether the sound has been mangled, polished or otherwise brutalized; the answer is a resounding no. The first demo is as hissy as it ever was, and the rest does not reek of later editing either. That primitive punch of the original recordings is still there in all its unholy glory. There are a couple of semi-produced studio tracks that are remarkably cleaner than the demo material, yet even they are quite far from the Sunlight sound of Soulside Journey. As for the live bits recorded in Denmark, they are noisy and obscure, just about the quality of a decent bootleg; not worth paying for on their own but a welcome bonus on a compilation such as this. Additionally, they make me chuckle, too, as Nocturno Culto introduces songs with coyness in his voice: \u201cYou\u2019re a nice crowd, really.\u201d \u201cWe might fuck this up but who cares.\u201d Humble!\n\nThe Goatlord session, well well\u2026 upon hearing the vocalized version, I made a vow to not buy the album, yet here we are! Thank all manner of deities that the worst irritant is gone; no more vocals. I do still find the album a tad too randomly collated slide show of riffs, but I am certain that many others will utterly love it without the throatwork. \n\nDid you ever think of buying Preparing for War to get a hold of the old death metal material? I certainly hope not; there is far more worth for your money here, and more importantly, nothing useless has been added. Who would want to buy a compilation with clich\u00e9s like Transilvanian Hunger on it just to have an incomplete collection of demo songs and rarities? Beats me; in any case, get this if the band\u2019s death metal phase is at all dear to you.\n",
        "\nWhat is out there to say about Darkthrone that has not being said yet? Is any original or revealing statement to make about \u201cA Blaze in the Northern Sky\u201d? I think not, so, my review will expose my personal feeling about this album and its relevance in the Metal world.\n\nOne of the main qualities that this release has is the bravery that Fenriz & co. had at the time to write, arrange, record and deliver to Peaceville Records this album. Remember that at that time, the label was expecting something in the vein of \u201cSoulside Journey\u201d. But Darkthrone delivered a new, cold and irreverent style of metal, full of hate, with a production value that was too lo-fi and primitive for the average Death Metal listener. For all the above mentioned, I think this album and Darkthrone as a whole gained a place in the history of Metal music. \n\nThis album defines in a strange way how a Black Metal album should be. I say in a strange way because it was originally written as a Death Metal album, Fenriz has explained many times how with his drumming he disguised the Death Metal riffs. The second wave of Black Metal was in its birth, and thought it is true that Mayhem had already released their infamous Deathcrush EP back in 1987, and Immortal was working in their \u201cDiabolical Fullmoon Mysticism\u201d as well as Burzum with his \u201cBurzum\u201d, this can be called one of the first hateful, chilling and devastating Black Metal releases that came from Norway and gave birth to the so called second wave.\n\nOf course the production is raw, with a lot of buzz, but all the instruments are fairly audible, and, given the talent this band has, each song has its own identity. In other raw Black Metal releases you can listen the whole album as one track, but in this case Nocturno Culto made a great effort in the riffing and Fenriz gave the final touch, and the overall result is breathtaking. \n\nThe album has 6 tracks ranging from 5 to 10 minutes, and the most interesting are\u2026 well, all, but Paragon Belial has something special, you can hear the Death Metal riffing right there, but the drum pattern and the production values make it sound evil as fuck, resulting in a hell of a Black Metal masterpiece, being one of the best moments of the release. But as I said before, all tracks are unique and great, the atmosphere of the album is hypnotic, and that replaces the lack of production that any Death Metal fan may complain about.\n\nThis is an important statement of the movement that begun in Norway in the late 80\u2019s/early 90\u2019s, this is one of the most representative albums of that movement for its bravery, for its mood and for its quality. This is an essential release that every metalhead should know about, so, if you don\u2019t, get it now and believe me, you\u2019ll be more than satisfied.\n",
        "\nOn one hand, this is the most accomplished guitar-oriented album of 2007, and on the other hand, the gatefold of the LP jacket is a giant photograph of a forest scene obscured by a can of Heineken and someone's knee. The album cover is horrible; the album title is worse; the song \"Canadian Metal\" is unforgivable garbage; it's barely a metal album, even less a black metal album.\n\nThe most notable two things about this album, aside from all those appalling negatives, is the painfully-apparent desire to broadcast how into punk the band now is: the single for the album had a Testors cover; they cite Poison Idea, the English Dogs, and Amebix, and Fenriz is wearing a World Burns to Death t-shirt---all this from a band that previously was the most rabidly \"orthodox\" black metallers! The second thing is that Fenriz, the drummer, now sings on nearly all the songs which he writes (where previously Nocturno Culto, the guitarist, did ALL the vocals). Weird change to make this late in a band's career.\n\nEverything I've said up to now makes it sound like a completely different band than that which recorded the sparse and ultra-monochrome Under a Funeral Moon.\n\nThat is not at all the case, though. This is classic Darkthrone. Or classic Celtic Frost, depending on how well you understand Darkthrone. It's true that Celtic Frost released a \"comeback\" album this year, titled Monotheist, but the best Celtic Frost album of every year since 1991 has been recorded by the band Darkthrone (or more recently by High On Fire).\n\nDarkthrone were already releasing \"hardcore\"-style songs on the album Hate Them, but it is only recently that this has become full-on crusty gutter sleaze. All the songs written by Fenriz are ludicrous, punked-out \"rockers,\" while the biggest irony is that the most \"Darkthrone-sounding\" songs are all written by the band member who did NOT write their classic albums. See? \n\nOk. So. Surface: black metal album by respected and original black metal band Darkthrone. Inside: cheesy slow rock album. Surface: cheesy rock album. Inside: insidious Celtic Frost influence. Surface: Celtic Frost influence taken to ridiculous extreme. Inside: bizarre regression to riffs from 3rd Darkthrone album. Surface: Return to sounds from their 3rd album. Inside: 3rd album already a rip-off of Celtic Frost. Surface: lifelong debt to Celtic Frost. Inside: This debt split into a schizophrenic songwriting labor that isolates the two ways that the Celtic Frost influence operates on their sound. Surface: songwriting labor split, vocal duties split. Inside: most ridiculous sonic aspect of new album is not this division, but rather the numerous and not-at-all-\"metal\" guitar solos on every track.\n\nIn conclusion, this has to be a concept album about irony and presentation. We might even say it is about what happens when the most \"true\" black metal band starts spelling it \"tr00.\" But the real joke is on the listeners (the same fools who were left in the dust when Dylan went electric) who did not see this irony as quintessential (no shit) to Panzerfaust or in the band's originary moment, the abandonment of death metal on their second album. \n\nlast note: Fenriz's vocals are so unsettlingly bad, until you realize that they are exactly splitting the difference between Tom G. Warrior (Celtic Frost) and Cronos (Venom)--essentially an impersonation. I would love to say that one's appreciation of the album rests on whether one likes \"Canadian Metal\" or not, but I don't pass that test myself, so...\n",
        "\nThere are two things that ruin this album. The first is the vocals. The second is the timing.\n\nMost people know that this was an album that was recorded at two separate times. This is most obvious in how much louder the vocals are than the instrumental portions of the recording. It detracts in my opinion from the overall fluidity of the record.\n\nThe main thing that makes me dislike this record more than any other album that Darkthrone has released, is the \"female\" vocals. First of all, they are inappropriate. It gives an otherwise decent album a cheap and almost comical sound. It seems that this was a joke to Fenriz, who did the normal black metal rasps, and apparently also performed the falsetto female vocals. What is the point I ask? For one thing, Nocturno Culto didn't do the vocals, even though there were many years that had passed since he took over as the vocalist for the band. It is nothing that the band was, or was moving towards...Vocally, this album was in left field with a hockey stick.\n\nThe female-like singing in the background is irrelavant and totally deters from the musical quality of the album. I think if these horribly mis-placed, terribly off-key, and irreperably damaging vocals were removed, this would actually be a pretty damn kick-ass album. Alas, the random, tone-deaf wails make people cringe, and shake their heads in disgust. This is a definite what-the-fuck-were-you-thinking type situation. Assuredly, just one of those things that make you go \"hmmmm\".\n\nI am not saying that Fenriz did a poor job (except for those random faux-female noises), I just don't really see what they were trying to accomplish by having a different person perform the vocals in a record that, in my opinion, is supposed to be the best showing as to how the band transitioned from death metal to black metal. The musical content is definitely in line with the transition that was happening. In my opinion A Blaze In The Northern Sky is their heaviest and darkest recording. There is still deathy remnants in that album (although they were completely abolished by Transylvanian Hunger) and Goatlord straddles that fence of black/death; as it should.\n\nMusically, though, the album is quite good. The strange beats that Fenriz used in Soulside Journey are still present in this release, the guitars are still on a death metal tangent for the most part, keeping the riffs crunchy, complex and refreshing. The quality of the recording is decent, and is much better than any of their previous releases, except SJ, where the fuzzy, unproduced sound was not as much a goal due to the different genre being played.\n\nThe band's lineup was the same, and that is to me the reason that there was still so much death metal influence, the riffs being quite similar and along the lines of SJ, the songs being exponentially shorter, and there being a much more fill-oriented drumming style. Fenriz used the other parts of his drumkit instead of the high hat, the ride, and the snare...and used a fair amount of double-bass. I think this was a nice addition to the blackened death metal feel of the album. Zephyrous and Nocturno played a diversity that falls between SJ and ABITNS where they were beginning to transmogrify their complexity, for driving and raw black metal riffs that were as predictable as a metronome regarding the strums for the chords.\n\nThis album was definitely a good release, if released when recorded. I feel that would have made this release much more widely accepted due to the fact that the sound, and song structure of SJ would be very fresh in the listener's mind, and it would be easier to see the relevance, and direction that Darkthrone was taking. Also, the stark difference between styles would have been much smoother, and possibly bridged the gap of fans of Darkthrone the death metal band, and Darkthrone the black metal band.\n\nWhatever reasons Fenriz and Nocturno had for releasing this album, were probably not very sound. Some have put to question whether or not they did it for the money. That is indeed a good theory. Because why would they release something that had such an un-serious approach after 4 of the most monumental releases in black metal's short history? The step down from those 4 to this is something that is almost beyond comprehension. After all, their transition was completed many years ago, and what fan base they had knew what to expect from these artists, and to receive such a curveball jeopardized their fan-base so much, that I fail to see reasoning behind this release.\n\nThankfully, for me, this album is saved only by the musical content, and my interest in the history of the band. I appreciate seeing the musical grey area that existed before ABITNS, and after Soulside Journey. It is a good showing as to how the band progressed musically. The fake woman Fenriz funtime is what floors me, and makes me wish this album didn't exist. \n\nBut it is here, and I appreciate it for what it is: the best and worst of Darkthrone all in one single album. The best musical description of how an up and coming death metal band made the transition to black metal (and one of the most influential black metal bands at that), and the worst timing ever, and the biggest blunder that Darkthrone has ever made in their illustrious 21 year (and counting) career.\n",
        "\nDarkthrone gets a lot of negativity from the black metal purists for their recent material over the years. Either with their albums itself being too generic and boring and same old, to their more recent stuff which mixes a bit of punk sounding drum styles and motorhead worship into the mix. It's clear from this EP though their more recent direction is worth exploring just a bit, at least from this recording. While I've only vaguely listened to a few things following the likes of Ravishing Grimness and Plaguewielder, what i've been hearing more recently from their new material is definitely a direction worth looking into by any real fans of this band.\n\nThis is what new Darkthrone is defined as on this EP. Yes, we'll all remember Darkthrone for the likes of the brilliant albums during the prime between 1992-1995 with albums like A Blaze in the Northern Sky, Under a Funeral Moon, their most recognized Transilvanian Hunger, and the underrated cold classic Panzerfaust. For those who have listened to these albums for years you'll always recognize Darkthrone for that as well as their early Death Metal too. Even I listen to this albums constantly since i heard them for the first time 5 or 6 years ago, however that's not to disregard their new stuff.\n\nThis album is a balanced mix between their old school black metal roots with the likes of Hellhammer, Celtic Frost, and Bathory which is especially evident on the first side of this album. Two very short as well as very attention grabbing songs which are memorable in the same way that the first wave black metal albums are remembered, and definitely songs that would be enjoyed by anyone who loves black metal as it was before the norwegian second wave. The second side of this record is more their newer direction and influence with a sort of crust punk style and sound reminiscent of old school punk riffs and the vocals a combination of both. I'm sure Darkthrone gets a lot of grief for this new stuff. It's nothing amazing at a first listen but the sound grows on you, especially if you already dig the sound of old school punk in the first place. If you're strictly into metal or black metal though then this new direction may not be for you.\n\nDefinitely an interesting new direction. One that may take getting used to, but I definitely like how this turned out and makes me even more interested to check out what i've missed from darkthrone on albums like Hate Them, Sardonic Wrath, The Cult is Alive, and FOAD. Once again Darkthrone has reinvented their sound, remained dedicated to old school, and brought out new stuff that is very kickass to listen to. This stuff really has the balls we need in metal once again!\n",
        "\n'Ravishing Grimness\u2019 is a continuation of the demise of Darkthrone. Most people have long since given up on a band that are often classed as legendary in respect to their early material. Is it a case of Darkthrone losing their identity over time? Seemingly so. Evolution of a band is nothing new to any of us, but I\u2019m not sure anyone could have foreseen the demise of this band when, for example, \u2018Transilvanian Hunger\u2019 came out. There are times when things seem too good to be true, or some might even say slightly ironic. For instance, Darkthrone\u2019s lyrics. Are they meant to represent the downfall the band have experienced over the years?\n\n\u201cIn the Water of Life the Circuits are breaking\nEons of Numb Hopelessness Lies Ahead.\u201d\n\nLyrics like those seem to equate to what happened to the band as a whole. For many fans, hope was lost when albums like \u2018Goatlord\u2019 came out of the works. Whilst their journey has continued, the fan base has weakened significantly. Whilst \u2018Ravishing Grimness\u2019 doesn\u2019t represent the absolute worst that Darkthrone have provided us with, it\u2019s nothing short of bland. There are no redeeming elements about this album, it\u2019s another one that simply exists for the sake of existing. One would imagine, if perhaps, just perhaps, Darkthrone took a longer leave of absence to develop their material, may be they would come up trumps? It seems to be a long shot and not a feasible solution to the band\u2019s problems, but as band\u2019s release more and more material quickly, a growing number of fans tend to grow tired of their work. It\u2019s happened here, if you ask me.\n\nDarkthrone are a band that never seem content with what they\u2019re doing, thus the reason they decide to change their style so often. If they\u2019re not content, it\u2019s a feeling that does tend to wash over the audience. This album seems awkward at times, if anything. It\u2019s as if Darkthrone are almost completely out of idea\u2019s and are resulting to an old style whereby black metal is crossed over with a thrash style. Most people tend to call it black n\u2019 roll. It\u2019s a sub-genre, which going by Darkthrone\u2019s music, seems to lack any real substance. The percussion element of \u2019Ravishing Grimness\u2019 is severely struck down. It\u2019s just incredibly irritating. The only variation we\u2019re offered are when double bass is brought into the picture, but that\u2019s hardly inventive. If you\u2019re going to take a thrashier outlook on music, it must be creative to withstand the test of time and this just isn\u2019t. On the entire album I can only really pinpoint one song I really like, that being \u2019The Claws Of Time\u2019. Otherwise the vocals are lifeless, the guitars may as well cease to exist as they offer so little to the audience in the way of atmosphere and the percussion is as lacklustre as it gets. Again, this isn\u2019t the worst Darkthrone album, but it\u2019s by no means good.\n",
        "\nThe year is 1994. Black Metal has existed for a little over a decade, but only recently has it hit the spotlight. Bands like Emperor, Burzum, Mayhem, Ildjarn, and of course Darkthrone made up the so-called second wave of black metal. Shunning the death metal scene of the time for being too overproduced and poppy, these bands attempted to re-create the true death metal sound, their interpretation of which would later be known as black metal. Of course, this review is not a history lesson. It is a lesson in why Transilvanian Hunger is one of the finest albums to emerge from the second wave of black metal, and perhaps metal on the whole.\n\nWhere Emperor chose to represent its black metal with elaborate counterpoint and complex songwriting, and Mayhem originally played a blend of pseudo-thrash riffs with a rhythm section right out of death metal, Darkthrone preferred minimalistic styles more akin to the piano works of John Cage and the Baroque drones underpinning some of the best works of Georg Philip Telemann. Written almost exclusively in the minor, every riff on Transilvanian Hunger evokes a sense of longing, regret, and a glimpse at the ultimate downfall of civilization. Darkthrone themselves say it best on their lyrics of the title track:\n\nBeautiful Evil Self to be the Morbid Count\nA part of a Pact that is delightfully immortal\n\nReferring literally (and obviously) to the legend of the modern European Vampire that Bram Stoker first created with Dracula, this simple couplet represents the entire vision of the album, that is the unavoidable fact that we mere mortals will eventually be extinguished from this Earth and only our immortal creations will remain. Darkthrone is unpretentious however, and they are not suggesting that they have created anything worthwhile. Instead, they allow their creation to speak for itself.\n\nIt would be far fetched to call Transilvanian Hunger an experimental or avant-garde album, but the influence it has had on black metal is undeniable. Even more than Darkthrone's earlier black metal output, this album is a force of minimalism that takes shape not through the meshing of individual instrumental parts like Soulside Journey did but instead through the product of the whole. The production is raw, gritty, but still balanced between extreme treble or bass. The vocals of Nocturno Culto are generally impossible to decipher without a lyric sheet, but they are still a vital part of the music. Rhythm is a strong component of Transilvanian Hunger and the guitar is the driving force behind it. In an interesting and unorthodox move for black metal, it is sometimes the vocals that provide the lead and substitute for melody over the rhythmic riffing of the guitar. Darkthrone's latest albums show their heavy affection for early punk music and rock n' roll, and the drumming of Fenriz as early as 1994 pays homage to his influences. A steady repetition of blastbeats and d-beat patterns keeps time and meter while generally serving to enhance the playing of the riffs. Interesting this was the last album Zephyrous played on, choosing to leave before Panzerfaust. Perhaps it is his role as guitar player on this album that gives it such a unique sound, even compared to earlier Darkthrone albums he also played on.\n\nThe mistake many may make in listening to Transilvanian Hunger is not an intentional one. Instead, it is one brought on by simply listening to too many modern bands that have been inspired by Darkthrone. The sound of 1349, Dark Funeral, and even so-called suicidal black metal bands like Xasthur owe their entirety to Transilvanian Hunger (and to a lesser extent Mayhem's De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas). The unfortunate outcome is that these bands miss the mark by far - Transilvanian Hunger was not an album intended to be copied; Darkthrone did not want countless clones to rip off their sound. For some listeners, it may be hard to realize the superiority of the original when they have been spoiled by overproduced and stereotypical black metal, the stereotypes being created first by Transilvanian Hunger.\n\nTransilvanian Hunger is not an easy listen for the beginning black metal fan, and at first it may be cast aside in favor of more recent bands that simply copied its formula. But this is an album well worth sinking listening time into, for under the surface it is easily one of the best black metal albums of the 1990s and one with the most longevity. Transilvanian Hunger is true, pure, raw, cold, and worthy black metal that is nothing else. It is black metal. It is one of the classics of the second wave. It is Darkthrone. Nothing more need be said.\n",
        "\nLike Soulside Journey Darkthrone's Goatlord is an album i had sitting around, though unlike Soulside Journey the dust it gathered had good reason behind it. Goatlord isn't an album as much as it is an official release of previously unreleased material during Darkthrone's death metal era in their timeline. Goatlord was originally planned to be Darkthrone's sophomore release under the Peaceville record label before the band got to know Euronymous and changed their sound to cold, raw, harsh black metal and released their classic \"A Blaze in the Northern Sky.\"\n\nGoatlord is definitely an underrated album. It's the type of album that generally on first impressions seems like it will be a complete flop, but on the contrary there were some good ideas on this record, though unfortunately they were poorly executed. It's common knowledge by now with anyone reading reviews to this album that Goatlord was not much more than a rehearsal tape made during the early 90s with the vocals added later on. It isn't. The production is a clear indication of that. It's just what you'd expect listening to an early 90s death metal demo tape, or any rehearsal tape from most bands, however in some parts it actually gives more to the recording than takes away. Could this album have been better if they went and re-recorded it professionally? Absolutely, and honestly if they had done so I'd probably be more inclined to boost my rating of this album in that case.\n\nThe instrumentation itself on this album is definitely noteworthy. What you have here is very solid 90s death metal, and a good direction from their soulside journey album in terms of the actual musicianship. The guitar playing is near flawless and Fenriz's drumming is more than a metronome like with Darkthrone's black metal era recordings, and even a step up from his playing on the soulside journey album which admittedly was lacking in some places. His fills and timing were very good, even on a rehearsal recording like that.\n\nHowever where does this album lack? The vocal work. Recorded later on, this almost kills the entire album as a whole. Nocturno Cultos vocals are very out of place, poorly mixed with the instrumentation and just seem to be its own seperate entity which can prove to be distracting from what was mostly good ideas when it came to the strings and the drums. Even worse are \"Fenriz\"'s female vocal lines which provide nothing to the overall recording which prove completely useless and downright confusing when listening. What he was thinking none of us can tell, and if it was meant to be a joke, it was a rather poor one considering darkthrone was just breaking out from their prime with Transilvanian Hunger and Panzerfaust before this record came out. The backing vocals and male vocals themselves are equally pitiful and distracting on the recording and definitely take away from what this album could have been.\n\nGoatlord could have been a strong album release, there are definitely some key things surrounding the album that brought it down, but at the same time there were plenty of great ideas put together on the recording that can make some fans of Darkthrone wish they had taken the album and done more for it. Had they taken out the useless clean vocals and had they rerecorded the album in a more professional studio, perhaps Goatlord could've easily rivaled Soulside Journey in terms of how well done it is, but unfortunately Darkthrone decided to just release the rehearsal as was and add some aspects to it which only would make the record turn out worse. Listen to this recording at least once, don't expect much from it, but it's definitely worth spinning once or twice if you can borrow it from someone or download it somewhere for free.\n",
        "\nOne of the problems with legendary albums is that they often steal the thunder of other great albums, which is unfortunate regardless of how good the opuses granted such elite status may be. There is even a sense of legend attached to the year 1994 insofar as the 2nd wave of black metal is concerned because of the large number of legendary albums released at that time. Darkthrone\u2019s disposition at this time is unique because they seemingly joined the scene quite late (there is some question regarding the 1988 demo \u201cLand Of Frost\u201d being a black metal release or not) yet had also put out more full length albums than several others, mostly due to their label being willing to take a chance on an already signed act changing styles, thus giving birth to the black trilogy that this release is the 3rd and final installment of.\n\nWith regards to this famed black metal trilogy that comprised Darkthrone\u2019s releases on their first stint with Peaceville Records, this is arguably the weakest. There is definitely a strong sense of Burzum\u2019s style of minimalism, though presented in a much more barebones fashion. There are no keyboards to speak of to augment the atmosphere, the songs will often begin abruptly and mostly end with either a traditional fade out or an equally abrupt final stroke, most of the songs consist of 3 or 4 very clear cut riffs/melodic ideas, and the tempo remains almost completely linear throughout. Guitar solos are extremely few in number, reserved in their presentation, and ultimately a slave to what is going on around them, which is a departure from the technical flair of \u201cA Blaze In The Northern Sky\u201d and the grimly cold yet intricate \u201cUnder A Funeral Moon\u201d. \n\nThis entire album could be described as a collection of 8 poetic narratives, only two of which are in English, thus necessitating translations for anyone not of Norwegian descent. What surrounds them is an almost uniform wall of sound, built with hundreds of icy notes and chords played in rabid succession with a rhythmically precise, perpetual blast beat. The voice track towers over the rest of the arrangement, yet is simultaneously garbled under the weight of its own moroseness and often listens like a faint, incoherent whisper trapped beneath 20 centimeters of frost. Its charm is not immediately obvious, but repeated listens develops a gradual impression that eventually unfolds into a waking sleep of emptiness.\n\nAlthough the production definitely reaches for the fuzzy bleakness that typifies \u201cFilosofem\u201d, it falls short of achieving the same mesmerizing affect, and there is this sense of perpetual sameness to most of the songs that further hinders the album\u2019s flow. The opening title track individually listens like a brilliant prelude to a very dark endeavor, complete with a sorrowful droning melody implied in the guitars that could freeze the soul of the bravest day walker. But then we get another similar idea, in almost the exact same tempo, with no hearable variation. It\u2019s almost akin to listening to Buddhist or Gregorian chants for 39 minutes, but with electric guitars and a good deal of static.\n\nThe idea behind \u201cTransylvanian Hunger\u201d would have greater potential with a more ambitious attitude towards musical arrangement. This doesn\u2019t mean to suggest that the album need be the theatrical and heavily technical feats that \u201cIn The Nightside Eclipse\u201d and \u201cVikingligr Veldi\u201d were, nor thrash riff happy extravaganza that \u201cDe Mysteriis Dom Sathanas\u201d was, but a greater sense of variation can occur within the minimal style that this is presented in without robbing it with its stylistic attributes and further expand its charm. Nocturno\u2019s vocals could stand to vary a little more as well, as they are just as restrained and minimal as everything else here, jumping out to the listener mostly because they are too high in the mix.\n\nI can\u2019t say that I\u2019m in love this album, but I can\u2019t bring myself to dislike it because individually each of its songs possesses a sort of impressionistic charm that isn\u2019t lost on me. Sometimes I see frozen landscapes under a full moon with the immortal Dracula standing stoic in its light, other times a scene not all that removed from what Cocytus might look like. But the canvass sounds incomplete, and stops short of any real sense of climax, denouement, and closure. \n\nLater submitted to (www.metal-observer.com) on January 10, 2009.\n",
        "\nMake no mistake, \"Soulside Journey\" is a fine piece of Scandinavian death metal, secure in its position and unique because of a twisted and angular approach to songwriting that most of Darkthrone's peers did not favour. However, isn't it a somewhat sterile-sounding affair? Does it not sound, due in large part to the Sunlight production, like \"Indecent and Obscene\"'s more wide-eyed and brainy brother, who could certainly wow you with his IQ but probably couldn't break your jaw with a fist like his sibling would given the chance? There's something that prevents \"Soulside Journey\" from really being considered among the classic works of Darkthrone, and I would say there's more to this than the simple fact that it's a death metal album. I'm pretty sure that most people got over Darkthrone's style change years and years ago.\n\nWell, if you answered \"yes\", even if hesitantly to the question above, then you should listen here, because this album (that isn't really an album at all) encapsulates the feeling of what \"Soulside Journey\" could have been, while being considerably different by virtue of a distinct lack of polish. In fact, this really is a raw recording, which is not exactly something I would say about Darkthrone's black metal albums. It is a rehearsal, if a well-cooked one, and while it is obvious that the band knows the songs well and are quite disciplined, you will notice the ambience of the room (garage?) Darkthrone recorded this in, you will hear the crackle of overdriven amps and the sharp wash-out of enthusiastic cymbal-bashing. And hell and damnation, it sounds superb! If you ever wondered what it would be like sitting in Darkthrone's rehearsal space in 1991, hearing the band crank out some gloriously evil hymns to Darkness, \"Goatlord\" is your chance to find out. It's death metal, oh yes, but it is as black as any of Darkthrone's black metal classics, and within the confines of these tracks, mastered no doubt from an old cassette tape, you will find a spine-chilling evil feeling that simply isn't much present on the band's workmanlike debut.\n\nMy position on \"Goatlord\" may be slightly unusual, because this is actually the first Darkthrone release I heard and unreservedly enjoyed. Before early 1997 (I think it was), I had heard \"Transilvanian Hunger\", or at least most of it, and while there was something slightly fascinating about the repetitive melodies and hissy sound and endlessly pattering percussion, I just didn't get it at the time. Then, a woman who hosted a local metal radio show at some ungodly hour of the night far in excess of the Witching One played \"Sadomasochistic Rites\" from the \"Goatlord\" session. I was immediately struck by the absolutely eerie and dark feeling this recording had, and I was surprised to learn that the song was by Darkthrone because, rather than being hypnotically repetitive, it was frenetic, unpredictable and busy, with a raw-as-hades guitar sound that was like early Black Sabbath but much dirtier. Of course, I didn't know the history of the band at the time, but I knew I had to have this recording, whatever the hell it was, and further songs played in the coming weeks on the same show made me realise what a creepy gem this really was. While I went on to love \"A Blaze in the Northern Sky\", and even \"Transilvanian Hunger\" in time, this recording has always had a special place in my heart as it was my true introduction to what would become my favourite band for many years.\n\nI suppose it is commonplace for people to say nowadays, \"well, 'Goatlord' should never have had the vocals overdubbed .. they maybe should have released the instrumental version.\" I however cannot condone this sentiment. Sure, the vocals were added a few years later, and they seem to have been thrown into the mix without much thought given toward comparative levels or balance. Yes, there are moaning, ululating falseto croonings in most of these songs, provided by Fenriz himself. You're damn right, it sounds weird and not quite the height of profficiency. But \"Goatlord\" is basically a demo, given professional packaging in retrospect, and the vocal addition is a sweet touch indeed, with its excessive volume, pukish screams (certainly not done by Satyr) and sundry strange noises only adding to the morbidity of proceedings. I would be a lot less happy about \"Goatlord\" without them, and I'm almost more of a fan of the crooning than I am of the synthesiser bits on \"Soulside Journey\", which the former is obviously supposed to replace. Who knows if, given the chance, Darkthrone would have inserted keyboards where these vocals currently stand, but I can tell you that they add a unique presence to the recording that I've never heard anywhere else, particularly when they're harmonised, which provides a wonderfully eerie effect. The band abandoned these songs, but think of all the blackness that would have been sucked out of them at Sunlight Studio! Ole' Skogsberg would never have let Fenriz moan and hum into a microphone like that, and more to the point, that whole ominous, horror-metal vibe that \"Goatlord\" exhibits in spades would simply be gone!\n\nI don't know if it's the dirty, roomy sound, but this sounds a lot more like Autopsy than \"Soulside Journey\" does, while still maintaining its own sick character. The lurching tempo-shifts, tumbling drum fills and trudging doom all call to mind the aforementioned American group's most sublime moments, and both Darkthrone and Autopsy seem to draw on the same primal metal influences. Those who dismiss the new Darkthrone stuff for being too rockish might want to take a listen to a song like \"Towards the Thornfields\", and not only note the unrepentent Black Sabbath-like groove, but also perhaps be surprised by its twisted nature. This is also something I always admired about Autopsy: How they would take these retrograde, rock 'n' roll riffs and wrench and mutate them into something that resembled bile gurgling and churning in a corpse's gut. \n\nFenriz is all over the drums here too, in full death metal exuberance that only remains slightly on the subsequent full-length and dissipates quickly afterwards. It's a pleasure to hear and assures us that he is a very capable and even stellar drummer, and I do prefer this live percussive attack to the heavy but somewhat lifeless-sounding battery on \"Soulside Journey\". I particularly enjoy the use of the china cymbal here, which gets beaten pretty mercilessly throughout this session. I must stress that although the sound is much akin to the band playing a few feet from where you stand, no doubt quivering in fright, it's one of the clearest rehearsal recordings I've heard and you won't mistake this for an amateur band of highschool students dicking around in a basement with a ghetto blaster set on record. You can even hear Dag Nilsen's bass sometimes, though admittedly it is the one element that's somewhat buried. He does get a few cool solo spots though, just as he did on \"Soulside Journey\", only these are better!\n\nSo, while this may literally be \"throwaway Darkthrone\" it certainly doesn't deserve to be forgotten. While you could argue that it's unfortunate the band scrapped these songs, some of which may be rather embryonic, you could also say that this recording really is the way these compositions were meant to be put forward. Fenriz and Nocturno might not agree, but I certainly find it so: Fitting and deserving of your undivided attention, particularly if you're a Darkthrone fan who loves death metal but just doesn't think that the Soulside is quite moribund enough.\n",
        "\nDarkthrone- a bunch of seemingly pretty laid back dudes cranking out some fierce, minimalistic black metal. Perhaps it's just me, but with my first experience of this band being Nocturno Culto's 'The Misanthrope' DVD (which I thought was really good, personally), it's always been hard to take these guys' older, more grim albums all that seriously. \n\nStill, dudes seem to love them, so surely there must be something about them. And there is- this album kicks off with a quality riff, everything a lot more bassy then I expected, everything all buzzy and with a repetitive, hypnotic feel. It's great.. the problem is that it doesn't really vary, at all, for the whole album.\n\nFor the record, I know that it's a bit unfair for me, the resident drone fanatic of MA, to single out something as 'boring' or 'repetitive'. But that's what this is, and while it's highly enjoyable in short sharp bursts of three or four songs, listening to it in large doses turns the whole thing into a dreary, blurred smear of hypnotic blast beats and endless guitar riffs belted out with the same tremelo'd rhythm. \n\nMost songs are good, even great, on their own. The title track's opening riff can simply be described as perfect, (and I'm certain that Ulver ripped a few of these riffs for their Nattens Madrical album) and indeed, most riffs on their own are really solid. Perhaps I had just got a bit caught on the mythology of this band, but it's all a lot less extreme then I expected- the riffs, while not melodic in the 'Hey guys lets rip off Iron Maiden' sense, are still very memorable, surprisingly catchy, and you will find yourself humming them. 'Skald Avc Satans Sol' has a vague NWOBHM vibe too it (the production increasing that sort of obscure early 80's vibe), while 'Graven Takeheimens Saler' is probably the heaviest song on the album, Fenriz supplying some excellent, kinda galloping beats while Nocturno summons an epic wall of guitar. It's a great song, probably the best on the album. I was also quite surprised by just how 'good' the production is- the guitars are muddy but still quite thick, the bass is surpisingly audible, and the whole production is suitable raw but still somewhat pleasant on the ear.\n\nHonestly, I'm not entirely sure why I get so bored of it, as the songs sound great on their own.There's a few bands I like that do a similiar, perhaps even more repetitive styles of this sort of music- Paysage D'Hiver, for one, but whereas PDH achieves some sort of 'blast till transcendence' thing with me, Darkthrone just leaves me bored after a few minutes. I guess one of the main reasons is that I'm a pussy- whereas PDH offers some sort of spacey vista in his music, Darkthrone offers up something monochrome and bleak. While the music may not be all that fierce (or at least not as much as I'd thought), the bleakness of the songs and endless tremelo'd guitar riffs seem to exude a massive amount of nihilism and hopelessness. I guess that's a good thing for most people reading this review- but as a fairly cheery dude, I don't really see the point of it.\n\nI guess the ultimate question, then, is 'Why did I bother writing this review then?', and I don't really know how to answer that. In the end, I'd recommend that if you have a passing interest in black metal that you should give this a listen. It's heavy and fast and what not. I just don't really derive any enjoyment from it. Those who like their music bleak will enjoy this, but those of us who are pussies would probably be best finding something else.\n",
        "\nThis is a fucking awesome album and, even though their next material would be black metal, Darkthrone will always be remembered as one of the most creative and interesting death metal bands from back when this was released. I just got this on picture LP, so here we go with this long overdue review.\n\n\"Cromlech\" bursts forth with a great thrashing Scandinavian sounding DM riff. The lyrics are well-written and even nicely optimistic/thoughtful in some places such as the last line \"We'll All Make It Through.\" The solo is well done and very well-written, so props for that.\n\n\"Sunrise...\" starts with more thrashing and stresses some doom metal tempos early on in the song. One thing Darkthrone mastered on this album was the utilization of a bunch of different tempos and styles. From doom to some black metal influence (before they became full-fledged minimalists) to thrash, this is a really extreme death metal album with a little something for everyone. However, the style is prototypically \"technical\" (before that became cool) death metal for the most part, so you'll get lots of amorphous chord structures and weird riffs wrapping and weaving around your head until they change into completely different beasts. It's compelling, interesting and very, very satisfying.\n\nPsychedelic and, of course, soul-searching psychological themes are explored in the title track, with equally \"seeking\" riffs aiming to develop some under-explored tempos here and there. Reaching a total plod, the band speeds up again with accurate double bass and competent drum fills from the mighty Fenriz (before he devolved to a metronome for the next few albums...kidding, of course!), attacking the listener with full-on thrash assault in an early Sodom or Kreator style...thrash 'til death, with a purpose! Great stuff here. Search the soulside!!\n\nAccumulation Of Generalization (what a mouthful, eh?) begins with a GREAT memorable bass lick before plunging into primitive death metal sounds with the standard (by now, anyway) tempo changing, with some great pinch harmonic usage and TIGHT rhythmic interplay; check out how the bass syncopates with the drumming and the guitars also...really interesting and well done stuff. Fantastic. Also, this is an instrumental (aside from the pitch shifted/reverbed/echoed \"R-R-RR-AAUUUUGH\" in the first minute and a half). Some keyboard sounds even peek out on this one, recalling the minimal synth stuff Sami of Sentenced would sometimes do on North From Here or even recalling other underground classics like Phlebotomized or Illdisposed's first LP. The song ends with a great thrash riff, too!\n\nNext we have Neptune Towers, the name of which some fans of mid-era DT will notice from being one of Fenriz's solo projects (Tangerine Dream/Schulze-inspired prog ambient), but this song is very different from that music. This features what is likely to be hailed as one of the most epic riffs, playing with a key shift if I'm hearing right and some EXCELLENT harmonized synchronized guitar parts. Just really stellar stuff. The solo is a little bothersome because it begins really loudly, cutting out everything else, but the actual content once it gets going is typically good, and the song ends abruptly with it.\n\nNow I'm not going to go through every song (rather I just went over what I know as Side A of the LP, heh) because that is just totally tedious and you don't need to be walked through it...you're a music listener if you're reading this, and probably a metal fan. Just know that if you're a fan of modern technical death metal, this is its grandaddy (along with Suffocation, of course, but they did a more \"brutal\" and grind influenced style as we all know)...if you're interested in what Darkthrone was before they became trendhopping (yet still good and influential) black metal, be sure to check this one out...it'll fucking singe your eyebrows at the very least.\n",
        "\nIt\u2019s truly sad just how deplorable that a once great Norwegian black metal pioneer as Darkthrone have devolved into such \u201chas-beens.\u201d This EP alone explains it all too blatantly, that their newest full-length LP, \u201cF.O.A.D.\u201d is not even worth the insulting criticism.\n\nAnyway, I don\u2019t even know where to begin but I shall try and be brief. As a confirmed trait to all REAL black metal connoisseurs and devout fans of the original Darkthrone is the fact that there is absolutely no real black metal sound or feeling to this EP. It is primarily just a mish-mash of punkish-thrash-crossover riffs played in pseudo-first wave black metal style with Nocturno Culto\u2019s quintessential vocals. \n\nAdditionally, the few English lyrics are absolutely bland and/or hokey and cheesy as \u2018heaven.\u2019 Notice I said \u2018heaven\u2019 and not \u2018hell.\u2019 What the fuck is up with a song like \u201cCanadian Metal\u201d? I\u2019m Canadian and I don\u2019t know whether to feel flattered or offended. Apparently, this was a song intended to be dedicated to Montreal, Canada thrash band Voivod after the passing of guitarist Dennis \u201cPiggy\u201d D\u2019Amour. However, those lyrics read otherwise. It just sound like a foreigner\u2019s assumption of what Canadians are like when it comes to metal, or a typical Satanic metal scenario in Canada instead of Europe. Us Canadians have much higher standards of metal in general, let alone black metal standards. \n\nThe last two songs aren\u2019t even worth the mention. The remaining tracks are pure filler, nothing more need be said. The final track, \u201cBad Attitude,\u201d is merely a bad Testors cover song \u2013 nothing metal at all, more sounding like Oi/Punk \u2013 with Fenriz doing very badly on vocals.\n\nSpeaking of, how is it now Darkthrone are making more EP\u2019s? I thought their original stance was \u201cfull-length albums or nothing\u201d? But then again, I\u2019m thinking of the glory days of Darkthrone \u2013 over 10 years ago. Talk about hypocrisy. They sold their souls to the \u2018dollar god\u2019 since 1998.\n\nThis band doesn\u2019t even deserve to be noted as \u201cTrue Norwegian Black Metal\u201d anymore because Fenriz & Nocturno & Co. don\u2019t even live up to the title or their original impetus anymore. If this was anymore sad of a spiral \u2018fame to shame\u2019 tragedy story of what once was (to reference Burzum if I may) it would be enough to make me either commit suicide or become an eccentric Taoist. \n\nDarkthrone\u2019s grave rest here \u2013 the New (hopefully last) Wave of Bullshit Heavy Metal.\n",
        "\nA pretty climactic year had passed for the lads in Darkthrone. They had just released their most ambient and controversial album, \"Transilvanian Hunger\", which absolutely purged all traces of death and thrash metal from their music. They were unceremoniously dropped by the usually-forward-looking Peaceville Records after the label executives seemed to get cold feet over some doubtlessly flamboyant and inebriated statements from the band. With that, out walks Zephyrous into total obscurity (or so it seems), and Darkthrone is left as a duo who convinces the little guy who calls himself Satyr to release their next album on the fledgeling Moonfog Productions. Darkthrone hold back no punches here, making yet more flamboyant statements in the album insert about exactly how much the people who thought they were a political band need to fuck off, yet also revealing their (or at least, Herr Nagell's) sense of humour just a bit. In many ways, this album feels like a bit of a rush job, because it lacks the coherent direction of previous works, yet it actually gains strength through its somewhat schizophrenic nature. It also happens to be the most grandiose album in Darkthrone's discography.\n\nThis is certainly no Isengard, and the recording itself is uniform in sound. This is mostly a great thing, because the guitar and drum sound is, to put it bluntly, fantastic. I've always felt that Darkthrone knew exactly what they were doing in the studio and managed to get an interesting and distinct sound out of almost every one of their albums. Here, the drums have a muted but very heavy, natural thump, and the guitar tracks seem to exude the intoxicating, thick aroma of damp soil. You might almost say it's a \"warm\" sound, and seems a deliberate contrast to the very trebbly \"Transilvanian Hunger\", where despite the prevalence of high-midrange frequencies Nocturno Culto's bass-playing was distinctly audible. Here, the lower-midrange tones of the guitar has been emphasised, sacrificing the four-string anchor, but it's not needed here as the guitars simply sound so vibrant and ... alive. I feel that while \"Transilvanian Hunger\" was insidiously hateful and melancholic, \"Panzerfaust\" is a coursing, prancing beast, jaws flecked with foam and eyes alight with primordial intelligence. It's an exuberant album, in its black metal context.\n\nThe schizophrenia I alluded to earlier becomes clear once one has had time to digest the record and its implications. There are three distinct sounds, directions, or chapters to the \"Panzerfaust\" musical experience. The first that manifests is the melodic, melancholy-ridden progressions that made up the entirety of \"Transilvanian Hunger\". The songs \"En Vind av Sorg\" and \"Hans Siste Vinter\" might well be leftovers from the previous album's writing period. They are characterised by hypnotic, cycling short melody lines that wind and burrow into the cranium, with the endlessly \"polkapolkapolkapolka\"-ing percussion of Fenriz providing the pulse that simultaneously grounds the listener and opens his mind to receive the gnosis. The latter song seems to feature a single riff, but it is so beautiful and memorable that its nearly five-minute duration seems concluded in a trice, and the fade-out is slow and seems drawn out with exquisite deliberation (yes, that often-unnoticed Darkthrone ear for detail again). The effect is awesome, as you strain to continue hearing the song's melody and message long after the guitar has nearly ceased to be audible at all. \"En Vind av Sorg\" is a bit more harmonic and makes use of a few similarly patterned melodic ideas, dropping into a surprising, monstrous metal riff toward the end with a killer guitar slide .. the sort of thing that the band would *never* have placed on \"Transilvanian Hunger\". This is a phenomenal effect, because the rest of the song simply drips sorrow whereas the aforementioned metallic collossus of a riff (it's so simple, too!) is the transformation, the woeful man turning to rage for his solace as he drops to all fours and begins to transmogrify, bloodlust filling his heart. I guess this is as good a time as any to talk about the vocals. They're ugly, and there's no way around it. Unapologetically loud, unhindered and up-close without a hint of the usual Darkthrone echo effect to be found anywhere, Nocturno sounding stoned out of his mind to the point where you can almost see the drool spattering from his lips. I like them quite a lot, myself, but can relate a little to those who find them gratuitous or wish that someone would at least have turned the volume down in the studio. In the end though, I really can't imagine \"Panzerfaust\" being as good without those nasty and unique snarls.\n\nI'm tackling the three segments of \"Panzerfaust\" in order of their appeal, from greatest to least, and so we come to the middle-tier, the Hellhammer-ish dirges. Again, there are two of these in number, and they're both incredibly strong in their own right. \"The Hordes of Nebulah\" is sluggish and menacing, Nocturno Culto's fingers seeming to have expanded to the thickness of large tree branches so that every chord must be picked out with entirely too much effort and concentration. The song has great lyrics and those riffs have about them the stench of necrophilia. \"Quintessence\" almost deserves a paragraph all to itself. It actually sounds more like Burzum than Hellhammer, and is without a doubt the most over-the-top, monstrous song Darkthrone has ever written, and I admit that I laugh almost every time I listen to it .. but it's laughter of joy and zeal rather than derision, because who the hell knows how they thought they could get away with this, but they did it and it turned out to be one of the most memorable, anthemic songs in the canon of black metal. A slow, prideful riff of infinite simplicity and majesty that slides up to a different key but never really changes much. Drums that pound ponderously like the gait of an unstoppable behemoth. Nocturno Culto roars and groans out lyrics penned by Varg of Burzum about indomitable will to survive and thrive overcoming the adversities of man and nature. The song builds to a sort of climax at which everything stops to make way for screaming feedback, a descending orgy of tom-bashing and our satanic emissary getting so wrapped up and carried away by this expression of ideal that his vocals definitely bare the suggestion of predatory, sexual release, before the song returns to its original key and the narrative resumes at a calmer (well, comparatively calm, for this album) pitch. I think it's a neat little coup de grace that Fenriz only really begins to vary up his drumming and make things \"spicey\" when the song is already fading out, suggesting, perhaps, that the striding beast still continues in his journey though his hymn be concluded for the present. If the vocals in this piece are too much for you, you can here what is almost a much tamer version of the song on the Storm album. I guess that riff was just too good not to recycle.\n\nThen we have the third section, the Celtic Frost tribute songs, and this is to my mind the least notable part of \"Panzerfaust\". The songs are quite good for what they are, and the riffs are certainly nice and complemented well by that exquisite guitar sound. However, Darkthrone haven't really tread this path since the \"A Blaze in the Northern Sky\" days, and when they did, they made sure to inject a good helping of their original formula into the fray. \"Beholding the Throne of Might\" sounds like \"In the Shadow of the Horns\" without as many cool parts, and \"Triumphant Gleam\" sounds a bit like an embryonic out-take of something from \"To Mega Therion\", perhaps \"Fainted Eyes\". The conviction is still present in spades, but all the same these two pieces are lacking in something that almost made \"Panzerfaust\" a superb rather than a good album in Darkthrone's catalogue. The epilogue is Fenriz's responsibility, and it is a suitably eerie synth piece (the only time Darkthrone would try something like this) played with a brass patch and overlaid with sinisterly-spoken Norwegian poetry and rolling tom accents.\n\nDespite the feeling of odd juxtaposition I occasionally get from this album, on an ideological level it does seem to convey a unified message. I'd call this a most noble and triumphant record, and when it's at it's best it really is among the greatest in Darkthroen's achievements, while the mediocre material doesn't really detract from the over-all experience and provides some catchiness that the rest of the work mostly lacks. It is certainly necessary that anyone even remotely interested in Darkthrone have this in their collection, and it is an effective bridge between the more riff-heavy, rhythmic style of 80s death/thrash that inspired Darkthrone and the original, cold Norse black metal aesthetic.\n",
        "\nTo me, Darkthrone may as well have created the black metal textbook. How they specialise in creating generic music, and still sound so great, and dare I say it, original, still baffles me to this day. They are experts in representing everything I first loved in Black Metal, and now, they've decided to cut things right back to the skin and bones, and create some raucous ruckus of an [almost] straight down the line Heavy Metal album. This album drunkenly swaggers from track to track with catchy riffs and ridiculously over the top vocals, shrieking and all. The production sounds fucking great, and it really does make you want to rock out. I just have to make sure I don't headbang too much while I'm driving!\n\nThe bottom line for me, is that this albums rocks out, and it's obvious that it's a pure tribute to everything they love in Metal. I just wish I could put my finger on some of the things I love in the genre myself, and actually identify/qualify them in some coherent way. This is where Darkthrone are true masters! The text on Transilvanian Hunger that warns listeners that the album is above criticism holds true for this album. They can do whatever the fuck they like. (just to go off-topic here, I though Sardonic Wrath was worthy of critiscism. It sounded tired to me, like they didn't know what they were doing with it. I guess they were in two minds about carrying on with the textbook general BM, or rocking out more like they have chosen to since)\n\nI do have to say that, with me being English, the guys use of the language makes me laugh. In some ways the use of slang in metal sounds naive to me, but they do actually sound like they're using English English. That might be seen as stupid, but it's the kind of stuff my fellow islanders would come out with. When compared with a lot of other bands, even English bands, the accent/language sounds kind of neutral, avoiding modern cultural dependence, but this is different, so it's so strange to hear them shouting and screaming like this. I'm sure they're no strangers to these shores after hearing this album. It sounds like they've spent many a moon in the pubs over here!\n\nI've enjoyed going through some of the 'top ten' that both guys list in the liner notes too, especially Cirith Ungol which is very new to me, and I had to nod in agreement at some of their other choices too!\n\nI don't really want to give a percentage, what the fuck would it mean anyway? I put 85% in just because I think this is pretty damn solid. Maybe there's room to wonder whether it can stand the test of time like so many of the classics it harks back to. I usually find catchy albums wear off quick. Will Darkthrone go down in history along with greats like the ones they hail? Do I give a fuck? Did those bands give a fuck? Do Darkthrone give a fuck? Of course not!\n",
        "\nWhat the fuck is this? Man Darkthrone have totally gone mainstream. They sold out!! They are posers!! FUCK OFF AND DIE!!!!\n\nMy interest for Darkthrone ceased with Panzerfaust, I still kept somewhat up to date, but for the most part the curiosity for them and their music was gone. I heard F.O.A.D. was causing a stir so I decided to check it out. Well right from the start I couldn't stop laughing. They really don't give a fuck anymore and that's what makes it so great. They are from the real generation, they were one of few black metal bands and they will always remain on top in my mind. Every step they make is always miles ahead of the rest. They were playing this 'black n' roll' when nobody else was, now it's the trend of Scandinavia and increasingly across the world. F.O.A.D. is just the continuation of their earlier thrashy elements stripped of the droning black metal riffing. It's minimalistic, it's raw, and it has the real metal punk attitude that most music of today has forgotten. In a scene of masks, stagnation and pre-pubescent internet warriors Darkthrone laugh, take a sweaty beer shit and bust out some killer hellbanging chaos!\n\nNothing is lacking here for fans of 80's thrash, punk and rock bands. They basically did a Probot, by which they took signature styles of the good old bands (Metal Church, Venom, Black Sabbath, Celtic Frost, Piledriver etc.) and put them into a sort of compilation. \n\nI couldn't find anything wrong with this album. The production is that of a well produced 8 track rehearsal. The only thing that's clearly processed are the vocals, which vary in every imaginable way, from the standard ugh's, to falsetto wails (courtesy of Fenriz) and of course the signature growls of Nocturno Culto; which are albeit noticeably, though no doubt purposefully tamer than before. This actually fits the album well however. For the duration Nocturno looms over the podium and despotically mocks the mindless herds which have gathered beneath his feet. As the crowd jeers and spits and tears itself apart he closes his eyes and proudly dismisses them with a brush of the hand.\n\nThe drumming is damn good although relatively basic. Fenriz has been on the radar for percussive creativity since displaying his talents on the Land of Frost demo back in '88. Well nearly twenty years later he proves again to be one of the best. His playing style is extremely fluid, with great attention to the subtle intricacies which really make or break a drummer. He knows when and when not to play on the beat and with this he combines a phenomenal sense of groove. The guitar work is again above and beyond. Nocturno Culto must have sold his soul to the devil because it seems every riff he conjures is impeccable. Even with Darkthrone being such an old and influential fixture in the world of metal he still manages to keep ahead of the pack and really that alone demonstrates just what kind of talent he possesses. \n\nTo sum things up, if you're tired of sifting through the countless piles of shit and would like a bit of refreshment, then pick this up. To me there's not a ton of replay value, but who knows, either way it's fun and with the proper volume and alcohol ingestion you'll find yourself right where you need to be...\n",
        "\nI must confess that I'm still a newbie to the tr00 and kvlt black metal bands out there. Those early bands that were still considered by some to be death or thrash. Of course, Satyricon is not unkown to me, either is Mayhem, but bands like Darkthrone... Not heard yet... until now. F.O.A.D., a \"subtile\" way to hide the actually title (Fuck off and Die) is Darkthrone's newest album. There are no traces of black metal in it. Not to say it's bad, I have an open mind for bands to experiment. It's just... This experiment is not a great succes, and I'm being soft right now.\n\nTo critizice this album on the same niveau is not only a hard task, but also one of the weakest excuses to sound as blunt as possible. It's almost as if Darkthrone wanted to dispell every sense of emotion on this album. And while some may argue that emotion is not important matter in heavy metal, this just reached the bottom. F.O.A.D. is a rusty piece of fucking metal. A blunt way to entertain headbangers. An unenjoyable piece of work for the ones whose opinions are that emotion is an important factor in music. For those, it would likely to happen that they will find it shittier than dog poop.\n\nBut how can a band be as emotionless as this is? Quite easy, actually. Have the clich\u00e9 heavy metal riffs present, a screaming vocalist and some shitty drums under it. It would all work if the production was clear, like it's the case with Satyricon's Now, Diabolical (which can be enjoyable at times), but here, it's not. To make it sound even more rough, Darkthrone contained the production of their earlier years, a production that doesn't fit with Darkthrone's new goal.\n\nNow this is a blunt piece of shit. There is no reason to minimize the drums to sloppy groove metal beats. Like the guitars, the drums are extremely simple, very uninspired, and above all, highly uninteresting. Not only has the drummer made many faults with his compositions, the drum sound is bad, tempo's and volume's are uneven and it all doesn't flow with the guitars and vocals. Not that it would matter anyway, the vocals are so dreadful, this album would score higher if it was entirely instrumental. Catch a drunk metalhead who happens to like St. Anger, and ask for an imitation of his almighty lord Hetfield. Most likely, it will sound like this vocalist. There are no grunts, no proper screams, no clean vocals. Only half-assed yells, paining my ears and wondering how one could find this comfortable to listen to. It's almost as if the vocalist tried to sound as fucked up as possible, just to sound heavy.\n\nThere are some enjoyable parts throughout, thouh very rare. Canadian Metal has a funny chorus, the solo of The Church of Real Metal is quite good and The Banners of Old features a nice bridge. But for gods sake, the chorus of F.O.A.D. was so bad, whether it be meant to be funny or serious. And on this way I can name ziljions of examples of why I question this band's sanity and musicianship. But I will finish this review with a conclusion on the same niveau of this album.\n\nThis album fucking sucks.\n",
        "\nThis album is unfairly reviewed by most. While some \u201cget it\u201d, most just dismiss it. Well sorry folks, this isn\u2019t another \u201cUnder a Funeral Moon\u201d or \u201cTransylvanian Hunger\u201d. Get over it. If the listener can quit whining about it not sounding like their old albums, and actually listen to this one for what it is, they will realize that Darkthrone has released a really good album.\n\nThe sound of this album is defiantly old school thrash; however, it has a black metal twist that only Darkthrone can pull off. At this point in their career, Darkthrone feels they have nothing to prove and no one to impress. They are just making the albums that they want to make, and that deserves some respect. It\u2019s admirable when a band makes music for themselves and not for the consumer. It\u2019s the opposite of selling out, so I see no basis for the bitching of immature so called \u201ctrue\u201d black metal fans. The songs all pretty much have a similar sound; the style doesn\u2019t jump too drastically from song to song. Most songs sound like either Venom, Motorhead, or Hellhammer/Celtic Frost songs filtered through Norwegian black metal sensibilities.\n\nThe vocals are one of my favorite parts of this album. Nocturno Culto\u2019s voice seems to have changed a bit over the years, and mostly for the better, considering the tone of their recent output. More aggressive, less grim and cold. Very metal. Fenriz does more vocals on this album than usual (if you don\u2019t count Goatlord) and he does a great job. The last album he sounded more punk, but this time around he sounds like Tom Warrior (on Canadian Metal) or Lemmy (on the title track).\n\nThe guitars on this album are really good. I\u2019ve always loved the sound Nocturno Culto\u2019s guitar. It\u2019s very crunchy and high in the treble department, and I could listen to it all day long. It\u2019s like music to my ears (literally). The riffs are amazing. Very thrashy, and very fun. Turn this album up and try not to bang your head along with songs like The Church of Real Metal and Raised on Rock.\n\nThe bass is audible, which is rare in black metal, but then again this isn\u2019t actually a fully black metal album. Nothing interesting really going on with the bass, but it does its job well and sounds great.. Even though it\u2019s a little simple and unimpressive, I wouldn\u2019t change a thing. This isn\u2019t the kind of album where the band is trying to impress everyone with their \u201cskills\u201d.\n\nI enjoy the drums quite a bit. I have heard some complaints about Fenriz\u2019s drumming. People say it\u2019s too straightforward and ordinary. Listen up people, because I know this is going to blow your mind: Fenriz doesn\u2019t care about impressing you. He plays to fit the music, not to make everyone go \u201cwow he really is good!\u201d He knows he\u2019s good, he doesn\u2019t need to prove it anymore.\n\nNow on to the lyrics. They are the weakest part of the album. Most all of the songs deal with heavy metal or rock and roll. Not very imaginative, but then again they serve their purpose and fit the overall vibe of the album so it really isn\u2019t so bad.\n\nThe production is, in a word, dirty. All the instruments can be heard clearly, yet it sounds rough enough to give it that old school, gritty, underground thrash feel that they were going for. For some reason though, Canadian Metal seems to be boosted in the bass department, so I have to turn the bass down when I listen to that song or else the music gets lost under the booming fuzz. All in all, the production is perfect and very appropriate.\n\nDarkthrone\u2019s 13th studio effort, F.O.A.D. (An acronym for Fuck Off And Die), is a heavy metal masterpiece. This is noting to be taken seriously, folks, so just pop in the CD and get ready to bang your head. This is old school, no bull-shit thrash. No pompous arrogance or attempts at pleasing the masses here. Just good old fashioned rock \u2018n\u2019 roll. Would you want it any other way?\n",
        "\nThe year 1995 signalled the end of an era for me. It was the year the last decent Darkthrone full-length graced the public with it's uncompromising style. Panzerfaust represents the last of the Darkthrone material which is good enough to be seen under their name.\n\n\nIt takes the style of Transilvanian Hunger and attempts to progressively alter it. Although Panzerfaust doesn't quite live up to the previous Darkthrone release, it does it's job effectively and with ease. This is just another black metal album which relies heavily on creating atmosphere to appeal to the listener. Some might say it relies too heavily on this one element to pull it through and make it something special. That is somewhat true. Panzerfaust is by no means fantastic, but it's decent. Something which cannot be said about the vast majority of Darkthrone's material. Considering the fact that it's been over a decade since this full-length was released and since then all the public have heard is an awful change in sound, style and approach by Darkthrone, it's incredibly hard to write a positive review in the knowledge of how their career turned out. \n\n\nThis, like Transilvanian Hunger, is about repetitive riffs and percussion sections. This is done in order to achieve a certain atmospheric sound, one that Darkthrone pull off well. It's bleak, cold and dark. Not to the same extent as previous albums, but it's close enough to those elements to become enjoyable to listen to. The vocals are quite poor. They fail to live up to the standard Darkthrone previously set themselves. They're scratchy, much like the production, and they lack any real spark to be considered any different to any other mediocre black metal performance on vocals. \n\n\nThe production isn't as harsh as we've seen. Darkthrone either suit reasonably clear production with immense atmospheric qualities, or a harsh lo-fi production. Panzerfaust displays neither. It's somewhere in-between, which one does not want to hear. It doesn't enhance the atmospheric nature like the repetitive guitars do, in actual fact it doesn't really have much purpose. This is a striking negative on latter Darkthrone albums. A sheer lack of purpose and soulless material, Panzerfaust can display this at times.\n\n\nTo put it simply, this is the beginning of the end for Darkthrone as we know it. Funnily enough, as I wrote that, I heard the vocals say, \"We're the future\". Unfortunately not, no.\n",
        "\nIs strange how apt Darkthrone's lyrics are in terms of public perception on them these days. Here's an example of what I mean:\n\n\"Hate at first sight\". A feeling most people tend to feel before hearing the latest Darkthrone full-length. Over time Darkthrone have lost more than their talent. They've lost their appeal and fanbase. There are some who continue to stay in the hope that they'll eventually give up on this new approach and just head back to the good old days of misanthropic black metal which would easily beat any other record to a pulp with it's mammoth repetition, dark atmospheric nature and unrelenting style. Alas, no. Hate Them is another disappointing Darkthrone full-length, but is by no means the worst.\n\n\n\"Death just takes a moment \nSuffering is forever\". This much is true when it comes to Darkthrone. The death of this one legendary band came in an instant, whereas the suffering of having to endure one after the other of new lifeless Darkthrone full-lengths still continues to this very day. Darkthrone's style of Hate Them is very laboured and weary. It's simply unable to stand up to the challenge of modern day black metal. Whilst the genre has continued to grow, with new sub-genres emerging regularly, Darkthrone's essence is stuck in the past. Unable to unlock the talent which this band once had, Hate Them lacks the drive and passion we once saw on earlier records.\n\n\n\"Let's leave this sinking ship together\". Perhaps a metaphor for the band's global image nowadays. It's steadily sinking, just as a ship would do. Every element of Darkthrone has become progressively worse. Progression backwards is quite some feat. The poor vocals, which simply irritate and become tedious very quickly. They add no atmosphere, they simple exist. The nothing riffs which will ultimately fail to be remembered with kindness. Percussion wise, this is again poor. Uninspired blast beats are placed in the mix quite often, in order to fill the void. There's no spark or creativity, it's dull, dreary and lifeless. Lyrically, Darkthrone have just become poorer and poorer. None of the old misanthropic aggression remains. \n\nA glittering career is being washed down the drained and fast. One has to wonder why Darkthrone have changed their style.\n",
        "\nI don't often buy new albums, even more so, I almost never buy expensive new albums. But somehow I was able to shell out close to $20 for this oddly encased new release by Darkthrone without hesitation. The reasoning for this choice extends far beyond a compulsion to support a band which has achieved legend status, or to critique and compare this new offering. Quite simply, I purchased this album because Darkthrone is a band that has spent more of their career shattering contentions about what black metal should be, than wallowing in the stale arena of blast beats and corpse paint. I had no doubt that they would continue to push the envelope, fan boys and elitists be damned, and I was not disappointed.\n\nFor starters, F.O.A.D. IS a black metal record through and through. However, it exists more in the realm of the time before black metal became a thoroughly defined genre, held down by standards and stipulations. True there is no corpse paint, no minimalist stark black and white photos, no cryptic messages in Old English fonts, but the last time I checked, Venom, the band responsible for giving the genre 'black metal' its name, had none of these things. In fact, they could barely play their instruments, their raw evil sound owing more to sloppy playing and poor recording than cold calculated delivery. What did exist then and exists in this album is a fury and desire to play the blackest, most unchained, and yes, most rocking, music possible. \n\nF.O.A.D. razes the church of black metal to the ground and builds it back up with blood, sweat, and beer. I'd be lying if I said this album isn't a bit of a shock to the system, but this album isn't just a change from the traditional, it's a fucking paradigm shift. The guys start out easy on us with 'These Shores are Damned' a fairly \"non-blasphemous\" tune, straddling the territory between Total Death and The Cult is Alive, before Hellhammering the senses with the ton of bricks that is the opening riff for 'Canadian Metal'. At this point, opinions on this album are sure to split 50/50, with genre purists crying foul, and fans of raw metal mayhem screaming for more. And more they shall receive. 'The Church of Real Metal', with it's almost Dio-like passage into the shouted chorus, followed by far away keys and doomy riffing. 'Fuck Off and Die' fueled by Motorhead and hatred of those who are quick to judge, but too slow to change. I'll spare you a further individual track breakdown. Suffice to say that this is an album filled with many moments that demand double takes, but make more and more sense with repeat listening. The riffs themselves are untouchable, the solos and leads darkly melodic with touches of the psychedelic, but best of all, everything is kept simple and to the point.\n\nSoap box time. This album is a giant fuck you to a large portion of the world of metal as it stands now. The ideas that only the most skilled of players are fit to create good works, that songs must be epic displays of fretboard gymnastics or mind bending mathematical workouts to be considered of worthwhile integrity. An idea of any kind, in music or otherwise, is the most effective when it is kept to the point, undiluted, unbound by useless tangents. Progressive symposiums, impossible scales, songs comprised of a few good riffs sandwiched by dozens of generic or mundane ones. It's like a huge algebraic equation or formula for quantum physics. Sure we can all appreciate it's complexity, but how many among us can actually fully comprehend or relate to it? \nThis is black metal. Anguished, evil, angry, bleak, disparaging, depressing music, and not all of it must be detached and cerebral. The primal urge of rock appeals to all of us, no matter how above it we try to act. \n\nDarkthrone is giving black metal back to the common man, the outcasts, the disenfranchised, the unprivileged. Destroying the traditional rules of what is and is not acceptable in metal. Releasing an original and refreshing album, that is both tribute and traitor to heavy metal. And why?\nBecause they are in a perfect place to do so. They have the clout to release what they want, when they want, with the artwork and packaging they want. Nocturno Culto can release a pseudo-documentary dvd of himself just hanging out, and still release it on a recognized label with worldwide distribution. They released an expensive, elaborate, dangerous album, and even the naysayers still purchased it. This is not an album released to fulfill contract obligations, if it was, it would have been bland and predictable. This is a toss of the gauntlet to the old guard, a battle cry to the numerous underground metal bands playing with more originality and passion than technical expertise. \nA cry that only Darkthrone could force the world to hear.\n",
        "\nGoatlord is Darkthrone\u2019s sixth album by time of release and their second by time of composition. The music is basically death metal from their rehearsal era with vocals added in 1994, including backing vocals by Satyr of Satyricon and female vocals allegedly recorded by Fenriz himself. Unfortunately this is quite a weak combination of sounds and one which ultimately ruins this album. \n\nThe death metal instrumental work here is relatively good. Some parts like the end of the opener, Rex, are actually quite good, as are parts from other songs. This is just on the instrumental side though, and nothing here reaches what I\u2019ve heard neither from Soulside Journey nor from Darkthrone\u2019s demos. For example, the 9-minute instrumental Snowfall easily kills this entire album in terms of technicality and songwriting and it\u2019s been recorded in 1988 for the \u201cA New Dimension\u201d demo. Goatlord isn\u2019t much more than a rehearsal with vocals added later on and this painfully shows. \n\nThe vocals are what take this album to the brink of being complete shit. First of all, Nocturno Culto\u2019s standard black metal rasp isn\u2019t too bad compared to the rest of the vocals on the album but even this rasp is inferior to almost everything he\u2019s done on other albums. Then we have the clean vocals. I don\u2019t know who does them, but they fucking suck. And finally in the vocal department we have the female vocals. I don\u2019t really care if Fenriz became an audio transvestite while doing them or if someone else did them because either way they suck and have no place on this album. Now I can appreciate both clean and female vocals but here they\u2019re executed in such a laughable way that they nearly eliminate all potential enjoyment for this album. \n\nLyrically this is pretty standard stuff for either black metal or death metal\u2026stuff about death, darkness and some anti-Christian stuff here and there. They\u2019re not bad but nothing to get excited about either. \n\nNow I haven\u2019t heard the newer Darkthrone albums which are considered crap or sell-outs by many reviewers. In fact the only albums done after Goatlord\u2019s release that I\u2019ve heard are Total Death and Hate Them but they\u2019re both far better and well written than this. Goatlord\u2019s just a death metal rehearsal with added vocals (which are shitty for the most part). It should be regarded as such when one considers buying this. While a couple of listens might be worth your time only consider getting this after all other Darkthrone albums or if you\u2019re interested in the period between the first and second Darkthrone albums.\n",
        "\nI love EP\u2019s. Maybe it\u2019s because the first record I got as a kid was a Beatle EP in the early 60\u2019s. My test for a good EP is if you play it twice right through when you first get it. I played \u201cNWOBHM\u201d two and a half times.\n\nA listening tip: play this on the best quality system you can. It\u2019s tempting to think that, because Darkthrone goes for a lo-fi sound, there\u2019s not much in there and that any cheap plastic system will do. Not so. Minimal production doesn\u2019t mean bad production.\n\nA case in point is the first track, a much bigger and fatter version of \u201cWisdom of the Dead\u201d, the last track on the new album \u201cF.O.A.D.\u201d. It\u2019s a whopping, all-encompassing sound, full of heavyweight punch, the vocals more close-mic\u2019d and intimate \u2013 if I can use that word with Darkthrone \u2013 than the album version. A fabulous track with great riffs that recall the dense textures of the old days.\n\n\u201cCanadian Metal\u201d follows, pretty well identical to the album version but with different vocals (no pub chorus, basically). If you\u2019re not planning to buy the album, at least with this EP you get one of its best tracks, one you can really headbang to in front of the hi-fi.\n\nThe standout part of the third track, \u201cHedninger Fra Helvete\u201d is the chiming coda which kicks in around 3:50. It lasts only a bit over a minute but it\u2019s a gem, the bass climbing the fretboard to support the suspended chords. Very atmospheric.\n\nThe last full-length showed that at least one ventricle in Darkthrone\u2019s black heart is consecrated to punk and the final track here, a cover of Testors\u2019 \u201cBad Attitude\u201d, proves it, if proof were needed. Again, on the best system, this rocks like hell, a short and fitting end to a solid and engaging fifteen minutes of black \u2019n\u2019 roll.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to disagree with antipath\u2019s review of this disc. Viewed from the logical standpoint of musical history, this EP looks a cheap and cynical knock-off from a band way past its prime. Trouble is, my foot taps involuntarily every time I put it on, I bash away on the steering wheel with the frenzy of Fenriz when I play it in the car (not recommended for younger drivers) and my family is sick to death of me bopping around the house warbling \u201cCa-nay-dee-un Meta-aaahhhl\u201d. In short, it\u2019s a rocking little disc.\n\nWhen it comes to a conflict over Darkthrone between my brain and my foot, the foot wins every time.\n",
        "\n\"Soulside Journey\". \"A Blaze In The Northern Sky\". \"Under A Funeral Moon\". \"Transilvanian Hunger\". \"Panzerfaust\". \"Goatlord\", and, arguably, \"Total Death\". All classics, a catalogue of releases which span a five year gap from 1991 (Soulside Journey), to 1996 (Total Death). \n\nHere it is, some eleven years later, and Darkthrone are still at it. Fenriz and Nocturno Culto are still playing a dirty and controversial form of metal that fans either love or hate, with very little room for middle ground. \n\nAdmittedly, I haven't had much exposure to Darkthrone's material post-1996. That is, beyond a few random, and brief listens. Certainly nothing serious, as I am of the opinion that Fenriz and Nocturno Culto could never outdo, or come close to, their work on \"Transilvanian Hunger\" and/or \"Panzerfaust\". \n\nIn all honesty, if anyone out there is expecting black metal these days that sounds like it did durring the second wave, they're deluded and more than a bit jaded. This goes double when referencing a band who was actually around and recording back then. \n\nNo matter how childish some of Darkthrone's lyrics are these days (very!), they're not teenagers any longer. That initial fire in their bellies has long went cold. The only last vestige of those days, is that Fenriz and Nocturno Culto look at making albums from a standpoint of pleasing themselves, not the consumer. \n\nA cop out for Darkthrone? Perhaps, but \"F.O.A.D.\" is hardly worthy to be called Darkthrone's \"Saint Anger\" either. Although it doesn't live up to Darkthrone's more legendary material, there is at least a part of those greater times preserved here. \n\nMetallica's \"Saint Anger\" was probably the biggest let down in metal history. Promises were made, and Metallica didn't deliver on one of them. For the most part Darkthrone do deliver the goods here, with \"F.O.A.D.\". \n\nThe vocal tone - the lyrics are proposterous, childish, and just plain stupid - the guitar tone, Fenriz's pattented drums and the all too inaudible bass are all here. Just like in the classic releases, and with much of the same pinache, only done in such a way as to harken back to other (some would say better) bands. Bands such as Iron Maiden, Whiplash, Diamond Head, Holocaust, Motorhead, and Tankard are all given the once over on this album. This album actually has a very Bay Area thrash feel to it because of that. Only \"F.O.A.D.\" is much dirtier, as one should expect from Darkthrone's releases. \n\nIf \"Panzerfaust\" was a Celtic Frost rip-off (you can debate that, certainly), then this one should really come as no great surprise. Especially given that \"The Cult Is Alive\" was an intentional stab at crust punk. While I certainly found \"The Cult Is Alive\" to be somewhat of an \"Undisputed Attitude\", this is actually enjoyable in places. \n\nAgain, my biggest complaint over this album is the lyric. I wonder if this is why Varg was such a big contributor to Darkthrone in that department? Certainly, the sound of this album is about as good as one could hope for, beyond the second wave brilliance of Darkthrone at least. \n\nActually, I'll even venture out and say that some of this album is absolutely brilliant. It's just too bad that an otherwise superb album is tarnished with such a frequently overlooked thing as lyrics. It's not brain science, or rocket surgery, but Nocturno Culto sure makes it look as though this were the case.\n\nAs with anything new, I suggest downloading it before you buy it. There's no reason to buy a crap album these days, not when mp3s are so easy to come by anyhow.\n",
        "\nNaysayers can eternally rot! This is raw, minimalistic, nihilistic, grim black metal, a milestone and eternal classic in the genre. Joke if you want about the production (which sounds great compared to Mutiilation or Beherit, I don't see what the complaining is all about), but the production is just one of the great things about this album. Really everything about the album is great, it deserves its rating. It is the epitome of evil in black metal music, impossible to access by the mainstream, metal or otherwise. Fans of popular newer black metal may be disgusted to find out not all evil can be that clean. This is dirty, this is raw.\n\nThe overall sound of the album has been described by many, but I'll do it too in case you don't know yet. The drums are very repetitive, mid to fast tempo blastbeats. The drum sound is muffled, and essentially becomes \"white noise\" to a casual listener unless you are listening to the album very closely. This repetitive and \"background noise\" nature of the drums is a blessing. The drums serve only to keep a steady, trance-like rhythm to the music. This allows the guitar to be the focus of the instrumental portion of the music.\n\nWhich brings me to my next point: the riffs of Transilvanian Hunger. They are mostly sad-sounding, and all definitely evil. The riffs of this album are the soundtrack to darkness and sadness. They are all played entirely open: no palm muting or fancy guitar work here. Strictly open notes, open strings, and power chords with open strings for dissonance create a wall of sad-sounding riffage. The bass is essentially unheard on this album due to its nature and focus on guitar, however at some points it is heard, generally playing one or two notes over and over (essentially a background-music extension of the drums). The guitars, leading the instrumental sound of the band, are fairly high pitched in terms of metal, which runs parallel to the vocals of Nocturno Culto.\n\nNocturno Culto's vocals are top-notch to creating an evil, black metal atmosphere. He has throaty, evil sounding growls that are neither very low (ala death metal) or very screechy (ala Hat from Gorgoroth's Pentagram). The vocals are mid-range which is really great for the music- high vocals would simply be over the top in this sort of minimalist rampage of bleak nihilism, and low vocals would take the emphasis off of the repetitive (this is a good thing here) two or three black metal riffs per song.\n\nThis album's effect on black metal is profound- there are a slew of bands who play Transilvanian Hunger-influenced style. Generally they fail to meet the mark- one generally cannot create evil beauty like this over again. Darkthrone didn't try to create the sound again, as they haven't had an album like this since.This album shows that a band can play only a minimal amount of a few riffs in a cold atmosphere and create an absolute classic.\n",
        "\nWhoa! Where are all these 90 ratings coming from, Nocturno Culto and Fenriz themselves? Have you people heard this album from beginning to end? I have and this is definitely no 90 out of 100. I keep that rating reserved for anything of Darkthrone from 1990 to 1996. Now is this a black metal record? Hell no, but Darkthrone pass themselves off as a black metal band. Of course they should, they\u00b4ve only made their names in metal history playing black metal music. They also made some of the finest works in the genre. I\u00b4m all for trying to play music from your heroes but at least don\u00b4t pass it off as a Darkthrone album. Jeez, I can only imagine if they had thought of trying to play Uriah Heep style music on this. Are they trying to alienate the thousands of loyal and dedicated fans that have stuck with them for the better part of 15 years? From the looks of the direction in the past couple of years it looks like it.\n\nThe album starts off with a nice riff on These Shores Are Damned and its a song that easily could have been off The Cult Is Alive. Canadian Metal is an alright track that could\u00b4ve done without the clean vocals in the beginning. In a way it takes away the intensity of the track and almost makes you laugh. The Banners Of Old has an big Black Sabbath influence on it but Nocturno\u00b4s voice ruins it which is an absolute rarity since he almost never does a bad job on many songs but here he lacks hatred and intensity. Maybe age is getting to them since the fire seems to have dimmed a bit. They are in their mid 30\u00b4s and with real lives. They just sound like they\u00b4re going through the motions here and seemingly have to look elsewhere for ideas and inspiration to continue. I have to agree with the poster below who said the title track sung by Fenriz is a joke. Even though Fenriz does a nice Lemmy imitation it should have been kept as a b-side, HIdden from the majority of fans. Which leads to another thing, since when does Darkthrone release singles? Didn\u00b4t they stand for everything \u00a8anti-promotion\u00a8? Oh yes, they used to until they started selling out.\n\nI don\u00b4t know these guys anymore. I\u00b4m ok with going into \u00a8new directions\u00a8 as long as it\u00b4s good as before or close to it. This doesn\u00b4t cut the mustard folks. I almost can\u00b4t believe the absurd silly lyrics and even sillier song titles (Fuck Off and Die and The Church of Real Metal). I\u00b4d love to know what church they\u00b4re going to in search for \u00a8real metal\u00a8 that way I can send a telegram to Varg Vikernes to burn it down. Oh Lord, I can only imagine what Varg himself would think of Darkthrone today as opposed to when he first went into prison back in \u00b493. Raised On Rock you guys say? Ok, fine do it under a different name but please stop desecrating the good name of your band. For those of you who haven\u00b4t heard this I\u00b4ll say that Venom sounds harder than this. Yeah, this from the men who brought necro classics as Transylvanian Hunger , Panzerfaust and A Blaze In The Northern Sky. Shame on you Darkthrone for releasing this half assed attempt at \u00a8metal music\u00a8 and shame on the two guys who actually gave this album 90 or above rating. I\u00b4ll keep my copies of Soulside Journey up to Total Death while I\u00b4m giving this cd to my friend who can also hear it and give it a negative review in the future. Pathetic.\n",
        "\nIt's funny. It happens to every band that does this, but you can't stop it. Once a well respected black metal band tries something new, here come all the kids saying how this is bad and they lost their way. I thought people understood, with last year's The Cult is Alive, that Darkthrone is just making music they want to make. They want to pay tribute to the bands that influenced them so deeply. Whatever. All that doesn't matter, because once you listen to this record, you'll understand that FOAD is an ode to those unheralded 80s metal bands, and a salute to the bands that took the metal flag and raised it high for everyone to enjoy.\n\nFrom the opening notes of These Shores are Damned, Darkthrone deliver 8 tracks of classic heavy metal riffs and that beer-fueled, sweat-filled energy every metal fan feels when he hears that awesome riff. These guys aren't just your average 3-chord black metal guitarists, they understand how to create catchy riffs without sounding cheesy, and still make them sound like a Darkthrone riff. Combine this with Fenriz's usual top-notch drumming performance (he adapts so well to the style changes here), and Nocturno Culto's trademark vocals, those gravelly, aggressive, Lemmy-doing-black-metal things he does so well, and you got a winning formula. And the Darkthrone guys went out of their way to point out just who they want to honor here. Canadian Metal reeks of Manilla Road and Iron Maiden's passion and energy. The Banners of Old sounds like it wouldn't be too out of place on an Ozzy-Sabbath record. This all delivered with the intensity that these two men always manage to translate onto their records. \n\nPretty much, you should know what to expect with this. This is just a fun metal record, one without any lame pretensions or scene ideologies. Enjoy it for what it is, and salute the bands that made Darkthrone, and the countless other bands you might listen to, pick up their instruments and entertain you.\n",
        "\nIf you\u2019ve seen Nocturno Culto\u2019s rambling yet oddly compelling DVD \u201cThe Misanthrope\u201d, you\u2019ll be on familiar territory here. Slip past the grinning gravedigger Mr Necro on the cover of the CD booklet and you\u2019ll be greeted by (gasp!) colour photos of Ted and Gylve romping in their beloved Norwegian wilderness. The pix could easily be stills from the film. Since the excellent \u201cPreparing for War\u201d box of 2005 the Darkthrone boys have opted to give us more than just a glimpse into their lives. \u201cMisanthrope\u201d even shows them jamming in their studio \u2013 yes, the famed room with the tea-curtains \u2013 worth the price of the DVD alone. Now, on \u201cF.O.A.D.\u201d, they\u2019ve pretty well invited us around to spend the winter. The lads have even provided an annotated listening list of great but largely unheralded metal albums (so glad it includes Mayhem\u2019s brilliant \u201cOrdo Ad Chao\u201d) to while away the chilly nights.\n\nThe personal guided tour continues with Fenriz\u2019 intros to each song, typically tongue-in-cheek, and it soon becomes clear that this is a tribute album of sorts. The punk propulsion of the last record has gone and old school riffs abound as DT hails Iron Maiden, Metal Church, Black Sabbath and Burzum, amongst others. Fear not \u2013 it\u2019s unmistakably Darkthrone, although whether it\u2019s a tribute or piss-take you can never be quite sure with these clowns. An example is \u201cCanadian Metal\u201d, a whimsical uproar (to borrow from the lyrics) that features a chorus line of BVs and a Bruce Dickinson-styled operatic trill. Why can\u2019t metal be fun, hey?\n\nThere is more musical variety on this disc than any other DT album I can think of. Chorus lines and even a guest vocalist apart, the big changes come in the guitar tones. Ted has decided to broaden his palette and there\u2019s an unprecedented amount of layering without, thankfully, forsaking his characteristic sound. \u201cChurch of New Metal\u201d and \u201cThe Banners of Old\u201d both sound like a \u2019throne take on Sabbath. There\u2019s still the trademark chainsaw crunch of Ted\u2019s guitars but the moaning reverbed refrain in the left channel sounds like it came from \u201cParanoid\u201d era Iommi. It pops up elsewhere and it\u2019s a wonderfully atmospheric sound to fatten up the album.\n\nThose who mourn the passing of the old necro sludge of \u201cTransilvanian Hunger\u201d may take some consolation from \u201cSplitkein Fever\u201d, the guitars intentionally muted down to sound like the old days. Even Ted\u2019s voice sounds more organic and less gravelly. When they rip into the fast double-kick refrain you\u2019ll think it\u2019s a long lost track from the corpsepaint era. Lovely.\n\nBut it\u2019s the beercan-raised tributes that dominate here, none more endearing \u2013 or silly \u2013 than \u201cRaised on Rock\u201d. As on the title cut, Fenriz delivers his best Lemmy impersonation in this homage to Venom. What makes the track \u2013 and the entire album \u2013 live and breathe, of course, is the drummer\u2019s gift for swing. He can play on my demos any day. Like all Darkthrone albums, \u201cF.O.A.D.\u201d romps from start to finish.\n\nDarkthrone have always been jokers, often to the extent of their own credibility. Some, though, have never seen the gag and yearn for the \u201cserious\u201d days of corpsepaint and \u201cNorsk Arisk Black Metal\u201d. Me, I love Darkthrone, whatever they do and find their nudge-wink humour refreshing. Darkthrone\u2019s music is the reset button that clears away the cobwebs and the crap and I often find myself turning to DT when everything else seems stale and wasted.\n\nAnd so it\u2019s almost impossible for me to allocate a mere number rating to Darkthrone\u2019s music. It\u2019s either all or nothing in my book and I like this album a lot. Before deciding on a figure, I pulled out all my DT albums (no, I don\u2019t have them all \u2013 yet) and put them in order of most to least preferred. This disk was second from the top, hence the mark I\u2019ve given. What was at the top, you wonder?\n\nListen without prejudice, and then decide for yourself. For those who don\u2019t like this album, of course, the band has a few words of wisdom for you.\n",
        "\nGoatlord, or perhaps the end of a career? Call it what you will, but Darkthrone still made the decision to release this material. Is it fair to say it was unnecessary? I'd say so. Just as things were going well for Darkthrone, they messed it up by allowing Goatlord to be heard by the adoring fans world-wide. It's symbolic of the beginning of the end for a band who showed so much promise and potential. \n\n\nThere are numerous failings when it comes to Goatlord. As the material comes from a rehearsal tape, it is quite obviously and expectedly poor quality in terms of production. Lo-fi and scratchy in sound, hearing each instrument can become a challenge. Given the fact that there isn't much to appreciate here, perhaps challenging one's self to being able to decipher everything over the poor quality production is the only worthwhile thing to do. The vocals are substandard. Considering the fact that Fenriz claims to have recorded the 'female' vocals himself gives the listener a clear indication of what to expect. I'm not sure what these 'female' vocals are meant to add in terms of depth and additional qualities. I'm not a huge fan of female vocals as it is. There are even some form of clean vocals present, which adds to the confusing surrounding this full-length.\n\n\nThe fact that the vocals vary throughout is somewhat confusing and isn't necessary, just like the release of this full-length in general. Deep growls, tortured screams and whiny high pitched vocals reign supreme. It's hard to find a justification for this album considering it was recorded between what most people call their best albums to date. It would be somewhat understandable if the material was recorded years before they produced their best work, but it wasn't. It was practically in their prime. It makes no sense for them to release this amateurish, inept and unskilled piece of work. \n\n\nSimplicity has never really been an issue for me, but Goatlord showcases a dull and lifeless form of simplicity that won't live on in the memory for any positive reasons.\n",
        "\nDarkthrone are mostly known for their triptych (a work of art divided in 3 sections) of A Blaze In The Northern Sky, Under A Funeral Moon and, finally, Transilvanian Hunger.\nThese three albums represent the pinnacle of their black metal work. Later albums just aren\u2019t as grim or as \u201cblack\u201d even though they still are great for the most part. Transilvanian Hunger is the last of these three godly black metal albums and, in my opinion, the greatest. \n\nOne aspect this album is famous for in black metal circles is its completely awful production. I say awful not in a negative sense but in a sense that compares this to the vast majority of artists who try to make their music sound\u2026well recorded. Here Fenriz and Nocturno decided to produce their fourth studio album in a way that makes it sound about as grim, raw and generally evil as possible. As much as I personally consider good production a good thing, I am forced to say that many extremely well-produced black metal bands out there just don\u2019t sound evil at all. Most of these are symphonic bands such as Dimmu Borgir or Cradle of Filth but also some \u201ctr00\u201d bands like Immortal and newer Darkthrone. In any case, the production here fits the music perfectly. This is as raw as it can get. \n\nMusically we have raw and simplistic black metal played by what is undeniably one of the best black metal bands ever. Fenriz\u2019s drumming is extremely simplistic and in the background, as should be for any good black metal. One interesting aspect here is that even though this is raw as fuck, the riffs are quite melodic in nature. Not to mention well-played, even if they are quite repetitive: there are only two riffs on the title track. That\u2019s 6:09 in length. And these two riffs manage to create on of the greatest black metal tracks ever done by anyone. \n\nAs for the lyrics I can only judge the title track since the rest is in Norwegian, a language I still can\u2019t understand (yet). However, if the rest of the album is lyrically similar to the title track then we\u2019re in for one extremely well-written album. Transivanian Hunger\u2019s lyrics deal with the coldness of death, vampires, and generally Transilvania. Now it\u2019s not really that cold in Transilvania (not even during winter) but this song really manages to make Transilvania seem like it were in Norway or even further north. The last four tracks are written by Burzum\u2019s mastermind and only member Varg Vikernes, a.k.a. Greifi (Count) Grishnackh. Judging by Varg\u2019s work with Burzum, these tracks must be excellent as he\u2019s a fucking genius when writing music. And while performing it. \n\nOne thing that\u2019s made this album considerably more infamous is the nature of some of the statements on the back cover. First of all is the statement made by Fenriz about the album\u2019s quality which was to be printed on the back cover but was refused by their label: \n\u201cWe would like to state that Transilvanian Hunger stands beyond any criticism. If any man should attempt to criticize this LP, he should be thoroughly patronized for his obviously Jewish behavior.\u201d Obviously, as we live in a completely fucked up society dominated by political correctness up everyone\u2019s ass, this was seen as racist by their label Peaceville and they made a huge fuss over nothing, leading to Darkthrone\u2019s signing onto Moonfog Productions 2005, when they\u2019ve returned to Peaceville. \nThe second statement that sparked controversy was the Norsk Arisk Black Metal (Norwegian Aryan Black Metal) written on the back cover in very large print, under True Norwegian Black Metal. \nThese four words made it into early prints of the album but were censored from the recent digipack version. Again, everyone\u2019s mass hysteria about something being politically incorrect caused a huge crisis with the band having been accused of being National Socialists by the lovable Norwegian media and then having to made a statement as to which they are not a political band. Of course the word Aryan (simply meaning White, Caucasian) has been almost banned in the world since 1945 as a symbol of the evil of whites being proud of their heritage and culture. \n\nTransivanian Hunger is Darkthrone\u2019s best effort ever and one of the greatest black metal albums written. This is perfect when considering its musical genre and has absolutely no flaws to it. This is essential to everyone who claims to love black metal and is sincere about it. One must really have something wrong going on in his/her brain in order to claim this is bad while pretending to be a black metal fan. This IS black metal in its purest, unaltered form.\n",
        "\nWell, where to begin.... This is a pretty much useless release. Darkthrone has become fond of EPs now, which is already suspect. EPs serve one of two functions: to release good material for fans when there is not enough material to fill an LP (rare), or to serve as a quick cash maker for the band, record label etc... (most). This is a prime example of a cash grab. Ethical arguments aside, this EP is worthless. \n\nThe title alone tells you what you are in for. The typical packaging and selling of nostalgia when a market has stagnated. Darthrone, sadly, is stagnant as a relevant or creative force. This EP continues their trend of punkish, slightly thrashy watered down black metal. I love Darkthrone, but as those who will no doubt disagree with this review, I am more fond of their early work. So I just gave the posers an excuse to write me off. The title of this EP tells the listener that they will be taking a trip down memory lane, to a time when black metal was new. I see that they did remind me of those times, and the vocal technique used here is very similar to old Celtic Frost, Possessed, Venom, and to some degree Motorhead. There is the now usual punkish feel to nearly every song, which I'm sorry but I hate punk and there is no reason why a quintessential second wave Black Metal group like Darkthrone should still call themselves Darkthrone and become an Oi! band. That aside, the material is weak anyway. Cheesy guitar solos what would have only been impressive in 1981 only remind you how far Darkthrone has fallen. This is the kind of black metal that short haired 14 year olds in leather jackets and Hammerfall T-shirts would listen to because Old Man's Child is too scary sounding. \n\nThe problem here is creativity. All you will hear on this EP is stuff that was coming out in the early 1980s, and which was overdone and out classed by the late 1980s. Some will justify this by saying that Darkthrone is going back to their NWOBHM and punk roots, and that if anything this is a more \"true\" release than Under a Funeral Moon. I say bull shit. This kind of stuff ran its course and has been done 10 times better anyway. Darkthrone has gone in a really bad direction, and if anything their music is devolving rather than evolving. We all get nostaligic at times, but that is why we dust off our old Possessed CDs, we don't let ourselves be suckered by formerly good bands who have run out of ideas and need money.\n",
        "\nFirst off, screw what all the blackmetal dudes say, THIS is Darkthrones crown achievement of their career, NO QUESTION. Having bought this album when it was released, I was super excited for what the future would hold for this band... Of course many of us who DIDNT jump on the blackmetal bandwagon were utterly DISGUSTED with their direction after this album, as they totally jumped on the Euronymous/Mayhem trend and completely abandoned their roots. Hell, I have a friend who WROTE these guys in '92 telling them how much he liked this album, etc. only to have Fenriz reply that he should fuck off, as should anyone who likes this release, or death metal in general. That was the end of my support for these guys, and the end of this band in general to me. Their next album \"a blaze in the northern sky\" was an insult to their early fans from their demo era as were all of their later releases as a reformed \"blackmetal\" band. \n\nOn to this great release now, which is nothing short of a pure scandinavian DEATH-METAL masterpiece...\n\nThe album starts with the absolutely great song \"Cromlech\", which will have you feeling goosebumps of evilness from the opening riff even before the vocals ever even start... Then all hell breaks loose... \"INTO THE ABYSS I FALLLL......\" with the tempo picking up to a traditional 2-beat rhythm that will have your head banging! From there the album continues to rape your mind with brutal yet depressive and dark death all the way through to the end... So many classics on here, especially the demo songs... It could be said this album has a bit of an \"entombed\" feel to it, but that was pretty common for albums of this era from the nordic region... It is by no means a rip off album, and Dark Throne finds an identity of their own here. The guitar sound comes through in the traditional swedish style \"buzzsaw\" production which is clear, thick, and evil. Kind of reminds me of the production on Dismember's \"Pieces\" release, but is still noticeably different from a traditional sunlight studios production. This is by far the best slab of death to come out of Norway in history, even surpassing Cadaver in my opinion. If you love scandinavian death, and hell, even AUTOPSY you should have this record in your collection, end of story. \n\nA true Masterpiece.... now I have to go throw it on again!\n",
        "\nHaving heard none of Darkthrone's material prior to grabbing this album, I was expecting some kind of horrid black metal with basement sound quality even if ripped at 320kbps. I have to say I'm utterly surprised and delighted at the overall death metal feel to this album. Sure, there's little gloomy bits occasionally but that's actually part of what makes this album so beautifully atmospheric and, most importantly, enjoyable. \n\nHowever, vocals on songs such as Accumulation of Generalization seem to kick in when they're least wanted, and use a lot of annoying reverb, slight echo and maybe a minor pitch shifting, all combined to make an \"evil\" growl sound that's absolutely stupid, and would've ruined the song if Darkthrone weren't so musically brilliant on this album. Anyways, other than that little gripe the vocals are pretty much perfect for the feel of the album, think a slightly more aggressive Possessed - Seven Churches with just the right amount of \"black\" added. \n\nThe guitarist seems to tease you with riffs, constantly going from one bit to the next, never really settling on a constant overall theme for the song. The riffing can go from frenetic alternate picking to doom-paced power chords and back to standard thrashing, all in the course of one song. Coupled with this is the jazzy, technical-(yet relaxed) working of the drummer, using constant snazzy cymbal rides and pounding along to the riffs with near-surgical precision. Though it may be unfair to compare, imagine a Sound of Perseverance era Death without too much flash. Bass, as usual, is barely audible and irrelevant to this album.\n\nNow unlike some other bands that do this, Darkthrone have managed to find a workable relationship between synth choir effects and their riffs, especially on the track \"Grave with a View\", even though the part only lasts half a minute or so. Other bands that have tried this ended up with an annoying bit that you have to skip past just to get to the enjoyable part of the song (like Carcass' Reek of Putrefaction off of Symphonies of Sickness, but it could just be a technology gap). \n\nThe only thing that brought this masterpiece down 2 points was the first gripe above, vocals can pop up in annoying intervals, but that's it. It still leaves an impressive 98% and will remain one of my favorite albums for a long time.\n",
        "\nSo here I find myself dealing with the album that was hailed as THE masterpiece of the early second wave of Black Metal. \n\nSo how to describe this album? A person associated with Black Metal once reminded not to mistake lack of talent with genius in that style of music. And to be quite honest, that walk along this extremely narrow grid seems to be a quite befitting issue with Darkthrone:\n\nThe value of musical skill? Naught. The song-writing? A catastrophe to any Primary/Elementary school music teacher. The sound quality? A bit like a faulty electric razor. The music itself? A monotonous cacophony that could not be worse \u2013 all in all the album sounds a little like a few kids who figured out how to mess with the gain pedal and the guitar, and the vocals have the reminiscence of a chain smoker after 45 years, awaiting cancer surgery\u2026and having read this, can anyone really wonder why Peaceville heavily reconsidered having ever signed them?\n\nSo what is it then that deserves this release the 95% that I am donating? Well, besides its status as one of the most influential releases and the untouchability somewhat arise thereof, there are quite a few points that rehabilitate for the first disappointment that anyone used to less raw music will meet.\n\nNotable is the intelligent riffing, i.e. the utter rape of the guitar by both Zephyrous and Nocturno Culto that create a superior atmosphere that only Darkthrone is able to create, and the minimalistic setting described above only happens to highlight this feeling so dark, cold and grim that it has Satan himself hide behind a sofa. At this time, provided you have sufficient imagination, you\u2019re likely off sacrificing sheep in a wood in Norway.\n\nNocturno Culto\u2019s voice is genius \u2013 raspy as it is: Grimmer than any horror movie and frostier than the deepest reach of Siberia, it again contributes to establish an atmosphere beyond description. In fact, many have attempted to mimick his style of singing, but very few have succeeded\u2026hard to describe indeed, except that his vocal contribution to this release is probably some of the best that the entire genre of Black Metal has seen thus far.\n\nThe whole sound is rounded off by the raw and trollish battery delivered by Fenriz: Some-times blast-beats that build up the atmosphere, another time more mid-tempo, even slightly punky drumming \u2013 whatever it is, he uses it in good strategy even though, again, minimal in style.\n\nFinally, notable mention has to go to the lyrics. OK, so they might be the most outright anti-relgion, Satanic, dark-side-of-nature revolved shit that you\u2019ll ever encounter; but then again, Darkthrone were pioneers at doing this, so it is actually highly original. Lyrics are often left out of the equation when reviewing an album, but in this case, more than ever, they are the essence of the message of the album, in fact they fit the music 1000 percent.\n\n\u201dA Blaze in the Northern Sky\u201d is an album that I can certainly recommend acquiring \u2013 definitely worth the \u20ac12.00 you usually pay for it. The old quote of \u201cBlack Metal ist Krieg\u201d could not be more fitting when you talk about this album, and if you\u2019re a fan of the likes of Bathory of Burzum, then you\u2019ve not lived until you\u2019ve heard this album. It is probably amongst the best BM albums ever recorded, and should not be missing from any CD collection, at least not in the collections of those that boast themselves \u201ctrue Black Metallers\u201d. Congratulations to Darkthrone for creating a masterpiece for all eternity!\n\n(originally written for Amazon.co.uk, revised and expanded upon for this page)\n",
        "\nThe problem with compiling any best-of is that you have two equally important markets to satisfy \u2013 on the one hand, you have the long-time fans who probably own most of the albums who will want to see all of the best songs there and something new, on the other hand you have the potential fans and casual listeners, who want the band\u2019s \u201ckey\u201d songs to get started with. Luckily, Darkthrone\u2019s Preparing For War strikes that lucky balance. Having previously only really heard a jumble of MP3s and the 30 second samples HMV allows people to listen to of their albums I can honestly say, as a potential fan, its worked. The first five Darkthrone albums are all now on my list of CDs to get, furthermore, everything I\u2019ve read seems to suggest the songs here satisfy the long-term fans as well. In particular there are two demos and a couple rare live tracks, making it a very attractive package indeed for the fan who has everything else.\n\nHowever, the album is really let down by one thing \u2013 pacing. Nobody wants a 9 minute demo instrumental as the second song to a compilation \u2013 even the long-term fans expect the rough demos to close the record and (frankly) its just plain off-putting to the new listener. The whole album is a mess, with what seems to be no thought put into organisation. Its not chronological, its not in order of \u201cbiggest hits,\u201d in fact, I can\u2019t see any rational method of organising a CD which would have ended up anything like this.\n\nBeyond this, however, there\u2019s not really much to argue with (except the obvious fact it contains nothing Panzerfaust onwards, due to this being a compilation by the label which released their first four albums). If you know anything about Darkthrone you know what to expect \u2013 rough, raw, fast black metal with bare-bones production. If you like that sorta music you\u2019ll like this, if you don\u2019t, you won\u2019t. Simple as. Everything is what you\u2019d expect from one of the most important black metal (well, death metal on their debut Soulside Journey) bands in the universe.\n\nOn the whole, what you have here is a solid collection of fine songs by a legendary band, all of which are highly listenable if this is your kind of thing, its just a bit messy in terms of order. For this reason I\u2019d recommend putting it on computer, making a playlist, moving a few songs about (in particular Snowfall) to an order that makes a bit more sense to your ears and enjoy!\n",
        "\nHoly shit, this guy is annoying. Seriously, Nocturno Culto sounds like shit on here\nHe's croaking his way through the album (trying to do a Tom G. Warrior impression) and he's far too fucking loud in the mix. The absolute worst vocal performance on this album can be found in \"Quintessence\", where he's probably trying to sound original by emulating about 15 different forest animals, but fails miserably. I don't know what possessed his mind, but you need to listen for yourself to understand. \n\nThe most annoying fact is that the music contained on \"Panzerfaust\" is actually pretty strong. Great tremolo-picked melodies share their space with Hellhammer/Celtic Frost-esque proto-thrash riffs and fitting drum work. Therefore, \"Panzerfaust\" is a pretty catchy album, not only relying on atmosphere, but also on the aforementioned riff craft. \n\nFenriz\u2019 drumming might not be too technically demanding, but one could say that he's instantly recognizable. Blastbeats aren't the main focus here, which does help in letting the riffs shine. Yeah, these riffs are definitely the album's saving grace, especially in songs like \"En Vind Av Sorg\" and \"Hans Siste Vinter\". \n\nStylistically, \"Panzerfaust\" is slowly moving away from the sound featured on earlier albums, but is not exactly exploring new ground either. Instead, Darkthrone took a wide step back to their earliest influences (the aforementioned Hellhammer/Celtic Frost) and tried to combine them with their original sound. They succeeded for the most part, but sometimes the worship is just a tad too obvious. \n\nThe simplicity of earlier albums is also less prevalent here, leaving room for more technically demanding compositions. Best examples are the more advanced tremolo-picked melodies in \u201cEn Vind Av Sorg\u201d and the more oldschool-sounding \u201cTriumphant Gleam\u201d.\n\nApart from the extremely annoying vocal mix, the production job is an improvement over their earlier works, granting a more accessible, organic sound, which fits the compositions rather well, without being even remotely \u201cclean\u201d in the modern sense of the word.\n\nI checked this album out because I wanted to see what the fuzz was all about and while I agree with this being a rather good album, I see Nocturno Culto's lack of vocal ability as a severe negative point. Without him, \"Panzerfaust\" could have been close to being essential, but now it simply serves as a perfect example of a missed opportunity.\n",
        "\nThis album in an interesting listen, indeed. It is a concept album where the production values of black metal with the musical stylings of crust punk. I will admit, I truly enjoy the album, it has a very \"old-school\" feel to it.\n\nFenriz's drumming drives the album with a pretty consistant stream of D-beats and punky fills. The guitar riffs are, in themselves, punky as well, but the production quality is styled after raw, primitive black metal, evoking the sound and feel of black metal in spite of the writing style. Nocturno Culto's vocals are as they always have been, with the same reverb effect he's been using practically since the band's inception. Suprisingly, he occaisionally breaks from his black metal rasp to deliver some punky shouts. As far as his lyrics go, Nocturno's in my opinion, serve little more than comedic effect, with song titles such as \"Graveyard Slut\" and \"Whisky Funeral\" and lyrics such as \"you call you metal black, it's just flaccid, lame and weak.\"\n\nThe highlight tracks on the recording are probably \"The Cult of Goliath\" and \"Too Old, Too Cold,\" but if you like the style of the recording, you will probably enjoy the entire album. And if you enjoy punky sounding black metal (as I do), then you'll definitely like it.\n",
        "\nWell... I guess some people just didn't get the joke. The clues have been there all along, really. We should have known things would turn this way back when Panzerfaust came out; when Darkthrone reinvented themselves as the booze-driven, reckless, and careless dudes who just loved to play really dirty black metal. But really, it was easy to see. A Blaze in the Northern Sky had a definite punk influence, but only in a roundabout way. Hell, even Sardonic Wrath was a big red light that screamed, \"Hey, we're Darkthrone, and we're a black metal band who loves crust punk!\" But of course, the shit hit the fan for a lot of people when \"Too Old, Too Cold\" was released as a single. So, all that aside, is it a good album? Damn right. What makes this album great is the fact that Darkthrone have figured out that it doesn't really matter what they do now, because they've done huge things for black metal. So it doesn't matter if people complain about the growing punk influence in the band's sound; technically, they can do no wrong at this point in their career.\n\nEven with Darkthrone moving into a continual rock/punk territory with their dirgy, loose brand of black metal, The Cult is Alive shows a band with new blood in their veins. Quite a few of the past albums have come off as lazy and boring at some points, but this album bursts at the seams with conviction, energy, and a new sense of focus in songwriting. Though the structures remains fairly formulaic as it has on the past few albums, the riffs and instrumentation are better, and there's actual energy here; so there aren't any more moments where your mind goes numb from lack of variety. There's a perfect sense of dynamics in the tracklisting, as the more metal-ish tracks ala Ravishing Grimness are carefully balanced with the muscular, ferocious black n' roll hybrids.\n\nFenriz shines on this album. I'm glad he decided to let loose on this album, because the swaggering, raw feel of the drumwork helps things out tremendously. We see more fills here than we ever have before, and the time changes help to add some ear candy to the songs. There are plenty of pounding D-beats, mid-paced blasts, and the slower moments definitely have more balls behind them. There's even some occasional double bass, and it only adds more balls to the album. Aside from his drumwork, Fenriz has written some of his best material in years. All of the lyrics seem to be cynical, bitter, and even sarcastic. There's been some odd, kind of snide humor to the past few albums, and that comes full swing here. Open shots are taken at modern black metal in \"Too Old, Too Cold,\" and \"Shut Up\" is pretty self-explanatory. Fenriz even does vocals on the catchy as hell \"Graveyard Slut,\" and does a great job of adding filthy, old-school, Celtic Frost-esque grunts and shouts to the song. \n\nThe guitars switch up between highly crust-influenced bashings, mean thrashy riffs, and well... signature Darkthrone riffs. \"Underdogs and Overlords\" is an instant classic with its seamless switch between a bruising main riff and a more mid-paced section with a complimentary solo. Speaking of which, there are quite a few of those; frenzied, almost messy tremolo solos soaked in feedback make an appearance on just about every song, and help to fill out the booze-drenched feel of the music. \"Forebyggende Krig\" has a solo at its end as well, and even has a short but sweet harmony amidst the madness. Though some may scoff at the notion of Darkthrone being \"catchy,\" it's hard to deny the pure rock fury behind the guitars. These songs feature some of the most attitude-filled riffs since Panzerfaust, and it's a good refreshing taste from the strict nature of previous albums.\n\nNocturno offers up an amazing performance here. There's ton of gravel and dirt in his voice, but still so much clarity. His voice has a new fierce luster that hasn't been seen since A Blaze in the Northern Sky, and \"Whisky Funeral\" is all the proof you need. There are still plenty of strung-out screams for those wanting that desperate edge, and of course the complimentary yells of \"Fuck off!\" Classic stuff.\n\nThe production here is a bit older-sounding, but cleaner than what you would expect. The guitars use a very gritty, old-school distortion, and the drums use a fat, open sound similar to Motorhead. Nocturno's vocals use a healthy amount of reverb to add some grit, but never overpower the music. In short, it's the perfect Darkthrone production.\n\nThough we can't expect another \"classic\" anytime soon, I'm pretty happy with this new direction. Then again, I'm a huge fan of crust punk. Either way, those who are looking for a loose, attitude-filled album, metal or otherwise, will enjoy the sarcastic and booze-fueled madness that embodies The Cult is Alive.\n",
        "\nAs Darkthrone progressed from death metal to black metal, another evolution took place: the distillation of the music itself. Under A Funeral Moon was significantly grimmer and darker than A Blaze in the Northern Sky, which was in its own right already a classic. (And a total inversion of what was done on Soulside Journey.) Fenriz and Nocturno simplified the music as time went on; not out of laziness, but to emphasize the real essence of what black metal was about. Fenriz as a drummer became more bare-boned in his approach and playing style, and his contribution in songwriting became increasingly minimalistic, but darker. The band eventually reached the musical formula that would form Transilvanian Hunger. This is the raw essence of black metal without frills. \n\nDarkthrone's aim in their early career was to express the unbridled essence of black metal music through continuous simplicity in playing technique. Transilvanian Hunger shows the product of their ventures; a concentrated, distilled, and ultimately accurate collection of songs that got the point across. Whereas previous albums had some shades of grey with the bleak nature of the music, Transilvanian Hunger is monochromatic, one-way, and unchanging. Many of these songs only consist of two or three dissonant, atonal, ugly, power-chord driven riffs, all of which are repeated during long, narrative phrases. Fenriz' drum beats now consist of a never-ending bass/snare pattern with very few fills that would become a staple of black metal. Some may not like this at all, but the heart of the album lies in the droning, suffocating, and cold atmosphere put off by everything. The drums have been pushed to the background as more of a pulse than an actual guidance tool in the songs, to emphasize the guitar riffs. \n\nRiff-wise, this may be one of the most important albums for black metal. Needless to say, it's minimalist; a series of notes will revolve around one chord for any given amount of time, before switching to another riff of the same nature. All of the playing is based upon mid-paced, tremolo-picked chords, as I mentioned; and it doesn't change. There is no melody, mind-blowing technique, or anything that will make you play air guitar; but it will fucking freeze you to the bone. The opening title track possesses one of the most famous black metal riffs ever; a semi-melodic 4-note rotation filled with emotions of despair and coldness that drones for the entire song, except for one or two different power chords riffs scattered throughout. \"I en Hall Med Flesk Og Mjod\" is a clear exception to the rule; it hearkens to a dominant Celtic Frost feel with a battering D-beat and ugly-as-hell riff before launching right back to the throbbing bleakness that lays out the rest of the album. The bass usually only plays the root notes of the guitar for the whole song, though it will sometimes shift frets for dissonance and ambience. (Example: \"As Flittermice as Satans Spys\")\n\nOf course, the production plays a huge role in atmosphere and aesthetic for the album. If you thought Under a Funeral Moon was gritty and lo-fi, this is pure black dirt. Nocturno's monotone and terrifying croak comes to the forefront and sets the stage with a nightmarish performance. All of the lyrics are in Norwegian, (except the title track) which adds a ritualistic feel to the music. The guitars use the famous trebly, dirty distortion that became signature for the genre, and the drums are barely miked for a super lo-fi and distant sound, which helps when the drums are already in the background.\n\nWe'll never see another album like this again, so it's worth checking out. It may not be black metal's best, or even Darkthrone's best, but it does have a legendary status behind it. Hell, after spawning so many clones, why wouldn't you wanna see what the hype is about?\n",
        "\nDespite what people say, I don't think this is the definitive black metal album which everyone says it is. In my opinion that award goes to fellow Norwegian black metal band Emperor for the album \"In the Nightside Eclipse.\" Now, I love black metal, having said this, one might be surprised that this album, until recently, wasn't in my metal collection. To be perfectly honest, the only reason I got this was because it did so well in the black metal survivor game (corny reason I know) but I digress.\n\nI had a pretty open mind when I listened to that album; actually I was pretty eager to listen to it. I had heard some other stuff by Darkthrone \"Under a Funeral Moon\" which was shit (easily the most overrated album, second only to the abomination itself, Drawing down the Moon) and some samples from \"Sardonic Wrath\", which didn't impress me that much either. Based on that, I was expecting some pretty fast, in your face raw black metal. But it wasn't There are no really fast songs on this album which I think is definitely a thumbs down. If the songs had been faster this album would have been way more interesting. \n\nAs for the songs themselves, they aren't really all that bad. From what I've heard of Darkthrone, the songs are usually quite repetitive this basically equates boring, unless the riff is reaaaallly good. As implied the songs have a lot of variety and the riff structure changes around a lot. But then again, the songs are quite long on this album. Had the riffs been repetitive, then this album would have been a dead loss because slow songs + repetition on long songs is just flat out boring. \n\nNucturno Culto's vocal performance is decent here. Not as good as it was on \"Under a Funeral Moon\" and \"Sardonic Wrath\", but still passable nonetheless. It's rough and grim which suits the style of this album. What really more needs to be said?\n\nDarkthrone get a lot of credit for this, i.e. their raw, grim production which certainly gives this album a pretty cool, dark atmosphere. Unfortunately on later albums they took this a little too far. But here it is fine and certainly is a strong point off the album. Frankly the album would have been a lot dryer if the production had been crystal clear. If this had been the case (good recording), the album probably would have been way different and the reaction to it would have been a lot different.\n\nIn summary, yeah this album isn't bad, but there honestly isn't much on here to scream about. Sure the songs are good but not that good. I'll admit it, I haven't listened to this album much and maybe after a few more listens I'll love it. (If this is the case then I will rewrite this review.) However as it stands this album is nothing special. \n\nConclusion: I would recommend you buy it, only if it's cheap, 15 dollars and under. If not just download it as it's pretty accessible. \n\nAside: (When was this album recorded? This site and some others say it was recorded in 1992, but the inlay of the album says it was recorded in August 1991? Even more confusing is the fact that on the inlay it says: \"A Blaze in the Northern Sky is eternally dedicated to...Euronymous.\u201d He was killed in 1994, at least 2 years before this was even released. Perhaps it's a re-release?\"\n",
        "\nCutting straight to the chase by bringing their Hellhammer/Celtic Frost influence to the forefront of their new sound, Darkthrone ditched the death metal and went for the jugular in a different way with frenzied, seemingly miscalculated attacks of lo-fi and raw black metal on their \"first\" record, A Blaze in the Northern Sky. Not only did this record see a hearkening back to an old-school style of metal, but more importantly, it added a new edge. The classic Darkthrone albums are what Celtic Frost would sound like if they were strung out and dead-stern misanthropes, or if Quorthon were to take Under the Sign of the Black Mark into even murkier terrain.\n\nBy seemingly being themselves and adding new standards to what Bathory and Celtic Frost had forged, Darkthrone, without realizing it, revolutionized the genre and raised the bar. A Blaze in the Northern Sky still stands the test of being one of the absolute meanest, balls-out, and dirty black metal albums to emerge in the past two decades. Maybe it's the lo-fi, gritty guitar distortion; or the throbbing pulse of Fenriz' boisterous, swaggering drum work; or maybe it's just the attitude behind it all. Like it or not, this album puts a pretty heavy punk influence out into the air, and that clearly shows in everything, especially on \"In the Shadow of the Horns.\" The classic yell of \"Nocturno Culto!\" affirms this, along with Fenriz' constant use of shuffling D-beats and stick clicks. This isn't the same punk formula that has surfaced in the past few years on Darkthrone albums, as it is put on in a more abstract and crusty manner. This, however, doesn't take away from the fact that this album rocks with filthy power and pure aggression.\n\nThe two things that make this album what it is are the guitars and vocals. A wide array of techniques of guitar playing is used here, whether it be the bludgeoning power chords that drive the long-winded opener \"Kathaarian Life Code,\" the disharmonic tremolo riffs of \"Where Cold Winds Blow,\" or the occasional splice in harmonies (\"Paragon Belial\") and chaotic Slayer-esque solos. If an example were ever to be given as how guitar solos should be used in this genre, this album would be my first choice. They never enter too often, but always at the right moments to push that feeling of madness and hatred to next level. \"Where Cold Winds Blow\" is a prime example of this, where a seething tremolo riff serves as the support for this type of solo. The rhythm riffs themselves switch between pounding, fast-paced attacks and sludgy moments that pay a bit of homage to the blackened muck of early Celtic Frost. Best moments of the latter are seen on the title track and the closing track, \"The Pagan Winter,\" where grinding, sustained power chords create a primal atmosphere. Along with the riffs, the distortion used helps drive things forward. We've heard it a million times in black metal before; the buzzing, high-frequency, grating fuzz 'n' scuzz blasted through old practice amps. But ample room is left in the production for the riffs to breathe, and the solos are soaked in plenty more distortion and reverb to ensure maximum ear bleeding, heh.\n\nNocturno Culto's performance has been mimicked by many, but never duplicated. His throaty, gravelly, booze-fueled screams dive in and out of the chaos, and the impression left is that of a truly pissed-off dude. There is some reverb placed on the vocals, which give it a more natural, organic feel. This works perfectly on the manic, desperate screams seen in \"Where Cold Winds Blow\" and the title track. Fenriz' lyrics are essentially what make Nocturno so great here. To some, the lyrics may seem like nonsense that tries to come off as \"evil.\" But it truly becomes evil when it's spewed forth by Nocturno. Some lines on this album cannot be beat, such as the call-to-arms of \"The next thousand years are ours!\"\n\nFenriz certainly gave us his best performance here. The rustic drum sound, seemingly haphazard fills, and pure fury combine with shuffling rock swagger here, and it's clear to see that Fenriz gave his drums a pounding. Nothing is too complex or flashy, nor is it painfully simplified like future albums. The hi-hat and ride cymbals clash with the earthy snare and thumping bass to form a loud and intimidating wall of noise on the faster moments, while leaving room for groove-laden simplicity and power on dirgy moments.\n\nWhile this album certainly is overrated in some circles, it pushed BM into new territory in a barely detectable way. This album will melt your face off without mercy.\n",
        "\nAfter a near twenty year existence and eleven previous full-length albums to their name (of admittedly inconsistent quality), Darkthrone are perhaps one of the best known acts to have emerged from the early wave of Norwegian Black Metal bands. And, unlike many of their contemporaries, they have been sticking to their guns since their inception in 1987. Although they have experimented slightly with Death Metal elements and even became a little more Rock-orientated for a time on the underrated \u201cPlaguewielder\u201d album, fans of Metal immediately associate the duo of Nocturno Culto and Fenriz with primitivism and a reluctance to progress their sound in any extreme manner. And with \u201cThe Cult Is Alive\u201d, their twelfth studio release, musical progression is certainly not the focal point!\n\nQuite simply, \u201cThe Cult Is Alive\u201d is still a Black Metal album, but one that is infused with blatant Punk Rock influences throughout its duration. The main riff on opener \u201cThe Cult Of Goliath\u201d, with its almost upbeat style, shows the listener what to expect from the entire album. The Darkthrone that created the classic \u201cTransilvanian Hunger\u201d is no more. Where previous albums \u201cHate Them\u201d and \u201cSardonic Wrath\u201d indicated a possible return to this style of harshly produced garage Black Metal, this album essentially acts as a \u201cfuck you\u201d to elitist fans and critics, with the band proud to be making the music that they want to make, as opposed to caving in to expectations or demands. They seem utterly frustrated by the genre which they effectively pioneered in the early \u201890s turning into a fashionable modern scene, which is evident from the hate-fuelled lyrics on \u201cToo Old Too Cold\u201d: \u201cYou call your Metal black; it\u2019s just spastic, lame and weak.\u201d\n\nBut the main problem lies herein: \u201cThe Cult Is Alive\u201d is not actually all that great. Whilst some of their post-2000 material has been reasonably impressive, this musical relapse has resulted in a substandard and frankly pedestrian glitch on a catalogue that has been gradually declining in quality. There are some standout moments, like the fantastic main riff of \u201cAtomic Coming\u201d, which sounds like it could have come straight from \u201cUnder A Funeral Moon\u201d. Also, Nocturno Culto\u2019s vocal delivery still sounds as rough and booze-fuelled as ever, which is much more than can be said for Fenriz\u2019s first attempt at vocals on a Darkthrone album on the awful \u201cGraveyard Slut\u201d.\n\nOverall though, the album\u2019s near forty minute length begins to drag after two or three songs, with the music becoming far too repetitive and sluggish for anything to really come across as memorable. It\u2019s certainly commendable that Darkthrone have tried something different here after perhaps working their Black Metal persona to death, but the listener is left with nothing to take away from this quite inane and monotonous work. If they took more time to perfect this new style, then by all means we might still see another landmark release from these Norwegian Black Metal leaders (they started working on album number thirteen as soon as this one was released) but \u201cThe Cult Is Alive\u201d has nothing to take it beyond the level of mediocre. If you\u2019re an old school Darkthrone fan, you\u2019d probably do best to ignore this, or get a real shock upon hearing your favourite Black Metal horde go Punk.\n\nOriginally written for http://www.blastwave.co.uk\n",
        "\nComparing your band\u2019s upcoming new album to a return to your classic days is practically the worst mistake to make whilst promoting its release. For instance, Metallica\u2019s \u201cSt. Anger\u201d and Slayer\u2019s \u201cGod Hates Us All\u201d both suffered hugely from such build-up, with both bands boasting a triumphant return to form yet blatantly failing to live up to their own glorified promises. In a similar fashion, Darkthrone\u2019s drummer Fenriz made such a blunder by ambitiously contrasting their approaching album \u201cPlaguewielder\u201d to the immortal \u201cTransilvanian Hunger\u201d masterpiece. Naturally, as soon as these words were uttered, expectations from the band\u2019s followers were massive. Could the band possibly be about to deliver the sequel to one of Black Metal\u2019s timeless models or were standards perhaps simply set too high from the beginning? Unfortunately, it is the latter statement that holds the most truth but, realistically, the album was no catastrophe.\n\nAnd so, after two relatively disappointing studio albums, \u201cTotal Death\u201d and Ravishing Grimness\u201d, \u201cPlaguewielder\u201d opens with a completely different sound with first track \u201cWeakling Avenger\u201d. Gone is the standard atrocious production, replaced with a clearer yet still distinctly garage-like sound. The track begins with a haunting, murmuring intro akin to the band\u2019s 1992 masterpiece \u201cA Blaze In The Northern Sky\u201d, as Nocturno Culto painfully groans the words, \u2018It\u2019s not by death but by life that death kills life\u2019 before moving straight into the album. The opening track itself, although immediately reassuring the listener that this will be no classic-sounding Darkthrone album, still emphasises one important aspect of the band: their ability to construct simple song structures and to pummel them into their listeners heads over and over again. Fenriz\u2019s drumming is as straightforward as one can expect in Black Metal and Nocturno Culto\u2019s riffs are uncomplicated, yet repeatedly effective. With the following track, \u201cRaining Murder\u201d, it is apparent that his vocals are still harsher and coarser than most other vocalists of the genre and, like most Darkthrone albums, these vocals are a real highlight and treat to listen to.\n\nHowever, with only six tracks lasting over forty minutes, the album\u2019s main flaw is that many of the songs have a tendency to go on for an unneeded extra few minutes. Closing track \u201cWreak\u201d is a prime example of this flaw, coming in at over nine minutes in length. Although most probably the standout track of the album, and with some of the most melodic Black Metal passages that the band have ever written, there is simply an extravagant amount of repetition and duplication, even for Darkthrone\u2019s standards. Nonetheless, \u201cPlaguewielder\u201d is an extremely interesting and unique listen for fans of the band and will most likely divide opinions from the outset. Yet the album without doubt shows a band back on their feet after a long period of disenchantment. Quite simply put, this is not Darkthrone\u2019s very own \u201cSt. Anger\u201d and the listener should give it time to allow its great aspects to shine through above a perhaps uneasy first impression.\n\nOriginally written for http://www.blastwave.co.uk\n",
        "\nSince their signing to Norway\u2019s Moonfog label, Darkthrone have quite admirably, yet sometimes tediously, continued to follow their renowned path of reasonably under-produced and all in all rebellious Black Metal. Yet it is undeniable that the band\u2019s absolute best and most legendary material was recorded in the early 90s whilst signed to the English label Peaceville. \u201cPreparing For War\u201d is essentially a collection of some of this early material, yet also includes two tracks from each of the Darkthrone demos as well as three extremely rare and desirable live tracks (especially since they vowed never to play live again after 1996.)\n\nIt is blatantly obvious that Peaceville put a considerable deal of effort into compiling this \u2018best of\u2019 release, by tracking down and including a selection of more uncommon tracks that fans were somewhat unlikely to own or have heard themselves. Also, with a brief two-page history of the band, written by drummer Fenriz in his customary humorous style, it is apparent to the listener that the band were happy to give their approval to this release, hence giving it a certain sense of credibility within the Darkthrone discography. The music itself is a relatively balanced affair, with the majority of the tracks taken from the band\u2019s four Peaceville releases: \u201cSoulside Journey\u201d, \u201cA Blaze In The Northern Sky\u201d, \u201cUnder A Funeral Moon\u201d and \u201cTransilvanian Hunger\u201d. However, the order of the tracks seems a little puzzling and perhaps random. Opening with the title track from \u201cTransilvanian Hunger\u201d and then proceeding with two demo tracks, the order almost seems to slow down the compilation. Evidently, it would have seemed much more logical to use this album as a chronological musical history of the band, starting with the demo tracks and finishing with the more recent ones.\n\nHowever, the order of the track list is perhaps the only quibble to be had here, as the songs included are utterly remarkable. \u201cThe Pagan Winter\u201d, \u201cNatassja In Eternal Sleep\u201d and the live \u201cNeptune Towers\u201d all stand out as true Black Metal classics and demo tracks like \u201cSnowfall\u201d and \u201cArchipelago\u201d allow the listener to hear the very humble, yet exciting, beginnings of one of the most celebrated bands of the genre. Austerely, \u201cPreparing For War\u201d is absolutely necessary for any Darkthrone fan, purely for the rare tracks alone. Yet, this anthology would also be an excellent introduction to the band for those so far uninitiated, as it contains such an impressive variety of music from their earlier years. If you can look past the patchy, minimalist production (probably the hardest task when listening to Darkthrone), then this album is well worth purchasing purely as a basic preface to this phenomenal band.\n\nOriginally written for http://www.blastwave.co.uk\n",
        "\nAfter releasing several infamously unrefined and massively influential Black Metal albums in the early 90s, including the classic \u201cTransilvanian Hunger\u201d in 1994, it was only inevitable that Darkthrone would eventually issue an album that would tarnish their own progressively increasing legacy. \u201cTotal Death\u201d perhaps solely represents a trace of mediocrity within their otherwise thriving discography.\n\nThe band\u2019s second album for Moonfog Productions (the label run by Satyricon main man Satyr), \u201cTotal Death\u201d was also their first release since their inception not to feature guitarist Zephyrous in the line up, hence reducing them to the duo of Nocturno Culto on guitars, bass and vocals and Fenriz on drums. Not surprisingly, throughout the album, it seems apparent that the loss of Zephyrous led to the greater loss of creativity and general brilliance in terms of musicality. Tracks like \u201cEarth\u2019s Last Picture\u201d and \u201cGather For Attack On The Pearly Gates\u201d seem to drag on without direction and this develops into an almost overriding theme throughout. The guitar arrangements in particular are far simpler and more repetitive in comparison to the spiteful and intricate sounds of previous album \u201cPanzerfaust\u201d for example, and so this monotony only adds to the aimless feeling throughout.\n\nFurthermore, although Darkthrone are renowned for their notoriously bad production, there is something quite amiss with the sound on \u201cTotal Death\u201d. Indeed, the production is terrible, but not in the \u2018classic\u2019 way expected from a Darkthrone album. Previously, their harsh, garage-like sound has fuelled the primitive nature of their style of Black Metal but on this release it almost seems as if the band have tried to somehow develop both their playing and production methods. Quite frankly, this change of direction was problematic, as it was entirely unnecessary. The overall mix is simply shambolic and allow the new tracks very little chance of acceptance amongst their fans. However, amongst this mess, there are indeed still signs of a band who have not entirely drifted from their past, with some fantastic melodic parts scattered through tracks like \u201cBlack Victory Of Death\u201d and \u201cRavnajuv\u201d.\n\nPut simply, Darkthrone are not supposed to represent progression or advancement; they are the Black Metal fan\u2019s reliable lot and are plain expected to release practically the same record again and again. Perhaps this is a narrow-minded approach but, quite truthfully, this album is proof of a failed attempt to diversify - something which Darkthrone themselves have never attempted since.\n\nOriginally written for http://www.blastwave.co.uk\n",
        "\nThere are few albums in the metal scene more stripped, examined, and dissected than Darkthrone's seminal 'Transilvanian Hunger'. Every person who has come in contact with black metal, fan and detractor alike, has heard and most likely commented on the qualities or lack thereof in this LP. Is it the extreme polarity of opinion that drives listeners to make their views heard? Or perhaps it's that aesthetic, that ultimate purity of black metal expression that pierces the darkness, shrieking all the way. Either way, this is an album that has been at the center of stormy controversy for thirteen years now.\n\nI wouldn't be a misnomer to say that 1994 was a crossroads for black metal. The genre seemed on the threshold of a great change, one that might make or break the genre. Irony, always the amused commentator of this musical community, decided to step in and make everyone disagree with whether the making or breaking had actually occurred. This was a year that many claimed carved the epitaph for black metal as a genuine form of musical expression, while others say that it was indeed only the beginning of a new era. Albums such as 'Pentagram', 'De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas', or 'In The Nightside Eclipse' all seemed to be a natural evolution of previous works, yet oddly distanced, as if emerging from a world removed from Dead's suicide and church arsons. Not to say the music was any less spiteful; just, like Darkthrone's 'A Blaze In The Northern Sky', even more disconnected from the average and mundane. Indeed, one could also say that this was the root of the split between raw and melodic in the black metal community; the latter being represented by Emperor's debut LP, and the former by this piece here.\n\nIt's not so much that the sound of 'Transilvanian Hunger' is so unbelievably raw; much more abrasive material had been heard on Mayhem's early demos, for instance. It's more that 'Transilvanian Hunger' exposed so many people to this level of production, as well as being one of the first albums to postulate that a degraded level of recording could be a boon to the atmosphere and quality of the music rather than a detrimental coincidence. I can't actually imagine the music here with 'quality' production; the static shimmer and murkiness adds a layer of otherworldliness to the proceedings that's so necessary to Darkthrone's work. In a similar form of distance, it goes even further against their death metal roots, with such bands attempting to gain higher and higher fidelity in their music. On the same note, only two of the tracks here possess English lyrics, as if Darkthrone was intending to distance themselves from the predominantly English-driven music of the time.\n\nTo put this album in perspective: around three weeks ago I was spending time with a couple prospective band mates. We were discussing how to create atmosphere in music, and while he was speaking, I was idly playing the main riff to 'Transilvanian Hunger'. He immediately stopped and said, \"You see? That gives the feeling of being on a frozen Norwegian mountain.\" After asking about his reaction later, he stated that he had never heard the song. And herein lies the quality of this album; the ability for every person that hears and understands it to identify with the thoughts and feelings that went into its creation. While all music requires more or less interpretation to determine meaning, 'Transilvanian Hunger' is an entity of such absolute purity in form that each and every person that hears it can inherently understand the meaning of such a work.\n\nIndeed, that first track is easily the best on this record. I would have no qualms with someone who stated that it was the peak of black metal as an artistic form. It is an entity of complete, heart-wrenching beauty and simplicity that will be forever remembered by the metal scene. Six minutes, four riffs, and one drum beat, and Darkthrone instantaneously conquered everything that black metal had done, was doing at the time, and ever will in the future. Most of the songs here are structured in the same way: Riff A alternates with riff B, while riff C acts as a bridge. And despite the repetition and simplicity of construction, it is still potent due to the incredible beauty of the music. Each riff peels off and spears through the echoing soundstream, bringing an entirely new vision to the proceedings. Songs like 'Skald Av Satans Sol' are entities of absolute steel beauty.\n\nNumerous people complain about the album for its low technical skill and recording quality. However, this is exactly the same thing as criticizing, say, Psyopus for NOT having those same qualities. When one stops viewing technicality or fidelity as linear entities, where there are only directions up or down, one can much better grasp the objective of this disc. This is music purely based upon atmosphere and melody, and to judge it for qualities that it has no intention to pursue in the first place is a foolish and ludicrous idea.\n\n'Transilvanian Hunger' is an eternally timeless record. It stands as being possibly the greatest achievement of black metal, and cannot be properly justified through words alone. One must listen to it, and soak in the grandeur of night skies and deep forests.\n",
        "\nI can with a clean conscience and complete honesty say that this album truly deserves a 100% rating. This is in my opinion the best album that Darkthrone has ever put out and yes I know that it\u00b4s not a very evil or necro album. Don\u00b4t get me wrong I like they\u00b4re old stuff as well, I absolutely love it but this album really tops them all.\n\nThis album shows the completion of what Darkthrone started on with \"Hate Them\", mixing punk into their music. The music is very punk but still very black metal, old-school black metal that is, and the it works damn well. To be honest there isn\u00b4t a single filler on this album. The guitar sound is thin and crunchy but without loosing any feeling or power and the bass... well it\u00b4s there I guess but I can\u00b4t really hear it. The vocals are, as they have always been, excellent and the drumming is just so fucking brilliant and awesome! Fenriz really lets loose on this album and so does Nocturno Culto with the guitar solos. The solos are fantastic as well, none of them stretch on for too long and none of them are cheesy or overdone.\n\nIf you hate punk and can\u00b4t stand black metal that doesn\u00b4t sound like \"A Blaze In The Northern Sky\" then this really isn\u00b4t anything you should spend any money on. If on the other hand like old-school black metal and don\u00b4t mind punk influences then this is something you have to check out. If you haven\u00b4t already checkec it out then hurry up because you are missing something amazing!\n",
        "\nIt takes serious nerve to entirely redefine your sound on only your second album; nerve that Darkthrone obviously possesses in spades. In the harsh light of hindsight, it's easy to misjudge Darkthrone's turn towards the blacker side of things as something that ever could have been seen as 'natural'. But go back to 1992, with Darkthrone as a young, promising band on Peaceville, coming off the heels of a well-received death metal release, and the perplexing case here begins to take form.\n\nBefore the nineties had passed and black metal was viewed as a commodity, just another subgenre, it was still a primal, dangerous, experimental force in the metal scene. Like the emergence of death metal before it, black metal was frequently scorned and misunderstood by the status quo. Such a time seems alien, particularly for those of us who got into metal after the tumultuous period of the early nineties, where the chaos of the Norweigian scene was not something relegated to books and collective fables, but a very real situation where the actions of those such as Dead and Faust were very real and very current.\n\nAnd, stumbling out of that murky blackness, was Darkthrone, a band who, with the release of 1992's 'A Blaze In The Northern Sky', seemed to capture that dangerous potency that black metal had in its heyday (or as close to a heyday as black metal ever had). Certainly, the metal scene had been exposed to what was referred to as 'black metal' before; mostly through the Venom-emulating sets of Mayhem and its ilk. But then comes Darkthrone, a band that entirely eschewed thrash, and instead stared into a Nietzschian abyss that few others had dared to. Aside from the collection of Celtic Frostian riffs and some lingering death metal influence, one could say that 'A Blaze In The Northern Sky' came from nowhere and related to nothing; it entered the room, and everyone paying attention could hear the audible screech of a record stopping.\n\nTake off glasses jaded by a million clones and you can see how absurdly daring 'A Blaze In The Northern Sky' is. It's easy to look at 'Kathaarian Life Code''s ten-minute length or 'Where Cold Winds Blow''s undulating ambiance and discard them as mere convention; but to do so is to ignore that this, right here, is where that convention was established! Entering the world a scant month before Burzum's self-titled debut, this was easily the most extreme, demented, and progressive work on the metal market at the time. It wouldn't be a long shot to say that one of the things that distinguished Darkthrone from the pack was their inherent theatricism and artistry, a level of which was probably only popularly matched by Celtic Frost, who at this time were no longer relevant to the community at large, leaving Darkthrone the sole group that was forging ahead with its specific music.\n\nWhile not as assaultingly atmospheric as later works, 'A Blaze In The Northern Sky' enters the world on its legendary, ritualistic ambient section before entering the shimmering darkness of 'Kathaarian Life Code', the longest and perhaps most archtypically 'black metal' track on here. Follower 'In The Shadow Of The Horns', not unlike the title track, could be said to be helping the doubtful ease into this extraordinary new sound; while 'Kathaarian Life Code' tosses the listener directly into the stream of black metal, the second track's Frostian crunch riffs act as a much easier introduction to the startling new world of black metal; at least, before Nocturno Culto's howl ushers in towering blast beats from beyond.\n\nThe album continues through such a route; pure, undeniable black metal with periodic lapses into slightly friendlier territory. However, the emphasis is still on the pitch-black negativity of 'A Blaze In The Northern Sky' that infects every part of it, from cover to lyrics to music to the intentionally raw production that would snare thousands into starting their own bands. In a uniquely ominous twist, the album ends with the same ambiance that it begins with; however, in this case, it is viewed as an escape from this terrifying reality away from our own, as opposed to the entry into it. No, I doubt Darkthrone was attempting to replicate the cyclic nature of their own songs. It's just a supremely devilish coincidence.\n\nBut I suppose supremely devilish coincidence does quite well to sum up an album such as this, doesn't it?\n",
        "\nDarkthrone's Transylvanian Hunger hardly needs any introduction to anyone with even a passing interest in black metal. But what makes this lonely record such a monstrously important album? The importance lies in the regression. Darkthrone regressed at a time when bands were attempting to progress. With this album, Darkthrone were one of the first bands to look at regression as progression. \n\nAs soon as title track opens, your mental state is immediately transformed, rearranged. There is no pretentious guitar noodling here, no jazz interludes such as were finding foothold in death metal. This is black metal at it's blackest, most pure state. Eight tracks of musical malice. As Transylvanian Hunger fades out, you are expecting another pitch black composition but instead you are confronted with Over Fjell Og Giennom Torner, an entirely different beast of evil. Subtle melodies hint at some unknown joke. This album exists to play with your mind and does through the very last track. It pokes and prods relentlessly at your fears.\n\nThe production is primitive, yet surpasses most black metal releases in it's atmosphere. Each instrument is audible. Zephyrous' guitars cut through Nocturno Culto's trebly, wobbly bass tone, with knifelike sharpness. Tremlo picking is clearly the method to the madness. Fenriz's drums are primitive, basic back and forth between the bass and snare with some crash and ride thunder hear than there. Even though each song is very similar, you can tell each one apart instantly. Quick leads and accents hear and there blend into the album's aesthetic perfectly. Not pretentious, not ovedone, just there, leaving a signature. Vocally, Nocturno Culto's vocals are un-earthly. Each time something erupts from his mouth, it sounds like his throat is ripped and scarred more severely.\n\nThese are well crafted songs meant to leave not only an impression but a mental scar, a memory of this album's impact. Songs like Slottet I Det Fjerne are simply epic in their melodies. Each song can be a soundtrack to a journey to hell. The second half of the album, with lyrics written by Sir Varg Vikernes, is conducive to the overall feel of the album. My only complaint is that the noise inbetween songs cuts off. I would have loved to hear the static, hiss and shit there at all times instead of cutting off. For what it is worth though, this album is a classic example of what black metal evolved, devolved from.\n",
        "\nThis is probably on of the better of Darkthrone's later material, but it's still a waste of time. For this album Foamriz and Nocturno Vodka try a few (very few) new ideas, but it still feels tired, generic and like it was done just for the sake of doing a new album, which I'm sure it was.\n\nWhen I first got \"Plaguewielder\" I liked it. It wasn't anything original or special by any stretch of the imagination, but it was a little more interesting than the albums since \"Transilvanian Hunger,\" which I must say was a pretty ridiculous album. Strangely enough though, I've always enjoyed it. I can't explain why. Anyway, I listened to this a few times and then forgot about it for a while (no surprise), but when a friend and I were going to hang out and smoke I decided to bring it along since it was beginning to collect dust. It was then that I realized just how bad it really was. Funny how when I listen to things alone I am a lot more tolerant of bad music. \n\nAs with any time I listened to this, the downright corny intro made me regret even buying it, but when that goofy riff came in I couldn't help but cringe. Of course the intro wasn't the only thing that was corny. These lyrics couldn't suck more ass. \"life is just a shadow of death\" That and all the rest of the lyrics remind me of tv shows about school kids where there's that goofy goth kid in the class who gets up to read some of his terrible poetry about dead leaves and loneliness. These guys and most other foreign bands should just stick to their own languages so that if their lyrics are weak, most people can ignore them.\n\nEverything on this album feels so pointless and uninspired it's almost torture to listen to. Everything is rehashed from earlier releases and the only difference between this and other Darkthrone albums is that some of the riffs (like the first one) sound more like Satyricon rejects than Darkthrone ones.\n\nI would have been more specific in this review, but after listening to this about 5 times nothing stuck with me. I'm sure I'm not the first one to say this, but \"Plaguewielder\" and most other Darkthrone albums (any after \"A Blaze\") are shit and only give black metal a bad name. Don't buy this. You would be better of just spending your money on drugs or fast food. Both would probably stick with you longer as this is an utterly forgettable release... I think the last time I listened to it I only made it to track three before I couldn't take any more and needed to hear some GOOD old-school style black metal instead of shit. I put in DHG's first album and was as happy as can be.\n",
        "\nI dare anyone to show me a band (Apart from the obvious one's which are on a par with Darkthrone) that was more essential to the Black Metal scene as Darkthrone were pre-1995 when according to most of the original fanbase, \"Darkthrone went downhill\". \"Under A Funeral Moon\" was perhaps the first piece of Black Metal work that Darkthrone had produced, as A Blaze... was more of a Black/Death fusion. This is primarily Black and it's fucking grim! At this point in time, Darkthrone were one of the genre's leading bands in terms of setting the pace and creating the sort of music the genre craved. One can argue that they're still pace setters, but it's highly unlikely one would win that argument. \n\nIn terms of the music itself, this is grim, harsh and downright evil. No one can deny that Darkthrone are legends of the genre and they thoroughly deserve that title if not for this creation, as well as \"Transilvainian Hunger\", which is a masterpiece. The album begins as it means to go on. Cold and raw. Much of the unique atmosphere should be credited to Nocturno Culto with his inspiring screams of hatred and aggression. I've never, to this day, heard such conviction in a vocalists screams. Such emotion is portrayed in his wails of despair. The production is also a much needed asset in creating the frost-bitten atmospheric nature of the album. That lo-fi sound we've all become accustomed to and have grown to love over the years. You could be forgiven for thinking this was recorded in a basement. Heck! It probably was! It's cut-throat, it's blasphemous and it's evil ... Much like Darkthrone themselves. Minimalism is taken to another level by the mighty Darkthrone. Chainsaw guitars, guttural screams and pounding drums are necessary assets to this much loved band. Rhythmic, varied and following with ease. Mid to fast paced, often slowing down to give us all a taste of the innovative nature that Darkthrone possesses. Blast beats where appropriate. The buzzing distortion necessary. This is driven to a goal of blasphemic destruction and annihilation of the weak. The tyranny of the devil in man will reign supreme. Uncompromising and ruthless. \n\nThis is one of those albums that only comes along once every so often. This is an album that has the ability to kick you the fuck out of your chair and kick you back into it again. The lyrical content has improved in my opinion. \"To Walk The Infernal Fields\" is a great example of such an opinion. Comparisons to Bathory have been made and will be ignored. Darkthrone were nothing but a class act at this stage. \n\nThis is essential Black Metal. As much as i love \"To Walk The Infernal Fields\", i shall recommend the entire album on the whole.\n",
        "\nThere's not a lot to say about this demo, because there's not a lot of substance to it. The first track, Forebyggende Krig, is what we expect from Darkthrone, cold and Black, but lacking the power and \"necro\" sound of their classic, earlier work. It is, however, not a bad song. There is a solo after two and a half minutes that is very \"Black and Roll\" sounding. It came as a slight surprise to hear, but was welcome all the same as something mostly fresh and new. \n\nThe second song, Bad Attitude, is a cover of New York City punk band the Testors. It is, to say the least, totally different from anything I've heard from Darkthrone. Fenriz does vocals on this track, and for good reason: it doesn't have \"Black Metal vocals,\" instead it has, as to be thought, punk vocals. However, lurking behind the steady punk back beat and shouted vocals is a droning, black metal guitar. I have never heard a combination of punk and BM before, and I must admit it is catchy and good. If someone decided to do an album of this, I would definitely give it a listen.\n\nOverall, its a good, quick (5 minutes) listen, and definately worth at least a download.\n",
        "\nSometimes it truly is best to let sleeping dogs lie. Darkthrone had probably never considered this when approached by new label Moonfog about releasing their second album proper, \u201cGoatlord\u201d. The album was actually shelved at the time of its demo recordings in 1991 to make way for the classic \u201cA Blaze In The Northern Sky\u201d as the band developed a far more extreme Black Metal sound than on their debut, \u201cSoulside Journey\u201d. Judging by the material on offer, it is not entirely surprising that the entire album was abandoned in favour of a different, yet now classic, Darkthrone approach.\n\nThe album consists of ten tracks taken directly from a rehearsal tape from 1990 and 1991, with the vocals not recorded until 1994. It is a reminder as to what Darkthrone could have ended up sounding like for their entire lengthy career were it not for the intervention of ex-Mayhem guitarist Euronymous and his encouraging the band to take an alternate musical path. Not unsurprisingly, the style of Metal that Darkthrone played at this time was not a world apart from what they were to become but \u201cGoatlord\u201d definitely shows a band playing a style more akin to mid-paced Death Metal than downright Black Metal.\n\nProduction-wise, the tracks have retained a certain natural sound from the rehearsal tapes, yet Nocturno Culto\u2019s latterly recorded vocals sound too removed from the music and not nearly as menacing as would be expected from a leading Black Metal vocalist. Such weak vocal performances are exemplified on tracks like \u201cPure Demoniac Blessing\u201d and \u201cBlack Daimon\u201d. Drummer Fenriz also contributes some frankly embarrassing feminine sounding vocals on tracks like \u201c(The) Grimness Of Which Shepherds Mourn\u201d and \u201cToward(s) The Thornfields\u201d which sound even more inappropriate and unquestionably should not have been included.\n\nThe music itself on \u201cGoatlord\u201d emanates amateurism and an attempt by the band to sound far more technical than their ability would seem to permit. Although the songs are taken from rehearsals, many of the guitar riffs and drum patterns are either dreary and tiresome or over the top and cluttered. Opener \u201cRex\u201d is the perfect example of such a lack of focus within the music, rapidly but imperfectly changing speed and direction throughout and sounding nothing but awkward and ungainly as a result.\n\nUnfortunately, this is simply a Darkthrone album that did not need to be released and Moonfog\u2019s motives for doing so are quite ambiguous. It is vaguely interesting to hear what the band were originally planning to release as their sophomore effort, yet the music is extremely misleading, sounding more like a third rate 80s Death Metal band in the early demo stages than actually representing the veritable immensity of Darkthrone. This is one for the fanatics and exceptionally curious only.\n\nOriginally written for http://www.blastwave.co.uk\n",
        "\nDarkthrone is in my mind one of the top 5 most important black metal bands in the genre. Their influence is evidenced by the countless amount of copycat bands out there. Most of them are shit and some are good. The band is in the twlight of their career and their music hasn't been essential since Panzerfaust. But they still put out some really good music today. I hate when so many fans rip this band apart for not making another \"Blaze, Transilvanian or Funeral Moon\". The creative run they had from 1990 to 1995 was one that will never be bettered by themselves and probably not many others can even match that string of excellence. \n\nDarkthrone have in some way made a good run starting with 'Hate Them', 'Sardonic Wrath' and now 'The Cult Is Alive'. They have taken a bit of a different direction in their style musically. There's signs of a punkish vibe along with doom laden riffs in their music. I personally don't have a problem with it as others who have posted here do. Darkthrone in 2006 is very different from the band circa 91-94. They don't wear corpsepaint anymore, they don't play gigs and they look to be more comfortable in their own skin with normal, happy lives. Back then they were much more the black metal band, look wise and lifestyle. \n\nNocturno Culto's voice is still fucking top notch, he hasn't lost a step one bit. With opener \"The Cult Of Goliath\" he lets loose with the guitar and vocals, the only difference being that the riff aren't 100% necro like before, there's rhythm and a punk rock sound now. The single \"Too Old, Too Cold\" is a catchy headbanging song with cheesy lyrics. They've got nothing to prove, they're just hellish rock n roll freaks like N.Culto said in the song. There's a couple of songs that really just look like they have run out of ideas like 'Shut Up' or 'Whisky Funeral', lyrically they're some of the worst songs written by them but the melodies make them bearable.\n\nThe majority of the songs are really good like 'De Underjordiske (Elia Capitolina)', 'Tyster P\u00e5 Gud' and 'Forebyggende Krig'. Add those with the first three songs and you have a really good release. I guess I cut these boys some slack because I know that the days of Blaze, Transilvanian... are long gone. I don't mind the change in style too much, I realize that many are disappointed or infuriated that they drifted from their early to mid 90's style of black metal. While they're not as good as in the early days they haven't \"lost it\" and are capable of making some quality music.\n",
        "\nLet me begin by saying that I'm pretty familiar with both versions of this album and that this review is not so much to critique the music (which totally rules), more this particular release instead. I first heard \"Goatlord,\" but after being curious about some of the tracks that were left off I downloaded the \"Clamor\" version. I listened to it for a while and then eventually decided that I wanted to go back to the slightly more crisp (although trebly) sound on \"Goatload.\" The transition back never happened because once I got used to hearing it without vocals I couldn't stand this version. I never noticed it before, but the vocals seem like they are twice as loud as the music and they are terrible to boot. They sound like Fenriz vomiting all over a mic. Instead of the excellent music all I can pay attention to is the almost constant and distrorted \"BARF\" sound. I can't turn it up to hear the music better because then the vocals will shred my ears. The only time this doesn't make me want to puke all over myself is when the \"female\" vocals come in every so often. I love them because they are very strange, eerie and beautiful, but with a delightfully disturbing (not because of sheer volume, heh) undercurrent. While they are cool and unique, they are not enough to save this from it's single, fatal and tragic flaw. My guess is that they made the vocals too loud intentionally so that maybe people wouldn't give it a chance and would foolishly assume that the problem was with the \"soulless, all tech, no heart, bullshit\" prog metal thereby sabotaging the release, further distancing themselves from their very creative/musical past. That sounds like a conspiracy, but hey some people will believe anything so what the fuck... Bottom line is that they should have released it without the vocals. The fact that they added them makes it feel like a \"cash-in\" trying to pass as a normal album. IT'S A SIX YEAR-OLD REHEARSAL TAPE WITH OVERDUBS FOR FUCK'S SAKE!!! That's not an album, it's just cheap. Forget about this unless you are a Darkthrone fanatic and/or feel that you absolutely must supporting these filthy whores. Just get \"Clamor\" instead.\n",
        "\nDarkthrone\u2019s latest album, \u201cThe Cult is Alive\u201d sounds like it took as long to make as it takes to listen to, and is no worse for that. The band\u2019s DIY aesthetic is well in evidence with a return to the home-studio ambience (little bass, phone-booth drums etc) of its seminal black albums. It\u2019s what helps to make DT so special, or pathetic, depending on your point of view. No pretense or production, just raw, visceral riffs, then a few beers, not necessarily in that order.\n\nThe \u201cPreparing for War\u201d Special Edition box is the total overdose for fans of the \u201craw necro\u201d DT rather than the later, more polished albums of the \u201cRavishing Grimness\u201d era and style. The first disc has been available for some time and is a cracker, a genuine \u201cbest of\u201d the Peaceville albums with demos and live tracks thrown in. On its own, Disc 1 is a must-have.\n\nDisc 2\u2019s compilation of demos and rehearsal tracks shows clearly the band\u2019s transition from death to black metal. Strongly evident is Fenriz\u2019 noble (?) intention of minimizing his drum technique over time. The demo tracks from the late Eighties show him to be quite a proficient, technical death metal drummer with a real native swing to his playing. As time goes by, his style is stripped back to the barest minimum. As he himself says in interview on Disc 3 (DVD), black metal is not about drums but riffs. The drums are there to serve the riffs. Nonetheless, Disc 2 highlights Fenriz\u2019 great propensity for swing and backbeat. His two-beat polka romp propels the \u201cUnder a Funeral Moon\u201d rehearsal at a cracking pace, even faster than the official version, and, as the last track on the disc, is fittingly its highlight.\n\nThe set\u2019s third disc is a DVD containing video footage of (all?) the band\u2019s live performances. Typically Darkthrone, the video quality is at best grainy and at worst as good as a fifth-generation VHS re-dub. Whatever, it\u2019s great to have it just for its own sake. Highlights have to include the four-piece band\u2019s TV appearance in 1989 playing tracks from \u201cSoulside Journey\u201d: lots of moshing blond hair in the two-guitar-and-bass frontline with Fenriz bashing grandly up on the riser. Preposterous stuff! No wonder they quit playing live! The \u201cinterviews\u201d (Fenriz and Nocturno taking it in turns with the handi-cam) are not as enlightening as the excellent interview transcribed in the accompanying booklet, but, again, it\u2019s great to see and hear them in the flesh, so to speak. Fenriz lives up to his joker reputation and both clearly show the long-term effects of years of hard work and dedication to the black metal craft (nudge, wink).\n\nAll in all, unmissable for the DT devotee.\n",
        "\nThis is an album that \u2013 over the years \u2013 has received much praise, been cloned many times, and is generally held as a cornerstone of modern black metal. There seems to be no doubt that this album is essential. However, I just can\u2019t understand why. I don\u2019t mean that the album is bad, but it\u2019s just not that good.\n\nThe album opens up with \u201cKathaarian Life Code.\u201d Some bands can open an album with a ten minute song, but Darkthrone really shouldn\u2019t. There are some great riff structures in here, but the song just drags on. And on. And on. By around five minutes the song has changed riffs a couple of times but hasn\u2019t really gone anywhere, it\u2019s just boring, mid-paced black metal. However, the last minute and a half stand out, because the tempo increases and the song seems more aggressive. It also stands out because it\u2019s good.\n\n\u201cIn the Shadow of the Horns\u201d beats me with more boring, mid-paced black metal. Boring riffs, and that is just the overwhelming thing about this song. Like the previous track, this song also has a tempo shift, but when it speeds up it\u2019s still boring. I find that this song pretty much sums up the album as a whole. It has everything every other track has: boring, and a whole heap of it. It goes nowhere and just can\u2019t hold my interest, and occasionally there\u2019s some aggressive speed thrown in, but hell, that\u2019s boring too (for the most part).\n\nThis album is not complex, it\u2019s not pretty and nor does it try to be. It\u2019s raw, it\u2019s evil and it\u2019s proud, but most of all it\u2019s dull. It\u2019s an album that just never made an impression on me in all the times I\u2019ve tried to get into it, but most frustratingly, it doesn\u2019t give me a lot to say about it either. It simply lacks whatever it is that makes an album enjoyable.\n",
        "\nThis is a very difficult review to write. Transilvanian Hunger is not like other black metal albums. In fact, its not like any other album period. How Fenriz and Nocturno Culto made the artistic and stylistic decisions that birthed this album is beyond me. Like Neo in The Matrix, Transilvanian Hunger is an anomaly in the metal world; this album should not be the album it is. It should be either ignored or looked down upon. By all the normal \"rules\" of music, this should be a bad album. But it...isn't. In fact, its something much more.\n\nEverything about this album is completely different than anything else in Darkthrone's library, almost shockingly so. The most obvious thing that people will immediately notice is the now infamous production. Transilvanian Hunger has, without a doubt, the dryest, most muffled production I have ever heard. The reasons for this are often debated; while some would say this was a concious decision on the part of Darkthrone, others have said that Peaceville pushed them to release this album at a specific time, and as a result the production was left unfinished. While the riffs are easily identifyable, as are the vocals and even to a certain extent the bass, the aspect of the music that is most affected by the production is the drums. Fenriz's constant attack behind the kit is almost complety washed out and buried in the mix; sometimes its next to impossible to make out the snare, and the bass drum seems like you are hearing it through a wall two doors down. \n\nThis would obviously be a huge detriment if not for the nature of the drumming on Transilvanian Hunger. Fenriz's performance on this album consists of a constant one-two punch of bass, snare, and hi-hat that literally almost never changes. I think there are maybe eight or nine fills and maybe two tempo changes on the entire album; everthing else is the same not-quite-blast beat, over and over and over...This coupled with the muffled production gives the drums an indistinct yet strangely hypnotic role on the record, the repitive nature lulling you into a trancelike state where your full attention can be given to the riffs.\n\nOh, the riffs. Transilvanian Hunger is a riff-based album if ever one existed. Most of the songs consist of three to four chord progessions played in a tremolo style, and there are rarely more then two riffs per song. With that being said, the riffs are absolutely fantastic, displaying a cold, uncompromising sense of melody that would never surface again in Darkthrone's catologue. This is not the kind of grand sweeping melody displayed by Emperor on In The Nightside Eclipse, however; Transilvanian Hunger's melody is of a simpler, more heartfelt kind, combining grace and beauty with the cold malice that every black metal band wants to portray. The bass lines generally follow the guitar, with the raspy vocals topping off the whole sonic picture, like an old man sitting up in a mountain commenting on the misery and despair he sees in the world below him. \n\nAll of these unique musical aspects meld together and create some of the most hypnotizing, dark, disturbing songs ever recorded. The now infamous melody of the title track, the strange churning notes of \"Over Fjell Og Giennom Torner\" (with the opening melody being one of my favorites on the album), the metallic fury of Skald Av Satans Sol, the flowing repition of \"I En Hall Med Flesk Gg Mjod\", and the misanthropic vibe of \"As Flittermice As Satans Spies\" sounding like it could be the soundtrack to Hell itself; everything comes together as something complete and whole. Transilvanian Hunger is an ALBUM; all the music shares a pattern, a thought, an ideal. \n\nWith its muffled production, unifying drum beat, cold, repititive melodies, and hypnotizing nature, Transilvanian Hunger is unlike any other album in metal or rock. Honestly, it seems strange to even call this \"metal\". Much like Burzum's Filosofem, this album has done something truly spectacular in my mind, which is carve out its own unique niche in music, sounding unlike anything else, yet sounding somewhat familiar at the same time. How much of this album's unique sound was on purpose on how much of it was a fluke is irrelevant, as Darkthrone has repeatedly stated that they will never make another album like Transilvanian Hunger, and I can't see any other band making one either, no matter how much they tried. \n\nPeople have repeatedly stated the \"flaws\" of this album, and I am well aware of all of them. Yet for some reason, on this particular album, by this particular band, these are not flaws, but parts of a unique sound-one might even say, the perfect black metal sound that every like-minded band wants to capture. In this way, like the infamous statement issued on the inital pressings of this album, Transilvanian Hunger is truly beyond criticism.\n",
        "\n\u201c\u2026crush not only our surrounding walls of curiosity, but also the hordes of blind believers\u2026\u201d\n\nAnyone who\u2019s done even an hour's worth of research on early death metal has to know that demos of the style, even in \u201989, were as narrowly distributed and spread out as towns and hamlets across Siberia. Yet the sound was there. Bands like Grave, Obituary, Amon, Dismember, Death and Morbid Angel are the logical first in this fact-finding expedition, acts that tried their damnedest to plow through anonymity\u2019s slush by feverishly snail-mailing tapes to every label, magazine/fanzine, and indie metal radio show they could find, across an ocean or in their backyards. These demos paved the proverbial way for horrific late \u201880s/early \u201890s slabs that would nurture the malevolent creature after the umbilical cord had been hacked and cauterized. Rarely mentioned in this inquest is Darkthrone \u2013 absolutely no surprise to me, their death metal heritage somehow considered more a misguided indiscretion than a conscious attitude by many stalwart face-painters, yet after four demos and an album\u2019s worth of the stuff it\u2019s kinda ignorant to say the route wasn\u2019t dead set in their minds. \n\nNeedless to say, there was no grand revelation when the sound on Soulside Journey mirrored this, at least not to those who had spun Cromlech or material prior. With that in mind, if the debut had blared something more akin to A Blaze in the Northern Sky, these unsigned works would be a little more important now. \n\nBut the proof is in the pudding. In addition to earning them a deal with gloomy n\u2019 doomy Peaceville, Cromlech\u2019s \u201cThe Watchtower\u201d, wordless \u201cAccumulation of Generalization\u201d, and \u201cSempiternal Past/Presence View Sepulchrality\u201d (spelled \u201cWiew\u201d on the inlay) predict the future sound of many including the rhythmic grind on Necrophobic\u2019s debut lp as well as the pubescent, not-yet-so-downtuned cacophony of the Sunlight Studio Swedish invasion. Unorthodox doom shambles like early Paradise Lost with one tied on and unashamedly entangles with Gylve\u2019s unsettling speed-sworn drum work, sweating quite frantically in the final track. Scattered throughout are vocals soaked in as much guttural malice as any of the other fledgling death metal bands on or off their way, and what little lyrics are penned show an imagination geared more toward the arcane than the frank, nocturnal yet timid. \n\nHindsight colors much of this review even if someone in the Darkthrone camp thought I should hear this, and in \u201889 I was pleased to see a package from far-frozen Norway stuffing my parents\u2019 quaint New Jersey mailbox. In that light, it can be said the hindsight here is a conscious effort on my part, \u2018cause no one could know what would become of Darkthrone, Tomas Skogsberg, and all the bands around them that perished shortly thereafter. In real time, Cromlech was an exertion of strong-willed death metal that didn't really take the dread music of Morbid Angel and Death to a different level, yet provided something very solid, very serious, and would probably beguile the fan who hadn't heard either. And for some, it's what Soulside Journey did. \n\nNowadays if someone comes along swearing that Cromlech roams with gross deviation over demos by Nocturnus, Greeting Death, Messiah Death, and Nihilist, it\u2019s based on the bias of the band\u2019s future accomplishment, sentiment, and time, not what\u2019s at hand.\n",
        "\nHere\u2019s where Darkthrone lost much of their originality. Panzerfaust is often hailed by many as the one of the greatest, if not, the greatest Darkthrone album ever released. But I disagree. Why? Well, remember how I stated many times before that Darkthrone was influenced highly by extreme Metal bands of the 80s? Well, this isn\u2019t the case here, with the exception of one band. Panzerfaust is nothing but a carbon copy of Celtic Frost\u2019s first two albums. There aren\u2019t even any Sodom or Bathory influences to be heard here. Most of the material here sounds exactly like something Celtic Frost would have released back in \u201884 or \u201885. \n\nNow, I do like Celtic Frost a lot, but if you\u2019re going to take an influence from a band, I don\u2019t think that copying their entire damn style is the right thing to do. I mean, people claim that Usurper, a Death/Thrash Metal band from Chicago, is a Celtic Frost rip-off. But what about this? Despite my rant, there are a few elements on this album that differ from the traditional Frost style. For one, the vocals are completely insane. Nocturno Culto sounds NOTHING like he did on the previous Darkthrone albums. Instead of that evil, harsh, raspy shriek that he commonly used before, his vocals sound more angry here than anything, sort of\u2026punk-ish might I say? And if you thought that the vocals from Under A Funeral Moon were far too high in the mix, then just check these out! The vocal mix here is almost twice as loud as the mix on Under A Funeral Moon, although they don\u2019t contain the reverb that the vocals on that album had. \n\nAnother difference would be that a few tracks do stand out as a reminisce of Transylvanian Hunger, consisting of repetitive tremolo guitar picking overlining a constant pace in the drum patterns. Still, I think that Darkthrone could have layed off of the Frost influence a bit. Seriously though, this record is RAW! RAW I tell you! RAW! There\u2019s very little atmosphere to be heard here. This is more straight up, blackened thrash Metal from the 80s the way Celtic Frost used to do it. There are even some doomy parts to the album, meaning that Darkthrone layed off the \u201call open strings\u201d rule for a bit, blasting out several moments of thick and heavy riffs the way, of course, Celtic Frost used to do them. See what I mean? They overdid it with the Frost influences, but that\u2019s not to say that this is a bad album or that it isn\u2019t enjoyable. There are still some trademark, Darkthrone elements here, meaning that this album isn\u2019t completely unoriginal. This isn\u2019t anywhere near as repetitive and/or minimal as Transylvanian Hunger or even Under A Funeral Moon. It\u2019s more along the lines of A Blaze In The Northern Sky without the other extreme Metal influences.\n\n\nThe opening track, En Vind Av Sorg, sounds more like something left off of Transylvanian Hunger. It\u2019s got the exact same vibe of that album, though overall less impressive. The vocals are incredibly upfront and in-your-face, giving off a true vibe of hate and anger. Unlike Transylvanian Hunger though, this track manages to spew forth a bit more riff variety under the chaotic overtones of the music. The English translation of the title is One Wind Of Sorrow. Now Triumphant Gleam sounds EXACTLY like Celtic Frost with hasher vocals. To be honest, this is nothing short of an 80s Doom/Thrash Metal tune with some trademark, Darkthrone overtones, which of course, are barely present. In fact, if you were to eliminate the vocals from this track and play it, you\u2019d probably assume that this was something off of Celtic Frosts\u2019 Morbid Tales or To Mega Therion albums. This is still a good song though, just nothing great. I\u2019d rather just listen to Celtic Frost instead. The Hordes Of Nebulah is another very Doom Metal based track with the obvious Celtic Frost influences. Ever heard Celtic Frost\u2019s Procreation Of The Wicked? Well, that\u2019s pretty much what this song sounds like. The vocals, of course, just sound much angrier and overall more harsh. Needless to say, this song is HEAVY in all caps! So yes, this is a great song. Original? Not exactly, but this is some great shit.\n\nHans Siste Vinter is my favorite song off the album. Yes, it does strongly have that Transylvanian Hunger vibe to it, much similar to this album\u2019s opening track as well, but the difference here is that this one has some incredible atmosphere. Okay, so the mood and atmosphere isn\u2019t as intense as one would find it to be on Transylvanian Hunger, but at least this song doesn\u2019t reek with Celtic Frost clonage. The English translation of the title is His Last Winter. Beholding The Throne Of Might is another doomy, heavy as all hell track in the exact vein of old Hellhammer and Celtic Frost (duh!). The first half of the song consists of thick, heavy, chugging riffs that drag along slowly in a fit of death and despair. Pretty soon though, the song begins to thrash things up similar to\u2026yup, you guessed it, Celtic fucking Frost, or even Sodom or Venom for that matter. In other words, it\u2019s a great fusion of old school punk and thrash Metal, which is something that all three of those bands did back in the 80s.\n\nWith Quintessence, I guess the band chose to leave the guitar strings opened for the entirety of this song. To be honest, this track kind of bores me. It\u2019s not entirely bad, but I could have dealt without it on the album. It\u2019s all slow paced, but let me say something; if you\u2019re going to make a slow song that\u2018s NOT a ballad, make sure the riffs are nice and heavy. Look to Beholding The Throne Of Might or The Hordes Of Nebulah for some GREAT examples of that formula. Like I said, this isn\u2019t a bad song, but it does tend to bore me quite a bit. The last track, Sn\u00f8 Og Granskog (Utferd), is a weird way to end the album off. There\u2019s some\u2026trumpet playing the background? Actually, this entire song consists of ONLY this trumpet like instrument, along with some guy saying some shit in Norwegian that I cannot understand. Sounds like he\u2019s preaching or something. Maybe I could have guessed what he was saying if the English translation of this title was available. I can\u2019t seem to find it! So I have no idea what the title even means. Well, this is an interesting ending to the album, despite how weird it may be.\n\n\nPanzerfaust marked the end of Darkthrone\u2019s glory. At least that\u2019s how I view it, as well as most other people too, I\u2019m sure. If you liked any of Darkthrone\u2019s previous releases after Soulside Journey, then you\u2019re bound to like this. Or even if you\u2019re just a casual fan of 80s Death and Thrash Metal, you might even get into this as well. I also forgot to mention that this was the last album with Zephyrous in the band. It\u2019s still unknown to this day as to why he left. Both Nocturno Culto and Fenriz refuse to speak about it in interviews when the question is brought up as to why he left. So now Darkthrone was only down to two members. Could the band survive? Well, I\u2019ll elaborate more on that on my next album review for the band.\n",
        "\nLet me just start by saying that Transylvanian Hunger makes Under A Funeral Moon sound like fucking Soulside Journey in so many ways! The minimalism that is obtained on this album is fucking incredible, so fucking minimal, that it will put the listener into a trance like state, with the whole point of the album being to hypnotize those who listen to it. Honestly, I think it requires great talent and accuracy to play the same riff for over 6 minutes straight without screwing up once, so those of you who start to accuse Darkthrone again of being talent less fucks, you can suck Satan\u2019s cock in Hell for all I care. I respect anyone who can get into this, or at least appreciate it for what it is. To get a clear idea of what the album sounds like, take the two most minimalistic tracks from Under A Funeral Moon and subtract one or two riffs from them. Then remix all of the instruments together to create a hypnotizing wall of noise, lower the vocals into the mix, and there you have it; the dark and evil masterpiece known as Transylvanian Hunger. Nothing more and nothing less.\n\n\nThe album kicks off with my all time favorite Darkthrone song, Transilvanian Hunger! The entire track is based on two riffs, the same drum pattern through out, yet spans over 6 minutes long. Needless to say, the hypnotic atmosphere that is created by this song is purely incredible, and one would only have to hear to understand. Do yourself a favor; turn off all the lights, light some candles, play this tune full blast on your stereo, relax and let your mind wander into the evil, haunted bat-ridden forests of Transylvania where Dracula\u2019s castle stands in all its might over the hills. That\u2019s really what this song does. Pretty amazing, huh? All of that based on 2 riffs, repetitive beats and harsh vocals? I tell you, it\u2019s all in the mix and production! The band really did it this time. I mean, that one main riff is catchy as all hell and will stay nailed into your skull for a very long time. I guarantee you that! In Over Fjell Og Gjennom, believe it or not, there is only ONE riff through out this entire song. Yet, this is the shortest track on the album, lasting only 2 and a half minutes long. The English translation of the title is Over Mountains And Through Thorns, and is based on battle and Norse pride. The last lyric, which is \u201cDen Norr\u00edne Rase ma Slakte den andre nar blammen dunker for tungt pa var d\u00edr\u201d, translates to \u201cThe Norse race must slaughter the other when niggers pound too heavily on our door\u201d. That later on caused some confusion on whether Darkthrone was a neo-nazi act or not.\n\nThe next song, Skald Av Satans Sol, consists of more than four riffs at least. The drumming of course remains the same as with the previous two songs, but the main riff in this track is catchy as fuck! It may be quite repetitive, but hell, I don\u2019t care. This is one badass riff, and is also another that is guaranteed to stay nailed into the back of your skull. The riffs do change slightly through out though, but the main focus and highlight here is the main riff. By the way, the English translation of the title is Scald Of Satan\u2019s Sun. Much in the vein of the title track, Slottet I Det Fjerne relies on only 2 or 3 riffs which are executed well enough to keep the listener interested, or at least in a trance like state. The harsh, Norwegian lyrics only add to the evil atmosphere that this song conveys. The English translation of the title is The Castle In The Distance. With Graven Takeheimens Saler, unlike most of the other tracks heard here, there is more variation in the riffs. There are maybe about\u20264 or 5 through out the song? Regardless, this track still delivers the same cold and harsh tone that places you into a trance like atmosphere. Don\u2019t expect any variation in the drumming either. The English translation is The Grave In The Misthouse Halls.\n\nLen Hall Med Flesk Og Mjod is merely like every other song on the album, as it begins with a blast of rapid drum beats, frozen, icy riffs, harsh vocals and an atmosphere of darkness and mysticism. It isn\u2019t until the middle of the song that the riffs tend to vary, allowing Nocturno Culto\u2019s vocals to come a bit more forward in the mix so that his harsh, Norwegian accent shines in all its evil glory. This is one of the most evil sounding songs on the album, and is without a doubt, one of Darkthrone\u2019s best. The English translation of the title is In A Hall With Pork And Mead. As Flittermice As Satans Spys is by far one of the most minimalistic tracks on the album. Much like Over Fjell Og Gjennom Torner, this one is based solely on one riff, maybe two, yet sustains a much harsher, colder feel than that aforementioned song. It conveys more of an atmosphere as well since it spans almost six minutes long! Let me tell you, if this doesn\u2019t pull you into a trance, then you\u2019ll get bored of this song easily. That goes for the rest of the album as well. \n\nEn As I Dype Skogen is the album off on one incredible note! Okay, so it\u2019s simplistic and repetitive just as the rest of the record is, but riffs and atmosphere here\u2026wow! That\u2019s all I have to say is\u2026wow! This isn\u2019t aggressive in the sense of A Blaze In The Northern Sky. This one is just pure fucking atmospheric chaos all the way through, something you\u2019ll have to hear to understand. I mean, how the hell do they do that while relying only on one or two riffs?! Honestly, this song will take you into a deep haunted forest where the cold winds blow along with many mysterious creatures that inhabit it. Seriously, when you translate the lyrics into English, that\u2019s what this song is about. It\u2019s called A Hill In The Deep Forest. Funny thing is, is that although the lyrics are in Norwegian, you don\u2019t have to understand them to experience the atmosphere that this song tries to convey. The music just speaks for itself.\n\n\n\nI know, I know, I stated in my review for A Blaze In The Northern Sky that Darkthrone\u2019s goal when making albums was not to take the listener off into another realm with their music, just as Emperor, Satyricon and Burzum were doing at the time. Well, they sure did it here with this album, but this is very different from those bands. VERY different. How? Well, there\u2019s no use of keyboards, symphonics or constant riff changes like Emperor includes on their records. There\u2019s no use of sad, melancholic and/or depressive atmospheres used with keyboards and mid paced beats like Burzum used. I mean, this just sounded pure evil and mystical, not depressive. Last but not least, there\u2019s no use of folk and medieval instrumentation that Satyricon used on their early releases. This album is just a few different riffs put together over the same pattern of drum beats, managing to have a much greater effect on the listener than any of the other Norwegian bands that I just mentioned. Well, that\u2019s all in my opinion. So really, you either love or hate this album, which seems to be the case with most people. Some call it godly, while others claim that it\u2019s one of the worst pieces of shit ever released. Still, if you claim that this is \u201cno-talent-minimal-bullshit\u201d, then you can just continue sucking off Opeth and Dream Theater, or some shitty flower power band out there. Not that I have anything against Opeth or Dream Theater, but if you think good music has to be solely complexed with crystal clear production, you couldn\u2019t be more wrong.\n",
        "\nA Blaze In The Northern Sky was bit of a cross between Death and Black Metal, which sounded like an album that could have easily been released in the mid or late 80s alongside bands like Sodom, Celtic Frost and Bathory. But with this album, Darkthrone seemed to have taken minimalistic musicianship onto a whole new level. Yes, this album is harsh as fuck, but it isn\u2019t heavy. The production is raucously loud, yet paper thin. There\u2019s no bass work to be heard here and the vocals are so damn high in the mix, that they tend to turn off even the most extreme Metal fans. \n\nDespite confrontations with the record label about the album\u2019s sound, Darkthrone carried on with the recording of Under A Funeral Moon, which consisted of sloppy, minimalistic musicianship that required a particular taste to get into. In other words, most armature garage bands have better production than this. Many people accuse the band of producing such a minimalistic, low-fi album in order to disguise their lack of talent. And yes, there are plenty of shitty bands out there today who use this technique because they can\u2019t play their fucking instruments, but must I bring up Soulside Journey again? These are the exact same musicians, excluding the bass player, playing on an entirely different album. The fact is, is that the sloppy garage sound and minimalism was done INTENTIONALLY, and those who bitch about the minimalism and low quality production of this record are clearly missing the whole fucking point! These truly are fantastic musicians whom are using the least of their ability to achieve great, black art, and with Under A Funeral Moon, they do that quite well. \n\n\nNatassja In Eternal Sleep is one of the first Darkthrone songs I ever heard, and if not, it may just be the first! My first reaction was\u2026\u201dWhat the fuck is this crap?!\u201d. There are something like\u20264 or 5 riffs through out the entire song, maybe even less. The drum patterns remain the same through out, and needless to say, this is RAW in the true sense of the word. The bass is practically non-existent. However, the absolute minimalism and rawness of this song intrigued me quite a bit instead of turning me off. Lyrically, this is like a Satanic love song which is dedicated to a dead witch named Natassja who was burned alive at the stake. I\u2019m quite sure that the lyrics were inspired by Mercyful Fate\u2019s Melissa..With the next track, Summer Of The Diabolical Holocaust, the use minimalism gets taken to the extreme. The riffs are barely decipherable, yet, the mood and evil atmosphere that this song conjures manages to keep things interesting. The rather loud vocals, of course, help with this factor. There is a slower segment during the middle of the song in which this searing, long guitar solo comes into play. One of the best? Maybe not, but it\u2019s still a damn good song.\n\nThe Dance Of Eternal Shadows begins at a very slow pace, yet still lacks the overall doomed feeling that the previous two albums had. The reason for this is because from this album on, all the riffs that Darkthrone came up with were made up solely of open strings. In other words, you won\u2019t hear that thick, crushing or heavy sound that most Death, Doom or any other extreme Metal bands form their riffs with. The strings of the guitars on this album are all open in order to be played in a sloppy manner. There are no definitive riffs to be heard here. Anyway, this track manages to pick up the pace pretty soon, but to say that it\u2019s thrashy would be a false statement. The drums are far too low in the mix to create a thrash break for any song on the album. The following song, Unholy Black Metal, truly lives up to its title! Of all of tracks on the album, this one is by far one of the most minimal, consisting of only 2 or 3 riffs through out the entire song. The drum pattern changes pace only once or twice through out, which is still minimal even in a song that\u2019s only 3 and a half minutes long. The vocals, however, are loud as fuck! Bone chilling, to say the least! Combine all of these elements together, and you get one of the best Darkthrone songs ever made. Now THIS is what Fenriz meant when he stated that less means more. This truly is Unholy Black Metal!\n\nTo Walk The Infernal Fields is merely a carbon copy of Bathory\u2019s Enter The Eternal Fire. It\u2019s just played much sloppier, that\u2019s all. Is that such a bad thing? I think not. I view it as more of a tribute than anything else. The entire song consists of mid-paced, swinging drum patterns that change very little through the song\u2019s 8 minute length span. As for the riffs\u2026well\u2026I wouldn\u2019t call them a rip-off on the Bathory tune, but they\u2019re clearly identical to it, just played in the Darkthrone style. The original Enter The Eternal Fire is overall thicker and much heavier, while the Darkthrone tune relies all on open strings to convey the melody across. Overall, I think that this track obtains a great atmosphere, as well as some killer lyrics and the best Darkthrone quote ever; \u201cWith my art, I am the fist in the face God!\u201d. Gotta love that line!\n\nDespite there only being very few riffs (of course!) in the title track, the main riff is pretty damn catchy when compared to what else is on this record. The vocals, once again, are ice cold and harsh, very much in the vein of the Unholy Black Metal track. Both songs don\u2019t differ much from one another, with the exception of this one having more riffs and a bit more variety. There\u2019s also this part during the song where it all slows down to allow this extreme, rapid guitar solo to surge through the speakers. Now when Darkthrone does guitar solos, don\u2019t think that they\u2019re high quality material. Their solos are no more complexed than old Bathory\u2019s, Celtic Frost\u2019s or Sodom\u2019s. But hey, any cleaner or more precise, and the solos wouldn\u2019t go well the music. \n\nInn I De Dype Skogers Favn is the first song that Darkthrone wrote entirely in Norwegian, and let me tell you, when Nocturno Culto bellows out his harsh lyrics in Norwegian instead of in English, the evil atmosphere is like multiplied times 10! His harsh, raspy shrieks match the language so well. I mean, this is one of the harshest sounding languages next to German, so it\u2019s only appropriate that it\u2019d be used for Black Metal. The English translation of the title is In The Deep Forests\u2019 Embrace. Lame song title, but good song. Perhapse it was put into Norwegian for that reason? Musically, this kind of foreshadows what the following Darkthrone album would sound like. There are like\u20261 or 2 riffs through out the entire song. The lyrics are entirely in Norwegian and the drumming is as minimal as can be. The only thing that this song lacks is the incredible atmosphere that the follow up album would have, but that\u2019s an entirely different review to come\u2026\n\nIn the closing track, Crossing The Triangle Of Flames, Fenriz really displays some unique variation with his drum work here. Through out most the album, he relied on the same drumming technique, but with the album\u2019s last track, he tends to use much variation with the drum snare, providing a nice rhythm to go along with the blazing fast riffs. The high usage of crash symbols adds much to the effect as well. So needless to say, this is a great song to end the album off.\n\n\nVery few bands have been able to mimic this style without sounding like utter crap. Hell, even most Metal fans would state that the sound on this album is utter crap, but truthfully, they\u2019re missing the entire fucking point. We already know that Darkthrone are great musicians, so there\u2019s no need to accuse them of lack of talent. After all, doesn\u2019t it take much talent to create something so sinister using only little elements of what you\u2019re really capable of? That\u2019s like someone telling you to write a paragraph on a certain subject using only a few given words. It would be hard, wouldn\u2019t it? So quit bitching people, because you\u2019re missing the point. Even if you can\u2019t stand this album, at least understand the point it\u2019s trying to convey, okay?\n",
        "\nBy the early 90s, several of the European Death Metal acts along-side Darkthrone like Entombed, At The Gates and even Dismember, seemed to have had \u201clost\u201d the extreme, raw and brutal edge to the Death Metal genre. Death Metal is or was all about being aggressive, raw and down-right primative. Not to say that those bands weren\u2019t damn heavy, because they were, but Darkthrone saw a decline in extremity when it came to what was called \u201cdeath metal\u201d during the time, which included their Soulside Journey album as being a perfect example of that decline as well. Pretty soon, Darkthrone wanted absolutely NOTHING to do with the current Death Metal scene, in which they wrote it off as being wimpy and trendy.\u2026\n\nSo what does Darkthrone do? They don\u2019t progress. They release one technical Death Metal album, Soulside Journey, and then go back in time into mid 80s (not literally, but musically speaking), and release an album full of hate, rawness, aggression and minimalistic musicianship, VERY MUCH similar to what Bathory, Hellhammer and Sodom were putting out during their prime. This particular album, A Blaze In The Northern Sky, marked the start of a new beginning for Darkthrone. Three of the four members obtained this \u201cless is more\u201d mentality, reducing their music into minimalistic, raw and hateful Black Metal. Nevertheless, the music on A Blaze In The Northern Sky isn\u2019t as simplistic, raw or minimal as their later works like Under A Funeral Moon or Transylvanian Hunger. Instead, this album is kind of a cross between Black and Death Metal, leaning more towards the realm of Black Metal. Even those of you who despise the bands later works MIGHT get into this album after a few listens since there is enough Death Metal riffing to be heard here. It\u2019s just the raw production that will turn most people off. As for the band\u2019s later offerings\u2026well\u2026they\u2019re a totally different story.\n\n\nKathaarian Life Code kicks off with some evil chanting, followed by a voice that\u2019s whispering something of which I cannot understand. This kind of intro sets the mood perfectly, probably causing the listener to assume that this is going to be another atmospheric Metal listening experience. But if they assume that, then they\u2019re in for a total shock! The intro lasts for about 1 and a half minutes, and then after that, a raw and furious metallic assault of noisy riffs and thrashy drumming comes thundering through your speakers, accompanied by screechy, high and raspy vocals that are almost harsh enough to freeze the blood in your veins. At first, it seems almost like a wall of pure evil noise, but after awhile, you\u2019ll notice that this is nothing more than a reminisce of Bathory\u2019s 1987 masterpiece, Under The Sign Of The Black Mark. Everything here just sounds overall thicker, noisier, and downright more harsh. Okay, so this isn\u2019t Bathory quality Metal, but this is still some good shit. Spanning over 10 and a half minutes long, the song manages to undergo many changes, including standard thrashing, sort of in a punk-ish style, all the way to mid paced, thick and heavy, chugging riffs. Overall, this is a killer beginning to the album.\n\nIn The Shadow Of The Horns, in my opinion, is the best song on the album, as well as one of Darkthrone\u2019s all time best. The majority of the track flows at a mid pace, though the riffs are heavy as hell, raw (duh!), and thick in sense that they CRUSH, much similar to the way Autopsy formed their slow, chugging riff work. The vocals of course are harsh, angry and hateful, bellowing out one hell of a chorus \u201cIN THE SHADOW OF THE HORNS!\u201d. It\u2019s not too long though before the thrashing takes place, speeding things up sort of in the vein of early Venom or Mot\u00f6rhead, fusing a nice mix of speed metal and old school punk. Then once again, the thrashing is followed by a furious assault of pure black/death Metal in the Bathory vein, accompanied by Nocturno Culto screaming \u201cIn the shadows of the horns!\u201d over the wall of noisy, chaotic Black Metal. Oddly enough though, there are some acoustics that overline the music towards the end, which sound so out of place, that they fit perfectly IN PLACE with this type of music\u2026if that makes any sense to you.\n\nParagon Belial is another mid paced, heavy track that is kind of a reminisce of Bathory\u2019s Enter The Eternal Fire or any of the Viking-era stuff from the band. Well, that\u2019s at least how the song begins. The double bass soon starts to kick in and then these groove-like, thrashy riffs come into play, making me to assume that the music to this track was probably written during the band\u2019s Death Metal era. The ending of the song, though, is completed with some semi-epic, bombastic riffing, which fits perfectly well with the formula for this song. Overall, another one of the band\u2019s best. Where Cold Winds Blow is just one tremendous thrasher!! If the Bathory/Hellhammer/early Kreator and Sepultura influences aren\u2019t obvious here to you, then either you\u2019re deaf, you\u2019re an idiot, or you haven\u2019t heard any of the aforementioned bands. There\u2019s also some loud, extreme guitar soloing going on that sounds like it\u2019s all over the place at first, but that\u2019s obviously the way it was meant to sound. Don\u2019t think that Nocturno Culto can\u2019t play the guitar accurately, because his work on Soulside Journey proves that wrong. This is the way that he chooses to play on this album, and I wouldn\u2019t prefer it any other way.\n\nThe album\u2019s title track is yet another death-like, Black Metal thrasher in the vein of the opening and previous tracks. Pretty soon though, the pace shifts, changing from loud, thrashing material to swinging drum beats in the vein of Bathory\u2019s Viking works. Things to seem to slow down even more towards the middle of the song as the mood and atmosphere appear to become more epic, despite the song only being roughly 5 minutes long. Hey, there goes another pace change! Back to the groove/thrash riffing that was present on Paragon Belial. Oh boy, the band really knows how to make good Metal, don\u2019t they? There\u2019s also some pretty interesting riffs towards the end, or shall I say\u2026melodic? Yes, even a grim, cold and harsh album such as this has its melodic moments, although they\u2019re quite rare.\n\nThe record comes to an end with The Pagan Winter; a solid, angry thrasher, spewing forth rapid amounts of blast beats and double bass in the beginning, yet slowing down a bit during the middle, blasting a fair amount of semi-melodic riffs. Overall, the majority of this song is quite aggressive, yet still has its epic, Viking-era Bathory moments as well. Another one of the band\u2019s best songs, overall. The entire track length is roughly six and a half minutes long, but the music tends to stop around the five minute mark. This is because the album\u2019s ending consists of an outro that\u2019s just like the album intro. Dark and evil chats with a voice that\u2019s whispering some jibberish stuff that I cannot understand. But oh well, I think it was a great choice for the band to add an outro like this. Seems more like a tribute to Bathory than anything, since it\u2019s almost identical to the outros that are featured on the first four Bathory LPs.\n\n\nSo yes, this was a MAJOR change in direction from Soulside Journey. If you like your Metal to be precise, accurate and full of complexity, then stay away from this. You might be able to appreciate this for what it is if you can get past the low-fi production and overall cold, harsh sound. I mean, even the casual Death Metal fan may like this. But I\u2019m warning you, if Soulside Journey was the first Darkthrone album you heard and if you enjoyed it, then approach this release with caution, because this just doesn\u2019t seem like the same band at all.\n",
        "\nLet\u2019s get one thing straight here; The material on this album isn\u2019t the Darkthrone that we all know and love, yet that statement isn\u2019t an implication that this album is necessarily a bad debut. Instead of the harsh, raw and cold Black Metal that the Metal scene has grown to recognize Darkthrone for, Soulside Journey is at the opposite end of the extreme Metal scale. There\u2019s no cold or harsh atmosphere to be found here and the musicianship is highly complexed and technical, which is the COMPLETE opposite of the way the later Darkthrone albums would sound. For those people who claim that Fenriz and Nocturno Culto are bad, lame and/or sloppy musicians who can\u2019t play their instruments, I strongly suggest that they REALLY check this album out. Despite the band hailing from Norway, the sound on this album sounds very Swedish, much similar to early Entombed, Grave, Unleashed and Dismember. After all, the album was recorded in a Swedish studio that was shared with the members of Entombed at the time. Darkthrone\u2019s Soulside Journey is probably the most atmospheric Death Metal album I have ever heard. Even Grave and Entombed had more brutality than this, but I\u2019m not saying that as a bad thing. The complexity and atmosphere adds such a uniqueness to the album that little or no Death Metal bands have ever been able to mimic. As for the production\u2026well, it\u2019s there, which is a surprise, considering that this is Darkthrone we\u2019re talking about. As a matter of fact, the production here is crystal clear, allowing every instrument to be deciphered while still maintaining a dark and sludgy sound to everything. The bass and drums seem to have this technical jazz influence to them, though not to the extent that bands like Atheist had. The riffs are all down tuned, and the vocals are a low, mediocre growl instead of the high pitched, raspy shrieks that Nocturno Culto uses on the later Darkthrone releases. \n\nThe opening track, Cromlech is one of the best, if not, THE best track on the whole album. What starts out with a dark and moody hymn, leads right into a double bass and riff assault while still maintaining total complexity. The use of triggers on the drums are presented almost through out this entire song (and album as well), sustaining the speed at a constant pace; nothing overally fast, yet still providing something great to headbang to. There are also some incredible, highly atmospheric Doom Metal breaks during several parts of the track, as well as some killer Thrash Metal assaults, showing that Darkthrone had indeed taken their extreme Metal influence from the 80s onto a whole new level. The majority of the next track, Sunrise Over Locus Mortis, is very Doom based, yet the Thrash outbreaks are still quite present, particularly during the middle of the song. As for the riffs, well\u2026they\u2019re at a constant change. Like I stated many times so far, this album is complexed, technical Death Metal, and although the jazz influenced bass and drumming have much to do with that factor, the riffs really top it all off. This isn\u2019t just guitar wankery either. This truly is some great guitar work.\n\nThe album\u2019s title track is a relatively doomy number, coming off as one of the heaviest tracks on the record. Just check out that amazing riffing there! Sounds like an ode to Candlemass or early Sabbath to me. This just goes to show the diversity of Darkthrone during this era. However, this song doesn\u2019t fail to also thrash things up as well. Accumulation Of Generalization is also a really nice instrumental. Pointless? Kind of\u2026there\u2019s nothing to be found here that won\u2019t be found on the rest of the album, aside from a few random growls. Good track, needless to say though. Neptune Towers is very much like the title track since it consists highly of Doom inspired riffing that sets a quite darkly mood upon the listener, although much of the song still manages to thrash things up quite a bit. And just check out those church organ keyboards during the mid segment of the track. They give off quite a\u2026shall I say\u2026dark vibe? Okay, that\u2019s such an understatement, but whatever\u2026\n\nSempiternal Sepulchrality is one major thrasher! Yes, this track is by far the most aggressive and thrashiest on the whole entire album. I mean, just look at the title. An ode to Sepultura? Or perhaps Sodom? Sodom has a song called Sepulchral Voices on their In The Sign Of Evil EP. After all, Darkthrone claims to be inspired by the early works of both bands. I think the best thing about this song though are the riffs. Despite the majority of the album relying more on atmosphere and melody, the riffs here absolutely kill! In a way, they kind of remind me of Sepultura\u2019s Beneath The Remains album, and if you\u2019ve heard that record, you\u2019ll know damn well what I\u2019m talking about. That one\u2019s a fucking riff fest! A Grave With A View is yet nother Doom inspired track. Dark and heavy as hell, and if that\u2019s not enough to bring forth an atmosphere of darkness and despair, some of the track\u2019s doom breaks are underlined with eerie chants. Just like most of the songs on the this record, this track does have its thrash breaks as well, but it\u2019s nothing compared to the previous song.\n\nThe next track, Iconoclasm Sweeps Cappadocia consists of some strange, yet highly unique bass work. Let me just say this; Dag Nilsen is a MASTER at great bass work. It\u2019s no wonder he chose to leave the band after Darkthrone decided to acquire a more primitive, simplistic style of Metal. You\u2019ll really have to hear this bass work for yourself to understand what I mean. As for the song itself, well\u2026it\u2019s just another great slab of technical Death Metal, much like every other song on this record. There aren\u2019t many thrashy moments to be found on this one though. Nor The Silent Whispers is much in the vein of the previous song. It\u2019s basically is no frills, non-thrashy technical Death Metal at its finest, yet along with the title track and Neptune Towers, it does have much doomier moments than the rest of the album. You know, there weren\u2019t many bands back then that mixed Doom Metal with Death Metal, with the exception of Autopsy, of course. I know that Fenriz is a huge fan of Autopsy, so its no wonder why there are plenty of Doom inspired riffs on Soulside Journey. \n\nThe Watchtower, once again, manages to thrash things up a bit more, much in the vein of Sempiternal Sepulchrality. Of course, this particular song is much less impressive than the latter, while managing to stray away from filler territory. It\u2019s just that by the time the listener is this far into the record, a track like The Watchtower offers nothing special. The last track on the album, Eon, is another instrumental that is far more impressive than Accumulation Of Generalization, which is the only other instrumental song on the album. The main difference? The dark, melodic chants in the background. They really give off an incredible atmosphere to it all. Not to mention that the riffs are far better as well.\n\n\nFor those of you who can\u2019t stand Darkthrone\u2019s later works, I strongly suggest that you check this album out. Like I stated earlier, Soulside Journey is at the opposite end of the extreme Metal scale when compared to other Darkthrone albums like Under A Funeral Moon, Transylvanian Hunger, Panzerfaust or even A Blaze In The Northern Sky. It\u2019s not raw, it\u2019s not grim or cold, it sure as hell isn\u2019t primative and it isn\u2019t extreme in the sense that you need an acquired taste to get into it. Even those of you who can\u2019t stand Death Metal might even like this. Who knows, just check it out for yourself.\n",
        "\nThe first thing I noticed was that this new album once more comes in a great looking packaging. The regular album version comes in a slipcase package while the limited edition box comes in a cardboard box with an additional poster and video clip for the single \"Too old too cold\". The lay-out has once more been done by Trine & Kim and just like with the \"Too old too cold\" single also on \"The cult is alive\" they have once more delivered a marvellous job suiting Darkthrone's image just fine.\n\nBut, as always, it is the music which matters most. On \"Too old too cold\" Darkthrone showed a musical style which headed more into dark punk rock. Still the music was typically Darkthrone with the many Celtic Frost references. Yet the band dared to move a bit more into punk rock as well, a musical style where Darkthrone also has got their musical roots. On \"The cult is alive\" the same musical direction as on the single can be found and the new album displays a great mixture of traditional Darkthrone black metal with dark punk rock with on top some occasional chaotic guitar solos. These slight new 'influences' enrich Darkthrone's music a lot as well as makes the 'red line' throughout the whole album much more obvious. Because of the many variations in songwriting \"The cult is alive\" stays interesting the complete 39 minutes and I unconsciously push the repeat-button from my CD-player again and again. This album really is like a drug. After the first listen it immediately becomes addicting and you'll crave to hear more, again and again and again. The single title-track \"Too old too cold\" can be found as well on \"The cult is alive\" just as the brilliant \"Graveyard slut\". Biggest difference though is that on the single Nocturno Culto does the vocals while on the album version Fenriz does the vocals. Mentioning any further seperate songs in this review isn't necessary simply because the complete album is damn good. The quality in songs remains high throughout the whole album and I think \"The cult is alive\" definitely belongs to Darkthrone's best albums ever.\n\nAs always the die-hard purists claim that Darkthrone lost their credibility because Darkthrone never have come up with \"Transilvanian hunger part 2\". With including a bit more dark punk rock influences in the furthermore well-known Darkthrone sound these purists will now stand even stronger behind their, to me narrow-minded, beliefs. All I can say is; ignore such morons and instead take a listen at \"The cult is alive\" and let the album grab you by the balls. Just like it grabbed me by the balls. \"The cult is alive\" shows that the cult named Darkthrone still is alive. Alive and just as strong as ever!!!\n",
        "\nHooray, another Darkthrone album. Either you love this band, or you\u2019re a fag. There\u2019s no middle ground. The Cult is Alive takes the raw, punky approach of the last album Sardonic Wrath and slows it down to a more relaxed rock\u2018n\u2019roll pace, injected a lot more expression in the guitar department (half these songs have jamming, almost bluesy solo sections), and a whole lot of extra grim rawness. Thus, it moves even further away from the expectations most people would have for a Darkthrone disc, while remaining completely true to their trademark attitude. \n\nThe first single \u201cToo Old Too Cold\u201d is actually a fairly good representation of the whole album. The weird song here is \u201cGraveyard Slut\u201d, where Fenriz provides a surprisingly clean vocal approach while the song itself is pure blackened swagger. Elsewhere, \u201cShut Up\u201d is amusingly aggressive and \u201cWhisky Funeral\u201d just flat-out rocks. They seem to have gone back to the good old \u201c4 tracker in the rehearsal room\u201d approach to recording too, which gives the album a very abraded, rough sound \u2013 it\u2019s certainly much cleaner than, say, Transilvanian Hunger or Under A Funeral Moon, but also has a significantly thinner sound than the last few discs. \n\nIf you\u2019re expecting a return to the \u201cTrilogy\u201d and won\u2019t settle for anything else, don\u2019t bother with this. If you liked Hate Them and Sardonic Wrath, this is also worth investment. It\u2019s a grim, catchy, sometimes punky album which absolutely reeks of attitude and irreverence. In other words, pure Darkthrone.\n",
        "\nI am really tired of Darkthrone. If I weren't told that this album was different, I wouldn't care nor listen to it. However, I did, but I'm still tired the same as before. \"The Cult is Alive\" is another example of how a great black metal classic can't find its way after 20 years of playing. Now, the band switched to some rockandrollish whatever not caring about the music itself. It seems that any change in Darkthrone's style is so big event, that nothing more is important.\n\n\"The Cult is Alive\" contains 10 songs. All of them sound the same, but it's quite normal for Darkthrone lately. The riffs are the same, all that really got changed is the rhythm and general sound - both turned more to rock and roll, punk or something like this. The lyrics are different, either - now they are three times more stupid than before. All would be fine, if the songs were good. Unfortunately, they are not, they're just mediocre. I can remember one or two riffs from the whole album and they aren't even good. \n\nI'm not saying this is a bad album. But I'm not saying that it is good, either. It may be a pleasant background for beer adventures, but generally there's no possible way to enjoy \"The Cult is Alive\" itself. Darkthrone is dead, I hope that at least Nocturno and Fenriz enjoy the music.\n",
        "\nIt's very hard to objectively review a band that you consider one of your all-time favourites. Moreover, I like ALL Darkthrone albums, so if you are a \"metal purist\" (which I'm definitely NOT) you might as well skip reading this article.\n\nFenriz once said : \"Well, Nocturno Culto always says it's going to be different, but when we go and rehearse it, and when we go to the studio and record it, I think it usually sounds like the same album all over... And I'm perfectly happy with that!\"; this can be in general said about this album as well. In my opinion, from 1991 on, their releases have had basically the same influences, even chords/music to some extent, but the overall atmosphere was different on each of them.\n\nFor a start, let's face it-the key influences on Darkthorne, namely Celtic Frost/Hellhammer, Venom and Bathory owe to early punk/hardcore as much as they do to hardrock and classic metal. The proof of it can even be found in today's so-called \"crust\" bands which are too numerous to even mention. If there wasn't for the punkrock's ugly head, black metal or any form of extreme music would't even exist; Darkthrone understood this from the start and their attitude was metaphorically speaking \"punk\" within black metal-take their classic \"Transilvanian Hunger\" (LP) for example : underwater production, stripped-down repetative three-chord riffing and ugly shouted vocals in a distant point recall more on the Sex Pistols than Iron Maiden (which, ironically, started off as a punkrock band). In 1982 Lemmy of Motorhead said in one of the interviews something like this : \"If you play The Damned, The Adverts and then Motorhead, you'll probably say that it's just another punk band\"-regardless of what he thought whilst labelling his band \"rock'n'roll\", this statement is pretty much accurate, and since they had an enormous influence on punk as well as metal, esp. Venom and consequently Celtic Frost and Bathory, it could be applied to these bands also. Another thing relating black metal and punk was the spirit of rebellion, although it's strength was channelled against different authorities-religious/false moral in the first case, and political in the second.\n\nHaving this in mind, I'll try to point out what's new and what's old on the new Darkthrone album : the distorted \"primitive\" production doesn't really differ much from their previous albums, the harsh and ugly vocals are there still being one of the best in (black) metal ever, i.e. not sounding like a deranged witch and/or demonized alien repltile; on the other hand, there's more punchline in the riffs and the drums pace is somewhat \"slower\", similar to the first Venom album. The songs are rather short (3-4.5 minutes), almost pop-structured, and that works out almost perfectly. The lyrics are a bit of a weaker point as they are way too basic, but still darkly humorous and ironic. I'd dare to say this was done deliberately in order to sound even more distant from the bands who call themselves black metal nowadays.\n\nSo, if you call this punk/crust, then it is; who cares, because obviously they don't. One thing's for sure, they got bored of current black metal scene and quite rightly so in my opinion-like with REAL punkrock or grindcore or alternative music and/or any other strongly influential musical direction, the days of true black metal are way behind us. I do regret to say this VERY MUCH but I think they are right..... Darkthrone did what they did in \"those\" days-created at least three out of top ten most cloned records in black metal history, which practically invented all those \"tr00 necro\" bands. On the other hand, it is obvious that they didn't see any point in repeating themselves for another million times. They just got bored, and I think I'd do too if I had a band as influential as theirs. \n\nI've always regarded black metal as an enemy of everything gentle, nice and subtle, or, to put it as an anti-thesis to one Mozart statement, a music that should \"insult your ears\"; it was never meant to be melodic and/or polished. To be more specific, I fully respect their (in my opinion slight) change in musical/lyrical direction; even if this record is more influenced by (true) punk (of course not the modern Green Day crap), this is a shift to another underground old-school style. In fact, their last three albums are among the finest amalgams of the sort.\n",
        "\nYet another \"ignore the hype\" record, this is not a fucking Discharge album as everyone either hopes or fears it. In fact, the only punkish songs are the ones that were on the EP, and really, they arent that punkish . Unless by punkish you mean Motorhead. That's really the biggest influence on here, well, other than Hellhammer and Celtic Frost that is. Really, this is only slightly less heavy than Panzerfaust or A Blaze in The Northern Sky. \n\nI really shouldn't say ignore they hype, because, this is most certainly a record worth paying attention too. Yes, there is a bit of a change of direction on here, but really, its nothing that warrants either the hype over it, be it the kids getting all excited or those getting bent out of shape. The riffs are still deathish black metal. No tremolos though. Fenriz's drumming is as sludgy and heavy as ever. Nocturno Culto's vocals are upped a notch on the vehemenence level. They are more discernable then on during their glory years, but really, nothing new. In the Darkthrone camp, nothing new is something good.\n\nThere are two different styles on this disc, so this is the only caveat. The songs \"Graveyard Slut\", \"Too old, too Cold\" and \"Whiskey Funeral\" have that Moterhead vibe I was talking about. They might annoy some, I personally like them, but wish they werent on this album. The rest of the songs, just bleed Darkthrone and intolerance. The overall style is, surprise surprise, very tyrranical. I would say this is the attitude that Craft wishes they had. No tolerance, and even now not much fun.\n\nStand out tracks; Cult of Goliath, this sets the stage nicely, a bit of a motorheadish/punky intro, but once Nocturno Culto starts rasping away \"666\" you know this is no-holds barred Darkthrone. Atomic Coming, the vocals on this really stand out, thicken up the guitars and this song is on ABITNS. Shut Up, this song is musical despotism and a middle finger to all their old comrades and new imposters to the black metal throne. Forebyggende Krig, this reminds us once and for all, Darkthrone represents musical repression. Cold and ugly. I give this 9/10, despite the couple out of place tracks. Hails.\n",
        "\nI really didn''t dislike at all this album, but there is something missed here. We can recognize Nocturno Culto's voice, it's raw and noisy and the album production it's obviously \"bad\"; seems like we are listening the music through a metal cone, in my opinion they went too far.\n\nPointless to review each song, cause of all them sounds kind of the same, maybe would be easier to divide them into: \"bad ones\" and not \"that bad\".\n\nLet's make it fast and let's help to some people to save some money. \n\nAs I said, it's not really a bad album cause some tracks are really catchy and I think that it's caused to the strong punk influence on it and this is a majour change on the band; isn't just a \"bad\" album but another direction on their sound. \n\nAnd with this new sound they sound sometimes a bit childish, a bit funnny and you can't take seriously this album. This album is to get some fun, drink at your favourite bachelor party and to \"impress\" to your friends letting them know how \"bad\" you are.\n\n\"Underdogs And Overlords\" it's from the \"not that bad\" tracks, and it's really into the \"old\" Darkthrone. Graveyard Slut\" introduce us to Fenriz singing (wow :| ) and this is from the \"bad ones\", just take your favourite punk band, tune up your guitars into a black metal style and try to be funny on the lyrics in a dark way, and you may have a very close idea about this track (and the whole album).\n\nAlmost all of us listened before at the \"Too Old Too Cold\" track, and well, if you liked that one you may think seriously in to go and buy the album, cause that song is the worse one, so the rest of the album will be \"cult\" for you. Ridiculous and nonsense lyrics. \n\n\"Tyster P\u00e5 Gud\" and \"De Underjordiske (Aelia Capitolina)\" are more from the \"not that bad\" the rest, as you may imagine, belongs to the \"bad ones\".\n\nAnd at the end, if you wanna be just simple and plain, there is not a real bad or good song in this album, it just looks so flat and pointless but at the same time you can't say that it's shit (only if you are a hard Black Metal and Darkthrone fan).\n\nTake advantage if someone else buy this album, listen it at his/her house and when you feel like listen to it again, go and pay another visit to that friend, otherwise, if you liked to listen to Nocturno Culto singing:\n\n\"Yeah, we're old.\"\n\"Yeah, we're cold.\"\n\"Alright. St. Black Anger, there you go!\"\n\nand you were headbanging and smiling nervously, as I said: go and buy the album.\n",
        "\nExcellent first single from these conservative old school freaks! \"Nothing to prove\", my ass. Of course Fenriz and Culto prove again that flutes and synths are not their way of expression, but only crushing raw riffs, necro pounding and dictator vocals, spreading the curse to all fakeness. And that's what \"Too Old, Too Cold\" is filled with, indeed. The self-titled track has the great touch of old 80's crust punk bands like Discharge, Anti-Cimex, Riistetyt, Svart Parad, Amebix etc., and combined with the \"tired-of-all-modern-shit\" verses by Fenriz, it sounds like a real bomb at the centre of nowaday's scene. \"High On Cold War\" begins as a classic (ha!) punk riff and murderous solo by Culto, but when he and Grutle (from Enslaved) both start to shout insanely, you know that this definitely ain't Dimmu Borgir. Also excellent lyrics. The cover version of Siouxsie And The Banshees is incredible masterpiece - all those perverted \"singing\" and real PRESENCE of attitude! The fourth track - \"Graveyard Slut\" is another iron punkfist, reminding very much of Chris Reifert's Abscess and the good old Deathstrike. Here Nocturno Culto performs another nerves-cutting solo. \nThis single is total masterpiece - a masterpiece of regression and homage to the roots of old school black metal. \"Depends on who's listening\", wrote Culto, and that's the key to understand this act, made by Darkthrone. Once they negated the commercialism of death metal and turned back to 80's spirit of harsh black metal. Now they say \"fuck off\" to commercial theatric \"black metal\" and go backwards again - to the very depths of chaos and nihilism in rock (anti)music - the PUNK. They started it in \"Hate Them\", and now they finish their unholy deed. Too rusty, too crusty for the new wannabies, too old and too cold to deal with \"kvlt\" avantguardism and other keyboard crap. \nNothing to prove, just a HELLISH rock'n'roll freaks! All hail to them! \n\n(I give 98% because Fenriz once stated, that doing cover versions is some fucked up thing... He went wrong. But damn, who cares at all??! he does cover versions the way they should be done - GREAT!)\n",
        "\nI am sure that this is not going to be one of my personal most listened albums. Compared to this shit, Plaguewielder was the greatest masterpiece recorded ever, what should we say about Transylvanian Hunger, Under A Funeral Moon and the others...?\nI really don't know, what the fuck were Fenriz & Nocturno thinking at when recording this?\n\"Yeah, we're old.\"\n\"Yeah, we're cold.\"\n\"Alright. St. Black Anger, there you go!\"\nNo black metal to be found here. Absolutely none, null, zero. Too Old, Too Cold starts with a pretty fast Hellhammer reminding awful punkish speedy blasting and slows down the crap in the second part, with Nocturno screaming that fucking line:\"Too old! Too cold!\". The riffs have a pure punkish tone, Sex Pistols of black metal, or The Dwarves of black metal, take it as you want. High On Cold War was the best on this, with some screaming nice solos and a good old rocking riff. Fenriz starts with a heavy metal beat, then turns the beat to a part like the more punkish stuff on A Blaze In The Northern Sky. I liked also the vocals in general, raspy and very agressive for an old quasi-kvlt-gone-ass band. Love In A Void and da Graveyard Slut were the same crap, punky anthems, meaning a cover of a bullshit band with shitty clean vocals (Rammstein with dynamite in their asses) and a primitive pointless noisy track with the title in the refrain (Graveyard Sluutt!). The percussion was the weakest of the weakest, none of Fenriz' blastbeats that I loved so much were present here. Fuck it.\nI give this 10 percent for the vocal performance (except Dick In A Void), and 1 percent for Graveyard Slut. You know, I am Romanian and in my country jokes with graveyard bitches are very tasty and popular.\n",
        "\nFirst of all let me start by a huge laugh from the depths of my heart:\n\nHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!\n\nNow let me explain what this was all about. Let me explain, in some kind of way, how it is possible for me to take back everything indecent I said towards Darkthrone and finally respect them like there is no other. But above all, let me explain about the huge leap that a band has to do to prove their worth; they kind of leap that this band was always capable of but all so scared to do.\n\nToo Old, Too Cold, above all, is pure black metal. It's not black metal like the kind of thing that you expect the youngster kvlt kids to play, no sir. This is black metal played by pioneers and directed at those who can pay attention. It's black metal with a formed opinion, black metal that is rectifying the mistakes of the old, the yound and unnecessary mixture of wrong ideals and directions. In a retrospect, it is real black metal because it is there to destroy everything that you held holy or as a standard and take you down with it.\n\nIf you like bands like Ancient of God Loves The Dead, Carpathian Forest in Black Shining Leather, Necromantia in Scarlet Evil Witchin Black or even Satyricon in Rebel Extravaganza then you know exactly what to expect. Although Too Old, Too Cold will probably exceed your wildest expectations, as it manages to stand by those releases as a proud brother and in some ways exceed them.\n\nIf you believe that black metal is old Darkthrone, old Mayhem or whatever else in that direction, it is about time to wake up and realize what is going on. How black metal was never meant to be a one-off slap in the industry of music. How there just needed to be a second coming; a better one I must add, to achieve anything. If you are not one of those kids, for whom I could barely even care to be quite honest, then listen to this and you will agree with me.\n\nMusically, everything is played from two different perspectives. For Darkthrone's standards, this is technical as hell. Hell, even for all the bands mentioned above, this is still technical as hell. But at the same time, everything is old school, sending down that warm (or is it cold? HA!) old feeling of bands like AC/DC, Motorhead, Hellhammer and the good old punk of the 70s. The playing is spot on, with some of the best riffs you are going to listen to and the vocals are simply perfect. Further proof that Nocturno Culto is up there with Nattefrost, Lord Kaiaphas and Isahn in terms of vocals. The single contains three tracks, along with the necessary (and amazing I might say) cover chosen to demonstrate the new sound of the band very carefully. I won't say much more on that; just listen and find out for yourself what this band is!\n\nI have been constantly bashing Darkthrone. I think Transylvanian Hunger is a joke. But they showed some sincere signs of being a band much better than I could think with Hate Them and Sardonic Wrath. And while those releases were very solid and almost up to par with Ablaze In The Northern Sky, there was still something missing. It was the proof that Darkthrone can be something beyond good lyrics, a hateful feeling and an old attempt to remain \"cult\".\n\nI would have never thought that they would decide to change in such a way. They proved that what was missing, was balls; and I can finally say that this is all the proof people like me needed to realize that Darkthrone have balls. Balls to write good music. Balls to write real metal. Balls to admit that they have nothing to prove. Balls to admit that all those who call the crap they are listing to \"Black Meta\" are lame. Balls to go back to the real roots of genre and play Punk/Thrash with passion.\n\nAnd above all, balls to take a bold direction towards the sound they were always born to play. Which is that sound that's too old, too cold, and the sound that nobody can ever forget; if they know what real metal is all about.\n\nI am anticipating The Cult Is Alive, and it will be album of the year. Of that I am sure of. Hats of to Darkthrone.\n",
        "\nProduction: Rough, but has the feel of a giant throwing you through the dark excitement of battle.\n\n\"En Vind av Sorg\" picks up right where \"Transilvanian Hunger\" left off; and it is one of the most mystical, enchanting, intriguing, other worldly songs this reviewer has ever heard. One may get the feeling of standing in a forest, arms outstretched, while everything whips around you; your body and soul channeling the energy of the universe while being in awe of the surreal aspects of creation.\n\nWith \"Triumphant Gleam\" and \"The Hordes of Nebulah\" the album switches gears, taking on a very strong Celtic Frost influence, executing it with perfection. \"Triumphant Gleam\" is what I envision as a war parade of victory, but unlike the happy, confetti, float filled victory parties of WWII, this parade celebrates the victors as they crush any possible on-lookers. \"The Hordes of Nebulah\" is like a mud stomp through hell; filled with a confidence that must be similar to what immortality feels like. The album as a whole switches back and forth between mystical surrealism and in-your-face battle cries.\n\nInstruments here are played with a combination of minimal yet aggressive phrases; distorted guitar crunch, but overall expanded into a space of giant sound. The random use of unpredictable lead guitar adds a tone of sinister viciousness, showing how these songs can evolve into a romantic influenced aura of structure; while staying grounded in a dual use of style.\n\nDrums compliment rhythms in an almost mocking style; whether it be held back, snail's paced beats, or a horse stomp-trotting through a war zone. Fenriz shows again his mastery of drumming skill; using the constant thread of the high hat to sew everything together.\n\nChills cover the listener as Darkthrone shows brilliance in its ability to deliver dark melody and rhythms that many have imitated in black metal ever since.\n\nThis album marks the end of an era for Darkthrone; they have yet to achieve on any following release the darkness, power, and authority that they established on their first four black metal albums. That being said, they succeeded with those four releases what other bands can only dream of.\n",
        "\nProduction: Emphasis on guitars and vocals; drums almost drowned in mix while bass is audible but not overbearing.\n\nGenre` defining album that, along with \"Transilvanian Hunger\", established Darkthrone as one of the most influential bands in black metal history. There is little doubt that this album alone sparked the creation of countless copy-cat bands that continues to this day. There is so much magic and energy in this release that it naturally motivates people to want to be this amazing. It is after this album's release(not initially though; it was mocked and hated when first released) that so many musicians said, \"I want to be like this\".\n\nStripping away all finesse and going straight for the throat, Darkthrone abandons all acknowledgement that nothing other than a nihilistic approach matters when making music in today's world. With \"A Blaze in the Northern Sky\" they boldly stepped out of the box; with \"Under a Funeral Moon\" Darkthrone blazed again, even more so in creating a new path that so many others have tried to follow.\n\nGuitars are pushed to the front, with every song formed around minimalist motif riffs. Atonal aggression is expressed through a super quick picking technique that occasionally slows down to catch it's breath. Guitar tone is flavored with a vibrant, harsh, buzz saw sound that is fueled by adrenalin.\n\nVocals are just as harsh, and in many ways just as buzz saw sounding as the guitars. The difference is the vocals come across as more rhythmic than the melodies of the guitar motifs. Both though put an exclamation point on the emphasis of highly motivated evil.\n\nFenriz puts to use his now signature drumming style; blasting away in the background, cleverly forcing each song to run straight ahead, no matter what the melodies are doing, although at times the melodies do run faster than the rhythms. The point is this: drumming here is not ego driven flair and showmanship; it is a tool used to make the song better achieve it's goal of supremacy and annihilation of the weak.\n\nAt the time of this album's creation, the interaction between the drums and guitars expressed here was so very unique. Never before had such a talented metal drummer put his skills into promoting the importance of the melodies, forcing the riffs to dominate the structure and direction of each song. \n\nBass is not made to dominant, and never has with Darkthrone, but with this album it is important to note how it gives each melody extra force with it's distorted lower end frequencies.\n\nDarkthrone had such a drive, an ambition to take this concept of black metal and utilize it for no other reason than to piss on every single thing that the music community considered untouchable, and to cast aside the crowd so something genuine with real thought could return to metal.\n\nAll in all this album is flawless. Even with the focus on speed, there are enough breakdowns and tempo changes to keep this work interesting from beginning to end. This extremely intense piece of art shows how Darkthrone became one of a small group of trailblazers that created a new aesthetic and approach to music that hadn't really been seen before. A masterpiece that tops most masterpieces, and one of the most influential albums in all black metal.\n",
        "\nI\u2019m going to be blunt with you right now, straight out; Plaguewielder sucks ass. Well, at least the majority of this album does. It seriously sounds like nothing more than half assed Satyricon without the folk and medieval influences in the music or even like Dimmu Borgir without the keyboards. This is the shit that modern, new wave \u201cblack metal\u201d bands are made of. Before I even gave a listen to this album, I heard many complaints about it, even from the most die-hard Darkthrone fans. I heard that \u201cit isn\u2019t raw\u201d or \u201cit doesn\u2019t sound like the traditional, old-school black metal that Darkthrone usually play\u201d. My first thoughts were \u201cWow, I have to check this out. Can Darkthrone really sound that bad without their usual raw production? People need to quit whining just because a band experiments a little\u201d.\n\nWell okay, so there is a far more decent, yet horribly average production job on this album, but that isn\u2019t the real issue here, at least not for me. The REAL problem is the song-writing that\u2019s used for this record, for where there are areas of decency on the album, the majority of the song writing just lacks. The production itself isn\u2019t exactly slick and clear, but when compared to what Darkthrone has released before, there is indeed an overall \u201cclearer\u201d sound to the album. The song structures themselves are far less minimal and even a bit more complexed at times. The riffs can all be deciphered, yet, there are moments on the album where Darkthrone attempts to be their traditional selves again. It\u2019s like they couldn\u2019t decide what the fuck they wanted to release. Were they going for another Total Death/Ravishing Grimness type record or for another Soulside Journey sounding release? Seriously, if they\u2019re going to make an attempt at technicality and clear production, then they should just use the best of their skills by going full-out with their ideas and releasing another Soulside Journey album or at least some kind of technical, Death Metal release, because the shit on this album sounds like nothing more than average, sub-par modern \u201cblack metal\u201d without the usual elements that bands like Dimmu and Cradle of Filth add to their music. \n\nThere are only two or three decent tracks on this album, yet even by Darkthrone standards, those songs are merely nothing short of decent Black Metal with serious potential that lacks in all aspects of the music. I won\u2019t bother wasting my time on elaborate descriptions of the songs. This time around, they\u2019re going to be a bit more brief and to the point, because while this album isn\u2019t horrible, it isn\u2019t good either, meaning that I pretty much pointed out all of the bad aspects of the music already. In other words, I can\u2019t complain much more about it nor can I praise it. It\u2019s just a boring, sub-par album from a great band; plain and simple. \n\n\n\n1. Weakling Avenger - For such a cool song title, this song ranks as being one of the worst on the album. It begins with some eerie, raspy croaks, sounding as if someone or something was dying in the studio during the time this song was being recorded. The song itself is nothing but a half-assed rehash of Darkthrone\u2019s older material played at a mid-paced, very similar to Ravishing Grimness, yet overall more mediocre in sound. It seems like Nocturno Culto is attempting to make interesting riffs that vary, yet fails. Fenriz attempts his usual rapid blast beats done with a slicker production job, meaning that the outcome is going to be really shitty and mediocre. Why is this? Because his drumming used to be one of the important elements in Darkthrone\u2019s raw, minimal sound. Mixing it in perfectly with the rest of the instruments was really a bad idea.\n\n2. Raining Murder - Aside from the few rather interesting, yet slightly mediocre riffs during the middle of this track, the remainder of it is even shittier than the opening song. Same fucking problems, same damn structural technnique in the both the riffs and the drum work. By now, the album already almost bored to death.\n\n3. Sin Origin - Here\u2019s one of the two or three decent songs on this album. Of all the tracks on here, this one is the most \u201cold-school\u201d sounding, coming off as another thrashy/punk-ish Black Metal tune that wouldn\u2019t have been out of place on Ravishing Grimness. With that being said, even if it were to be placed on that album instead, it would still be a filler track because it sounds so damn average and mediocre. But on here\u2026it\u2019s one of the album\u2019s best tracks.\n\n4. Command - I honestly don\u2019t know what to think of this song. Part of it thrashes pretty fucking well, while in other segments, I feel like I\u2019m going to die of boredom from listening to something so uninspired. It\u2019s like\u2026half kick ass Black Metal in the old Darkthrone vein and half shit that consists of rapid blast beats and shitty, sub-par riffs that so many nowadays \u201cblack metal\u201d bands use. Hey, I guess this song could be worse, but I can still care less for it.\n\n5. I, Voidhanger - This really has to be the best song on the album. While it contains its crappy parts as well, there enough classic Darkthrone elements to be found here. In think that this beats most shit on Ravishing Grimness, by the way. Now why the fuck couldn\u2019t the rest of the album be like this? This is more of a reminisce of Panzerfaust without the Celtic Frost-esque riffing. In other words, the guitar strings aren\u2019t played as openly here as on most other Darkthrone material. Instead, they have a certain thickness and heaviness to them that goes really well with the production of this album. Sadly, that means that this record had much potential, as I stated earlier above. The band just chose not to use that potential.\n\n6. Wreak - The last track on the album is WAY too damn long for its own good. It\u2019s the second longest Darkthrone song ever composed next to Kathaarian Life Code off A Blaze In The Northern Sky. At least Kathaarian Life Code is nothing short of amazing. This song, however, is not. It\u2019s nothing bad, but it just isn\u2019t Darkthrone quality material. I\u2019d probably rank this as one of the better tracks off the album if it wasn\u2019t so damn long! It just isn\u2019t that good to span over 9 minutes without me growing tired of it towards the end. Musically, this is everything that one would expect from Darkthrone. It\u2019s one of the rawest tracks on here next to Sin Origin, but needless to say, it still isn\u2019t that great. Sure, it has the traditional Darkthrone rawness, thrashing, coldness, aggression and trademark tremolo picking, but it ceases to be the aggressive, epic masterpiece that Kathaarian Life Code Is. This song is enjoyed much better if it\u2019s listened to individually without hearing the rest of the album. You won\u2019t grow bored of it so quickly that way. \n\n\n\nWhile not COMPETELY horrible, Plaguewielder stands a major disappointment when one considers what Darkthrone are really capable of. Oh, and I forgot to talk about the album cover. For once, Darkthrone has added COLOR to their artwork! And when I say color, I really mean color. The album\u2019s art work comes off as some sort of abstract painting. It\u2019s very different in the sense that this is Darkthrone, but it looks pretty damn cool either way, especially the band\u2019s blood-red logo. Now, if only the album itself was as good as its cover art, then this would definitely have been a good release. By the way, the best art work on a Darkthrone album goes to Total Death!\n",
        "\n2003\u2019s Hate Them showed Darkthrone SLIGHTLY returning to their rawer, more minimalistic and aggressive roots after a rather disappointing release in 2001 called Plaguewielder. Either way, this album is still a rare listen for me. It\u2019s either that, or just a few songs that I\u2019ll listen to individually off the album. Let\u2019s face it. Darkthrone remains only a shadow of what and who they used to be. And no, I\u2019m not referring to the band\u2019s image. Sure, it was more interesting to see them in their flamboyant, black and white photos wearing corpse paint, leather, inverted crosses, spikes and bullet belts, but it doesn\u2019t take an image like that to make good and interesting music. Just as their image got watered down into a more \u201cnormal\u201d approach, so did their music, and everyone saw that change in direction once the band reformed and released Ravishing Grimness in 1999. Hate Them is merely just an old-school punkish sounding Thrash album with the classic Black Metal influences not as present as on the band\u2019s earlier releases. Fuck, the band was at one point true, Unholy, 100%, no frills Black Metal! Not this time though. That\u2019s not to say that the music is bad, but I have to be in the right mood in order to hear it. Then again, if I\u2019m in the mood for something like this, then I\u2019ll just stick to the classics like Hellhammer, Mot\u00f6rhead, Venom and Bulldozer. Compared to those bands, whom were the main inspirations to Darkthrone, Hate Them is nothing more than good background music to listen to\u2026well, most of the time. Anyway, on with the song by song review now.\n\n\n\n1. Rust - The weird sound effects in the beginning of this song were done by a guy called Lrz who plays for the Norwegian electronic/industrial band, Red Harvest. The actual song itself is one of the overall least impressive on the album. It isn\u2019t until halfway through that we get some pretty good riffage and thrashing going on. Despite this track (and album in general) being overall more aggressive than the previous two releases from the band, I still miss that dark, blackened, cold and harsh sound the latter day Darkthrone lacks most of the time. However, one thing was brought back that they hadn\u2019t done in awhile\u2026\n\n2. Det Svartner Na - \u2026the Norwegian song titles and lyrics! Okay, so I\u2019m too lazy to look up the English translation of the title right now, but I guess that\u2019s not really the important thing at the moment. The important thing is that this almost sounds like classic fucking Darkthrone! And no, it isn\u2019t just because Nocturno Culto is using his harsh and evil Norwegian lyrics once again, but it\u2019s more due to the raw, straight forwardness of this song. So I wouldn\u2019t exactly call this Black Metal, but it\u2019s a nice mix of old-school punk and extreme Metal done in a more unique sense. With that being said, I would probably indulge in this album if I were a bigger fan of classic punk from the 80s because that\u2019s pretty much what Darkthrone sounds like now.\n\n3. Fucked Up And Ready To Die - At first, you\u2019ll probably notice the Plaguewielder-ish style that the first minute or so of this song conveys. Still, this material here is raw to the fucking bone, meaning that it sounds better than pretty much anything from that album. The song structural technique is just a bit similar to the previous album. Anyway, the rest of this track is a badass assault of Blackened Thrash Metal at it finest. It\u2019s songs like these that cause me to wonder if Darkthrone are really putting all of their skill into making their later albums. It\u2019s just that if they can make badass songs like this still, then why not make the rest of the album just as good? I mean, they USED TO be able to do that, right?\n\n4. Ytterst I Livet - Well, just like the killer tracks that are present on their later records, you also have your handful of mediocre ones as well. Take this one for example; The majority of the track is just a frenzy of harsh yet boring, mid-paced riffs with a constant underlining of double bass. It\u2019s this kind of sound that caused Plaguewielder to be such a crappy album. Once you get past the first four or so minutes of the song, you\u2019re hit once again with a fast paced, Black/Thrash assault done in a very classic way, yet, the band can\u2019t seem to pull off these assaults the same anymore.\n\n5. Divided We Stand - I was reading some other reviews for this album earlier and I noticed that so many people are hailing this album as the band\u2019s best work since Panzerfaust. \u201cIt\u2019s an assault on the modern trendy black metal scene\u201d I read from another fan\u2018s review. Well, I wouldn\u2019t go that far, because this album itself isn\u2019t exactly raw, old-school Black Metal. Old-school, yes, but as most others have pointed out, this is more along the lines of punk than anything, or\u2026\u201dBlack n Roll\u201d? I\u2019ve noticed a lot of people calling it that too. The reason for this is because the later Darkthrone material has more groove to it instead of focusing solely on minimalism. The punk riffs also sound a bit rockish as well, particularly on this song.\n\n6. Striving For A Piece Of Lucifer - \u201cI\u2019ve noticed a certain lack of demons lately, and it really worries me sick\u201d is one of the lyrics to this song. Yes, good lyrics, but sadly, it\u2019s all too true. I guess Fenriz really must be noticing a certain lack of demons, because Darkthrone needs to blacken things up a bit more like they used to. Striving for a piece of Lucifer? Yeah, it seems they\u2019re sure striving alright, yet cease to get the amount of \u2018Lucifer\u2019 they want in their music. This track is nothing too different from the previous song, but by now, I am totally bored with this album. Like I stated earlier, this serves more like background music than anything. The overall \u201cevil\u201d feel of the music is barely there. The band seems to also be striving to deliver cold and harsh Black Metal like they used to, but for some reason, only do a half assed attempt at it. Good track, but\u2026I really wish that Darkthrone would get that piece of Lucifer that they\u2019re striving for, because this isn\u2019t the cold and evil Darkthrone that we all know and love.\n\n7. In Honor Of Thy Name - A nice, distorted groove riff opens this song up and from then on, the band manages to deliver a nice slab of aggressive, old-school Black Metal. I mean, after reading the lyrics, I hoped that this would certainly be the most blackened song on the record, otherwise, the music wouldn\u2019t fit a lyric like \u201cBlack Metal is the Devil\u2019s fuel\u201d. Aside from the groove based opening riff, this track would actually fit on any of Darkthrone\u2019s earlier Black Metal releases if the production were a bit colder. Still, this is by far the best track on the album. Oh, and those weird sound effects at the end are once again, done by Lrz of Red Harvest.\n\n\n\nIf you noticed by reading the review, Hate Them is a mixed bag of sorts. Overall, it possesses the same punk/thrash/rock-ish feel with a harsher production job to everything, but still, some songs have more of a classic Darkthrone feel to them than others. Needless to say now, I don\u2019t care much for this album. However, their follow-up album, which is also their latest, is a completely different story.\n",
        "\nDespite some serious changes (talking especially 'bout the female vocals and mixture of black and death) made on this album that pissed off the hyperkvlt worshippers of Darkthrone, this is another gem in Darkthrone's darkened crown. Goatlord is more complex than anything that Darkthrone recorded before (except, let's say, Soulside Journey), Fenriz shows all his skills on this and eradicating any traditional song structure, changing rhythms in an insane way and making everything sound chaotic and destructive. Guest vocals were made on this by Satyr, and the result was not bad at all: the guttural growls are mixed with the screeching well-known attack, spoken parts, laughs and (horror!) female chanting. Actually, the female chanting sounds great, it amplifies the perverted nature of this masterpiece. The riffs became weirder than on the other albums, because we can find both black and death identities on this, resulting into whirlwind sewer-sounding riffs that are melodic and furious at the same time. Every song on this is great.\nDarkthrone fans and more open-minded listeners will enjoy this a lot.\n",
        "\nSomehow one of the original Norwegian black metal bands managed to put out an above average album in 2004, although that isn\u2019t saying much since Darkthrone is one of the few old black metal bands still left around they hasn\u2019t turned to suckage. Sardonic Wrath continues some themes presented in Hate Them, that is this album features many songs that may be inappropriately called \u201cBlack n Roll\u201d. But Sardonic Wrath basically features some decent to good groove based rhythm type riffs, much like the songs on Hate Them. Sardonic Wrath also features some pure grim riff based songs, with the generic symbol crash drumming, resembling work off Transylvanian Hunger, though not as good. The album would be labeled as good, except for a few shortfalls that render this album only above average but below good.\nOf the two types of song son this album Sjakk Matt Jesu Krist is the best groove rhythm based riff song. Starting off with a heavy chord slashing type riff along with slow pounding drumming it leads itself into an almost ever present riff that basically sounds like a blackened heavy/thrash riff, full of simple rhythms. The song is entirely consistent and never fails to break from its mold. The drumming performs simply and perfectly with the riffs, not doing anything complicated or even attempting to change, as with most Darkthrone songs. The song gets its strength through some nice placed shrieks and growls over the more powerful pounding moments where the riffs become more dominating or heavy, and the consistent sound and overall quality of the song comes from the almost ever present and never changing drum and guitar work. Information Wants To Be Syndicated sounds like something more off Transylvanian Hunger, but with better production and less grim (most likely because the song is louder due to better production and possibly more riff and drum changes than on Transylvanian Hunger Songs). The majority of the song is a grim riff that changes tempo every so often. Its somewhat high pitched while being played over symbol crashing drums. The song later falls into a slow sludge sound, it drains on and on with very slow drumming and a loud symbol crash every so often. It sounds a bit like when Bathory would play some slow paced music and go off on a rant about demons and Satan. Hates Is The Law is a nice song with very powerful vocals. They are shouted out abruptly as to sound like some sort of hate propaganda speech. Quite different than the rest of the albums vocals which consist of hardly audible screeches of words. These loud powerful vocals are quite audible but could never be considered clean, more like harsh. The song features both styles of Darkthrone, the grim style and the groove based riff style. Both being played under and with the powerful and authoritative vocals.\nSardonic Wrath falls short in that 30-40% of the songs on the album are just boring songs that go no where, or innately have bad riffs. Rawness Obsolete is both boring and innately has a bad riff. The riff is slow and sluggish never managing to pick up any energy like the groove based riffs on the rest of the album. It takes forever to go nowhere and is extremely boring. Other songs on the album are like and since they are spread out evenly over the album they ruin the playability. If Darkthone where able to make more songs like Rawness Obsolete and Sjakk Matt Jesu Krist then Sardonic Wrath would be a pretty good album. But with all the innately flawed tracks and songs that go nowhere rendering themselves boring this album just manages to be an above average album.\n",
        "\nMany things have been said about Darkthrone; their early days of sophisticated and moody death metal, through the gradual stripping down of their sound to its most primal elements within a black metal framework, to the final revellation that, big surprise, Darkthrone are just a couple of guys out to make loud and raucous heavy metal. Much of what's been said seems inaccurate, overblown, exagerated or simply misrepresentative. Whatever the case, it seems that nowadays everybody even remotely interested in metal has to have some kind of opinion about this band, even if more often than not that opinion is based on negligible fact or musical examination that is far from thorough.\n\nSo what's Darkthrone all about, circa 1993? Two years previously the band had disillusioned a great many fans by releasing an album that was markedly more ferocious and less rooted in the death metal tradition than its predecessor, yet in the end many of these fans came back after repeated listenings, because they realised that in fact the previous album's influences were still rather in tact, only cloaked by a thinner, much less immediately ear-pleasing sound and with much of the Scandinavian death tradition replaced by some nasty early 80s aesthetics. It was with \"Under a Funeral Moon\" that many listeners simply lost a grip on Darkthrone's singularly regressive plot. One reviewer described the album as \"sounding as if it were \"recorded inside a moving car\", and while death metal fans could forgive the admittedly less immediate complexities of \"A Blaze in the Northern Sky\", the minimalism that seemed to be creeping into Darkthrone's compositions at this point seemed rather unpalletable.\n\nOf the two points that are often levelled against this record, production is the easiest to tackle and to grasp. It is interesting to me that for the uninitiated listeners for whom I've played this, it is invariably the punk fans who find this easiest to swallow. Perhaps this is because true punk rock was never made to \"sound good\", and poor production values were at least in the early days second nature to the genre. Interestingly, the guitar tone on this particular (very metal) record reminds me more than a little of \"Fresh Fruit for Rotting Vegetables\" from the Dead kennedies, and in fact there's a specific riff on \"Under a Funeral Moon\" which a friend of mine pointed out sounded a lot like a DK riff (from \"Let's Get Drafted\", I think?). Comparrisons aside though, I find it difficult to see why anyone who listens to something other than slickly produced albums like \"Shout At the Devil\" would have any trouble with the sound of this particular Darkthrone album. Hell, Bathory's seminal \"Under the Sign of the Black Mark\" sounds much worse than this to my ears, yet seldom do I hear anyone complain about that particular masterpiece.\n\nYet, I'm not a \"Darkthrone apologetic\". In fact, I think that most of their albums have a perfect sound, or rather, perfect for the musical ideas they're attempting to communicate. It is remarkable to me that a band of Norwegians who, according to most of the naysayers, haven't a clue what they're doing with regard to playing their instruments let alone manipulating a mixing board, manage to go into the studio every couple of years and, almost unfailingly, come out with a slightly tweaked and different soundscape/production approach that fits their music so exactly. The Darkthrone production, in its various forms, is central to the music itself, and operates as a constant backdrop to the actual playing influencing the mood of the compositions and of the listener. It is, really, a stroke of genius that Darkthrone ought to be lauded for more often. Yes, the sound on this one is thin and reedy, the guitar tracks of Nocturno Culto and Zephyrous so brittle and dry sounding that they call to mind a burial mound on a blasted heath. Yes, the drums clatter and rattle away like a broken air compressor, or maybe like the dragging chains of a forgotten spirit (please excuse the melodrama!). But, hasn't anybody noticed, oddities aside, how clear everything is? Can you say with accuracy that you can hear every note played, every nuance of percussion laid out on your favourite Abyss Studios release (Marduk, I am looking directly at you!)? Darkthrone don't play fast, and they never allow everything to become blurred by constantly blasting snare and overmixed/compressed guitar. You can even hear the bass on this record! Despite the rice-paper guitar tone, that bottom end is a constant, a clean and reliable rumble that is like a grounding force holding the listener down to earth and sometimes serving as a reminder of the often obscure melodies being played. Vocals are so up front that you'd think they would overpower the guitars, yet they never do, despite the rampant use of an echo effect with a much longer delay than would be normal for say, your average 80s thrash record.\n\nSo Darkthrone can hide nothing with this high, stark degree of clarity. But why should they need to? We already know from \"Soulside Journey\" that they are capable of perplexing time changes and winding, jazz-inspired structures. Here they have done away with all the autopsy-isms and most of the Celtic Frostisms of \"A Blaze in the Northern Sky\" and replaced them with something that is part Bathory, part Hellhammer and part early Norwegian black metal trademark. Some of these songs do indeed have very few riffs, two or three, in fact, yet why does a metal song need more than that? Mankind's most ancient, pre-christian musics were unflinchingly simplistic in nature, stripped bare of incongruities and embellishments to tap right to the essence of the soul, rather than to be broken down bit by bit by a brain desperately searching for meaning.\n\nBut, as is the case with life in general, things are seldom quite as they appear and many of these songs do possess clever shifts and tricks that are, I would argue, based more upon the manipulation of sound rather than on a desire to implement crafty musical ideas. Take the closing track, \"Crossing the Triangle of Flames\". Why does it sound so different from the rest of the album...almost unsettlingly so? The riffs are strange, sure, obscure and melodic in an off-kilter sort of way, yet the drumming is really what does it. Formerly subdued cymbal splashes are suddenly constant, sharp rings, and it sounds as if Fenriz is flagging behind the kit, growing wearier and wearier as the song progresses, almost holding the band back, dealing out haphazard, painful sounding tom fills at strange seemingly inopportune moments. This sounds horrible, on paper, yet it works to the band's advantage here because you know that by this point they think of their compositions as soundscapes, canvases on which to paint audial portraits of embittered life and death. When you start thinking of music in this fashion, suddenly a whole wealth of new techniques becomes open to you, and former ideas about correct musical structure become limitations rather than benchmarks of quality. It's notable too that this is the final song, and all of us know damn well by now that Darkthrone are not amateurs, that they wouldn't set anything to tape that wasn't in some way purposefully concocted.\n\nThe highlights here are many. I already mentioned \"Crossing the Triangle of Flames\", and I think it is one of the best album closers in my collection. After the flagging, broken sounding semi-blast, the band collapses into a most colossal, doomy riff that is the epitome of hateful sounding, to be slowly superceded by the chhiming of a synthetic gong fed through some kind of strange studio effect to sound merky and as though it were recorded underwater. The title track is also a winner, as it actually possesses quite a few distinct riffs, one of which is so catchy and memorable that one really cannot help but appreciate it (you really ought to know the one I mean). My former band used to cover this one and it was always a fun song to play, right down to the great midpaced middle section with some very proud, malignant sounding chords backed by the kind of howling, dissonant soloing that is par for the course on this album. Of solos there actually are few, but they are very effective, seeming like a desperate and drunken Nocturno Culto's attempt to play every note possible on his guitar simultaneously and occasionally striving for understated, brief melodies in a similar fashion to what both Quorthon and Tom G. Warrior had already done.\n\nSpeaking of Bathory, who inevitably must be invoked frequently in any discussion of this album, \"To Walk the Infernal Fields\" sounds a hell of a lot like \"Enter the Eternal Fire\", but I prefer to view it as a tribute rather than a pitifully disguised rip-off, especially since darkthrone has an earthy, organic feel that Bathory, despite Quorthon's mastery, never really attained or seemed interested in achieving. \"To Walk the Infernal Fields\" is the first track I heard from the album, and its swinging drum beats, rather melodic riffs and powerful vocals (Nocturno Culto's gravelly snarls are really at their best on this record) drew me in after a few hesitant listens. \n\nAnd if you listen hard enough, you might just hear the dying gasps of the Scandinavian death metal influence in Darkthrone's sound playing their way discordantly through the distinctly odd \"Natasja in Eternal Sleep\". It's a black metal love song, of a sort, with lyrics oddly juxtaposed with the music so that it sounds as if they are being narrated rather than \"sung\", reflectively spat out by a filthy wretch of a man in between gulps from a bottle clutched in shaking hands. The band plays under this bitter monologue to establish the narrator's state of mind: a strange set of a very few riffs with notes that spiral upward in an unpredictable manner that almost remind me of a certain title track to a certain Entombed debut!\n\nI'm not sure if this is Darkthrone's crowning achievement, but it is damn close. Their personality and inventiveness seems at the highest level on this one, displaying a quirkiness of songwriting and arrangement that is undenyably Darkthroen and, though minimalist and regressive in playing approach, is progressive where it counts; namely, the band has reached the level where they can finally see their music as more than just a collection of riffs and ideas. Instead, we have full, detailed acoustical portraits that are more than the sum of their parts. This kind of thinking has been prevalent in the visual arts world at least since Piccaso (I'm hardly a painting expert), but it seems that the metal public often have a hard time swallowing this degree of abstraction in audio. And, for every one who does really grasp the concept, there are at least two hangers-on who are so quick to sing the album's praises yet still miss the point entirely. Still, isn't that always the way?\n",
        "\nExceptionally produced and way ahead of its time, Darkthrone\u2019s Blaze in the Northern Sky is an exemplary paradigm of second wave Black Metal. This album represents a great transition from Death Metal over to Black Metal, which Fenriz, Zephyrus, Nocturno Culto have seamlessly presented. Its raw essence yet superior design allows Darkthrone to keep ahead of most Black Metal bands.\n\nProduction-wise, Darkthrone displays a perfect example of Black Metal in its rawest form: hazy guitars, earthen drums, and guttural vocals. However, many bands forget the importance of atmosphere in Black Metal. Not to be trite, but this release is grim, yet epic, in the strongest sense. The ambience here is wrought with that original Norwegian sound, but the sound is shaped in a way that forms that novel, sylvan style.  Darkthrone plays their instruments well and the sound isn\u2019t overproduced, but lets the listener know that all the instruments can be heard when it comes to Black Metal. Nocturno\u2019s and Zephyrus\u2019 simple but rhythmic guitars wrap around Fenriz\u2019s thunderous, bassy drums to display a resonance that fits the hateful mood. The bass is not so silent that it can\u2019t be heard at all, blending in with the synthesis of all the effectively-but-simply played instruments.\n\nFenriz\u2019 lyrics also add to the early imagery of that cold Norway feel of early Second Wave Black Metal, making references to anti-organized religion (usually Christianity), Satanism, and grim narratives based on the wintry landscapes of Norway. I can\u2019t say I don\u2019t miss more of the same in later Darkthrone albums.\n\nNocturno Culto\u2019s infernal, (even) cantankerous vocals make this release a building block for Black Metal, especially the most overlooked ingredient: vocals. Nocturno\u2019s vocals are like a ghoul that pervade the essence of this record. I think anyone searching for their Black Metal vocal should aspire to imitate Nocturno. At least I do.\n\nOnward to much more grim endeavors. If you have the stomach, that is.\n",
        "\nAh yes, Darkthrone; a black metal elitist's wet dream come true. Not only are they Norway's most tr00 of the tr00 and kvlt of the kvlt, they also happen to be one of my own personal favorite bands that I just love to hate and hate to love. As a sort of guilty pleasure, I worship Darkthrone, but never beyond the confines of my living room. Like many others, I am in fact a closet fan. I mean, c'mon now. They hold the title of having one of the coolest names and logos ever, period! Just saying it gives me goose bumps. Darkthrone! oooohohhhh.\n\nIn all seriousness (if black metal could actually be taken seriously), Darkthrone are one of the premier acts that influence and inspire just about every other band under the black metal umbrella. You could say that they are the IT band that all the rest only wish they could be, except with more actual talent when it comes to playing their instruments. There's Venom, there's Bathory, and there's Darkthrone. All mediocre musicians for the most part, but hellacious songsmiths.\n\nThe duo, made up of guitarist/vocalist Nocturno Culto and Fenriz on drums, have spent over a decade in Norway's darkest corners churning away at the same drudging and droning chords and yet this template somehow works to their benefit, as they are consistently recognized as one of the most important acts in the history of metal. Let's see... Black Sabbath, Iron Maiden, and umm, Darkthrone? Hmmm. Maybe so. Some of their earliest works, such as the first and final death metal masterpiece Soulside Journey, along with its primitive successors A Blaze In The Northern Sky and Under A Funeral Moon, are among my favorite albums of all time. Oddly enough, I particularly make an effort of despising the raw primal side of music. This really says a lot about the kind of mind rape Darkthrone is really capable of. It's like 'I fuckin' hate you, but goddamn do I love you!'\n\nLike so few bands are able, or would even want to, Darkthrone have perfected the art of repetition. Only slightly maturing (yes, they eventually grew out of their grim kiddie make up) but never really evolving too much in their sound, they are an exact replica of themselves that has been preserved for almost fifteen years. In 2005, not a damned thing has changed. Leaving me in an utter state of awe with its minimalist value, Sardonic Wrath has some slow riffs, and it has some fast riffs. Shocking! If you have heard one Darkthrone album, you have heard them all. Like the rest, Sardonic Wrath features an entrancing intensity in its delivery that shifts between dragging doom type riffs and faster punk paced playing. Bottom line... If you had lost your copy of this disc, you could always just toss in any of their other releases and not be be any the wiser to the fact that it is a different CD.\n\nWho needs a polished production job? Certainly not Darkthrone. It takes away from the overall feeling and enjoyment of the record anyway, right? Just set them up in a wood shed somewhere, out in a freezing blizzard, smack in the middle of nowhere, with a four track recorder (not necessarily even digital) and they will emerge within a few short hours with a jaw dropping creation every single time. Same rule applies with Sardonic Wrath. It's chaotic, it's sometimes sloppy, yet it's easy to listen to from beginning to end.\n\nIt really seems as if Darkthrone is doing everything in their power to persuade us into not buying any of their records. They have even gone as far as declining award nominations that may make an example of their accomplishments. Hey, being applauded equals selling out. Didn't you know that? All the band's loyal legions know this, yet fail to realize they are the reason the band has notoriety. Get a clue, pal! Who really wants to live a glitzy lifestyle anyway? As if metal is at all glamorous. In my humble opinion, this only makes the band more intriguing. Everyone should praise Darkthrone (in private of course) even if it is against their wishes.\n",
        "\nDarkthrone promised us a revival of past glories with this CD and frankly, they've only managed to backtrack halfway across the abyss they were born in. Sure, the band have double-timed it up and gotten a bit more violent with this release. This doesn't mean though, that the band is writing songs that actually engage the listener and hook you in for repeated listens. Despite the rather striking album cover, old-skool production and seemingly increased attack the band have yet again released another Darkthrone record that is neither great nor horrible. The production is right, Nocturno still sounds pretty pissed off and the artwork is something to look at...but where are the timeless Darkthrone hooks? They're not really here...\n\nAll this being said, the record is still better than many others in the scene an certainly a step up from the snooze-fest known as \"Hate Them\". The doom-waltz \"Information Wants to be Syndicated\" has some interesting doom riffs that bear well under a few repeated listens. \"Sjakk Matt Jesu Krist\" has a few decent moments with it's old-skool punk-black metal stomp. This being said, many songs like \"Alle Gregen Alle\", \"Man Tenker Sitt\" and \"Rawness Obselete\" show good riffs but fail to capitalize on their epic opening moments by delivering any kind of excitement or built-up tension in their song structures. This is a record of many good moments, but little cohesion to bring the entire feel together, hence making it a passable display of black metal, but nothing that will challenge a rather sizable legacy in ANY way.\n\nOne wonders what Darkthrone are thinking by continually dragging these half-conceived records out to the public. Do Fenriz and Nocturno really believe that this is the best they can do? Do they care? Darkthrone are a strange bunch and while they are occasionally brilliant still one wonders is this hobby of theirs has tired on them and is more a habit than something that drives them at a basic level.\n\nThis isn't bad...but it's so faceless in some parts that it might as well not exist in moments. The next record will decide the fate of this band as they have little room to move around in anymore and they need to find themselves again and FAST.\n",
        "\nI know what you think about this score. Most of you worship old darkthrone albums and so do I.It\u2019s just that this one is actually better\u2026 Finally they\u2019ve managed to become even greater than they once were\u2026 In other words, they\u2019re right back on track.\n\nThe album starts out with the chilling intro \u201cOrder of the Ominous\u201d. This is a good ambient intro which sets the mood for what to come. The guitars bark in at the first second of opener \u201cInformation Wants to be Syndicated\u201d. Instantly you are caught in this whirlwind of thrashy black metal, and then it hits you. You can actually hear Fenriz\u2019s drumming, which is pretty new although the production is quite similar to \u201cHate Them\u201d. \u201cInformation\u2026\u201d is a strong song, with fast drumming and great riffs. The second song, \u201cSjakk Matt Jesu Krist\u201d (translated Chess Mate, Jesus Christ) starts off slowly, but picks up pace and turns out to be one of the best tracks on this album. It\u2019s got Norwegian lyrics as well as true Norwegian black spirit to it. Track nr. 3 is what I think, the best darkthrone song ever. In \u201cStraightening Sharks in Heaven\u201d we get one of their best performances ever. The typical headbanging tempo along with smashing riffs, it all fits. It even has a melody in the middle part, before the tempo gets slower and slower. And the vocals are great too, as Nocturno devilishly barks out rhymes from hell! It\u2019s simply the best! \u201cAlle Gegen Alle\u201d is a slower one, again great riffing, and that\u2019s what counts! \u201cMan Tenker Sitt\u201d and \u201cHate is the Law\u201d are the shortest tracks, very straightforward, at least the latter and are both great songs. \u201cSacrificing to the god of doubt\u201d is a great tune to headbang to. A repeating riff keeps the whole thing going. The finishing \u201cRawness Obsolete\u201d sounds a bit different, and is classic Darkthrone material. I suspect this song might have been recorded at a different time, or they have just changed the guitar sound completely just for one song.\n\nTogether, these 9 tracks make this album an absolutely essential purchase for anyone into black metal. I seriously think this is the best darkthrone album EVER.\n\nFave tracks : Information wants to be syndicated, Sjakk Matt Jesu Krist, Straightening Sharks in Heaven, Alle Gegen Alle.\n",
        "\nThe demo/promo consists of two instrumental tracks. The sound is grim and raw, but there is also, at the same time possible to hear what they play without any problem. In other words: Perfect! \n\nThe first track is some thunder and synthsounds, not very interesting, but it is a nice enough intro.\n\nThe second track, Snowfall, is great though! It\u2019s actually my favourite Darkthrone song. The two opening riffs sounds a lot like the two first riffs on the first song on Death\u2019s debut alum Scream Bloody Gore called Infernal Death. Being inspired by this album is not something Darkthrone has tried to hide\u2026 \nThe band lays riff, up on riff, up on riff going mid tempo with few repetitions for 9 minutes, and it never get boring to listen to. \n\nI believe this promo is hard to get, so I recommend getting Preparing For War, who has Snowfall on it.\n",
        "\nThis is a review I originally did for the Demonized Blessing Magazine (http://demonized.cjb.net)\n\nSo, what do we have here, it's the 2004 Album from Darkthrone, former premier Norwegian Black Metal act. The first real song after the rather pointless Intro \"Order Of The Ominous\" starts off with Darkthrone typical blast-beats and fast but simple riffing just to fade into some slightly dissonant, slow accords which make the end of the song very powerful.\n\nYou can easily recognize that the next song \"Skjakk Matt Jesu Krist\" was written by Fenriz (I think you can distinguish Fenriz's compositions easily on every Darkthrone album, very Rock'n Roll or Black'n Roll like if you want to say) and not by Nocturno Culto. And I find all of his songs sound quite the same in points of drumming, riffing, shouting and even the bridges. In my opinion, Nocturno Culto is the way better songwriter than Fenriz.\n\nThe next song \"Straightening Sharks In Heaven\" is a good one again with catchy riffs, some high-pitched picking and even a melodic part in the middle. Next song \"Alle Gegen Alle\" reminds me of the great \"Panzerfaust\" album. Celtic Frost like mid-tempo riffs if you know what I mean. I'm surprised that this song turns out to be a real banger as it is the second song written by Fenriz. At the next song \"Man Tenker Sitt\" starts the problem of this album: the songs get indistinguishable. It could also be on any of the last Darkthrone albums. The next one \"Sacrificing To The God Of Doubt\" starts off with a very catchy riff and probably is the best song on this album. The starting riff fades into some slow staccato accords and the song ends with the starting riff again. \"Hate Is The Law\" is the last song here written by Fenriz and it almost sounds the same like \"Skjatt Matt Jesu Krist\" except the good screams with much reverb effect which creates atmosphere. The last song again reminds of the \"Panzerfaust\" album, but it's \"just another Darkthrone-song\" in my opinion. And despite that, it's one of the best songs on this album, and that once again says it all what you can expect from Darkthrone in 2004 : Nothing new or groundbreaking.\n\nThe album has the typical Darkthrone length with a bit more than 34 minutes and most of the songs are between 3:00 and 3:30 except the last song which is over 6 minutes long. You can take the \"Hate Them\" album as a reference to describe the sound as it is almost exactly the same here. That means: again a raw production and not as clear as on Plaguewielder and Ravishing Grimness, but still miles away from the \"old\" Darkthrone sound on the first albums. \n\nIf you like the newer Darkthrone albums (from Ravishing Grimness onwards) you don't have to hesitate buying this one. All in all it's better than Ravishing Grimness and Plaguewielder and equal to Hate Them, but what is missing on this one is an outstanding song like \"The Claws Of Time\" on Ravishing Grimness or \"Weakling Avenger\" on Plaguewielder.\n",
        "\nSardonic Wrath is much like Hate Them. The production is almost identical and the vocals, guitars sound alike. Drumming is the usual simplicity with fills thrown in here and there for good measure. This release is a bit longer than the usual Darkthrone output. It has nine songs which are all between three-four-five minutes long. The intro \"Order of the Ominous\" sets the tone for the album with its cold sounding ambience. Then the thrashy \"Information Wants To Be Syndicated\" kicks into high gear and you are headed straight to hell. Over the course of the album, you begin to realize that this is pretty much identical to Hate Them. Enough so that if you didn't know it, you may think this was Hate Them. \n\nIf you have the promo version, there is only seven tracks, the last one being \"Silent Majorty.\" On this \"final\" version, Hate Is The Law is the same song, but with a different title. Music, lyrics, all the same. Rawness Obsolete is a nice closing song, a more slow tempo song than anything on here. It has some nice guitar work and vocals, and the drumming is also very good. \n\nIf you like new Darkthrone (Ravishing Grimness thru Hate Them) then you will like this, but if you are looking for an album that can stand side by side with the mighty Transilvanian Hunger, then this is not it. Darkthrone still have my respect for being true to the scene after all these years, and are far better than most newer BM bands coming out now, but with this formula, I just don't know if we will ever have another \"classic\" Darkthrone album to look forward to.\n",
        "\nSimply put, this is an amazing record. The best Darkthrone has to offer.\n\nReleased in 1995, this record picks up where \"Transylvanian Hunger\" left off as Darkthrone has expanded their sound. The songs on \"Panzerfaust\", although similar to those on the aforementioned previous LP, are a bit more interesting.\n\nOverall, \"Panzerfaust\" could be described as Darkthrone's tribute to Celtic Frost. The mid-tempo and slow parts featured on this record are nearly identical to those found on Celtic Frost's debut album \"Morbid Tales.\" However, this record is hardly slow, as Fenriz's frantic and drumming pound throughout the entire record. These faster parts of this record are the epitome of the Darkthrone sound.\n\nPerhaps the best aspect of this record is found in Culto Nocturno's guitarwork (although Fenriz did have a hand in writing the guitar parts). The memorable guitar riffs on this record are both melodic and unrelenting; they buzz and howl throughout every song. For example, the opening track \"En Vind Av Sorg\" has arguably the best riffs of any Darkthrone song wirtten.\n\nFenriz's amazing drumming, however, cannot be overlooked. Although minimalist, Fenriz knows exactly what to do and what not to do. He doesn't have the \"show-off\" flare of Mayhem's drummer Hellhammer, but that is a good thing. Fenriz knows when to play and when not to play. He hardly does fills on this record (less fills than in \"Transylvanian Hunger\" even). That's not to say that he plays the basic \"high hat+bass drum / snare / high hat+bass drum / snare\" the ENTIRE time, however. His bass drum patterns and syncopation in the slower parts are especially impressive and inventive. It is no wonder Fenriz's drumming style for these sections have been copied and rehashed so often by other black metal bands.\n\nVocally, this record is much more aggressive and angry than the vocals heard in \"Transilvanian Hunger.\" Culto Nocturno's voice is much louder in the mix for this record, which may put off some listeners at first. This mix works very well however, as his screaming is more varied and dynamic in style than on previous records.\n\nAs for the recording itself, it suits the songs very well. The rawness only increases the sinister nature of the music. Although, it is a bit heavier and thicker when compared to Transylvanian hunger (which was recorded in the same \"studio\").\n\nAs a whole, \"Panzerfaust\" is an amazing genre-defining record.\n",
        "\nI do not believe this to be as epic, much less good as most tend to make it out to be. This album is simply good, nothing more. Although I do take much more pleasure in listening to this over the tunes of the likes of other kvlter and tr00er bands, this is over worshipped. This is another black metal band which practices minimalist art, which isn\u2019t necessarily a bad thing. I happen to like minimalism in many cases, but in this instance you may as well take the first sixty seconds of each song and then replay it for another two or three minutes; you\u2019ll get the same effect as listening to an entire song.\n\nMinimalism is not bad. Lack of variety is what erodes the greatness of this album and only forces me to ponder about how good this could have been. The band had the right idea; they just needed to expand upon it a little bit with more riffs. On the level of skill, I\u2019m sure any guitar newbie could learn any of these songs, they aren\u2019t hard to play. What makes this attractive more or less is the sheer nature of this recording.\n\nThe blurry production gives Darkthrone a bit of an advantage for their quest to sound as if they recorded Transilvanian Hunger while camping out in a forest on a snowy winter night. Actually, this sounds more like it was recorded in a studio, then that recording was recorded on a tape player if you want to be realistic. The vocals sound like a growl in vein of a rasp; Nocturno Culto somewhat resembles the late Mayhem singer, Dead, during songs like \u201cSlottet I Det Fjerne\u201d with his \u201cARRRGH!\u201d Like the guitar playing, the drumming is pretty simple; Fenriz mainly just uses mid-paced blast beats. However, I happen to have a soft spot for the drumming here because of the way the non stop pounding adds a nice dosage of chaos to this album.\n\nEven though the guitars are just fast strumming, there is a lot of melody within the simplicity. Yeah, the sound is cold and grim, but even that isn\u2019t an excuse to cut corners like this. The guys in Darkthrone have a knick for creating good melody with little effort involved, but I know they could have done more with less recursive riffs to make this album really scream \u2018epic\u2019. This is worth owning if you\u2019re a fan of black metal, without a doubt, but I wouldn\u2019t call this essential by any means. If you hate repetitive minimalism then you may want to download this before you consider purchasing it.\n",
        "\nAfter releasing the mighty Panzerfaust, Darkthrone released this album. It's not as immediate as the first 3 as this takes some time to get into I must admit(for me anyway.) The riffs are cold, yet not icy or minimal as in Transilvanian Hunger and not evil as in A Blaze.... The songs are short, mostly around 3 minutes or so, with the occasional 2 and a half minute one. The vocals seem distant and the drums are mixed just a tad too high, but that certainly doesn't damn this album. During the blast sections, the music all seems to blend together, creating a wall of noise if you will. \n\nThe first track, Earth's Last Picture, really stands out. It has a nice, menacing main riff and at the break a speed picked riff comes in which really adds that sense of minimalism to this, but this is mainly it. Another highlight is The Serpent's Harvest, the last song on here. It's got a nice slow, chuggy riff at the beginning, then goes into an all out ball crusher riff about a minute into it. The lyrics for this album were written by some of the leaders of the Norwegian BM movement, including Ihsahn of Emperor and Satyr of Satyricon, although which person wrote which lyric I am not sure.\n\nAll in all this is a decent BM record, but not really a good Darkthrone record. It's got its moments, but those seem to be few and far between.\n",
        "\nAfter a long hiatus and silent period after 95's \"Total Death\" which was only interrupted by the release of \"Goatlord\" (which as you all might know is of a far earlier recording date) , DarkThrone returned with a very solid, unpretentious, honest, and strikingly mature album in \"Ravishing Grimness\".\n\nBeing that most BM fans often act as a herd unable to appreciate a work on it's own without referencing the band's past or production aesthetics, this little platter has been thoroughly ostracized to no end by the bedroom corpsepaint crowd. But, I assure you this, if this album was in any case released by Satyricon or any other \"less true\" band in 98 those same diehards would have probably hailed it to no end.\n\nThe album kicks off with whipcracks and the suitably sadomasochistic riffing on \"Lifeless\". Embedded with BM groove only DarkThrone can pump out it switches to a jumpy thrashy ending, but only after excessive repetition literally crushes in this song on the listener. \"The Beast\" follows, the only track with music written by Fenriz, and this is possibly DarkThrone's weakest song of all time, a thoroughly mediocre paean to Motorhead which still grooves and keeps pulse going rather well, but is a little far too \"rockin\" to avoid sticking out like a sore toe on an album of this kind. Third in line is the jewel of the album, \"The Claws of Time\". A depressive, thoroughly touching melody with a wailing sorrowful lyric gives way to an incessant repetitive hammering which ends with no relief following the narrative of the lyrics. Most anybody who has severe problems with latter day DarkThrone will quote this as the worst they have done, yet if it was a song by say Nargaroth or Abyssic Hate I doubt they could find a better work in the rest of the two mentioned bands' catalogue. \"Across the Vacuum\" lifts proceedings up in a racing fashion and keeps attention focused for another stroker in the title track. \"Ravishing Grimness\" is classic latter day DarkThrone filled with inertia and vigour, breaking apart in the middle for a round of droning torture only to pick up for final overkill yet again at the end. Closing the proceedings is yet another average track (though not as out there as \"The Beast\") in \"To the Death (Under the King)\" which reaches a rather astounding climax to round it all off. \n\nThe production on this is weird for DarkThrone to say the least, although similar in style to \"Total Death\", the bass drum is entirely subdued, while the guitars are a classic wall of sound DarkThrone didnt attempt before or after, apparently according to Nocturno Culto there's three guitars running throughout the length of the album which gives it the fullness this material needs. In content terms, this is very removed from the eerie and evil atmosphere of \"Under a Funeral Moon\" but the songwriting leanings are rather reminiscent of that album as there are plenty variations in motion within the songs themselves. If no-nonsense stripped down and serious BM is what you seek be sure to avoid the negative rants and give this a listen as it sure does hold value in \"Lifeless\", \"The Claws of Time\" and \"Ravishing Grimness\" to warrant the price asked.\n",
        "\nLast stop is NOT Hate Them. This album burns, kills, rapes, pillages, and all over your stereo. Don't look past it. Theres nothing to not miss.. kind of.\n\nThe riffs stay as power chords played over, but they build three or four real nice riffs for each song, alternate between them, and own your soon to be cold heart. The only notable problmes I found were with the intro and outro. Hearing the annoying \"opening\" in Rust just makes me skip it on WinAmp some times, either that or I just skip about a minute into the song. This dosn't give the vibe it wanted to, but the rest of the song does and does well. Darkthrone can't do much wrong, I don't think, and this is more proof.\n\nFrom beginning (:45 into Rust) to end, this album pleases aurally, and seems a bit like punk in points. Its not like Transilvanian Hunger or anything, but its really not like Soulside Journey, seeing as its even more evolved. From the said Soulside Journey, we saw Darkthrone's version of what most all black metal bands went through- their Death stage. It went onto black, what, the next album? And there it went on. I have only this, Panzerfaust, Journey and Hunger, so I don't quite know where they went before this, but they do seem to constantly evolve, and are persistant right with it. Keep in mind, it might be too different for some, but welcome for others. I'm the second group, and alot of people are too. Join us, get this album, and be happy.\n\nNot many flaws, just some of the tracks riffs get a bit old. Don't let it get you down, theres too much to miss here! Awesome lyrics, great guitarwork (even if its simple, it sounds great), and ever uber-drumming. Everything in time, everything nice, everything fairly simple but good. Like I said- don't miss it.\n\nJust tell Nocturno Culto you were too busy getting stoned to burn churches, he'll understand.\n|D|A|R|K|T|H|R|O|N|E| -- my anti drug\n",
        "\nFirst off I need to say that this is my first Black Metal cd. I will focus on the BM songs here mostly as they were my primary interest. Part of me expected an overwhelming assault on my senses, after hearing Marduk and random black metal from mp3\u2019s. When putting this on for the first time, I found that the music is very non-intrusive. The music is quiet and from first listening sounds like the raindrops hitting the ground in the background or a howling blizzard. \n\nAfter repeated listening, patterns emerge. The music sounds primitive, with several disjointed riffs that can be described as hypnotizing and trance inducing. The drums are fast and monotone on some tracks, but because they are in the background they don\u2019t cause too much irritation. The evil croaking vocals appear out of nowhere. Each section paints another part of the picture. Some tracks start mid riff and are cut short at the end. Oops, someone pulled the plug. \n\nTracks vary in recording volume and between Death and Black metal. It all comes together as one amazing trip. \n\nIf you get lost in the trance, you see several images pass you by. \nSunless world. All life frozen over. Shadows in the forest. A small town from another time. Wooden houses. A small cemetery in the twilight. Descent into the grave. Funeral march. Eternal winter. It is not easy to keep track of time when listening to this. Listen to it yourself, turn off the lights, put the headphones on and you will see it for yourself.\n\nNow, as for Death metal it is just a great listen as well. This is not a band that needs to prove how brutal they can be. Headbangable riffs, solid playing, no \u201cwhat the fuck was that\u201d moments. Everything is easy on the ears, even though it is crammed to the brim, you will wish this cd was twice as long. The effect is quite uplifting and addictive. Also, the tell-tale sign of a good piece of art is multiple interpretations; well this one passes that test with flying colors. \n\nAs for the content it covers 1988 and 1989 demos, first 4 LPs, two live performances recorded in 1989 and two unreleased tracks, if I got my math right. The recording quality is universally bad, which is not a bad thing in this case, as I cannot see music being this good otherwise. \n\nIf I had to choose a favourite, then Transilvanian Hunger tracks are the ones that sound with most potency to me. \n\nThis is a great way to get into Darkthrone, or you can get it for unreleased and hard to get stuff.\n",
        "\nThis is where Darkthrone completed their metamorphosis from their Death Metal origins to one of the most quintessential and uncompromising Black Metal bands. Where \"A Blaze In The Northern Skies\" still showed sparse riffs and structures reminescent of the band's past, \"Under A Funeral Moon\" sports a totally cold, haunting and unfriendly musical attitude. This is not saying that the work presented here is anti-musical or performed by untalented players, it doesn't get more false than that. Simply put, Darkthrone got hold of the identity they were striving for, and such identity was never meant to please a large number of listeners.\nThe differences between this album and the previous are quite apparent. First, the departure of Dag Nilsen, bassist extraordinaire whose highly unappreciated skills were a fundamental component of early Darkthrone, who had agreed to perform bass on \"A Blaze In The Northern Sky\" before quitting the band due to his lack of interest for the new direction. His style would clash with the band's music anyway at this point, and despite that, this album has some inventive bass parts anyway (handled by Nocturno Culto).\nNext, the production, or better the lack of. \"A Blaze In The Northern Sky\" had a very harsh sound, with the drums and echoy vocals often overpowering the trebly, fuzzy guitars and the barely audible bass. Here, it just gets worse. Everything on this album sounds incredibly thin. The guitars are a kind of buzz which seems destined to be drowned by static anytime, the drums are very flat and lifeless, the bass is heavily and unpleasantly distorted (although it stands out pretty well because of its thick low frequencies) and Nocturno Culto's vocals are a very raspy croak, very different from his usual style, and loaded with echo. This barbaric demo-like soundscape would be enough to put anyone off, yet I have to underline how well it actually works. No elements overpower others anymore, and the volumes are very well balanced.\nFinally, the song structures themselves, no longer as epic as in the old days but way more minimalistic, although some technical solutions still stand out. This si something you cannot bang your head to, you cannot air guitar to... this is ugliness at its best.\n\nAlbum opener \"Natassja in Eternal Sleep\" immediately gets to the point: a repetitive yet weird-tempoed tremolo guitar riff blazes along over Fenriz's droning beats, with Nocturno Culto adding basic bass lines and reciting the beautifully sorrowful lyrics. The middle section has some great guitar arragements going on. A great opener, which in time has become one of the band's best known anthems.\n\"Summer of the Diabolical Holocaust\" (I'd never thought that a Norwegian Black Metal band could ever mention summer in their songs) opens with fast and furios strumming and beats, the verse riffs alternating with an originally developed melodic tremolo part. Near the middle the song evolves into a slow, menacing soundscape which reminds me a bit of the middle section of Mayhem's \"Freezing Moon\" (especially considering how both songs go into this slower part coming from a fast rhythm, and both have a solo in the slow section). The fast beats pick up again, and near the end the tremolo guitar part is closely followed by the bass and goes into one finaldifferent variation.\nWhat follows is one of the strangest songs Darktrhone did this far, \"The Dance of Eternal Shadows\". This one begins as a slow plodder, then turns into another fast part backed by a rather complicated-tempoed riff (the part where only the vocals and guitars are left, with Fenriz inserting only a few percussion, is chilling), and closes as a mid-paced march.\nOn to \"Unholy Black Metal\", a title that says it all... this is where minimalism is brought to the forefront, as the song has exactly three riffs and the vocals follow the same pattern in each verse (and the verses themselves are all built on the same structure), most o fthe variation coming from Fenriz's well known subtle pattern changes. A seminal chapter for the band's evolution, which lives up to its title.\n\n\"To Walk the Infernal Fields\" is a real surprise. This is the slowest track of the album, as well as the longest, and keeps a midpaced approach all the way through (expect for a variation which brings it into an even slower part). the riffs are very melodic for the band's standard, and are built upon an intimate interaction between guitars and bass; the guitars themselves show subtle variations under the main riffs, which is one of Darkthrone's trademarks.\nNext is the title track, which once again mostly sticks to fast beats, yet is one of the more developed and varied numbers of the album riff-wise, and doesn't omit a more mid-tempoed variation in the middle.\n\"Inn i de Dype Skogers Favn\" is in my opinion the least successful track of the album. Where the other songs successfully show the interesting achievements that can be obtained through a severely stripped down approach, this one comes across as simply repetitive and uninspired. I can see some importance in this one, as it foreshadows what the band will come up with in their next album, \"Transilvanian Hunger\", considering the rhythm that never changes, the very repetitive riffs and the Norwegian lyrics; but Darkthrone themselves would do the song much better on the following album as \"I en Hall med Flesk og Mj\u00f8d\", the album where this apporach will really show its true potential in terms of intensity.\n\"Crossing the Triangle of Flames\" finishes the album on a very high note, thanks to its unusal drumming and very interesting riffs, among the most melodically complex in the whole band's history. A very underrated song in my book.\n\nOverall this is one of the best examples of Black Metal's beauty through ugliness, because in the end this album is simply beautiful. It's raw, intense and uncompromising. Even without looking at its historical importance, there's no denying its rich substance.\n",
        "\nThis is by no means another Transilvanian Hunger or A Blaze in the Northern Sky(etc), but were we REALLY looking for one? I have yet to hear a Darkthrone album that I sat back and said, \"You know what? This blows\", but I've also come to understand that magic like TH comes every once in a pagan moon. This is just another worthwhile CD from the grimest of the grim, Darkthrone.\n\nRust - I respect Darkthrone in everyway possible, but dammit, why did they add this intro? No, it doesn't give me this \"cold norwegian blizzard\" feeling. It makes me get up and skip(fastforward) it until I hear a guitar. It only lasts 43 seconds, so I suppose it doesn't take away from the song too much. Once the music kicks it, everything is as it should be. Nocturno is top notch. Is there any way to truly describe his voice on this track? There's the right word out there somewhere, but let's just use the word \"perfect\" for now. The production is lacking (in true DT style), but it's a signature that we've all come to expect. \n\nDet Svartner N\u00e5 - The guitars definitely shine on \"Det Svartner N\u00e5\". Repetitive? Oh Yes. Hypnotic? Yes. Lacking? No. This is where the \"cold norwegian blizzard\" is. I love this song specifically for that rotating riff and the lyrics. Simple yet, well, striking. It takes a step back into the old days where killer riffs and lyrics with the word \"satanic\" in them made classics. \n\nFucked up and Ready to Die - My favorite song on this album. The lyrics, the riffs, and the God-like vocals. The guitars are slow and grinding as if they are leading the song into something. And they are. The song builds until it boils over and Fenriz kicks into furious drumming and the guitars become faster yet still grinding. Each lyric is amazing. \"Let's leave this sinking ship together, The water of life will fill your lungs.\" No need to really explain that lyric as it foreshadows the entire song structure.\n\nYtterst I Livet - Another grinding song as it's predecessor was. The lyrics are obviously entirely in Norwegian. This is also a building song, but not quite as satisfying as \"Fucked up and Ready to Die\". Still a solid song, though, don't get me wrong. It builds and grinds on for about 4 minutes and then hits that climax that you're so desperately looking for. Fenriz breaks away from the mundane beats and bangs away while the guitars step out of the building monotony. The highlight carries on until the end of the song, but by the time it kicks in, the song is almost over. Probably my only problem with the album. \n\nDivided We Stand - The opening for this song rocks. One of the three songs with Fenriz did both the music and the lyrics. Just another footnote on this album. Nothing spectacular. The guitars push the drums aside for this one as they own this track. Very repetitive, but very good. About a minute in, they bring about a true hateful listening experience. Nocturno does his part as he always does. I'd say something about him vocals in each track if it would make people understand that his black vocals are the best I've heard (possibly) ever.\n\nStriving for a Piece of Lucifer - The combination of the lyrics and the music is amazing on this track. Apparently Nocturno and Fenriz were on the same page while creating this masterpiece. Cold, Grim, and Hateful. Everything black metal stands for. Obivously Darkthrone show that they're not planning on budging from being the black metal kings anytime soon. Once again Nocturno pulls his weight and more on this song, showing that I was correct when I say his vocals are black metal in every aspect. \n\nIn Honour of Thy Name - The guitars rip on this track with Fenriz banging on his set with true hate that anyone can feel just by listening to it. The song switches between the occassional slow, raw riffs and beats with Nocturno dragging out each hateful lyric, then suddenly switching to mind blowing pounding and distortion. I even like the outro. Imagine that. Classic Darkthrone. Something easily compared to the classics of the albums mentioned earlier. This does much justice to Darkthrone and all that they've accomplished.\n\nSo in the end, this album isn't innovative. It's not a step in a new direction or expressing some new musical taste. It's just Darkthrone doing what they do best. True Grim Black Metal.\n",
        "\nI think I should start this review with the general introduction to this album, namely it\u2019s history.\nThis album was originally recorded immediately after Soulside Journey and was just some rehearsals of 1990-1992 period. Later on, in 1994 the vocals were put to music. Finally, in the year of 1996 it was released on Satyr\u2019s (Satyricon) label Moon fog productions.And now about the album itself. \nMusically this album is something between black and death metal and is the only album that at some point is similar to Soulside Journey. Music is mainly slow paced, with lots of cold, grim melodies woven into it, it does not have wall of noise as on the upcoming albums by Darkthrone. Guitars here sound rather clear but already near to Black Metal albums of Darkthrone. Song structures are rather chaotic. As it is mainly slow-paced album there are almost no blast beats in here, or it is better to say they appear here from time to time in faster parts of songs. This album has a poor production but Black Metal and especially Darkthrone are not about good production . Music is the main. This poor production adds naturality and grimness to the album.\nVocals here deserve special attention. Many vocal samples were used during its recording: from death metal growling vocals to black metal kind and from clear voice to female vocals at the background.\nInteresting moment: lyrics of Gotalord partially can be met in songs of Under the Funeral Moon album (compare \u201cRex\u201d, \u201cPure Demoniac Blessing\u201d and \u201cCrossing the Triangle of Flames\u201d; \u201cPure Demoniac Blessing\u201d, \u201cThe Grimness of Which Shepherds Mourn\u201d, \u201cSadomasachistic Rites\u201d and \u201cThe Summer of Diabolical Holocaust\u201d (these two songs are composed into one song on Under the Funeral moon (\u201cThe Summer of Diabolical Holocaust\u201d) ; \u201cAs Desertshadows\u201d, \u201cIn His Lovely Kingdom\u201d and \u201cThe Dance of Eternal Shadows\u201d). So one can notice that UTFM album enroots from Goatlord.\nIn general this album ,is melancholic ,depressing ,dark ,gloomy ,grim ,evil ,unholy and balsphemous.\nTo agree with this review one must understand the album and to understand it one must listen to it attentively for atleast 5 times.\nNot recommended for people new to Darkthrones works and to True Norwegian Black. Because even some of DT fans dislike this album. And mainly people consider this to be a cash grab , sell out etc.\n",
        "\nThis is Darkthrone's newest album. It is more of a return to the raw, garage sound of the early days, but it is still not garage enough to be considered the brother of Transilvanian Hunger. This record is by no means a masterpiece, but it is also by no means a piece of shit. Every song on here is good. They all retain the feeling of grimness and evil, but they none of them are up there with classics like In the Shadow of the Horns or Skald Av Satans Sol (except maybe In Honour of Thy Name). \n\nThe guitars are all tuned to D, including the bass, and the riffwork is good, but a step down from Plaguewielder, which is what they intended, and they do it so very well. Fenriz's drums are excellent. He is really a great drummer, but he doesn't really do anything that stands out. Nocturno Culto's vocals are grim, evil, and colder than the freezing moon (bad joke). The vocals may be the stand out of this album. \n\nThe production is of course pretty bad, but it is definately good compared to earlier works. It does have a depth to it, which most of their records don't have. I read a review of this album on a site somewhere out there and the guy reviewing it said that the album sucked because of the \"demo-like quality of the sound\". Well that guy is obviously not been keeping up with Darkthrone since 1991. That is what makes their albums so atmospheric, the really shitty production, but really, this album does NOT have bad quality sound by any means. \n\nPick this up if you are a Darkthrone fan or a BM fan in general.\n",
        "\nThis is an awesome fucking collection of songs from a band that embodied all that Unholy Black Metal ever stood for. If you have just begun listening to Black Metal this is a sure essential, seeing as its a large variety of the bands best tunes. Few bands deserve a \"greatest hits\", but even fewer people would argue against this ones worth, and with that said this is a great commemoration of a bands music that has influenced a genration of Black Metal musicians.\n\nWith high lights like Grave With A View, Under A Funeral Moon, I En Hall Med Flesk Og Mjod, and In The Shadow Of The Horns this album contains some classic Black Metal songs that otherwise would force you to purchase many albums just to have the tunes on here (not to mention the previously unreleased demo tracks). Inside the album there contains a very brief history of how Darkthrone came to be (basically a few notes about the inception stage of the band). \n\nIf you cant, or dont want to go out and buy the bands discography this is an ample substitute. A great album, even after many, many plays. \nDarkthrone is for the evil in mankind!\n",
        "\nThis is the first Darkthrone CD I got and I found the instruments used for the album very strange (due to your everyday 'Black Metal' production i.e. crap) but the production of the guitar makes it sound like it was recorded in a tunnel or something.\n\nIt was originally the second album after Soulside Journey (which is more of a Death metal album than ye usual Darkthrone Black metal material) but was never released until the band joined Satyr's Moonfog record label. And Satyr thought when he got hands on the master tapes \"Hey, I could get Culto to sing so I could release this as a full length and get all the kiddes to buy it and make me rich!\". Satyr makes a guess appearance in the first and forth songs \"Rex\" and \"Sadomasohistic Rites\".\n\nVocals: They were basically spoken, in the black metal sense, over the music and doesn't really the pattern of the sound at all though there is a range of vocals, some roars here and there to even it out. The backing vocals sound feminine and a Darkthrone veteran would find these out of place. (do female backing vocals appear in other Darkthrone releases? answers on a postcard)\n\nGuitar: It sounds weak here without the drums and spoken vocals. They don't sound evil at all, they just huff and puff but couldn't blow a straw house down, they're only effective in a \"sneak and nip at your ankles\" way.\n\nBass: Where? It must be buried and abosrbed by the guitar because I can't hear it anywhere at all.\n\nDrums: Before the vocals were added on the songs, the drums were the dominant instrument in the mix and they can drown the guitar in a beat, the snare sounds tinny (but not to the extent of the dustbins of St. Anger, thank fuck, though it's more like a sound that you would get from tapping a triangle, which is something you would know about in music lessons at school).\n\nIn spite of the poor production, some songs are worth listening (Black Daimon adds 20% and the vocals for Toward(s) the Thornfields also add 5% as well) to the reviews final total) to so it may be worth your while to download Goatlord before thinking of parting with your money and giving it to Moonfog.\n\nBest songs: Rex, As Desertshadows, Black Daimon, Toward(s) the Thornfields\n",
        "\n...with even more raw, ugly and merciless unholy Black Metal! After the \"Norwegian Aryan crisis\" and the label change, Darkthrone resurface on Moonfog Productions with the clear intent of continuing their grim crusade. After completing their by now notorious Black Metal Trilogy, Norway's darkest sons take a trip back to the first wave of Black Metal in search for inspiration for the new material, eventually focusing their attention on the ever so influential Swiss underground legend namely Celtic Frost. Although references to this band could already be detected in Darkthrone's previous work, the boldly titled \"Panzerfaust\" almost reaches a tribute status. \n\nThe label change apparently brought some fresh air in terms of sound too. \"Panzerfaust\" is unquestionably underproduced and raw, yet it doesn't reach the barbaric trebly fuzz of \"Under A Funeral Moon\" or the chilling minimalism of \"Transilvanian Hunger\": the guitars are now a lot more organic and even some bass strums can be heard here and there. This different side of sonic ugliness (I wouldn't talk of \"more polished sound\") actually fits the new songs better than words can explain. I do, however, find a problem with this album's sound, namely Nocturno Culto's vocals. Gone are the chilling screams of \"A Blaze In The Northern Sky\" or \"Transilvanian Hunger\": here, Culto tries out what could be described as a semi-clean rasping singing, no doubt an attempt to get close to Tom G. Warrior's well known tormented vocals. His attempt, however, doesn't always emerge as convincing, with numerous bits sounding downright forced and uninspired. All of this is made worse by the real flaw in \"Panzerfaust\"'s production: the excessive loudness of the vocals in the mix, which at times end up drowning the whole music (especially the drums which on the other hand are a bit too low). \n\nDespite these troubles, \"Panzerfaust\" still stands as a winner thanks to the strength of the new material. The opening track, \"En Vind av Sorg\", descends directly from \"Transilvanian Hunger\"'s title track in terms of structure and rhythm but is fueled by new blood in the melodic progression department. Next, an amazingly groovy and cool riff introduces the second assault, \"Triumphant Gleam\", a quite complex song where the Celtic Frost comparison is on its firmest ground, thanks to its crude palm muted riffs and thrashing speedfests. \"The Hordes if Nebulah\", in contrast, brings the pace down to a slow and almost trancelike surreal journey, producing one of the most bizarre and original experiences Darkthrone has offered this far. \n\nAt this point a corious fact about \"Panzerfaust\" has to be pointed out: if you let out the outro \"Sn\u00f8 og Granskog\", the tracklist can be divided into two halves which have a symmetrical structure, meaning that the songs on the two halves can be coupled together. So, as on the first half we met a fast, grim song (\"En Vind av Sorg\"), a thrashy and complex one (\"Triumphant Gleam\") and a slow one (\"The Hordes of Nebulah\"), so do we on the second half, in the same order. It's a bit of a pity, as the structures underlines the similarities rather than the differences between the songs, and makes the second half of the album sound more predictable. Whatever... \n\"Hans Siste Vinter\" takes us back to the coldness of \"Transilvavian Hunger\" once more with its sorrowful riffs and ice cold minimalism. \"Beholding The Throne of Might\" opens with a riff which is a crossing between Darkthrone's very own oldie \"In The Shadow of The Horns\" and the beginning of Mayhem's \"Necrolust\", before evolving into another Celtic Frost tribute and exploding into a headbanging faster section. For some reason this track suffers from the comparison with its companion piece, \"Triumphant Gleam\", sounding less intense and inspired. On the other hand, the slow number of this second half, \"Quintessence\", is a lot more focused and organic than \"The Hordes of Nebulah\", and finds further strength in its fantastic lyrics, courtesy once again of Varg \"The Count\" Vikernes. \n\"Sn\u00f8 og Granskog\" closes the album on an atmospheric and eerie note, a very stripped down synth melody with some percussions and Fenriz reciting a Norwegian poem, an atmosphere somehow not too dissimilar to \"The Shadowthrone\"'s most laid back moments. Yet the back cover of \"Panzerfaust\" states that the album is indeed dedicated to Satyr \"Evig er krigen mot de av lyset\" (\"eternal is the war against those of the light\"), a quote which comes from the song \"Hvite Krists D\u00f8d\" off \"The Shadowthrone\" (and \"The Shadowthrone\" itself bears on its back cover a dedication to Fenriz \"we are the fist in the face of God\"). \n\nBetween label changes and political criticisms, an admirable result from a band which was experiencing one of its most problematic moments.\n",
        "\nIf you've ever heard Darkthrone, then you probably think that you know what to expect from a Darkthrone album. I'll say first and foremost that Goatlord--which was actually recorded immediately after Soulside Journey, before Darkthrone's transition to their more recognizable form first seen on A Blaze In The Northern Sky--defies any expectations.\n\nGoatlord is a strange album, indeed. For starters, most of the vocals resemble spoken words (albeit in a black metal voice) rather than singing, usually following no rhythm or pattern and coming at seemingly random intervals during the music. However, the vocals are where this album really shines. Throughout the album many different voices and samples are used, including but not limited to clean vocals, tortured screams, Nocturno's patented black growls, and even vocal samples resembling a female voice. Now whether or not this female voice is actually a female or just a modulated male voice, I have no idea.\n\nReally the only problem I have with the album are the instruments. For one thing, the vocals almost completely drown them out due to the production used. The drums are not really noticeable and the bass can not be discerned from the guitar. That being said, the guitar throughout the album is easily forgotten, only standing out on one or two songs, namely \"In His Lovely Kingdom\" and \"Green Cave Float\", which also happen to be the best two songs on the album.\n\nSo really, with a more appropriate production and a slight reworking of some of the guitar parts, the album would be a very memorable one. As it is, Goatlord is decent, but a bit mediocre. Highlights: \"(The) Grimness Of Which Sheperds Mourn\", \"Sadomasochistic Rites\", \"In His Lovely Kingdom\", and \"Green Cave Float\".\n"
