        "\nAt this point, the deterioration that fueled the creation of 1996\u2019s The Great Southern Trendkill is well-documented. However, I\u2019m not sure how much this album\u2019s duality is ever truly acknowledged. It could very well be Pantera\u2019s most ambitious effort, set apart by some of their most experimental textures along with a persistent air of self-loathing that feels like the macho antagonism of the last couple releases coming home to roost. Unfortunately, that self-loathing also leads to what could essentially be considered self-sabotage.\n\nPerhaps \u201cWar Nerve\u201d is the most striking example of this seeming sabotage in action. The song starts off incredibly strong with a punishing opening riff compounded by diabolically layered trade-off vocals for the first couple verses only for Anselmo to all but completely halt the momentum in its tracks a couple times to let out garbled attempts to ramble about God knows what. Past albums certainly had their share of songs that were well-performed despite the vocals, but now it feels like Anselmo is literally going out of his way to make the presentation as unpleasant as possible.\n\nThe other heavy tracks further reinforce the inconsistent quality that has come to be synonymous with Pantera around this period. \u201cDrag the Waters\u201d has earned its staple status thanks to its simple but hooky main riff and straightforward structure while the layered shrieks on \u201c13 Steps to Nowhere\u201d end up being oddly catchy. On the flip side, the sudden blasts and dissonant shrieks infamously courtesy of Seth \u2018Ha Ha, You\u2019re Dead\u2019 Putnam make the opening title track and \u201cSuicide Note, Pt. II\u201d a little too abrasive for my fragile ears while others like \u201cLiving Through Me (Hell\u2019s Wrath)\u201d and \u201c(Reprise) Sandblasted Skin\u201d somewhat lose their way with their tangent structures.\n\nOddly enough for a late-era Pantera album, the most melodic tracks end up being the strongest on here. \u201c10\u2019s\u201d may not be a full-on ballad but its grungy presentation plays out a more effective date of \u201cThis Love\u201d or \u201cHard Lines Sunken Cheeks\u201d while \u201cSuicide Note, Pt. I\u201d is an acoustic ballad that\u2019s effective even without the piercing sludge-grind of its counterpart. And of course, the seven-minute \u201cFloods\u201d earns its legendary reputation thanks to an appropriately apocalyptic atmosphere and a sweeping solo that Dimebag had allegedly been working on since he was a teenager.\n\nConsidering the rather frontloaded song presentation of past Pantera releases and the worsening personal relationships of those involved, it isn\u2019t too surprising that The Great Southern Trendkill is such a fractured effort. It offers the same inconsistent tracks and borderline obnoxious performances, but the personal despair that overwhelms the anger make the peaks and valleys more intriguing to examine. It\u2019s not pleasant to have on but it\u2019s easy to see why fans consider it to be one of their most underrated albums overall. If Vulgar Display of Power is something that I almost reluctantly enjoy, then The Great Southern Trendkill is something that I wish I liked more.\n",
        "\nWith the release of Pantera\u2019s seventh album, their evolution from glam metal nobodies to groove metal pioneers reached its ultimate culmination. 1994\u2019s Far Beyond Driven famously managed to get #1 on the Billboard 200 and did so without the band watering down their signature sound. On the contrary, the band\u2019s aggressive tendencies seemed to only amplify with the riffs getting blunter, the vocals more abrasive, and the songwriting less forgiving. However, I find this shift also led to their most unpleasant traits getting just as accentuated, resulting in what can be generously called a mixed bag.\n\nFortunately, the album manages to start with some of its strongest tracks. \u201cBecoming\u201d is one of the band\u2019s strongest songs as its compact structure does well to highlight the dissonant yet oddly catchy squealing main riff, well-contrasted vocal lines during the verses, and a solid chorus. \u201cStrength Beyond Strength\u201d also manages to be a decent opener despite its sudden crashing introduction thanks to its neat guitar work halfway through and the riff sets on \u201cFive Minutes Alone\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m Broken\u201d are memorable despite the vocals\u2019 overbearing tough guy-isms seemingly going out of their way to distract the listener.\n\nThat obnoxiousness reaches an early peak with the utterly abysmal \u201cGood Friends and a Bottle of Pills.\u201d The slow burn bass line shows some promise but is immediately undermined by the guitars providing harsh supplementary noise and an overall directionless structure that enables Phil Anselmo\u2019s most self-indulgent diatribe on record. The mix of douchebag spoken word and building shrieks is annoying yet oddly funny and there is amusement in its alpha male cuckold narrative lending to some unintentionally homoerotic interpretation with some of the phrases. It\u2019s easily the worst song Pantera ever released, but at least we can take solace in it being less than three minutes long.\n\nThe lingering stink can make subsequent tracks hard to stick around for, but at least it never reaches those depths again. \u201cHard Line Sunken Cheeks\u201d and \u201c25 Years\u201d offer some promise with the former\u2019s dips into slow sludge and the latter\u2019s more sinister riff set, but the structures lack a hook to make them truly stand out. \u201cShedding Skin\u201d also attempts to shake things up with subtle melodic textures, but lacks follow through. I can also admit that the disjointed nature of \u201cUse My Third Arm\u201d and \u201cThroes of Rejection\u201d could be compelling, but just don\u2019t appeal to my personal sensibilities.\n\nBut with all this mayhem running amok, the closing cover of Black Sabbath\u2019s \u201cPlanet Caravan\u201d manages to be quite interesting. It\u2019s a very well-done rendition as its quieter presentation is a pleasant comedown and the band\u2019s less-effects driven approach gives it an earthier touch compared to the spaced out original. However, it bares mentioning that the album\u2019s liner notes included a hilariously defensive paragraph from Anselmo all but apologizing for the song\u2019s inclusion and how it didn\u2019t reflect them going soft. Considering how his other band Down would have an equally melodic original song on NOLA just a year later, I can\u2019t help but wonder if he had a change of heart in that time or if he was unintentionally admitting that he thought Pantera fans were closed-minded meatheads.\n\nMost albums that I consider mediocre are usually just a dull malaise of interchangeably okay songs that only occasionally rise or fall beyond boredom. With that in mind, it is fascinating how Far Beyond Driven\u2019s mediocrity is based more on how it offers things that I love and hate about the band in near equal measure. Perhaps I\u2019d grade it higher had \u201cGood Friends and a Bottle of Pills\u201d been cut, but I could say the inverse had \u201cBecoming\u201d not been here. Even the good songs on here come with their hang-ups and listening to this album feels like a contest between promising ideas and overcompensating attitude. I can understand the significance of what it achieved at the time and the appeal that it still holds for many, but that doesn\u2019t necessarily make it fun for me to listen to.\n\nIf Far Beyond Driven is the Salty Spittoon, then I might have to go back to my Weenie Hut Jr.\u2019s in Power Metal. I\u2019m clearly not tough enough for this.\n",
        "\nIsn\u2019t it funny how if you say or do something ironically long enough, you can start to sincerely believe it? I still maintain that the Star Wars prequels\u2019 resurgence can be directly tied to people memeing the hell out of them in recent years. I could only joke about other dudes\u2019 bulges so many times before I realized that I might actually be bisexual. And to the point of this review, what started out as my tendency to reactionarily hail Power Metal as Pantera\u2019s best album ever seems to have crossed over to genuine belief.\n\nCowboys from Hell certainly deserves its reputation as the album that exposed Pantera to the metal world at large, but this was where all the pieces were put into place. It may be best known as their first to feature vocalist Phil Anselmo, thus solidifying their most definitive lineup, but it\u2019s also the culmination of their evolution during their oft-maligned glam years. Their early emulation of groups like KISS and Def Leppard has completely given way to heavier inspiration from Judas Priest and Metallica, and there are even shades of the groove metal to come on mid-tempo tracks like \u201cWe\u2019ll Meet Again.\u201d\n\nThe musicianship is also some of the most balanced of any Pantera album, bridging the early albums\u2019 flamboyant prowess and the street grit of subsequent outings. While Anselmo\u2019s mix of Rob Halford falsettos and David Lee Roth swagger lacks the quirks that would become his signatures as a vocalist, that is precisely why this is my favorite performance that he\u2019s ever done. His techniques make him nigh unrecognizable but the confidence in his delivery makes it still easy to get behind. And as somebody who gets frequently annoyed by his bravado, his one-liners here are more rooted in silly fun than aimlessly trying to fight everybody.\n\nOf course, the rest of the band still stands out. Previous albums had seen the Abbott brothers\u2019 performances getting gradually stronger and this one sees them at the peak of their powers, Diamond Darrell\u2019s guitar has that southern crunch getting more prominent yet never losing sight of the tight chugs and acrobatic soloing while drummer Vinnie Paul injects his hard rock beats with some faster patterns. Rex Brown\u2019s bass also manages to have more presence than before though it\u2019s not yet the foundational key that it would be through the nineties.\n\nI also find the songwriting to be more consistent than any other album they released, largely avoiding the other glam releases\u2019 limp-wristed trappings as well as the groove era\u2019s experimental bullshit. The one-two punch of \u201cRock the World\u201d and the title track reminds me of the similar start on Slave to the Grind, the former serving as an anthemic buildup to the latter\u2019s double bass-driven onslaught. \u201cOver and Out\u201d and \u201cProud to be Loud\u201d are also distinct winners as each pairs stomping beats with catchy as hell choruses while \u201cHard Ride\u201d adds some lighter AOR flair and a chorus that has shades of Priest\u2019s \u201cRock Hard, Ride Free.\u201d\n\nPower Metal is the sort of album instantly destined for niche appeal, but that niche is one that\u2019s seemingly tailor made to my exact taste. I could make some comment about how great it is if you just view it in a vacuum as some long lost USPM album but even if you compare it to Pantera\u2019s more recognized outings, it serves as a very strong transitional effort. This may not be as innovative as Vulgar Display of Power, but the musicianship and songwriting are some of their strongest of any era. I would never expect a mass scale re-evaluation of Pantera\u2019s eighties albums on par with the Star Wars prequels, but this one is the worthiest of a second thought. At the very least, it\u2019s damn fun to listen to.\n",
        "\nThis is Pantera's second studio album in the latter half of their career, and their sixth release overall. It's a solid and groundbreaking record for both the then-newborn and developing genre of groove metal, and for the 90s heavy metal scene in general. At that point in music, Pantera had practically evolved into their signature style, with much of their traditional heavy metal influences, as well as high pitched vocals being absent from this release and onward.\n\nPhil Anselmo had lost his ability to sing in a higher pitch prior to the recording of this album, and as such, it only contains the classical shouting that's prevalent in such tracks as \"A New Level\", \"Walk\", \"Rise\", \"No Good (Attack The Radical)\" and \"By Demons Be Driven\", and your rare, but apparent clean-like vocals in \"This Love\" and \"Hollow\". Dimebag's occasional soloing in combination with Rex Brown's basslines shows to the music world that they can be quite creative at times, though unfortunately this is the last Pantera release in which Dimebag showcases his immense solo guitar skills, as in later albums his solos are rather simplistic, short in length and watered down. Compared to CFH and any other Pantera effort prior to this album, VDOP exhibits down-tuned bass and guitars, which only adds up to the heaviness factor of it. Part of the reason why the band chose to go heavier is in part due to Metallica abandoning their thrash metal sound at around that period, so this album, in juxtaposition of the 1991 release Metallica (or the Black Album, as it's also known), shows how quickly the tides have turned and who took the torch of playing thrash metal, in addition to the groove factor of course. Also did I mention how the first two Doom video games featured two tracks which are inspired by, and nearly identical to \"Mouth for War\" and \"This Love\"? Yeah, it was THAT influential.\n\nMusically, \"Mouth For War\" starts in a very dynamic and heavy way, not even giving the listener the time to process what's happening while the riff already comes in like it's hitting you in the face, with Phil's vocals only amplifying the overall experience, as his voice blends in perfectly with the rest of the instruments and particularly Dimebag's guitars, thus creating one of the strongest tracks in the album already. \"A New Level\" continues in the same vein as the previous track, with its yet again heavy intro kicking in suddenly and Dimebag showcasing for the first time, though not for the last, in this album just how good of a solo guitarist he could be, with the solo towards the middle of the song being among some of his best. \"Walk\" is the slower, simpler and much more \"radio-friendly\" track that comes right after, and, in a sense, Pantera's \"Enter Sandman\" in terms of popularity and structure, with its riffs being simple yet heavy, and while it's not fast or complex, it's still the better radio hit in my opinion. \"Fucking Hostile\" is the embodiment of its very title, with its music being the personification of a middle finger towards the listener's face, straight-up thrash metal, with the guitar riffs and the aggression shouting \"fuck you\" as much as the whole attitude of the song. The Pantera guys do turn it down a notch for the first time in this album with the semi-ballad \"This Love\" being the next track, with the guitars in the clean part sounding particularly cold and haunting, giving the listener a feeling of melancholy and general gloominess, then the amplified riffs coming in and immediately pumping you up with raw energy, while the song's breakdown is, hands down, THE heaviest part in the whole album. \"Rise\", the next track, has the most sudden and fastest intro out of any song in the album, guaranteed to scare any first time listener shitless, with the switch between the clean outro of the previous track and the beginning of this one being just so quick, it's as if you're walking in the forest, only to suddenly fall into a trapping pit, except that this pit is the entrance to hell itself and at the bottom of it lies lava that will disintegrate anything the moment that it's unfortunate enough to fall in there. The solo in this track is, no doubt, Dimebag's best, with him proving once again that it's as if he was born with that damn guitar in his hands. \n\nFrom here on out, things take a twist and the record slowly dives into mediocrity, with \"No Good (Attack The Radicals)\" showing Phil delivering his vocals in the most diverse way, ranging from his speeches in the verses, to shouts on the pre-chorus to actual singing in the chorus, with his voice also being overdubbed twice, delivering a pleasant experience to the listener. The next two tracks, \"Live In A Hole\" and \"Regular People (Conceit)\", shows the band attempting a, dare I say, musically progressive and experimental approach, with the constant shifting of the rhythm and Rex Brown's bass playing being just insane, with him running around on his instrument, thus creating a bass solo which, in tandem with Dimebag's usual soloing, creates such a harmonious sound, proving to the listener that the two musicians shared a chemistry that was strong. \"By Demons Be Driven\" is truly the lowest point in the whole record, sounding more like a filler track (akin to Metallica's \"Escape\") than something that the band members would intentionally record. Despite it being repetitive, it's also way too long for a track of its kind. Luckily, the listener is gifted with the final track, which is the power-ballad \"Hollow\", with Phil Anselmo singing the cleanest he could for this song. As opposed to \"This Love\" where the guitars sound haunting and creepy, \"Hollow\" is clearly in the sadness territory, with its structure being similar to almost any Metallica power-ballad (for example \"Fade To Black\" and \"Welcome Home (Sanitarium)\"), with the song slowly building up towards the heavier part that comes on towards the end, leaving the listener with feelings of overall depression and grief, while the guitar slowly fades away into the darkness.\n\nLyrically, aside from the known sentiment of Phil and Co. being balls-deep in their testosterone-fueled obsession with all-things-masculine, there's also this softer and more socially conscious side to them, with \"Rise\" and \"No Good (Attack the Radical)\" in particular describing issues pertaining to racial prejudice and calling for all creeds of people to unite, and \"Hollow\" being about remembering the legacy of a dear friend who had passed away. \"Fucking Hostile\" criticizes mainly religion, but also calls out the hypocrisy of the law. \"By Demons Be Driven\" also calls out organized religion. Not all examples are that good though. \"This Love\" tries very hard at being a love ballad, but it kinda fails at that, and the rest of the songs are just about your typical, macho-oriented rambling about being a tough guy who's untouchable and unfuckable with. While the latter example isn't as bad and such lyrics can be creative and interesting at times, it kind of gets old if repeated a lot.\n\nOverall, Vulgar Display of Power is a damn fine listening experience from start to finish, with the record having its ups and downs, highs and lows, and of course, its strongest and weakest points as well. So, next time that you want to, say, work out, blast this album as loudly as possible to help yourself pump that muscle even faster, or if you stub your little toe on the cupboard, remember that yelling as loudly and swearing as much as Phil Anselmo does will help with soothing your pain much quicker.\n",
        "\nPantera, in my humble opinion, is the single most over-Hated band in all of metal. I understand that their sound is commercially viable and their celebrity status exploded with 1992's Vulgar Display of Power, but I see this more as a symptom of catchy songwriting and possessing the right ingredients than the band being sellouts. If anything, the band grew out of their sellout phase with Power Metal (though that album is pretty good, too). \n\nThe truth of the matter is that Pantera is a group of four superb songwriters, one of which being Dimebag Darrell, one of the most creative and musically gifted guitarists of all time. His exceptional playing is felt on every song here, from the sorcerous solo on \"Psycho Holiday\" to the licks on \"Heresy.\" But man, the riffs of this album are simply crushing! The power chords on \"Cemetery Gates\" are by no means flashy, but they fit smoothly with the heartfelt vocal performance by Phil Anselmo. The signature pinch harmonics embedded throughout numerous different riffs (particularly on this song) add nice contrast, but even without them, Dimebag's guitar acrobatics are on full display. The tone is heavy and the riffs are generally complex, although often rooted in a similar style. While this would later become a problem for the band, in 1990 it wasn't. And just catch the duel between Anselmo and Dimebag at the end of \"Cemetery Gates,\" I mean who thinks of that?\n\nFor the most part, with the exception of Exhorder's Slaughter in the Vatican and maybe some Fear Factory albums, groove metal was an incredibly niche genre that thrived mostly in the minds of Pantera fans. Grunge was the shit in the early-'nineties, not groove metal. But Cowboys from Hell is about as perfect as the groove metal experiment could be performed. Riffs like \"Domination\" and \"Message in Blood\" just have that feel to them, it's hard to put a finger on what it should be called, but groove metal seems to fit best. Dimebag's innate ability to write head-bangable riffs is the driving force behind this album, and every song follows this formula without getting repetitive.\n\nThe other force on this monstrous record has to be the vocals, because wow are they unique. Phil Anselmo has a powerful voice, deeply rooted in a Texan accent. By no means is he a great singer, but he has the attitude and gruff quality in his voice that just works for some metal bands. He does let off a couple well-held notes on \"Shattered,\" but this is generally the exception and not the rule. His voice is best when it's telling (somebody) to lick his sack, and it's best served as a compliment to Dimebag's ridiculously catchy riffing. Couple this with Vinnie Paul's very solid drumming and Rex Brown's thorough bass lines serving as foundation for the rest of the music to pile on top, and the band sounds incredibly tight here. \n\nThe band is far from one-dimensional, though this is a popular complaint for Pantera. \"Clash with Reality,\" for example, sounds nothing like most of the other material on here, but things like this are overlooked by the absurd amount of Pantera haters. Point is, Pantera inspired countless young metalheads with Cowboys from Hell, and this album should be remembered as a milestone for metal's evolution. The playing is great. The songwriting is great. Vocals kick ass. Seriously, why is this record hated so much? Whatever the reason is, this one's going to be spinning until the day I join Dimebag in Hell.\n",
        "\nI really don't want to step up and defend Pantera, a band I think got significantly worse after this album, (except Great Southern Trendkill), but it's kind of true that Cowboys From Hell is a unique entry in their discography. As time went on, they ventured further into groove and moved away from sounds rich with classically heavy influences like Judas Priest and speed metal, which could be pointed to on Power Metal and on here. Personally, I think their descent into groove metal is the worst move they made, and while it was commercially successful, I do believe that this album stands as a \"what could have been\" exercise, at least for me.\n\nFirst of all, this album isn't focused on brutality and tough guy macho shit above all else. There's some really good, thoughtful, and somber lyricism on here such as Cemetery Gates, which also features interesting guitar melodies and some of Phil's best singing. Of course there are some groovy, moshy rompers like Primal Concrete Sledge, this is a metal album after all, and despite it hinting at what's to come, I actually think it works pretty well in the context of an album as varied and dynamic as this. Primal isn't overcompensating with \"I'm so tough, I'm gonna fuck your mom\" vibes like so much of their later stuff. Phil actually fucking flexes his pipes on here, (shocker), and he's just amazing. His scintillating highs on Shattered made it one of my favorites on here. His singing voice is simply leagues better than those wannabe death metal growls of the CfH successors.\n\nA lot of licks Dimebag and the band uphold have this bluesy, southern rock-tinged goodness about them which, for me, contributes to this album being kinda timeless. There's just so much going on here and if one really digs, one can probably find something pleasing, even if one thinks they hate Pantera. Show some of these tracks to a thrasher from 1987 and he'll love it, a redneck could have a hoe down to the title track no fucking problem, and metalheads of yore will appreciate the subtle hints of their more standard glam/speed metal years which still linger here. It's really hard for me to imagine someone hating every single track on here, because it's just such a varied and dynamic experience.\n\nIt's not without flaws, I will freely admit that not everything on here is truly masterpiece material. The production is also not for everyone, as it clearly apes Metallica's And Justice For All with its scooped guitar tones and sterile sound, though Cowboys does have bass on it. I'm not that fond of Message in Blood and Psycho Holiday, they're just so-so cuts which chug along and don't do all that much for me. But the peaks of this release are just so damn high that I'm inclined to accept them as part of the experience. Syncopated thrash bangers like Domination simply justify those \"meh\" ones for me.\n\nThis album just has such a vast array of influences which coalesce often in really great ways. Why didn't they do it again? I don't feel betrayed, because this album will always exist to please my hunger for that groove/thrash sound Exhorder pioneered. I just wanted another one, that's all. They didn't reinvent the steel here, but they brought forth the shotguns and the cavalry for sure. Cowboys From Hell is a great album.\n",
        "\nLike Slayer with Divine Intervention, in mid 1990's Pantera also had something to prove. They were outdoing themselves to top 1992\u2019s Vulgar Display of Power, helluva record to say the least. Band members in interviews accompanying the release of their 7th full-length announced an album even faster, heavier and angrier than Vulgar. \n\nAnd they weren\u2019t lying. The opening track, \u201cStrength Beyond Strength\u201d is like a grenade exploded in your face. That\u2019s really a step forward in the extreme direction from the punch in the face (see cover art for Vulgar). Words stronger than all are also heavily accentuated \u2013 Pantera is ready to hit you even harder than the last time! Strength isn\u2019t all that makes us tick, though. Nothing\u2019s more important than good songs and fitting production, and \u2013 in case of bands like Pantera \u2013 some degree of progress. I\u2019ll rush to the conclusion that it\u2019s all there on FBD. Good songs? \u201cStrength Beyond Strength\u201c, \u201c5 Minutes Alone\u201c, \u201cI\u2019m Broken\u201c, \u201cShedding Skin\u201c, \u201cUse My Third Arm\u201c were my instant favorites. With time, I got caught in the groove of \u201cBecoming\u201c, \u201cHard Lines... \u201c, \u201cSlaughtered\u201c. \n\nThat leaves us with four songs; \u201cPlanet Caravan\u201c serves as a soothing close to a very heavy album and I can take it as such. However, \u201cGood Friends and a Bottle of Pills\u201c works only at first listen \u2013 this minimalist confession of a drunken dickhead (to another drunken dickhead) seems rather disturbing than \u2018cool\u2019 at further listens. \u201cThroes of Rejection\u201c sounds like a forced song, definitely subpar by Pantera standards. And \u201c25 Year\u201cs, the last song not mentioned so far is perhaps the album\u2019s weakest point. That\u2019s basically 6 minutes of heavy rap, I can take it sometimes, but overall it seems redundant. \n\nI have definitely more positive than negative feelings toward Far Beyond Driven, but it\u2019s one of those albums which would be 50% better had some of its phantom limbs (i.e. redundant tracks) been cut off. Notice that even some of the good songs are long (esp. for such an intensive, heavyweight act as Pantera) \u2013 \u201cHard Lines... \u201c clocks in at over 7 minutes, while \u201c5 Minutes Alone\u201c and \u201cShedding Skin\u201c are seconds shy from the 6 minute mark. That comes to a whopping 56:26 of total playing time for a really heavy and exhausting CD.\n\nBottomline: good stuff, however would\u2019ve been much better if the album was 15-20 minutes shorter.\n",
        "\nThis is probably my favorite Pantera release of all time! I love the riffs on pretty much all of the songs, those only 1-2 tracks that I'm not fond of but overall I thought this a more than average perhaps one of the most memorable Pantera releases in their entire discography for me! This album is just charged with energy as well! These guys were pretty heavy on here...guitar wise and the bass is loud enough to hear. I like the vocals as well. Everything seemed to mesh in here for a good portion of the tracks. I like the solos too, they were another highlight. Some of the best riffs that Pantera had ever come up with were on here!\n\nThis release came out when I was in High School, I had it on cassette. I didn't mind playing it often since I was heavily into the guitar. Dimebag was a big influence on me back then. Now 27 years later I'm still digging the music but I've abandoned the guitar. Or it abandoned me. In any case, these songs weren't the easiest to play, they were quite challenging. And the leads were out of this world. Some of the greatest groove metal riffs I've ever heard! They just got it down in terms of the music and Phil does a great job on the vocals. The whole band contributed to making this a mountainous masterpiece!\n\nIt sucks that Vinnie Paul and Dimebag are gone. They made Pantera and they can (I don't think) ever duplicate this lineup. It's useless to ponder because it's true. Anyway, the music is entirely original and catchy. Songs like \"Strength Beyond Strength\", \"Shedding Skin\" and \"Slaughtered\" are my favorites. But as I said, most of the songs I liked, just those three I like the most. Dimebag was one of a kind with the riffs and leads no one can replace him! It's a sad fate for Pantera but they made good albums despite them losing their lives. I like their previous releases as well. Just this one is my favorite.\n\nThe production quality captured everything. The guitars, bass, drums and vocals were all mixed in well. And if you don't have this release yet, get it! It's on Spotify and YouTube, but I'm urging you to get the actual CD! There's just so many milestone moments on here. It's one not to pass up in showing support to the music scene and lengthening your CD collection! Some great moments, well actually many different moments! The guitar and vocals were phenomenal! I liked this the whole way through just take out some of the useless songs and it'll just be perfect. Own it!\n",
        "\nPantera's 1988 opus \"Power Metal\" succeeded in both introducing Phil Anselmo to the world as well as bridging the Pantera that once was wth the Pantera that would be. It is my favorite release of theirs as well as their best, in my opinion because it combines almost all the influences of the glam-era Pantera with the almost all the influences of the groove thrash-era Pantera, in addition to it being an honest representation of the band and their music. \n\nOpener \"Rock The World\" is a cheeseball but it does immediately inform the listener of Anselmo's vocal range and prowess, which is used to far better effect in the following title track. The music on \"Power Metal\" is pure heavy metal with some hints of glam that are thankfully outweighed by the speed and thrash influences. Anslemo's voice would never sound this good again or be as powerful, and the emphasis on this album is on songwriting and arrangement as opposed to displaying technical prowess. \n\nBoth the riffs and the choruses are memorable particularly on songs like \"Over and Out\" and \"Hard Ride\". More thought is put into mixing and production and it benefits \"Power Metal\" a great deal. It's uniqueness and appeal is the fusion of glam, hard rock, and thrash (sometimes in one song), kind of placing the Pantera of this point in time alongside other bands with a similar approach such as Metal Church and Wrathchild America (who they subsequently toured with) as well as (arguably) \"Beast On My Back\"-era Crumbsuckers.\n\nThis is the 80's so the album ends with the decidedly silly \"PST88\" but the catchiness, memorability and quality of the rest of the songs on this album (including Keel cover \"Proud To Be Loud\") succeed in obscuring and smoothing over any little imperfections or digressions. It is a shame this version of Pantera was largely in the rear-view mirror with the advent of the '90s because it was a legitimately and enjoyable, albeit brief era of the band, the good and the bad of 80's heavy metal being an intrinsic part of both \"Power Metal\" and Pantera itself at this juncture of the band's existence.\n",
        "\nPantera may have never been popular in the underground necessarily, but it's impossible to overstate how much they dominated the 90s. They were the metal band (besides Metallica of course) that everybody knew, and they released four albums that decade, all massive hits with huge singles that dominated rock radio airwaves (less so with Trendkill but that one makes up for its lack of radio success by being the one Pantera album that Extremely Online Metalloids allow themselves to like), and then just... suddenly they weren't. Reinventing the Steel stands out precisely because it doesn't stand out whatsoever. I was a 90s kid that grew up loving the shit out of Pantera, some of my earliest interactions with other people on the internet come from when I was 12 years old and pretending to be 18 so I could join Metallica and Pantera messageboards on Elektra's website, and even then, barely a year after this album dropped, nobody at all was talking about it anymore. It's a strange bunny fart at the end of an otherwise very successful career that even meathead superfans with Confederate flag tattoos and Big Dog t-shirts forgot about mere months later. I want to revisit the album for the first time since Diablo II was released to see if I can suss out why. \n\nUpon relistening, the first thing I was struck by was how fucking good \"Hellbound\" is. Seriously, Trendkill is remembered nowadays as the most venomous and unhinged Pantera album by a fairly wide margin and \"Hellbound\" kicks this swansong off exactly where that classic finished off. It's basically \"Sandblasted Skin\" part two, and from minute zero it acts as buckshot to the face and amps the adrenaline off the fucking charts. You'd be forgiven for expecting the spiritual successor to \"Strength Beyond Strength\" judging by its immediate intensity and short runtime to kick off the album, but... you'd be wrong.\n\nAs good as \"Hellbound\" is, it also immediately signals a huge problem with Reinventing the Steel. \"Strength Beyond Strength\" is meticulously structured in three parts, starting off fast and furious, downshifting into a brutally sludgy slow part in the middle, and building to a fantastically exciting climax that showers you in vitriol. It's by no means novel or unique but it knew what it was doing and executed it very well. \"Hellbound\" on the other hand just... kinda ends. It goes verse-chorus-verse-chorus and then it just stops and moves on to the next song. It's really jarring because Pantera is known for simplistic groovy riffs and an overall aura of lunkhead jocks headbanging on two notes, but apart from a few flukey bad songs they were never really lazy. This sounds like they simply couldn't be fucking bothered to finish writing this song but felt like it had potential to be a good opener when they started writing it so they just went down with that ship.\n\nThe rest of the album suffers from this same problem but in varying ways. Some songs sound like they're just unfinished (like \"Hellbound\", \"Death Rattle\", and \"We'll Grind that Axe for a Long Time\") while others sound like they weren't workshopped at all and just recorded the first riff Dimebag could think of with no tweaking or variation across repeats (like \"Yesterday Don't Mean Shit\", \"Uplift\", and \"You've Got to Belong to It\"). Dime was always good at solos and shit at riffs, but he's never been shitter at riffs than on tracks like those. Reinventing the Steel winds up being surprisingly difficult to talk about simply because so little actually happens in it. It very much stinks of a band that can't stand to be in the same room together and just wants to get recording over with. It's pretty telling that this is a good ten minutes shorter than anything else from their groove era. You'd think this would be a good thing since there's always been a filler track or two and it's hard to groove for a solid hour without getting bored, but really it's a result of the band clearly wanting to just put this behind them and get out as fast as possible.\n\nIt's impossible to truly take this album in a vacuum because the behind the scenes drama shines through so effortlessly. It's well known that tensions within the band had been running extremely high for a long while by this point, with the Phil Anselmo being a strung out belligerent junkie and the Abbott brothers wanting nothing more than to cut bait and leave him out in the cold. If the few paragraphs of Rex Brown's autobiography that I found previewed on Google can be believed, the brothers themselves were also just genuinely unintelligent meatheads, with Vinnie being a loudmouth bully and Dime being a perpetually confused dimwit who couldn't handle his money if it was glued to his hands. I get the feeling that three of the four guys (excepting Dime, who by all accounts was a very nice guy who just wasn't too bright) were giant assholes who couldn't stand each other anymore. This tension goes as far back as Trendkill, but intra-band adversity has resulted in artistic brilliance before, likely the most famous being Fleetwood Mac's Rumors but even within the realm of metal you've got Painkiller or Persistence of Time being birthed from similar circumstances. The difference seems to be that after that tortured work of stressed out genius, there's either a notable member parting ways or the band just breaks up. Pantera made the critical mistake of trying to do this twice, because Reinventing the Steel shows what happens when the album in question acts as neither a catharsis nor an exit door for unhappy members, and they try to just \"stay together for the kids\", as it were. Trendkill was dark and violent and explosive, Steel is just a paycheck that nobody really wants to bother with anymore.\n\nAs a result, this album sounds exactly like what you'd expect given that knowledge. The band is on the verge of total collapse, the trademark great album that can sometimes happen when these conditions are met had already happened, nobody wants to be here and nobody wants to really try. Vinnie shines on \"Hellbound\" and one weird off-kilter bit in the bridge on \"Uplift\" but otherwise he's just going through the motions, Dimebag had precisely two standout riffs under the solo on \"Death Rattle\" and the intro to \"I'll Cast a Shadow\" (the former being most well known nowadays for being featured in an early episode of Spongebob Squarepants, which might seem bizarre but it's honestly the best riff on the album by a canyonesque margin so whoever chose to include that riff is a genius) and (for the first time) zero exciting solos, Phil's vocals flip flop between strained and uninterested, none of the songwriting has that tightened polish that their earlier albums had, everything is just a dull simulacra of what Pantera used to be. \"Revolution is My Name\" stands as one of the only enduring tracks from this release despite not being particularly good, and I think it's because it's the most Pantera-ish song out of all ten tracks. Even though it's pretty boring on the whole and the squealy bit in the intro is obnoxious, it at least sounds like a fully thought out song with a catchy chorus that wouldn't have sounded out of place as a weaker song on Vulgar Display of Power (or alternatively, a filler song on a late-era Lamb of God album). Unfortunately most of the album is just lazy and uninteresting. \"You've Got to Belong to It\" and \"Uplift\" are some of the worst tracks Pantera ever laid to tape, \"Goddamn Electric\" and \"It Makes Them Disappear\" might as well not exist for all the adrenaline they fail to produce, \"Hellbound\" is promising but clearly unfinished, et cetera forever. I know it's uncool for underground metalheads to like Pantera, but I think it's telling that the underground hate is usually directed at Vulgar Display of Power or Far Beyond Driven while nobody can muster up enough bile to even acknowledge Reinventing the Steel. Pantera was divisive, but they were unmistakable and everybody has a hot take about their early 90s era. By 2000, they were, for the first time since their oft-forgotten glam era, completely skippable.\n\nWe all know how this story ends. It took three years after release, but Pantera finally split for good after this album, with Phil and Rex focusing on Down full time while Vinnie and Dimebag formed Damageplan. Any future fantasies of a reunion were dashed completely when Dimebag was tragically murdered onstage in 2004, and their legacy was firmly cemented for better and worse. Reinventing the Steel is honestly just sad. It didn't need to be released and it certainly shouldn't have been the band's swansong. It's a pitiful non-album with painfully few bright spots but is mostly droning and ugly. Like them or not, Pantera was an inescapable force of nature in the 90s, and the storm ended with nothing more than a little spittle before subsiding forever, and it turns out the old adage about it being better to burn out than fade away is entirely true.\n\n\nOriginally written for Lair of the Bastard\n",
        "\nI really like Power Metal and The Great Southern Trendkill; I like Cowboys From Hell even more because it sounds more like a part of that late, great, '80s American thrash era. This album is a real disappointment, though. For me, it's comparable to hearing the first two [excellent] Metallica or Annihilator albums, then being underwhelmed by those groups inconsistencies, afterwards.\n\nIt's not a complete throw-away, though \u2013 there are a few good songs which I really enjoy cranking up to full-blast. This includes 'Mouth for War,' which has some good mid-tempo riffs, change-ups and snappy lead play. The other two are 'Fucking Hostile,' with its fierce thrash riffing, as well as 'Rise,' which has a vibrant thrash intro, followed by a mix of mid-tempo and full-on thrash riffing. It shows that they were capable of thrashing-it-out; if more of the songs had this up-tempo approach to songwriting, it would be an album to rival Cowboys.\n\nTo my dismay though, most of this album is chugging break-down, with some of Darrell 'Dimebag' Abbott's excellent lead play added at the appropriate moments. Its true nature is established very early on with 'A New Level,' which has a slow unexciting riff intro, appearing at regular intervals. And, its chugging nature epitomizes most of this album. One of the obvious culprits is the hit song 'Walk'. It just chugs along in an uninspiring fashion. This is confounded by Phil Anselmo's vocals, which lack the power, charisma and intonation which elevated Cowboys.\n\nThere are a couple of other decent parts, mixed in with the not so decent. An example of this is 'Regular People,' with its groovy intro, (which also drives the chorus) but Anselmo's monotone doesn't add much to proceedings. The best way to approach this is to enjoy the intro and Abbott's solo. Another example is 'Hollow,' which uses a vibrato over clean appergio to create atmosphere \u2013 and it initially works well. However, it falls apart in the vocal delivery and the ending is anticlimactic. Overkill's 'Solitude' is an example of this style done properly.\n\nAnother decent aspect is Vinnie Paul's blend of groove and thrash drumming, although, the drums don't have that snap or sharpness present on Cowboys. It's all a bit hollow sounding and this might be a technical decision based on the way the guitars are tuned down a whole step [at least I think they are] to create more heaviness. These decisions just make the entire production sound completely gutted and hollow; guitar notes just don't sound clear enough and they don't have that cutting-edge sharpness standard tuning can produce.\n\nThis era in the groups history has me speculate that their change in style was due to a shift in the metal landscape. Also, the success of Metallica's TBA may of had an influence on their direction of travel, as well. This album is mostly chug-chug, break-downs, with a lack of good riffs and compositions. It's way too inconsistent and very disappointing \u2013 at least I've got Cowboys From Hell, though.\n",
        "\nThere was a time when I legitimately dug Pantera, especially this one and Cowboys. However, there was also a time when I legitimately dug Big Bird, and Pantera is definitely the Big Bird of my musical tastes. Don't get me wrong: it's not that I can't \"take\" it - I'm a metalhead first and foremost, for better or worse, and black/death metal's been my jam since I was, like, twelve - but rather is it that there's simply nothing on offer here for me as a grown-ass man, and all of the veils that adorned this album hiding its reality fell away some time in my early twenties.\n\nI get that Pantera's one of the most widely-beloved of bands in the annals of metal, I really do, but goddammit, y'all: this shit is just basic. It's an album of unremarkable, blues-based songs that, musically, have nothing to say, an incompetent tapestry of cliche woven together from the simplest shreds of the bigger underground metal acts from the previous two decades, and it's all dressed up in gigantic, multi-tracked guitars, persistent double-kick drumming, and knuckle-dragging, self-important, macho jailhouse posturing. It's breakdown after lumbering, three-chromatic-chord breakdown, interrupted by occasional bursts of lowest common denominator thrash metal or an all-too-logical clean guitar line in a failed and transparent attempt to introduce dynamic. It's a monument to all of the worst American blue-collar \"masculine culture\" stereotypes, only a single rung on the ladder up from the likes of Limp Bizkit as far as both rising from and perpetuating the shit. Classist, you say? Yep, and it has nothing to do with money and everything to do with intelligence, and you'll find none of the latter herein.\n\nMy main complaint, vitriol aside, with Vulgar Display of Power is that it's just trashy. Strike that: it's the wrong kind of trashy. I like plenty of trashy shit: Cock and Ball Torture, Sutcliffe Jugend, the New York Dolls, you name it. The difference, to me, is that the aforementioned groups make no bones about what they're doing. All of those examples are of artists who are/were knowingly extreme in some way, be it in sheer sonic depravity, aesthetics/thematics, raucousness, or all three. Pantera, on the other hand, don't knowingly do anything. There's no concept here. There's no art. There's no spirit, and if I'm listening to an album and all three of those things are absent, then it better be so blatantly commercial/glossy that nobody could even begin to accuse it of having any kind of aspirations otherwise.\n\nPantera's goal was, I'm sure and like most other legitimately metal bands, to capture the essence of grandeur and will-to-power and Faustian yearning that represent the godhead of the genre; they just interpreted those things with a skewed perspective, through an emotionally- and intellectually-stunted weltanschauung innately at odds with metal's elemental characteristics. I'm not accusing them of being posers, merely idiots. \n\nThat being the case, is it their fault? In all honesty, probably not. Does that excuse them for Vulgar Display of Power and the strain of anti-intellectual, self-entitled trailer-baiting in metal that it begat in the '90s? My knee-jerk response is a terse \"nope\", but then again, maybe we, the metal community at large, are the ones at fault for buying into this shit, even if only temporarily, and allowing it to metastasize the way it did.\n\nDon't believe garbage, don't buy garbage, don't be garbage.\n",
        "\nI've never been a GIGANTIC Pantera fan, but I did listen to them quite often in my beginner metalhead days, and this song was one of my absolute favorites by the band, and it still is, definitely on my top 5 songs by them. Piss is a damn smacker. It grooves, it's catchy, and it's badass.\n\nSure, Pantera has some cringe vibes because of their \"tough man\" \"dad metal\" type shit, (that's a fact) but this song is honestly far from those cringe aspects. It's written greatly, and it truly deserves to be as \"tough man\" as it wants to, because the song itself matches that mood perfectly. \n\nOriginally this was supposed to be included on the Vulgar Display of Power album, but didn't for some reason, it should've been on it though, it would've been really popular back then as it is now. Such a underrated song although it probably isn't at all. Even though it didn't appear on the album, the song is definitely my favorite from it, because it was made during the album's creation.\n\nThe main riff is INCREDIBLY catchy. This isnt one of Pantera's average makeshift decent groove riffs, this riff grows on you drastically the second you hear it. It's catchy, catchy as hell. Straight up. The song is mid paced for pretty much it's entire length, but it manages to change up a few times so it's more interesting. It starts with the hooking riff, then slows down a little and grooves even more, then goes back to the main riff and adds in some cool drum patterns and end melodies. There's even a solo, super cool. The solo I wouldn't say is AMAZING, but it's definitely great. The guitar work is awesome, straightforward, catchy, and makes great use of the grooviness.\n\nVinnie Paul's drumming is super cool here. It may be more on the simpler side, but I personally like it alot. He does a pocket beat, then goes to mid paced double kicking, and back to pocket. It fits the groove of Dimebag's guitar big time, it goes together. The drums are nothing amazing, but I like them big time. Super fun to play on drums too, I remember playing this song dozens of times back in the 8th grade, and it sure was a blast. Along with the guitar playing and it's groove, the drums make this song catchy too.\n\nAlthough Anselmo sounds nearly identical on every Pantera song/release, I gotta say I really like his vocals here. They sound different for some reason, in the aspect of being better as usual. This song is about anger towards an idiotic person, so I guess he wanted to be more straight up with the mood of it. He may not have much range when it comes to the groove era of Pantera, (range meaning that he always sounds the same, not in the way of his work on songs like Cemetery Gates) but on this song specifically he does a great job, better than usual I'd say although it isn't nearly that different from his regular self here.\n\nI'm not one to care or talk about lyrics at all, but the lyrics on this song are definitely worth mentioning.\n\n\"I'd leave him physically crippled\nWithout a leg to stand\nI'd throw that trash away\nBecause a runt like that is piss in the wind\nMy fist would be the decider\nI wasn't raised a fool\nI'd stomp his ass for free\nBecause a punk like that is piss in the wind\"\n\nI absolutely love these lyrics, ALOT. Another reason why Piss is so catchy, the music may already be that; but these rememberable and relatable lyrics are so great. Whenever I read/hear them, a giant smile shows up on my face. I think to myself \"Wow, I love this, lmao. This is awesome. Makes me happy.\" This song is about beating up worthless douche bags that think they're the shit, referring to them as \"PISS in the wind\", because they're legitimately worthless and are reminiscent to literal piss. Especially these days, people are starting to act like wannabe gangster hood rats for absolutely no reason, and most of them are worthless douchebags that think they're all cool, and this song is an anthem towards people like those. Idiots definitely don't deserve any pity at all, and this song describes exactly that. Of course it doesn't always have to be a wannabe gangster, just your general cuckfaces that present themselves to be hard, when they're disliked by alot and are general assholes. People like this can't and shouldn't be tolerated.\n\nIf you've got ME talking about lyrics, then that means I really like the song, or you did a great job getting your message through, because I swear I couldn't care less about lyrics. I'm here for the music and only that. These lyrics are awesome and great, rememberable as hell and you'll be able to fully recite them once you know this song. \n\nI sadly had to take out a 1% and give this a 99% only because sometimes the kick drum can be pretty loud in the mix; since this was originally intended to be a song on Vulgar Display, the album has a loud kick drum that's excruciating most of the time. Other than that, there's absolutely zero issues with this song.\n\nAt the end of the day, I'm not a giant fan of Pantera, not at all. I listened to them alot when I was a beginner metalhead, these days I never listen to them at all, sometimes I will, but on the average? Nope. Never. Just a nostalgia band that I'll listen to when I'm in the mood. This song specifically I love, alot. It has personality, it's catchy, it's rememberable, it has all the awesome aspects possible. I'm not into any full Pantera albums other than Cowboys From Hell, I only like a handful of songs from all the other albums past that one. If I'm writing a review for a song, that has to mean something. I wouldn't be writing this if I didn't love this song itself. Pantera fanboys are fucking cringey as shit and I can't tolerate their fanbase for the most part, but Piss is such an amazing track, I have to appreciate it for what it is.\n\nMost of Pantera's stuff is pretty repetitive and not that interesting in my opinion, and they're not that special except for a few certain tracks on all the albums. I am not even an avid listener of the band, not any more actually. But THIS, Piss; is a beauty. Incredibly great song that deserves all and any attention it gets. It's a shame that pretty much all the reviews this has are negative. Yeah, Pantera sure is cringe at a lot of times, but this song is deserving of the \"tough boy\" attitude and isn't bad. This is a perfect song for a moshpit, and I'd throw down.\n\nPiss is an essential Pantera song, absolute smacker and forever a favorite of mine. Couldn't care less about the band these days, but Piss I will always love and care for.\n",
        "\nIf I had to pick one album from the cool side of Pantera's discography (from \"Cowboys From Hell\" on), that would probably be \"The Great Southern Trendkill\". Pantera's outputs in the decade 1990-2000 were all consistent and well-written albums, but \"The Great Southern Trendkill\" stands as the most extreme, passionate and groovy of their catalogue. The record was written during the most tense phase of the band, when Phil Anselmo and the rest of the guys barely talked to each other (indeed, they recorded their respective parts in two separated studios). \n\nThe bad blood flowing between Phil and Pantera at the time resulted in the Texan ensemble's angriest and most hateful opus, as it's made clear since the first second of the opening track, where Phil goes immediately all out with a visceral scream that could make burst out the lungs and the throat of an average person. Phil's vocals rely much more on shouts, screams, yells and even occasional growls than in any other Pantera record, although his gritty melodic singing is still present. When he employs it, he sticks to a mid-low register, with great results, as seen in \"Suicide Note Pt.1\" and \"Floods\". These two songs are quite unique among Pantera's discography, the first one being a completely acoustic ballad featuring some synth effects, and the second being once again a mainly acoustic piece, including what is considered to be Dimebag's best solo to date.\n\nComing to Darrell's riffing, it's more primitive and animalesque than ever during the most frenzied parts, including a lot of natural harmonics, pinch harmonics, and a crushing groove, but without forgetting the importance of melody, thus making songs like \"War Nerve\" or \"Drag the Waters\" the definitive groove metal tracks. This wouldn't be possible without the cohesive action of Vinnie's drumming and Rex's trademark bass lines, providing a real wall of sound along with Dimebag's guitar. The guitar sound is extremely distorted, and it's furtherly enriched by the use of various effects and of the digital pedals, that prove crucial to build some of the record's best riffs (just think to \"Suicide Note Pt.2''). Dimebag also experiments with the guitar tuning, and indeed the last two songs of the album are played in Drop-G, featuring some incredibly groovy and sludgy riffing. \n\nThe platter itself is rock-hard solid: you have bone-crushing, thrashy assaults (the title track, \"Suicide Note Pt. 2''), slow and goddamn groovy pieces (\"War Nerve\", \"Drag the Waters\", the two closing tracks), calmer and acoustic songs (\"Floods\" and \"Suicide Note Pt. 1\"): really, this album has everything, each track is worth mentioning, and it sees Pantera experiment both on a musical and on an emotional level, shifting the mood from disquieting, to hateful and furious, to melancholic depending on the song or the section. \"The Great Southern Trendkill\" is one of the best groove metal albums out there, and it represents yet another gem among Pantera's excellent discography. Absolutely recommended.\n",
        "\nOne of the greatest Pantera albums in my humble opinion. So much undeserved hate goes towards this album, and is generally the most overlooked album in Pantera's (revised) catalogue. This is among Pantera's heaviest albums; crushing riffs and grinding drum grooves left, right, and center. Like all of Pantera's albums, this album does not feature any \"filler\" songs, as each of them are memorable and uniquely different, yet refreshingly similar. This is also probably Pantera's best production and mix in their catalogue, and they've been able to maintain that raw and unrefined sound. It's so refreshing hearing these older bands, as most of the bands nowadays have over-produced their albums to the point where you can't hear any character or anything unique - they're all starting to sound the same.\n\nI'll start off with drums - The production is excellent; the snare is a thunderous clap/crack that isn't overpowering, and the kick drums are a perfect mix between a click and a thump. It's not quite as clicky as Far Beyond Driven, but it's certainly no deep thump either - it cuts through the mix perfectly. Vinnie's grooves are also just insane on this album. There isn't as much double-bass wankery, and the emphasis is really on the feel of the song. The drums are played aggressively with simpler grooves, which I think makes it truly heavy. Some highlights are \"We'll Grind That Axe For A Long Time\", \"Hellbound\", and \"Uplift\".\n\nVocals - Phil's voice is a lot more focused on having a clearer voice this time (compared the The Great Southern Trendkill). While still coarse, he sings now with some vocal variation and a melody somewhat. His voice is deeper on this record (his voice seems to have progressively gotten lower on each album). He still features some high-octane screaming on tracks such as \"Hellbound\" and \"It Makes Them Disappear\", but he also has some slightly tamer vocals on tracks like \"Revolution Is My Name\", where his voice bellows more than screams.\n\nBass - The best bass tone on any Pantera record. Period. This is definitely one of the albums where Rex is very audible, which is aided by Dime's slightly more tame tone. Rex is playing with a very over-driven tone, and is like a punch in the face. It sounds punchy but also bellows at the same time, and really adds weight to the mix. As usual, Rex is playing super-tight grooves, and it seems as though he diverts from the main guitar riff more than previous albums, which adds more variation and interest into the songs. By far the best tone is heard on the outro of the song \"I'll Cast A Shadow\", where Rex is most prominent and plays a super groovy blues-inspired riff with a wah-wah effect. Absolutely crushing.\n\nGuitars - What can I say; it's Dimebag! His tone on this album isn't quite as over-saturated and super gain-driven like previous albums, which allows Rex to become more prominent in the mix. Dime's got some really sick riffs on every single song, simple and complex. Solos on this album are mind-blowing, but not as prominent as on previous albums. Reinventing The Steel only features about 4-5 solos, compared to Cowboys From Hell which had a solo on basically every track. I think Dime has really grown as a musician here, and he understands that not every song needs a solo, and he could really tell whether or not it was appropriate. Although I think there could have been a couple more solos. Some amazing solos are featured on \"Goddamn Electric\", \"Yesterday Don't Mean Shi*t\", and \"It Makes Them Disappear\" (a super blues-inspired solo).\n\nOverall, this album is absolutely amazing. The band had great chemistry during this record, Phil even said in an interview that he and Dime were closer than ever when recording this album - and it shows. All the songs fit perfectly, and is a great album to have finished off their almighty run as a band. The only things I would want from this album is a couple more guitar solos, and maybe a softer song to break up the heaviness that ensues the whole record. Otherwise, this album is near damn perfect, hail the kings of metal!\n",
        "\nI love Pantera. From Power Metal to Reinventing the Steel, Pantera's discography is one of the most consistently entertaining and enjoyable of any metal band. But this album, The Great Southern Trendkill is Pantera's magnum opus, for a few reasons. Up until 1996, Pantera had garnered huge commercial success with their 3 previous releases and had become one of the biggest names in heavy metal, but now Phil Anselmo had a heroine addiction. This combined with Phil's anger towards the media and society created what I would call the first genuinely angry Pantera album. My biggest bone to pick with the 2 albums before this was, although musically great, the anger in Phil and the band as a whole felt fake. Now Phil and the band is actually angry, and this genuine anger proves to be very effective. \n\nThe start of the album has the ripping title track, which maintains the groove metal ideology but the aggression of Pantera is kicked up a notch. After the listener gets a feeling of what the album will be like, War Nerve, Phil's angry song against the media, hits the listener with a groovy, brilliant riff, and this song is angrier than the last. Phil begins the song screaming \"FUCK THE WORLD!\", a very on the nose message, but we get this new message: Phil is pissed. Drag the Waters is a very riff based song that any Pantera fan who has listened to the previous albums will love. The first ballady song, \"10's\", has a mesmerizing solo, followed by another angry rant, 13 Steps to Nowhere. Now the next two tracks, Suicide Note Pt.1 and Pt.2 starts as a very ballady song with Phil considering suicide, but then Pt.2 kicks in. This is the absolute most angry song on the album, and the song where anger fuels it from start to finish. Nothing about this song is exceptionally brilliant or technical, but the grooves combined with Phil's angriest screams makes this song one of Pantera's most exciting in their discography. As if this torrent wasn't enough, the faster Living Through Me (Hell's Wrath), displays Phil's anger over his drug problem. \n\nWhat can I say about Floods? It slows down the pace of the album with Dimebag's clean and melancholy riff. This is Pantera's spiritual song revealing mankind's sins and Phil asking for God's wrath, via a world-engulfing flood. Dimebag's verse riff combined with Phil's hostility towards humanity, creates the most sad feeling of any Pantera song, until we get to the solo. The solo that many metalhead rave about, and I can see why. With every bend and squeal of the guitar the solo is backed by a very groovy bass line by Rex Brown, my favorite bass line of his. The solo perfectly displays the melancholy feeling of the song, and then the outro solo, which leaves listeners contemplating all their life decisions and wrongdoings (at least that's how I feel when I hear the outro).\n\nAs this song leaves listeners breathless, this would be a perfect ending to any album, but the band still has two very groovy tracks, which return the sheer anger of the first half of the album. These two songs combine for more than 5 minutes, but after hearing Floods, this feels like the shortest 5 minutes ever. Phil ends The Underground in America famously screaming \"THE TREND IS DEAD!\" repeatedly. The album closes with (Reprise) Sandblasted Skin and the album ends just as furious as it began. This is a new fresh side of Pantera, unseen before and is easily much better than their previous two albums. This album is similar to Cowboys from Hell in a way that it feels new and is a very satisfying listen, making this and Cowboys from Hell my two favorite albums by Pantera. As an added bonus there is no faked \"tough-guy\" aspect in either of these albums. The bottom line is this album is an essential listen for any metalhead, and is the best of Pantera's catalogue.\n",
        "\nApparently, Pantera's 8th album (or 4th in their revised canon) is either an overlooked classic or an instant return to form, as the band aimed to get back on track after the supposed misstep that was Far Beyond Driven. With the band fracturing as a unit at this point, The Great Southern Trendkill, seems to have been released against the odds, those odds being Anselmo's creeping heroin addiction and failing relationship with the rest of the band. The result is an album that manages to out-do the last two albums in the self-pitying, white-angst department, without a single drop of positivity to stem the flow of unadulterated hate.\n\nThere is no denying this release is crammed full of ideas, but they are too often blunt, hookless and arranged in an erratic manner as though to seem intelligent or experimental. The brief moments of genuine entertainment are quickly suffocated by Anselmo's insufferable (and overly layered) pig-like exhalations, and many of the tracks fade in to plodding, mid-tempo passages that showcase the worst aspects of the album: hokey, soulless death-grooving that would come off as comical were it not for your ears being on the receiving end of the joke. And thanks to the genre-essential downtuning, even the speedier sections feel flabby and feckless. The standout appeal of the title track is that, despite the gimmicky yelling, it dives off in to a wholly unexpected but deliciously crunchy southern rocker.\n\nLyrically, the album feels genuine, and I'm sure it accurately paints a picture of Anselmo's mindset at the time. Unfortunately, it manifests itself in basic tropes already covered with sophistication in other genres: a biased media (rap), hard drug abuse (take your pick), and being an angry, white male (punk). As truthful as the lyrics are, they're often also so on-the-nose to the point of parody - exemplified by the \"Suicide Note\" two-parter, and the profane, infantile call-outs to 'the media'. Thankfully, Pantera seemed to regain a sense of humour and (more importantly) some self-awareness for their next and final release, Reinventing the Steel. Hooray for that album.\n\nSo, if you're looking to be bummed-out both lyrically and musically, and want to forget the heady days of \"Shattered\" and \"Fucking Hostile\", then this album is for you.\n\nSpin to Win:\n\"The Great Southern Trendkill\"\nDimebag's solo in \"Floods\" is generally held in high regard, if you can force yourself to listen to the music that bookends it.\n",
        "\nI have always loved a lot of these band's songs, which I had heard over the years at parties, rock concerts, video bars, on the radio, etc. Heck; I could have bought their first three CDs with the money I spent playing those songs from jukeboxes while playing pool -and driving my straight friends bonkers with them in the process; they hated them so much ! I even listened to those 3 albums on home stereos, but apart from those particular songs, the rest of the album songs failed to entice me into buying them; I didn't even particularly liked the way they were recorded. Until one day I stumbled into this comp, and realized all of those songs I had loved so much over the years had been neatly compiled -and painstakingly remastered- on this fantastic piece-of-hell of a CD.\n\nThe CD features a chunky booklet with lyrics for all 16 songs, clocks in at well in excess of 77', and has a ton of pics and a brief but highly interesting story of the band. I particularly loved the first 11 tracks, which are on the CD in chronological order, oldest to newest, taken from their first three records for ATCO (1990-1994 period; Phil Anselmo era), but totally disregarded the punk cover -I never liked Poison Idea in the first place, the song taken from \u00a8The Great Southern Trendkill\u00a8, the song taken from their live album, the one from \u00a8Reinventing The Steel\u00a8 , and their (hideous to me) \u00a8The Badge\u00a8 single. Well, it is hard to like every song on a compilation CD, but the ones that mattered to me were here, and added up to a satisfying 49', making for a great earful of powerful groove/thrash metal. I would personally have picked \u00a8Primal Concrete Sledge\u00a8 over the five ones I did not care for, but that's strictly personal taste, so take it with a pinch of salt; you will probably love the whole disc.\n\nThe remaster is simply breathtaking; more dynamics, fantastic bottom end, clearly audible cymbal work; all the albums lacked, this comp exceeded at sonically. I did not even resort to firing up my subwoofer FFS! Cannot recommend this highly enough, despite those 5 final songs that seem stylistically so different to the rest, but bands evolve, and you take it or leave it. GREAT insight on this band.\n\nThe bonus DVD has their official video clips, presented with interesting visuals, but non-remastered sound, way inferior, but the two live in Moscow songs alone are worth the expenditure.\n",
        "\nI'm having a hard time thinking of a good introduction here so let's just lay out the cards on the table here as simply and bluntly as possible. This sucks, like this is really quite awful. I won't lie, I didnt come here thinking I'd enjoy it, I hate Walk, it has an annoying riff, a grating guitar tone, Phil sounds like a parrot when he sings \"what do you say\", its stripped down midpaced drum approach is boring and the whole song goes nowhere nor has any sense of direction at all.\n\nI knew full well I was going to hate this EP, but I did not think I'd hate it THIS MUCH. For Walk itself just take the previous description but add that the guitar now not only has scooped mids but sounds hollow as well, Phil's vocals were put through a filter seeming to be processed with no intent except to sound processed, there was a pointless air siren on the intro, a gunshot sample at the beginning of the chorus and the siren sound comes back in and then they dragged out the ending. That list of changes is painting it in a positive light because it would be just as accurate and more concise if I said that they screwed up the audio and then added some edgy sound effects. The extended version might be even worse, adding over a minute of siren noises and Phil repeating the word walk way too many times.\n\nThe Walk remix was a Cervical Mix, the next two are the Biomechanical mixes which seem to be almost 20 years newer thanks to rerelease shenanigans, hell I'm basically listening to a whole different EP once track lists are compared. Unfortunately like the 90s mix for Walk they just screwed the audio again, then scooped entire song sections, this can be testified as By Demons Be Driven lost about 24 seconds of run time despite these remixes then replacing the scooped sections with new sections. By Demons Be Driven as mentioned lost 24 seconds of total runtime in this remix however it has this opening with a distorted voice saying \"demon\" over and over again on top of a double pedal drum roll that lasts 55 seconds. Add the lost 24 seconds to the 55 second intro and you've lost over 1:15 seconds of actual Pantera material before accounting for the rest of the track. Fucking Hostile on the other hand went from like 2:40ish to just shy of a 4 minute mark just from them adding a screechy intro simar to the one they gave by Demons Be Driven and rehashing it mid song.\n\nFinally though, after sitting through 4 of those damn remixes and then going through them again to make sure my descriptions are accurate I wind up at the live tracks, the end is finally in sight. Sound quality for these is pretty good, they sound a lot like they do on the album, some sporadic leads are tossed in a few places adding to the lengths of both and Phil has quite a few snips of dialogue to fire up the crowd. The fact this material is drawn from Cowboys From Hell is an upside since its the better of the two albums they could have used (Glamtera days excluded).\n",
        "\nAs a friend of mine noted recently there's two things that fairly stand out about Pantera. One, they got heavier the more famous they got, which as far as I can tell is pretty much completely unique, and two, perhaps in an old rock band kinda style they were surprisingly diverse; fun groovy tracks mixed in with fairly intense bursts of incoherent anger. We can bang on about the fairly deleterious influence they had on metal as a whole, but that's hardly their fault and they were capable of some genuinely interesting stuff- and a lot of said stuff is on their best album, on this album.\n\nWhether you want to blame this album's fury on a bunch of people calling Phil a racist, or on the joys of heroin addiction, or on both, it doesn't really matter because either way it works. Suicide Note Pt 2 is a good enough example, no one would ever claim that the riffs on display are particularly original or technical- or even all that interesting- but the speed, the attitude, and the furious vocal performance makes the tune a certified neck breaker. Possibly the best thing about Pantera here is that more often than not everything locks in well together- the riffs are good enough often enough, Phil is good enough often enough, and the rhythm section continue their excellent streak of form from Far Beyond Driven, tight, often a bit technical but still locking in tight. To refer back to the thing about diversity, after Suicide Note's Pt2, youve got the broken down despair of pt 1, the junkie psychosis of Drag the Waters and Hell's Wrath, a whole bunch of leads ripped straight from Kiss and Van Halen albums, so on and so forth. \n\nYou've also got Floods, which is perhaps close to Pantera's crowning glory, awful clean guitar tone aside. I guess no one ever got into Pantera for the clean tone. Anyway, it's a well written, brilliantly delivered ballad; everyone raves about the lyrical guitar solo and that's fair enough but it's those creaky, kinda dissonant parts at the start that get me going. For a band stereotyped as a bunch of rednecks doing dumb muscle metal I've always felt it's a surprisingly deep, vulnerable, maybe even beautiful tune, and the way it drifts in and out of loud riffing and nervous, tentative clean parts is pretty great.\n\nReally, it's a fascinating album, especially when seen in the context of the band's discography. Watching a band that at one point was pure physical power and motivation, what with Vulgar Display and all, slowly degenerate into the guttural despair that is Great Southern Trendkill is really interesting. Suffice to say I highly recommend this album.\n",
        "\nI like thinking about this album, probably because I'm a pompous windbag but also because it's certainly the heaviest album that ever made it to #1, and by such a huge amount that it boggles the mind the more you think about it. The previous heaviest song on a #1 album was.. Holier Than Thou? Struggle Within? Then out of nowhere you've got the vicious beatdown that is Strength Beyond Strength. It'd be like if the black album came out in 1965 or something.\n\nThe album itself is less interesting than its' historical context, continuing the usual Pantera thing of having a few absolutely banging tunes mixed in with some really subpar half arsed grooves, some vicious, brilliant vocals contrasting with some ridiculous tough guy stuff- it's typical Pantera, to a tee. When they nail it, it's glorious- otherwise you're hitting that skip button as hard as possible.\n\nIt's perhaps a bit more full of filler than Vulgar- 5 minutes alone is one of the worst songs Pantera/anyone ever made, Good Friends completely sucks, and I'm Broken is a hodge podge of nothingness with a catchy chorus thrown in, so on and so forth. A bit too much ego from Phil, and a bit too much fondness of that \"Texan power groove\" or whatever the abbott bros crap on about. \n\nStill, when they get it right it's great. The best two tunes here- that monstrous opening track and the \"well it's kinda one long breakdown but whatever\" that is Slaughtered- seem to draw from the same well, just with different approaches. It's this mix of beatdown-ish hardcore with a few thrash elements, and it's super heavy, extremely fun and a great thing to lift weights to. Is it a bit dumb? Yes, so what? It's brilliant fun to listen to. The production is ramped up somewhat, Dimebag's guitar approaching a new, super scooped, gnarly tone that would lead to a veritable army of terrible teenage bedroom guitar sounds, Rex's bass growling and stomping around, and Vinnie's \"yeah mate this is definitely a sampled kit\" sitting just so- probably his best drum performance, certainly his busiest. Again, when it clicks, it's glorious to behold.\n\nI'd heartily recommend Far Beyond Driven- lower lows than Vulgar Display, perhaps, but higher- heavier- highs. It's worth listening to just for that \"yeah right I can't believe this got to #1\" historical context thingo, and Strength beyond Strength and Slaughtered are worth the price of admission on their own.\n",
        "\nMy memories of Vulgar are a mix of a friend's older brother playing it when I was like 10, and it sounded like the most extreme album in the universe, and losing all my cds but this one in my luggage when I was in Iceland. Driving around all these beautiful glaciers and monoliths and stuff with New Level playing in the background. Suffice to say, I was glad when I found the other CDs.. First Ulver is a better companion to Iceland. Anyway, it was Vinnie's death that got me thinking \"perhaps I should give these guys a decent listen, see what's up with them\". Their boneheadedness is appealing in the right dose- I'd sure as hell take this over Opeth, given the option- and while they may have had an baleful influence on metal as a whole that's not really their fault.\n\nIt's probably a somewhat offensive comparison, but I'd say Manowar are a good analogy to Pantera. Manowar are capable of greatness, and they achieve it a few times per album, but it's a matter of everything clicking, and none of their bad attributes (bass solos, very boring rhythm parts, too much DeMaio, a bit too much cheese etc) coming to the fore. Same wth Pantera. When these dudes click- when the guitar lines are super catchy, when Phil is angry and charismatic without being too OTT they are a massive amount of fun. The album opener is a neato example; it strikes me that it would take deliberate effort and 5 fedoras to not thoroughly enjoy Mouth of War's mid tempo riffs. Or Fucking Hostile, which has some of the dumbest half assed thrash riffs ever but is jammed with enough conviction that it's pretty impossible to deny. Again, when Phil gets it right, like he does on Hostile- he's pretty peerless.\n\nBack to the Manowar thing, when they get it right it's great but when they fall apart, well. There's nothing here that's Warrior's Prayer bad, but there's a lot of stuff that's bass solo level bad, sorta thing. These guys occasionally drop a guitar solo without an overdubbed rhythm guitar track, it's fairly painful to hear the meat of the song drop out for Dime's enthusiastic but not particularly great shredding over Rex's quiet plonking way in the background. Why add the rhythm guitar for some songs but not others?? ????? Moving on, Hollow is a kinda neat but still completely ill fitting bit of mellow noodling, bit of hair metal balladry. By Demons definitely has a proto nu metal feel in that guitar-as-percussion main riff, and sure enough it completely sucks. Regular People's lyrics too-\n\nYou can't see because your head's up your ass \nAnd just in cast you think you're bad \nI crush your rush I rule you fool \nI'm immovable stone in your world of weak \n\ncmon Phil. Ok, maybe that is Warrior's Prayer bad.\n\nAll up- like Manowar really- you're better off getting a few songs off this, a few songs off their other albums and making your own greatest hits compilation. It would likely be an extremely fun greatest hits, too. Vulgar Display of Power has maybe 5 really good tunes, a few ok ones and then 4 or so shit ones. That's not a bad run all up. Worth getting if you see it around, mix up your gym playlist if nothing else.\n",
        "\nAfter reading the other previous reviews of this record, I decided to write my own two cents on Pantera\u2019s fourth and final \u201clost album\u201d. One of the reasons why I wrote this short appraisal of the LP is that a lot of people are likening the sound of Power Metal with GNR\u2019s Appetite for Destruction. While there is a bit of truth to this, the very few hard rock traits in the recording do not really overwhelm the heavy metal elements so much, unlike Skid Row\u2019s Slave to the Grind where the music is held firmly in place by an obvious hard rock backbone (this would be corrected three years later with their best effort Subhuman Race but I digress). The last \u201cGlamtera\u201d output is still very much a heavy metal album and also a cult 80s style metal release in the tradition of Vicious Rumors\u2019 Soldiers of the Night or Tokyo Blade\u2019s Midnight Rendezvous. So no, this is not a heavier version of Guns N\u2019 Roses\u2019 debut but completely follows in the footsteps of good old fashioned Judas Priest, Ozzy Osbourne and Sabbath.\n\nAfter the Terry Lee fronted trilogy of records, there are some noticeable changes on this album. For starters, the production value had an evident improvement; for a self-financed LP, the production on this disc is pretty respectable and adequate. The annoying clicks that could be heard on I Am the Night is now thankfully gone; Dimebag\u2019s dad, Jerry Abbot and Keel guitarist Marc Ferrari did a very admirable job behind the mixing board. Compared to the production on the first three albums, the sound mix on Power Metal is a marked enhancement and is a pure distillation of Pantera\u2019s eighties essence. In fact, Dime\u2019s guitar tone is incredible and has that serrated edge, with the distinct crunch and nice meaty low-end that would later be put to great use on their 90s discs. His shredding skill here is phenomenal and would rival the chops of Poison\u2019s C.C. DeVille and Blues Saraceno; just listen to that sizzling solo on the midsection to \u201cWe\u2019ll Meet Again\u201d and you will gain a newfound respect for this fine lad\u2019s ability and proficiency with the six strings. His riffing is no slouch either as can be heard on \u201cRock the World\u201d, \u201cOver and Out\u201d and \u201cDeath Trap\u201d. The riffs on these songs are typified by fiery, slashing rhythms; Dimebag wields his axe with a deft hand, beheading thrash and tech elitist assholes with a swift swing of its wide, circular blade. Rex Rocker\u2019s bass is somewhat low-key and is contented playing a subtle role in the background but is surely audible on several occasions on a few of the tracks; Vinnie\u2019s muscular drumming and pounding rhythm section provide that thundering base from which the band launches its strategic sonic assaults. He has yet to develop the style which he would be known for on albums like Far Beyond Driven but his percussive abilities on this record is pretty solid.\n\nCompeting for the attention of listeners is clearly Phil\u2019s vocals. His voice here is quite exceptional as he varies between high pitched falsettos and gruff singing; sometimes, his voice slows down to its normal range as can be heard on \u201cWe\u2019ll Meet Again\u201d. He noticeably has a thicker timbre than that of Terry Lee, who has a more \u201ceffeminate\u201d high-end when hitting those high notes. Phil\u2019s vocal style here is almost but not quite similar to his singing on CFH as he uses a lot of chirps and screeches that were kept to a bare minimum on the official debut. The best tracks on the album are \"Death Trap\" (about a Patrick Bateman type serial killer) and \"Over and Out\" which, with a little tweaking here and there, would not have sounded out of place on Cowboys from Hell.\n\nPower Metal is unique among the Glamtera albums in that it is the most \u201cgroovy\u201d; while I Am the Night had hints of US power metal, the fourth record is the first to experiment with the group\u2019s signature \u201cpower groove\u201d approach, perhaps as a result of Phil\u2019s various musical influences that have rubbed off on the rest of the band. Obviously, Phil\u2019s more masculine voice directly contributed to this development in the quartet\u2019s sound and Dime\u2019s exposure to albums such as Kill \u2018Em All and Ride the Lightning also played a major factor in the audio upgrade. \n\nThe album is almost perfect if not for a few flaws. One cannot understand why \u201cDown Below\u201d from the previous album was rerecorded note-for-note with Phil\u2019s vox; the original is alright and works just fine. A different vocal take would\u2019ve been valid if changes to the song were considerable (as is the case with Metallica\u2019s \u201cThe Four Horsemen\u201d), but its inclusion on this record is superfluous and is kind of a slight to Terry\u2019s contributions to the band. Another bone that I\u2019d like to pick is the insertion of Keel\u2019s \u201cProud To Be Loud\u201d which, admittedly is the one song here with an overt \u201chair band/poodle rock\u201d feel (It is actually the one song here resembling something that came out of Appetite for Destruction), but I wished they put in another original composition in its place; still the song is really enjoyable and is not jarring to the album\u2019s flow. \n\nMy closing point on the record is that while it works great as an elite model of 1980s heavy/speed metal, I do not quite agree with the opinion of a few reviewers who say that it\u2019s the best Pantera album (that honor would go to either CFH or FBD). In truth, it is the group\u2019s best glam era album and would\u2019ve given contemporary pretenders to the throne like Motley Crue a run for their money.\n\nTo conclude, Power Metal is a mighty specimen of classic 80s glam metal which is true to the celebrated and thematic conventions of this once thought of as extinct subgenre. It is a forgotten heavy metal gem and a testament to the glorious life of thee Arlington lads and one badass from New Orleans; a band that shaped the heavy music scene in the nineties and are now legends in their own right.\n",
        "\nMost folks agree that 1992 was a very creative year, if not the last creative year for heavy metal. We had breakthroughs in death metal, power metal, doom metal, which was for better or worse starting to morph into stoner metal, the second wave of black metal, and we even had a couple of impressive final gasps of thrash in the form of Tapping the Vein and Epidemic of Violence. \n\nIn the midst of all this creativity, we get the entertaining, but derivative dead-end that is known as groove metal with Vulgar Display of Power. Phil said the idea for Pantera's modern sound was to take a thrash break and turn it into the entire song. The problem was that the thrash break was already a sort of Sabbath/Priest worship bridge; already the inverse of what Sabbath did with songs like Electric Funeral, Into The Void, Under The Sun, where the song would suddenly kick into warp drive and literally thrash the listener for a few seconds. At the very least when thrash bands to an extent decided to turn those moments into a lifestyle it was something new. Vulgar doesn't offer anything new, and certainly not anything that could influence future generations in a positive way. From the clicky double bass drums, to the absurdly scooped midrange tone combined with atonality in riffs, to the beginning of the end of Phil's will to sing, this album does not offer a single original good idea for metal to follow. Lemmy knows the influence this album and Pantera would have. From the erosion of Tuomas Halopanien's riff creativity, to the Gothenberg scene's refusal to properly integrate the building blocks of thrash, to Hatebreed to Korn to Slipknot and a thousand other retarded mallcore and rap metal chumps who turned their suburban white noses up at the likes of the old-school, despite that Black Sabbath was thanked on practically every Pantera album, and Dimebag always wearing a razor around his neck in tribute to British Steel. Not to mention the supremely frustrating notion that 99% of these fools seem to forget that one big reason Dimebag was so respected even while he was alive was his commitment to playing solos. Dime even remarked in a public interview with Zakk regarding an Ozzfest lineup that it was depressing to see that they were the only two guitarists shredding on that entire festival lineup. Talk about Justin Timberlake telling MTV to play more music videos. Even Dirt, which yes, did help begat Nickelback, but mainstream rock will always have schmaltzy trappings to corner the female controlled entertainment market. Pantera poisoned the underground well, the land where trends and fashions should be thrown to the wind and follow their own true, blackened creative souls. This is why Vulgar's legacy is more negative than positive.\n\nSo, we come to the songs. There's actually nothing Angel Dust level offensive like \"Good Friends & a Bottle of Pills\" on Far Beyond Driven. At worst the songs are boring groove metal and at best, spectacular thrash and metal songs. The worst in question are No Good (Attack The Radical), Live In A Hole. No Good features what can only be described as rapping in the former. The thing is, Pantera fans would more or less agree with me that if there was a weak spot on this album, this middle two song sequence would be it. To accuse Phil of following or even innovating the rap trend I feel would be dishonest, considering this song never exactly made waves, and he would never do vocals like this again.\n\nThen there are This Love and Hollow, the ballads. I did always find it amusing that for all the claims of intensity and authenticity, Pantera wrote just as many ballads, if not more than Metallica, the band they were supposed to be replacing in the eyes of the hardcores. This Love has a nifty little mid-paced thrash section around 2:47, but other than that there wasn't anything here that wasn't done better on Cemetery Gates, or latter meditations such as Floods and 10s. Hollow is the slightly more interesting of the two songs, and considering how much emotion Phil shows here I'm surprised it was allowed to make it to the album considering the tough guy rebranding Vulgar was responsible for. Maybe management figured most listeners would be passed out drunk or beaten up by the end of the album. \n\nThe good songs: Mouth For War, Rise, A New Level, By Demons Be Driven. Mouth For War is the slamming hit single the band should have had (for the longest time I thought it was), Rise is a vicious blast of thrash with a little bit of The Camera Eye thrown in for good measure, A New Level is uptempo groove metal done properly and a barrel of fun, and By Demons Be Driven is quite possibly the most underrated song in Pantera's major label catalog. Imagine the mystic atmosphere on songs like Cemetery Gates, Floods, Message In Blood and The Sleep taken to practically Incantation levels of darkness. Yes, there is a bit of cadence pilfering with \"beckon the law/breaking the call,\" but the song is just too much fun.\n\nThe god tier tracks: Fucking Hostile and Regular People (Conceit). Everyone loves Fucking Hostile, and it's not hard to see why. For one thing the song is pure thrash, possibly more so than any other Pantera song. Everything from Vinnie's drum fill toward the solo to Dime's vicious solo to Phil's surprisingly complex lyrics about three different oppressive parties is just perfect, and the damn thing is under 3 minutes long! An Ace of Spades for the 90s, if you will. Regular People is the album's crown jewel, and as far as I'm concerned, so-called \"groove metal\" should have stopped right here. Never has a genre begun and ended in 6 glorious minutes. Most sub-genres allow room for expansion, and even if a particular song perfects the sub-genre early on, it still feels like there is entertainment potential in trying to add to it. Feeling more in common with Phantom of the Opera instead of Epic or Eye of the Beholder, Regular People has all the ingredients of a seminal song; perfect percussive attack, a killer riff and lead performance from Dimebag and cleverly vulgar witticisms and vocal deliveries from Phil (you can't see because your head's up your ass, and just in case you think your bad...I crush the rush! I rule you fool!). But alas, the song is a double edge sword, proving that not everything that doesn't sound exactly like Iron Maiden or Metallica requires it's own sub-genre.\n\nIn conclusion, Vulgar Display of Power is the reality of first time anal sex with your girlfriend without a condom. Sure it may seem exciting, deliciously sinful, and you may even want the thrill of blaspheming religious authority. Metal is supposed to be about breaking rules, isn't it? Fair points, but you also have a much higher risk of contracting disease, or even worse, getting hot poo down your pee-hole.\n",
        "\n\u201cPiss\u201d is a B-side track from the Vulgar Display of Power studio sessions and released as a single, probably to pacify longtime fans wanting a new release from the band (which quite obviously is not applicable at any point in time considering the group\u2019s axeman is now in the 666th Enochian dimension, playing hymns to the lord of the abyss); to be honest, I really don\u2019t understand the logic behind the excavation of this recording. Who would plunk valuable dollars from their bank account just to listen to a very sub-standard song? If Vinnie released Pantera\u2019s equivalent to The Lost Tracks of Danzig or Megadeth\u2019s Hidden Treasures, I would part gladly with my money but this is not the case here and so I have to instead review a Youtube upload for this critique. \n\nOn close inspection, it sounds like a demo for Use My Third Arm and Shedding Skin, merged into one song as both the breakdown riff (used here as verse riff) from the former and a rough draft of the solo from the latter, were originally used on this single. It does show how these bits and pieces of inspiration were later used on the two songs off FBD and is a textbook example of a work in progress and how song ideas and structures were utilized by the band during the songwriting process. I could understand why this wasn\u2019t included on Vulgar Display as the pacing and quality would sound out of place on that album; perhaps though it could\u2019ve been sandwiched between \u201cLive in a Hole\u201d and \u201cRegular People (Conceit)\u201d as those are the tracks which closely resemble this song at the very least. \n\nDimebag is at his element here, clearly comfortable with this style of one-dimensional riffing and bluesy solos at this point in his career, while the ZZ Top influenced groove of songs like \u201c5 Minutes Alone\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m Broken\u201d is yet to be realized at a later date. His simplistic approach here makes the most out of the few riffs used on the track which hopefully would\u2019ve been redeemed by Dime\u2019s shredding tricks but unfortunately even the solo cannot save the song from its intrinsic dullness. On the vocal front, Phil introduces the singing method that would launch the career of nu metal \u201ccrooners\u201d Corey Taylor and Jonathan Davis as well as fellow groove compatriot, Robb Flynn; it can be argued that \u201ctough guy\u201d shouts and growls (as distinguished from the usual death metal type of guttural growling and grunting) were popularized by Phil with Vulgar Display but it is actually Exhorder\u2019s Kyle Thomas who first registered on the radar using this technique. Phil merely took this idea and refined it on VDOP. Thematically, the lyrics are about Phil projecting himself as this street toughie; what he\u2019s trying hard to say here is that he\u2019s going to beat the shit out of anyone who \u201cpiss\u201des him off; I bet though that if this dude finds himself within the ghetto district of Englewood, Chicago, he\u2019d probably get his ass kicked. \n\nIt\u2019s quite sad that Pantera\u2019s legacy continue to be used as a cash cow by Vinnie Paul; that a reject from the VDOP sessions was used to do this is simply unconscionable; the release of this single is a blatant cash grab, plain and simple (it should not have seen the light of day as it is a rough and unpolished work). As for the status of the band itself, there is no sign of any revival anytime soon. There are talks about a reunion but a lot of fans think it is in bad taste to resurrect the group without Dimebag. One could only imagine the unrealized potential of the brothers back in 2004 if they weren\u2019t stuck in a groove/nu-metal rut; if they replaced Phil with a new vocalist, they could\u2019ve entered a new era where they were able to explore the thrash side of Cowboys from Hell with a fresh series of albums. Alas, that is now mere wishful thinking on our part, as some deranged marine shot up a club and the rest, as we knew it, is history.\n",
        "\nMany of the staples of that much hated genre, mallcore aka nu-metal can be traced to this record. Vulgar Display of Power is the album where the cowboys became thug wannabes; the songs are dominated by a very abhorrent mob mentality, similar to a crowd of busybodies loitering in a ghetto street corner. That isn\u2019t the most noxious aspect of the album though, but the virtual abandonment of the previous record\u2019s standards of songcraft were all flushed down the pooper with this release. \n\nCowboys From Hell was practically a metal album that was still firmly rooted in traditional heavy metal. It mixed elements of speed, power, thrash and groove in a blender and arguably became the last flag bearer of classic 80s heavy metal, at least in the mainstream. But obviously, it was a style that had a lot of potential for the band to expand on in future releases. It is very intriguing what Dime and his bandmates would have come up with, for example, if their follow-up to CFH was a full-on speed thrash approach ala Killing Is My Business or Bonded By Blood. Alas, that prospect is banished after the band decided that a generic hybrid of hardcore and Exhorder style groove circa The Law is the way to go. VDOP is a complete detour for the band and is a sign of their desire to forge a new identity, away from the thrash roots of their contemporaries. Vulgar Display is a sort of experimental album where the band members try their hand at something new and completely different; I consider this album as a \u201cnecessary evil\u201d to pave the way for their groove opus, Far Beyond Driven, in that they took the junk that was on this album and alchemically transmuted it into heavy metal gold later on FBD. As an example of this, \"By Demons Be Driven\" is a very crude precursor to the next album's \"Throes of Rejection\"; this might seem a bit of a stretch to some but if one is to take note of the former's structure, especially in the mechanical way the chorus hook is delivered (\"By de-mons! be dri-ven!\") and also the song placement (it is placed before the \"serene\" ballad \"Hollow\" just as the latter song from FBD is succeeded by \"Planet Caravan\", also a relatively tranquil track), it proves without a doubt of Vulgar Display's status as a transitional work of barely realized ideas and half-assed attempts at crafting a fusion of hardcore and metal like their contemporaries Crowbar and Corrosion of Conformity.\n\nOn this album, the first obvious thing we would notice is that the music was deliberately dumbed down to appeal to the unsophisticated tastes of the unwashed masses. Radio friendly music back then was saturated by pop crap by the likes of New Kids On The Block and MC Hammer so Pantera\u2019s management, seeing clear dollar signs, had the bright idea to simplify the band\u2019s sound in the same way Bob Rock was responsible for Metallica\u2019s eventual entrance into middle-of-the-road metal, to pander to this undiscriminating group of listeners. Another marked attribute of the record is that the riffs are conspicuously slower. Gone are the versatile songs from the major label debut that combined fast and slow tempos. Instead, they are now replaced with far more mid-paced riffing and simpler song structures. Pantera discarded the speed and power metal elements in a majority of the songs here and this was truly their first official 90s album and their real entry as the mountain men of redneck heavy metal with the residual traces of 80s spandex and hairspray finally shed and forgotten. The first track on this release is \u201cMouth For War\u201d with its very muscular yet strangely blunted introductory riff (I\u2019m sure everyone is now familiar with the music video that was on heavy rotation on MTV back in the early 90s, showing Phil doing his best Henry Rollins impression). This intro riff is kind of passable but it is also sadly lacking in the sinister vibe that was heavily abundant in Far Beyond Driven or even Cowboys From Hell (to a lesser extent). Quite obviously, the songwriting strategy that was done here was pretty straightforward: turn up the volume knob all the way to 11 as some shithead suggested from that crap movie, This Is Spinal Tap. Dimebag also cranked up the gain on the distortion pedal as well to create thicker and more massive sounding riffs. But these methods noticeably did not make the music anymore menacing or vicious. In fact, they totally robbed the guitar riffs of much needed vitality and vigor. Additionally, the most apparent culprit in pulling the teeth out of Dime\u2019s guitar tone, making it essentially a neutered and completely harmless organism, is the spotlessly clean production mix, which was clearly geared towards easy consumption with a mainstream audience in mind. Comparing Vulgar Display\u2019s guitar tone to Dime\u2019s tone in FBD, the disparities can be observed quite plainly. On their masterpiece, the guitar riffing was like a chainsaw, furiously cutting through limbs and dissecting the listener\u2019s auditory nerves like aural knives. On VDOP, the riffing is just a fa\u00e7ade, a shiny, thin veneer to hide the album\u2019s palpable shortcomings.\n\nThe next perceptible disparity with the album is evidently the considerable change in the vocal style of the frontman, Mr. Phil \u201cBadass\u201d Anselmo. His throatwork on this record is the basis for all the metalcore singers that followed suit during the 90s including Hatebreed\u2019s Jamey Jasta and North Side Kings' Danny Marianino. While most hardcore singers in the 80s emulated the singing of either Henry Rollins or Ian Mackaye, Phil adapted a more rumbling baritone grunt which was put to great effect on the track, \u201cA New Level\u201d. Worth mentioning also, is how he delivers his vocal lines on said song. When before, he sang the lyrics in a combo style, alternating between high pitched belting and low-end chants ala James Hetfield, now, he merely resorts to chest thumping shouts and staccato declarations of street smart machismo like a drunken hillbilly. But Phil's voice was not the only thing that changed but also his look; here, he shaved his locks for a more fearsome visage, like someone fresh out of jail. Combined with the tattoos and Phil's forever scowling countenance and body build similar to a UFC fighter, this new image must have scared the shit out of highly impressionable suburban kids back in the day. On the live front, when before, he stalked the stage like a wino with ADHD, now he lumbers sluggishly like a sullen gorilla, mad and angry after his stash of bananas gets stolen.\n\nThis is the new Pantera for the dozens of core kids back in the early 1990s. Lyricswise, Phil's writing gravitates around various subjects and themes; the first two songs, for example are like inspirational talk set to music, for those suffering from a lack of self-esteem. Fundamentally, the words in the songs revolve around issues that mattered most to Phil during this point in time. Mouth For War is particularly commendable for its messages of determination and self-empowerment; much like a motivational speaker, Phil declares \u201cI vacuum the wind for my sail\u201d. These very positive lyrics later became the hallmark in most Hatebreed songs. The first track and A New Level though are exceptions because the most frequent themes on the album are the emphasis on \u201crespect\u201d and very juvenile \u201cfuck the police, fuck the authorities\u201d sort of bullshit that could be found on an NWA record. This is most apparent in the track \u201cFucking Hostile\u201d, a song so mired in idiocy it could be used as background music to any Beavis and Butthead or Ren and Stimpy episode. This is the most praised song on the album by sexually frustrated, insecure, desert dwelling, thrash elitists goat fuckers for its generic, run of the mill thrashing (Seriously, people who are afflicted with this type of subgenre Nazism are mentally disturbed and should immediately check themselves into a mental institution). Another song that gets praised a lot in the album is \u201cRise\u201d, a song with virtually no riffs during the verse segments and has a very retarded chorus (\u201cIt\u2019s time to RISE!!\u201d). This one song surely gave rise to numerous blockheaded metalcore groups. Admittedly though, the song's intro riff is, to quote Beavis, \"cool\" and would've been cooler if it was sped up twice its normal speed.\n\nThe overall tone and feel of the album is generally one of anger and just bat-shit, pissed off attitude. Phil genuinely sounds like he wants to knock the teeth out of some punk bitch's pie hole. This is most manifest in \u201cWalk\u201d, a massive display of testosterone, similar to a doberman marking its territory with piss (there is actually a song with this title, ending up on the cutting room floor of the Vulgar Display recording sessions). The song\u2019s swinging rhythm and beat is very similar to Metallica\u2019s \u201cDon\u2019t Thread On Me\u201d off the Black Album; just listen to both choruses of each song and you will hear the resemblance. The message of the song is epitomized by Phil\u2019s taunt to any punk who annoys him: \u201cwalk on home boy\u201d. He obviously believes he\u2019s some tough Mafioso like Jimmy \u201cThe Weasel\u201d Fratianno or the fictional Michael Corleone. His megalomania is at its height on this album, though anyone with half a brain knows, he\u2019s just a tough-talking studio gangster who\u2019d probably get his brains beaten out of him on any dark back alley in Brooklyn. This exhibit of macho swagger is just hollow cockiness; at least in FBD, he was able to balance his bravado with confessions of insecurity and vulnerability. \n\nProceeding onto Vulgar Display, this album is significant in that it is the missing link, an important piece of the puzzle in the evolution and development of nu-metal as a genre, wholly distinct from metal, hardcore and other heavy music genres. The most obvious group to take inspiration from this record is none other than Korn, one of the progenitors of that beleaguered genre (the other nu-metal pioneer is Rage Against The Machine). That specific tuneless bend, which quickly follows the intro riff of By Demons Be Driven has been utilized to great effect and is a prime component in Korn riffs from their debut to their last crucial record, Untouchables (all of their albums after this particular record are quite inconsequential). Phil\u2019s tough guy growls was successfully incorporated into Jonathan Davis\u2019s wide vocal palette as can easily be heard on the band\u2019s eponymous release. The attitude and bluster inherent in the album were also flawlessly copy pasted by one Fred Durst who is a Phil Anselmo clone and whose band\u2019s song \u201cBreak Stuff\u201d is arguably their answer to Pantera\u2019s \u201cWalk\u201d. Surely, Vulgar Display and their other uneven album, The Great Southern Trendkill were major contributors into birthing nu-metal as a new musical medium. \n\nOf course, this doesn\u2019t satisfactorily explain the influences of nu bands like System Of A Down with the quasi thrashing on their debut and Godsmack who use guitar solos just like any hard rock or metal band. It is because nu-metal is a freeform style as opposed to the rigid boundaries and parameters that were set up by the old school. As such, no two bands play the style exactly alike, unlike two thrash bands for example who are identifiable as thrash precisely because of discernible commonalities. Nu-metal can be described as a rejection of the values championed by traditional heavy metal as it does not try to innovate but tries to integrate an assortment of disparate styles using metal or a metal subgenre as base/foundation in order to come up with its own brand of heaviness. \n\nTo conclude, Vulgar Display not only became the album which kick started mallcore/nu-metal but it also gave rise to a host of other unsavory genres such as screamo and emo. On the brighter side though, it serves as a bridge towards the ascension of Pantera\u2019s crowning achievement, Far Beyond Driven. It can be compared to a caterpillar or grub, an impermanent and ephemeral state, later peeled off for a new beautiful vessel to emerge. Like the ancient Chinese concept of Yin and Yang, for light to shine through, there must first be darkness.\n",
        "\nAfter the artistically bankrupt (but financially rewarding) debacle that was Vulgar Display of Power, Dimebag and the boys finally got their act together to create a truly intense, resolute work of heavy and brutal audio art. Vulgar Display was merely a transitory album, a failed experiment at fusing Biohazard\u2019s hardcore punk and Exhorder\u2019s groove thrash. Far Beyond Driven is the next logical step in the group\u2019s sound and as it turns out, the right direction for the band to follow. In order for this ultimate project to come to fruition, several components must come into play. \n\nAs a driving force behind the band, Anselmo is a confessed fan of various underground extreme metal bands such as Necrophagia and is obviously an avid listener of death metal and would have influenced Dimebag and the rest of the boys to incorporate elements of the subgenre in Pantera\u2019s sound. However, such a move would greatly and radically alter and deviate from the group\u2019s style; our cowboys from hell need to reach a compromise while satisfying Phil\u2019s craving for extreme sounds and also further fleshing out and articulating the groove element found in previous songs like Primal Concrete Sledge. The resulting album from this concession is Far Beyond Driven which is legendary for being \u201cthe heaviest metal record to reach number one on the mainstream charts\u201d.\n\nThis album represents the apex of Pantera\u2019s compositional mastery and they would never again reach this level of musical complexity and sophistication. Each band member brings their finest input to the drawing board. Rex Brown\u2019s bass guitar provides a fitting counterpoint to Dime\u2019s blistering solos while Vinnie\u2019s double bass footwork and minimalist drumming style endow the songs with a solid rhythmic backbone; surprisingly for a death metal influenced album such as FBD, he doesn\u2019t employ blast beats as would be expected from drummers of this type of music. Dimebag\u2019s guitar work is characterized by a lot of chromatic riffing and his solos are significant bursts of dexterity and showmanship. Phil\u2019s performance is phenomenal and would rival his vocal work in Cowboys From Hell, although quite evidently, the technique used here isn\u2019t of the early James Hetfield/Rob Halford sort. His voice, on this record, is an ever evolving and adapting element, trying to fit each of the various moods conveyed by the songs and fairly succeeding very often. Hard Lines, Sunken Cheeks, for example, is demonstrative and very expressive of Phil\u2019s blackened thoughts and emotions. Lyrically, his skill and gift as a wordsmith is at its peak on this album. On Vulgar Display, he was more preoccupied with being a tough street thug. Here though, the dark lyrical themes found in songs such as Message in Blood and Clash With Reality from CFH are revisited and explored further. They discuss subjects that are very unappealing to society\u2019s Disney and Pixar standards of perfection: life of crime (Strength Beyond Strength), family dysfunction (25 Years), alcoholism (Hard Lines, Sunken Cheeks), neurosis and self-doubt (Throes of Rejection) and even unbridled contempt for the Christian religion (Slaughtered).\n\nTo describe the sound of FBD, we have to understand what Dimebag and Co. set out to create here and this is their attempt to reproduce the atmosphere or \u201cfeel\u201d of Phil\u2019s favorite old-school gore metal classics and channel it into their bluesy and grooving heavy metal style. FBD is the aural output if you fuse Seasons in the Abyss with Pantera\u2019s trademark Southern approach. Similar to Slayer\u2019s fifth opus, FBD also does not completely shed its thrash tendencies. The thrash attack found in their major label debut, which was in short supply in Vulgar Display (except in the stupid song Fucking Hostile) reveals itself once more on the first track, Strength Beyond Strength, with its frenzied intro riff. Midway through the song, a cool breakdown balances the proceedings nicely and later, an eerie guitar lead by Dimebag blares through the speakers, sounding like a swarm of bloodthirsty gargoyles. Maybe it has to do with the effects pedal Dime used or the gadget employed in the recording studio but he has real difficulty duplicating that lead passage in a live setting as shown in Live 101 Proof. Good Friends and a Bottle of Pills is technically not a song but a \u201cskit\u201d track and functions as an icebreaker, displaying Phil\u2019s twisted and black sense of humor. It is also the sole track with the most F bombs, gleefully dropped by Mr. Unscarred, on the unsuspecting listener.\n \nThe other songs are also remarkable. Becoming is a catchy whammy pedal squeal feast while still managing to be heavy as fuck. Slaughtered is a great Slayeresque track with Dime\u2019s bludgeoning riff and Phil\u2019s hellish death grunts. Each of the next following tracks, 25 Years, Shedding Skin, Use My Third Arm, and Throes of Rejection (exemplary for its creepy lead intro and brutal groove as well as the catchy shout-along in the chorus: \"Re-jec-tion!) are all noteworthy for their dark vibe and unique individual characteristics. No two songs are alike. Final track, Planet Caravan, is the light at the end of the tunnel after listening to ten pummeling and punishing songs, and is a worthy homage to the heavy metal godfathers, Black Sabbath; the song serves as a great encore to finally wrap up the album. \n\nIn conclusion, FBD is a magnum opus of 90s groove metal. The band managed to sound extreme within the confines and limitations of contemporary heavy metal without degenerating into full on death metal or death-grind. It is a very much misunderstood album, especially by people who have an obvious bias towards thrash, speed or power metal. Narrow-minded thrashers, afflicted with tunnel vision, listen to the album, expecting something in the style of Kreator's Pleasure to Kill but there's no uber brutality here; the album has its own method of sonic punishment and I kinda like it. If you like your heavy metal with a shit ton of attitude, this album is right up your alley. But this is not recommended for those who want finesse and elegance in their lyrics or those who want to hear the same generic thrash riff repeated over and over for the rest of a compact disc\u2019s duration. Or those who dislike growling and prefer Eric Adams/David Defeis style singing.\n",
        "\nThis album is being propped up by revisionists and Pantera bashers as the only worthwhile full-length record by the Arlington, Texas quartet while ignoring or deliberately failing to recognize the genius behind masterworks Cowboys from Hell and Far Beyond Driven. This is what happens to a bunch of posers that wish to inflict their \u201cmetaller than thou\u201d attitude on the populace. \u201cFar Beyond Driven is too \u201ccommercial\u201d and mainstream for our tastes, but I dig TGSTK, therefore I\u2019m a more legit metalhead\u201d or some other patronizing and condescending drivel (kind of like the people who prefer Soulside Journey to A Blaze In The Northern Sky). It is indeed quite surprising that this is the record they chose, to show off how hip and cool they are, since based on the music here alone, it is obviously metal for blockheads and those suffering from mental retardation. Another irony is that this is supposed to have been written by Anselmo (the lyrics, that is) as a reaction against the grunge and alternative music trends that were popular in the early to mid 90s (this lofty position would later be usurped by the emerging nu-metal movement). His singing belies this as he adopts every vocal trick from Kurt Cobain\u2019s book; the songwriting itself and the song structures are very similar to how songs were constructed in Nirvana\u2019s In Utero and the Fecal Matter EP. They are chaotic and messy, far from the unified vision realized in the previous album. It\u2019s like the band took a collective dump with this album, figuratively and literally. The simplistic and straightforward approach reminiscent of Vulgar Display of Power was merged with the more refined grooving of FBD and the results aren\u2019t really that pretty. Also, I get the feeling that they were going for a sludgy sound like Phil\u2019s fellow New Orleans natives, Crowbar, though the finished product doesn\u2019t quite sound like Time Heals Nothing but a completely different monster altogether.\n\nAt the beginning of the album, the intro song/title track greets the listener with Phil\u2019s god-awful screams; the singer sounds like someone just crushed his balls with a nut cracker which isn't a good sign, to be honest. There's some interesting riffing and grooves on the song but the somewhat unbalanced sound mixing during the verse sections, placed Phil's vocals at the forefront, to the detriment of the guitars and drums. Thank God though, the song is later redeemed by a scorching and quiet lengthy Dimebag solo which thankfully is mixed properly to highlight Dime's shredding prowess. The next song, \u201cWar Nerve\u201d is one of those proto-mallcore ditties that were later aped by Slapnuts; it\u2019s a rather \u201csolid\u201d track (\u201csolid\u201d is usually a euphemism for \u201cmediocre\u201d) but the lazy way it\u2019s constructed could only elicit a humdrum response from yours truly. The band must have realized that the chugga-chugga riffs on the track are pretty weak so they have to rely on Phil\u2019s abuse of the F word to divert listeners\u2019 attention from the lack of quality; truth be told, the overuse of the word \u201cfuck\u201d was better handled by the likes of nu-metal purveyors Fred Durst or Jonathan Davis and they still retained a semblance of humor doing it. The bitter rage exhibited by Phil on this track has no creative or imaginative twist or sense of irony whatsoever to balance the song\u2019s anger management issues; there\u2019s no witty sarcasm like on Megadeth\u2019s \u201cPeace Sells\u201d or the tongue in cheek mischief in Venom\u2019s \u201cTeacher\u2019s Pet\u201d. Frankly, the song should\u2019ve been in a B-side compilation as that is what it sounds like, a very lackluster and middling track. Not one song stands out on the record but parts of songs do have their moments for those who have patience. \u201c10\u2019s\u201d is a ballad with an exceptional solo by Dime (one of his bests) and so is \u201cFloods\u201d, a moody track with another excellent solo. Other noteworthy songs: \u201cLiving Through Me (Hell\u2019s Wrath), \u201c13 Steps to Nowhere\u201d, \u201cThe Underground in America\u201d and \u201c(Reprise) Sandblasted Skin\u201d.\n\nWhat totally ruins the album is the excessive shrieking and screaming by the frontman and the less than satisfactory riffs; \u201cDrag the Waters\u201d with its chugging riffwork and swinging rhythm, sounds stale and feels like an updated recording from Sepultura\u2019s Chaos A.D. Phil\u2019s vocals on the song are thick, hoarse and powerful bellows, probably the only saving grace of the track; while the song is catchy, it\u2019s not really memorable in any way. Another song off the album that pisses me off so much is definitely \u201cSuicide Note Pt. 2\u201d; man, I just can\u2019t describe how fucking lame this song is. It\u2019s just pathetic and pitiful, a sad reminder and omen of the nu-metal epidemic that is about to devour America and the rest of the world in the late 90s. Phil is just screaming into a microphone, accompanied by Dime\u2019s squeaking guitar; normally, such a combination would\u2019ve been ear candy to these ears but the song\u2019s slapdash arrangement means there wasn\u2019t much effort exerted in putting the song together, which is why the vocals and riffs felt like they were just phoned in.\n\nOn the positives, Phil is a soulful and emotive singer as confirmed on tracks \u201cSuicide Note Pt. 1\u201d and 10\u2019s though we already had a glimpse of his \u201ccrooning\u201d beforehand on \u201cHollow\u201d and \u201cPlanet Caravan\u201d; his singing on the aforementioned tracks rivals James Hetfield\u2019s performance on \u201cUnforgiven\u201d and \u201cNothing Else Matters\u201d (of course, Phil always wins in my book). The other star of the show, the legendary Dimebag Darrell, is also remarkable as he employs a lot of flashy guitar tricks. Check out the aforementioned Floods for a sample of his \u201ctalking guitar\u201d and some weird sound effects in The Underground in America. The other members, Rex and Vinnie, are also at the top of their game. \n\nTo conclude, TGSTK is an album more notable for its ballads than for the loud songs; there are passable and decent tracks but nothing above average, instead, there are highlights within the songs but the tracks in general are not strong in themselves (with the exception of perhaps, Sandblasted Skin). It is also a record that I would only revisit when I'm in a certain mood. The album signals the beginning of the end for the band as the follow-up, Reinventing the Steel is a real stinker, a cobbled together collection of recycled and tired ideas. TGSTK could\u2019ve been Far Beyond Driven Pt. 2 or better but instead is a record revealing the band unraveling at the seams.\n",
        "\nPantera's early work is often said to be best left forgotten, as it is basically on the exact opposite side of the metal spectrum from what the band would do in the 1990s. While I personally find the bulk of their work from this era to be overlooked and underapreciated, there is one album that definetly deserves all of the mockery that it is subjected to. That album is their debut. The title of this album alone is enough to make anyone cringe and the cover art is both confusing and hilarious. Seriously though, what the fuck is that thing? The music here is more coherent than the cover art, but it is hardly any better. Even by the standards of glam metal, this album is seriously poor.\n\nMost of the music on here sounds like the members of Kiss had gone next to bankrupt, only to be forced by their record company to record an album on the spot, with no assistance with budget at all. The production on this thing is so low budget and flat that it makes Deathcrush by Mayhem sound well-produced. The bass is practically unintelligible, the guitars are obnoxiously fuzzy and the vocals are buried beneath the rest of the music. But even if this was produced well, it would still be horrendous, as the music is enough to keep it so. It sounds pretty much exactly like Kiss, but with the cheese factor turned way up, and a lead guitarist doing an impersonation of Randy Rhodes. Diamond Darrell is very talented, and his talent shows here. But his leadwork is boring and derivative, though he does show flashes of brilliance occasionally.\n\nMost of the riffs are rather predictable, and there really aren't a whole lot of them in general. This is one of the simplest Pantera albums from a structural standpoint. I don't believe that simplicity is inherently bad, but with the lackluster music that it builds on, it just serves to make the music all the more uneventful. There are a few moments where certain sections are repeated ad nauseam, such as the monotonous chorus of \"Tell Me if You Want It\". In fact, it's the choruses in genral that fall victim to this, something typical of glam, but the one mentioned beforehand is the biggest offender. \n\nWhenever the music isn't utterly forgetable, it's unpleasantly scarring. The best example of this would be the ballad, \"Bigget Part of Me\", with one of the most cringe-inducingly cheesy choruses that I've ever heard. The title track is also a good example. It's pretty much the one song where they break away from the Kiss worship (instead, it's Motley Crue worship), with one of those irritating earworm riffs that won't leave your head alone, even though it never sounded pleasing to the ear to begin with. And it's all topped off with horrendous whispered vocals that sound like something a bad 1970s R&B singer would do.\n\nSpeaking of the vocals, Terry Glaze deserves his own paragraph. He isn't exactly a bad singer from a technical standpoint, but the way he sings is absolutely grating. He never sings forcefully, half the time he sounds flat and void of any emotion. The other half, he tries to sing with feeling, but instead of coming off as emotive, he just sounds whiney. There is nothing truly convincing about it at all. This is made worse by the horrible lyrics, which I'm sure you can drum of an accurate picture of. Sex, girls, lamenting of past relationships, etc. There's even a song called \"Ride My Rocket\". That should give you a good peak of the boarderline self-parody that awaits you in this album.\n\nDebut albums are often said to be the weakest most of the time. There is some truth to that in certain cases, but they are very rarely even close to being this awful. While I dislike some of Pantera's other work, this is by far their worst effort. It shows a band who have no idea what they're doing, resulting in an incompetant, annoying and laughable mess of an attempt at making a fun album. This particular brand of metal doesn't get any worse than this. The other two glam albums from Pantera are overwhelmingly superior to this, as is the rest of their discography. Terry would turn into a more tolerable vocalist, Darrell would become a more tasteful guitarist, and the band as a whole would write music that was much more interesting. But not here. This might as well be looked at as a poorly recorded demo that no one cares about.\n",
        "\n\"In this day and time of metal magic, we need rock and roll. We need... Pantera!\"\n\nTruly fitting words to open the career of such an iconic band. It still baffles me that the reputation for this album is so negative, even by glam-era Pantera standards. Even fans of that era often write this one off. But to me, Metal Magic represents one of the standards for how to do glam metal well, and it's a real testament to what young musicians can pull off. Say what you will about it or the other Terry Glaze-fronted albums, but at the end of the day, they're hard to really get mad at. Darrell was only 16 when this was made, and the other members were fresh out of high school. They were just a group of fun, goofball 80s kids doing what they loved, which is where a lot of the charm in Metal Magic comes from. This was in 1983 too, so it's not like they had the modern tech, conveniences or distribution that we have now. You had to know just the right kind of people or pay shitloads of money for the right resources and teachers to learn how to shred the way Darrell does on this record. So in my eyes, it's even more impressive that the band could put together an album as good as this. True, they had Dime/Vinnie's father and his studio to give them a head start, but Metal Magic can still stand as an encouragement for aspiring, young musicians who want to get their material out there. If a group of kids could do it in the 80s, then surely anyone can get themselves known today too, so long as they've got talent.\n\nAnd talent there is! Dimebag manages to knock it out of the park on his first swing here. He's a long way off from the great solos heard in Floods or Domination, but even at 16, he could've gone head-to-head with Eddie Van Halen without breaking a sweat. Tell Me if You Want it, Biggest Part of Me, and Widowmaker show his ability to execute great hooks and riffs all throughout a song. The title track also shows a lot of promise for what he'd eventually go on to do down the line. There aren't a lot of his trademark whammy bar screeches in the solos as we'd hear on the 90s records; Instead, he went for a faster, Eddie-like approach with lots of fast tapping and string skipping, which I like a lot. If you're a fan of Dimebag's guitar skills, then if nothing else, Metal Magic will be a real treat for the ears just for that much, because it proves he'd been going at it longer than most people know. On the vocal side of things, Terry Glaze also does an impressive job as Pantera's lead singer here. He has a good amount of charisma in his voice, he's always in-key, and you can just tell he was having a blast behind the mic. \n\nTerry sounds very different on here than on Projects in the Jungle or I Am the Night though. I don't want to call it baritone, per say, but he sings in a lower register than those other records. Whereas on those ones, his voice was going all over the place from screeching highs to whispery lows on a dime. Here he's not often straying from what he was comfortable with at the time. You could almost be fooled into thinking it's a different singer entirely, the difference is that striking. I don't want to sound like I'm criticizing him for that, because I'm not, but it seems to me that he just hadn't found his full range just yet. Perhaps he was still developing his style. But nevertheless, as mentioned, this is hardly a criticism; Terry Glaze still does extremely well with most of the material given to him. He works with his limited range better than you'd imagine, and it's easy on the ears. His highlights include Biggest Part of Me, Ride My Rocket, and the title track, particularly with the chorus sections. For as much flack as Terry usually gets for these albums, I say he deserves a bit of vindication, particularly here on Metal Magic.\n\nRex Brown also does a fine job on bass here. My favorite portion of his work is definitely his bassline in Nothing On (But the Radio). It's memorable, buoyant and fun, almost having sort of a disco-like vibe to it. His bass at the beginning of Ride My Rocket has gotten some criticism for sounding like it ripped off Detroit Rock City by Kiss, but I don't mind it much at all. It's similar, yes, but I can cut Rex some slack here. Kiss was always one of their biggest influences during this time period, so I'm guessing maybe Rex wanted to pay an homage to it; Nothing really wrong with that in my opinion. At times the bass is hard to hear in the mix, but when it's present, it really shines. Last but certainly not least, Vinnie Paul manages to prove his worth on here too. While his best drumming was still yet to come, I admire his quick rhythms and how upbeat and full of energy he sounds in many places. I've heard some comments say that the drums here sound like typical 80s electronic drums, but I don't agree; they don't sound electronic at all on here. Vinnie did start to use them a bit on the following two records, but for Metal Magic, he's clearly just using a standard kit, so it's all good. There's also nowhere near as much keyboard or synthesizer work on here as some might lead you to believe either. Biggest Part of Me or Tell Me if You Want it are heavy with the synth, but outside of those, it rarely ever pops up. But when it is there, it still sounds genuinely good, particularly on the former. \n\nProduction-wise, Metal Magic is also well done. The production on the album gets a lot of crap, but I personally don't hear any problems with it. I've heard vinyl rips where it sounds much worse, so this could just be for my specific copy of the album. Take this with a grain of salt, but everything comes in clear and fairly balanced. I've already mentioned that the bass sounds lacking in some places, but beyond that, I don't hear any errors. Songs aren't too muddled, there's no vinyl hissing or crackling noises, and I can't complain about much of the mixing. Drums sound crisp and dry, the guitar is very clear-cut, and vocals are mixed nicely with the rest of the band. Producer Jerry Abbott had already worked with country music prior to this, so I imagine that this type of music was a very new deal to him. I'm also guessing he learned quick, because it came out just fine. I'm really curious about what a remaster of this album would sound like, though. \n\nLyrically, the album's definitely not breaking any boundaries or revolutionizing any genres, of course. Lots of the songs are about things like sex, love, rock n' roll, seducing girls, prostitutes; all that fun 80s stuff. Very different from the Pantera most people know, certainly. Widowmaker and I'll Be Alright are probably the weakest links in the lyrics department. The former is just some middle-of-the-road lines about a sexy girl, and I can't make heads or tails of what the latter is even about. Something about moving away, singing songs and reassuring someone they'll be okay? I guess? I don't know, it's not that well written or organized. Biggest Part of Me, on the other hand, touches on the themes of loneliness and abandonment from someone you love, which I think is an interesting break from the formula. Again, nothing to really write home about, and it's done in kind of a cheesy way, but it's a good touch. The title track seems to be about moving forward with life, enduring all its ups and downs, and never looking back. I like this idea a lot, and it's a good type of theme to name the album after, although I wish the lyrics were longer on it. They're too short and too few to really go anywhere truly great. So lyrically, yeah, Metal Magic is very simple, but kind of weak. It does leave a lot to be desired. I can cut the guys some slack here too though, because again, they were all just kids at the time, either in or just out of high school. I don't think most of us would be able to write Cemetery Gates or Walk at their ages either. My guess is that this is just what they thought hair metal lyrics were supposed to be like at the time. (And not to crap on these other groups, but to be fair, it's not like later bands like Ratt or Poison were doing a ton to prove them wrong.)\n\nIn conclusion, Metal Magic is a perfect example of what a 'hidden gem' is, and I applaud the band for pulling it off at such a young age. When looking at the big picture of Pantera's catalogue, it's easy to write this album off as the \"worst\" one. It sounds dated to some, the lyrics are mediocre, it's clearly out of place compared to Cowboys or Vulgar Display, and of course, there's the weird and ridiculous cover art. But to be completely honest, in spite of all this, Metal Magic might still be the Pantera album that I enjoy the most our of them all. It's the easiest on the ears (as mentioned before), it's got the most amount of solid hooks for me, Dimebag's early skills are still absolute bliss to listen to, and although the lyrics are once again 'meh', Terry Glaze still sings them out excellently. The songs are basic, fun and even addicting to listen to. Even with their simplicity, they're just dripping with promising talent and a fun tone, and most of it would make for great party material. I'm absolutely floored by the fact that this and the other Glaze-era albums never even gotten an official CD release. Pantera likes to keep up this \"manly tough guy\" image that started with Cowboys From Hell, which is all right, but I don't see how giving this a proper re-release would ruin that. Like it or not, this is how they started, and it's an important piece of metal history because of that fact. If for nothing else, I think the guys should at least honor that fact and give Metal Magic a good remaster. There's nothing to be ashamed of if they do; It's not like it'd make fans like Cowboys or Vulgar Display any less or respect Dimebag's legacy less because of it. This and the other Glaze-era albums are crucial pieces of Pantera's heritage, and it's a damn shame that you can only get them through bootlegs and file sharing sites now.\n\nWe really do need Pantera in this day and time of metal magic, not a single doubt about that.\n",
        "\nPantera's first four albums as many of us know were rejected by the band upon the release of their 1990 full-length \"Cowboys from Hell\". Many people, like the band, tend to agree that the \"Glamtera\" era of Pantera (wow, that rhymed a bit) should never have existed. I think \"Projects in the Jungle\" is a solid if somewhat predictable \"glam\" album, \"I Am the Night\" is fairly good and \"Power Metal\" is among one of their best albums. But what about \"Metal Magic\"? What about their very first album from 1983? Well, let's just say it never should have existed. This is easily the worst Pantera album ever to be released and unlike the three following albums, I can completely sympathize with the band wanting to discount this atrocity from their discography. \n\n\"Let's all get together, feather the crap out of our hair, wear girl's pants and makeup, and rip off KISS and Whitesnake. That would make for a cool album!\" Yeah right, girl. We all know Dimebag Darrell (known as Diamond Darrell at this time, up until \"Vulgar Display of Power\" was released nine years later) was a great guitar player if a bit overrated, but his performance here is bland, bad, and boring. The solos can be kind of cool here and there but the actual riffs contain no merit to Dime himself. There is a lot of cheesy guitar playing on here such is the case with about 90%+ of glam rock (this hardly qualifies as a heavy metal record). Come on, just listen to \"Latest Lover\", the juvenile \"Ride My Rocket\", or the seemingly necessary and obligatory ballad \"Biggest Part of Me\", which surprisingly Terry Glaze wasn't singing about regarding his pecker. This isn't the fun cheese that comes with a lot of power metal bands but rather a stinky, mold-infected cheese that should never be ingested by anyone. Even the title track which is probably the fastest song here, almost sounding speed metal-ish at times, still is extremely lame and overstays any welcome is somehow had. Somehow. \n\nTerry Glaze was not a good singer. Not in my opinion, anyway. Even his performance on the two albums which followed this distract me at times from the otherwise solid music. Here, he's only slightly worse than everything else going on. The lyrics were typical for glam rock bands. Sex, love, and rock n' roll. Emphasis on the sex and rock n' roll part. \"Ride My Rocket\". Really? Come on, dudes. These lyrics aren't even funny in a ha-ha sense, but rather comical in how bad and predictable they are, as well as completely juvenile. \"Latest Lover\" seems to describe either a prostitute or the city slut. \"Widowmaker\" makes me think of a stripper. I'm sure Terry was referring to his penis in the lyrics to \"Tell Me If You Want It\". I could go on and on here and fill up this review with examples of lyrical immaturity but I feel like I've already made my point. Maybe the lyrics wouldn't be as cringe-worthy if Terry was actually a decent singer? Nah, actually I take that back. They're still pretty bad. I'm glad he improved on the next three albums, granted it would only be a marginal improvement. Oh, screw it. Just look at the lyrics to \"Nothin' On (But the Radio)\". \"She looks easy\" and \"she's everything you ever wanted in a girl\"....? Yeah, because I definitely go for \"easy\" when it comes to girls. \n\nOf the band's 1980s output, this is the worst. Easily. Of the band's entire discography, this is also the worst. In fact, it makes \"Piss\" seem like grand musical mastery of intelligence and perfection. Okay, maybe it doesn't go that far, but it still makes \"Piss\" look like a good song. Which most of us agree it isn't. It's no wonder Pantera denies this album, at least they got THAT right...\n",
        "\nIt's obvious listening to this that Pantera, or at least Darrell Abbott wanted to go in a heavier direction after making this. It's darker and a little faster than the rest of the stuff they've made up to this point. The only thing that seemed to be holding them back was the hair metal gimmick and Terry Glaze was far too into that style to make any sort of major shift. Sure, his falsetto has improved, but he still sounds derivative and a little silly. Meanwhile, everyone else in this band, especially the future Dimebag was getting faster, more aggressive, and more agile. While Glaze remained firmly trapped in the Motley Crue mindset, his band mates let in influences like Judas Priest which has a strong presence on this album, and Iron Maiden with galloping riffs on many of the songs. It's Pantera's darkest album with Glaze, but how good is it?\n\nI would say that this does have its moments and the influence from less commercial metal acts certainly helps. There are still times when it feels like a very regular glam metal album. There are songs where the guitar play feels more glam than anything else. \"Hot and Heavy\", \"Onward We Rock\", and \"Come-on Eyes\" feel very regular to me. Though, \"I am the Night\" and \"Down Below\" are heavy and fast with nice traces of speed metal sprinkled in, especially \"Down Below\" with how rumbling and rowdy it is. This album feels like there's a bit of traditional metal trying to break through the glam surface, but it gets smothered by standard sounding glam rock lyrics and Terry Glaze's silly singing. He does work sometimes... in a Vince Neill copycat kind of way. There's nothing much more I can derive from this, other than that it's Pantera, it's glam metal, and it's a little harder and faster than before. Though, now that I think about it, Pantera does sound like a name a hair band would have.\n\nThere was change in the air coming for Pantera and it seemed like something heavier was in store. They wanted to go harder and faster, but still ended up caught in the glut of hair metal and had a vocalist who couldn't really do much differently. It seemed like something had to go away or be altered. It would only be two years after this album, that the Abbott brothers and Rex Brown would part ways with Terry Glaze and enlist the help of Phil Anselmo. Until then, Pantera's latest album would be one where they try to become something harder despite genre conventions. It still feels very standard, but there are little occasional bits of enjoyment to have here.\n",
        "\nPantera in the late 80's still had the veneer of a glam band. The music had gotten too hot and heavy for Terry Glaze, and as a result, Pantera looked for a vocalist who could handle a tougher sound. That led to Phil Anselmo becoming their new singer. With all of this happening, the Abbott brothers and Rex getting better and more aggressive at playing, and Phil's gruff vocal tones, there was serious change coming around. This seems less like a straight up glam album and more so one tinged with just a bit of traditional and thrash metal. Stylistically, this is close to Guns N' Roses with maybe a bit more muscle. Even so, it's a decent record compared to their early material, but not really on the caliber of their 90's output.\n\nPower Metal is the very hardest of the \"Glamtera\" albums in that it packs the most of a punch regarding songwriting and riffs. There are even faint hints of the style we'd see on Cowboys, with groovier riffs coming forward ever so slightly in the mix of hard rockin' tunes. There's even a song that sounds a lot like a prototype of \"Cemetery Gates\" called \"We'll Meet Again\" with a similar build and ballad style that Pantera pulls off with finesse. There's also a re-recording of the song \"Down Below\" from the previous album and it is even better thanks to louder production and Phil's much stronger voice which sounds like Rob Halford when he goes for falsettos. It's a catchy, rumbly album that has songs ranging from serviceable to great. The album itself does rely on some slightly corny taglines and some of the lyrics do come off as schlocky (albeit far less than on previous works). There's also the song \"PST88\" at the end that just blows it. The song is really called \"Pussy Tight Tonight\" and I fell on my ass laughing hearing them shout about pussy so bluntly and directly. That song, with how ridiculous it sounds, just made me feel embarrassed to listen to it. It sounds like a Steel Panther song. Putting that at the very end of the album ended it on a very sour note for me because all of the energy building up from the other songs is wasted on a track that starts off with the phrase \"PUSSY TIGHT!\" that had me giggling like I was 13 again. Still, even with that song ruining the momentum there are still a few good songs on this album and overall it's a decent effort. Even so, there's also more rousing catchy songs like \"Proud to be Loud\" that hit with all the strength of Judas Priest and could easily fit onto Screaming for Vengeance. These kinds of songs make up the bulk of the album and make it feel very complete and catchy. It's no Cowboys From Hell, but it's a good piece of rowdy metal nonetheless.\n\nAside from some silliness at the end of this album, Power Metal is the strongest of the non-canon Pantera albums. It's got the muscle to stand up to groups like Guns N' Roses and despite the glam exterior, there's some real fire going on here. The album itself does still feel rather typical of the time and there's nothing particularly unique or epic about it. There's a nice, even peppering of catchy and fast tracks to blast and they all have a balls-out bravado that would be expanded upon later in their career. It's a good album, especially if you wanted to hear Priest and GNR thrown in a blender.\n",
        "\nThat thing is the ghoulish monstrosity on the front of Pantera's first ever studio album from when they were a glam band in the 1980's. Sadly, that cover art is an omen about the quality of the record held within. This is a schlocky, amateurish glam rock album that's obsessed with fucking, a bit of rock n' roll, and more fucking. This is as stark a difference as you could get from the brutish groove metal of 90's Pantera. Which is especially odd, since the Abbott brothers and Rex are here, the only change in line-up is the singer, glam shrieker Terry Glaze. Even so, the misadventures of a band barely out of their teens and riding the latest trends might make for a great story, but not a great album.\n\nIf this album wants you to know one thing about, it's sex. There are tacky sex ballads and goofy, cringey taglines all over this piece. Metal Magic kicks off with \"Ride my Rocket\", a cheesy little ditty about playing with a penis that's as obvious as you can get. Not to mention the chorus to that song, and many others is beyond corny. \"Latest Lover\" just sounds way too happy to be a song about a prostitute. The title track even involves some \"perv whisper\" action despite being one of the only songs not primarily about a stupid sex metaphor. The other songs suffer from more general problems such as Terry's silly vocal antics, sex metaphors, sappy ballads, corny choruses, and a very derivative sound. Metal Magic is cheesy to the point of disgust, this is syrupy cock rock schlock in its purest form.\n\nI'm going to say that this album is WAY too close to Pantera's early influences to stand out. A lot of this feels like Van Halen worship. From Darrell's guitar play (which, though derivative is still good), to the corny pussy-chasing antics in the lyrics, to Terry's vocals, it sounds like an amateur version of Van Halen with catchy taglines in a starry-eyed hope of selling a ton of copies and breaking into the hair metal scene. It makes sense since the Abbott brothers loved the hell out of Van Halen. You can't really fault these guys for doing this because they were barely out of their teens when this was made, and Van Halen and hair bands were the big thing at the time. Just an observation, but an important one.\n\nMetal Magic is not a good album at all and pales in comparison to any of Pantera's canon albums. Even compared to their other glam albums, this is as weak as it gets. If they'd just held back a bit on the sappy and corny lyrical ideas, they could've at least made a serviceable, albeit faceless glam album to get it out of their systems. Just let Dime rock out and give him some time to jam and hone his skill while keeping Mr. Glaze under control, that's the advice I'd have given back then, if I were alive. Though, even with that, it might not improve that much, not at this stage, not with this style.\n",
        "\nProjects in the Jungle is the second Pantera album in the glam style. It's a noticeable step up from Metal Magic in that this feels more like a metal album and less like hard glam rock. There's more Judas Priest in the mix, and a little less Quiet Riot and Van Halen. It's still a cheesy glam metal album, don't get me wrong, but here it feels far more tolerable than before. It's a catchy and energetic release, if not also rather faceless.\n\nThis is basically Metal Magic with less lovey-dovey sexy-time BS and more rocking out. The catchier parts are more fun and less corny this time around. It's still corny, but it's to the point that it doesn't become too grating. The guitars have much more speed and impact this time around, with Darrell having clearly improved since album number one. The opening riff to \"All Over Tonight\" is savage and fast, which serves to make it a nice, hard song. There is still some sappy nonsense like \"Only a Heartbeat Away\" and pop-metal bufoonery on \"Heavy Metal Rules!\" which definitely drags this album down and makes it feel kitschy. This is also balanced out by harder rocking pieces which make up more of the album, making it feel more satisfying, despite the fact that I remember the bad songs more clearly. Terry Glaze's singing is also sharper as he's able to carry melodies better and his shrieks are more intense. There's still plenty of schlock to be had here, and honestly, this feels like a heavier and faster version of Metal Magic with an older, more talented band pulling the work.\n\nIs this really a good album? No. A tolerable one? I guess. It's still schmaltzy glam metal, but this feels like they toned down the sex and toned up the rock to make something that people other than Carl from Aqua Teen Hunger Force could sit through. It's a rather faceless album with fierce competition from bands like M\u00f6tley Crue and Ratt who were better suited to the hair metal scene and Judas Priest who were more intense and better established. It's a \"meh\" album, but that in of itself makes it superior to Metal Magic.\n",
        "\nUpon receiving this album in the mail being completely unfamiliar with it, I can honestly say I was curious about it. A friend of mine had said this album was crap, and stacked against the positive reviews regardless, I would keep an open mind. I think it is good and wise to be as positive as can be on a review no matter how bad or good it may be. If it just so happens to have very little merit, then allow that to speak for itself. It's not to say that one shouldn't make its complaints and where complaints are majority for this, I can't deny that it is good to give praise where it's due. None the less, it is a hard pill to swallow, and even harder to digest I might add.\n\nThere is first and foremost to be fair, some things to praise about this album. Whether or not one enjoys it, it must be respected. TGSTK attempts and in some ways succeeds in being a force that should not be reckoned with. They really pushed themselves to make something special that was outside of the box. Dimebag's playing was very different and unorthodox and Vinnie Paul's drumming was not typical but much faster and more aggressive. This really seems to be more of an experiment than a typical Pantera album. To some it up in a word, it's obscure. The \"best\" of songs are The Great Southern Trendkill, Drag the Waters, Suicide Note pt. 1, and Floods. I will praise that they meant to be daring and heavier than anything they have made, especially in a time of darkness. One of the best things is that you can hear the dark cloud that descended over the band in this time. \n\nAs said that you can feel and hear the dark cloud that descends on this album happens to benefit TGSTK, it also is to its detriment. The hits of the album I am reluctant to call that for they, like this album remains rather forgettable when compared to their other albums. In all honesty it is hard to know just what to rate it, which I think in all objectivity, is rather not a good sign. Take it as one will, but it is a hodgepodge of a mess. This album was written in a time of tension with the band, and unfortunately, it is heard throughout. I defend this album as one that should be checked out for sure, and perhaps embraced for what it is. After all this really is a what-it-is kind of albums in that it is very experimental, and that should be recognized before its approached. However there is so much working against it, just one example is the awful production. There is so much lacking in its organization and structure which makes it hard to enjoy. As well, for the masters of groove metal, there is almost no grooves, and if so they're completely irrelevant. Much of the influences are very much Nu-Metal. Speaking of Nu Metal, there is a strong lacking of melodic creativity. It just seems like Dimebag was somewhere else. As far as Phil goes, he sounds like he's hugging the toilet the whole time, and his lyrics were just what he was spewing! Many consider such things to work for it, and I am envious of that for I simply cannot even if I try. \n\nBOTTOMLINE: There is praiseworthy things in this album and for being obscure, it should be experienced. Regardless it should be admitted to be a hard pill to swallow. Enjoyed or not, it's worthy of respect to a great length. Keep in mind, it has a poor production, and it is a mess. This album will either make or break you're enjoyment so take with a grain of salt.\n",
        "\nI can't deny that with pantera, I was not only apprehensive with not only reviewing this album, but listening to it. Not because it was bad, but rather because I was afraid of having my opinion of 11 years shattered. After all, where I usually trust many elitist's judgement on their review's average, I was shocked that 64 percent was the average. It seems to me, most people either loved it, hated it, loved it despite feeling it as overrated, or hated it but recognizing it as a great album. I am no elitist by any means and you can say amen to that, but a 64 percent I just can't seem to submit to when viewing it at face value. The only thing to do for myself was to find out years later what my thoughts are now, and I have quite a bit to say.\n\nJudging by its title, it doesn't seem that an 84 percent should be positive when the word 'Filler' seems to be the reigning attribute. Perhaps it's because filler has been given a bad name. However, I will say that VDOP is an album that gives filler a whole new meaning. Where I will say that this is truly a great work, and one of the most important thrash metal albums which truly blessed pantera, that does not make it a classic. This is album is a must have, and it is a force to be reckoned with when viewed objectively. It was brutal, heavy, groovy, and downright mean. \n\nVDOP demonstrates hard work regardless of how enjoyable it maybe if at all. It is true that there really are only a handful of hits, the fillers most definitely deliver enough to conclude that there is not a single bad song. Many could say that they are in fact important songs not just for the album but for the band. A New Level, Walk, This Love, and Hollow are truly the headliners on this release. Which easily range a ten. Mouth For War, Fucking Hostile, and Regular People are the B-sides which could be hits but do slightly fall short ranging between an eight or a nine. Finally, leaving Rise, No Good, Live in a Hole, and By Demons be Driven as basically the worst on the album resulting in a seven. One thing I discovered was just how much I really hate Nu-Metal which I thought I had outgrown, but no thanks to Nu Good, you can clearly hear the influence of what would later become nu metal. Though it is not unforgivable, it is a turnoff. Much like seeing a very faint yellow stain on an otherwise clean white dress shirt. I feel like the worst song really is By Demons be Drivel which is a song that clearly doesn't go anywhere but still remains one of the heaviest songs which does rip off Breaking the Law by Priest. \n\nWhat I praise about this album is the hard work, it's innovative sound, the brutality and overall enjoyability. No two songs are remotely the same- there's a lot of diversity which makes it lots to digest. Though this as stated above is not devoid of flaws. Among its flaws, where Phil is a great vocalist and is totally appropriate for this album, he unfortunately can get quite annoying. His vocals come across at times as trying to overdo the gruff-tuff attitude to the point of overkill. The lyrics portray similarities with NWA, example fucking hostile, which is basically Pantera's Fuck The Police. When one spends time evaluating the lyrics, one's brain cells begin to melt away. It's as if the aggression is used for the sake of making aggressive music like teenage angst and I think that does have some negative impact. \n\nBottom Line: Regardless of its flaws, it is one of the most important pantera albums as well as metal albums ever. It might not be Master of Puppets and where many might think so, I don't even think its pantera's Master of Puppets, it certainly is deserving of respect. The fillers are all well done, the hits are even better and everything else in between is relatively solid. If you love or hate pantera, or even are indifferent, VDOP is worthy and should be checked out. But do so objectively for its work, it's time, and as others have stated, where there is something serious about it, do not take it explicitly serious. Have fun for this album is loads of it.\n",
        "\nReinventing the Steel is the sound of Pantera trying to get one more album out before inter-member pressure, side-bands, as well as drugs and alcohol would inevitably destroy the band. Tensions were at an all-time high and the years since Trendkill were hard on Pantera. Still, it seems like they had just enough energy to pull together one more album. Reinventing the Steel is the album that shows what happens when the hardships that powered Trendkill go on for far too long and end up dragging the band down. There is good material on here, but it's in much sparser quantities than in earlier releases. The classic groove of Pantera is still here, but it comes off as struggling and tired, as though the band meant for this to be the end of their \"official canon\" before they all called quits.\n\nEvery musical idea on this album comes off as much simpler and having less passion than before. Fewer of the songs stick out prominently and many feel like recycled or second hand ideas from previous albums. That's not to say they sound bad, they just sound simple and unexciting. There are songs on here that do come off as a genuine work of effort. \"HellBound\" for example, is great at revving you up for the rest of the album with its chunky bass lines and the pounding lead guitar barrage; and it feels much bigger than it is thanks to the strong buildup over its 2 minute and 40 second running time. \"Revolution is my Name\" is another song with imposing riffs that tower over anyone listening and a catchy chorus that draws people together in head-banging unison. It borrows from Down's style of sludge and that adds even more density to the song. Most of the other songs here are a mixed bag of \"boring and tired\" like \"You've got to belong to it\", and \"decent but forgettable\" songs like \"Death Rattle\" which many of us only remember since it was featured in a SpongeBob episode. Most of these songs use an idea that only gets half-realized, plodded out, and while it sounds okay while it's there, it leaves no impression. There's a decent groove kudos to Dimebag, but not much else in the way of catchiness or lasting impact. Songs like \"Death Rattle\" and others in the middle of the album feel like a series of \"Wham-Bam-Thank-You-Ma'am\" situations since they feel shorter than they really are and don't build to anything. The complexity of Trendkill has been dialed back extremely far and most of this album suffers for it.\n\nThere is one decent quality to Reinventing the Steel and that is the leftover sludge sounds from Trendkill. This leads to some interesting ideas that are better fleshed out towards the end of the album. Sure, \"Revolution is my Name\" has a lot of debt to the sludge style and that adds an air of menace to the song, but it doesn't go full in towards sludge like \"It Makes Them Disappear\" and \"I'll Cast a Shadow\" which go for a murky, hellish timbre. These songs have a deathly atmosphere about them as the slow, low, and foreboding riffs spell out the nearing approach of this album's end, much like the nearing approach of the band's end, like death's hand creeping slowly towards you. While they still sound rather simple, it works with a sludgier tone, and they were pulled off fairly well. It doesn't save the rest of the album, but it makes for a chilling final chapter.\n\nWhile the magic isn't lost on this album, you can certainly feel it slipping away. The music here was simpler, less emotive, less passionate, and more tired. You can tell that Pantera was at their breaking point when Reinventing the Steel, because everything sounds like Pantera, it just sounds less engaging. As I observed before, there are choice cuts on here, but the overall album has less to offer than the other \"canon\" Pantera releases. While the continuation of some of Trendkill's sludge-based ideas are welcome, and give the ending songs a satisfying \"impending doom\" vibe, most of the songs on this album just feel like something that was written out just to fill space. This is the weakest of the \u201ccanon\" Pantera albums. It's still decent, but it seems like the band didn't give it their all here since they couldn't. We're talking about a band that was suffering more and more from interpersonal tension, fighting, and drug abuse as time went on, wearing down Pantera, and wearing down this album. Perhaps Reinventing the Steel is worth a recommendation if you have all the other \"canon\" Pantera albums and you just want a little more, but even then, this album still feels weaker and less iconic than any of the others going all the way back to Cowboys. It sounds okay, but it's just that, okay.\n",
        "\nThis is the sound of hardship coming back into Pantera. This album combines all the anger and melancholia that the band had built up over the past two years since Far Beyond Driven. Singer Phil Anselmo, was particularly important when it came to this. Phil had gone out of his right mind and made paranoid and racially-charged statements about rap music. He'd also begun using heroin to ease the increasing pain in his back. this led to him becoming more erratic in his behavior and more estranged from the band to the point of having to record all his vocals in New Orleans while the rest of the band recorded in Dallas, he was not only having a terrible time himself, but also drawing many years of negative press coverage and giving his band-mates new troubles to fret over. There is also a noticeable musical shift here from the \"chugga-chugga\" grooves and accessibility of Far Beyond Driven. This album goes for an even slower and heavier approach than Far Beyond Driven, which was far heavier than Vulgar Display or Cowboys. I bring Phil up again since his influence is also prominent here in a musical fashion. Phil led the sludge band, Down, and released their first album, NOLA only a year before Trendkill dropped and Phil was also big into extreme metal such as Darkthrone and Neurosis. Despite the growing rift between him and his band-mates, you can hear the influence of these artists in the instrument sections played by his band-mates. The influx of dense, groovy sludge metal, forlorn Texas blues, and grating extreme metal with ferocious and biting songs make Trendkill the most diverse, extreme, and skillful album Pantera has ever released.\n\nThe anger shown on this album is more \"from the gut\" and genuine than anything they've previously released. Trendkill comes screaming right out of the gate with its title track that uses Dime's brawl-ready riffs and Phil's bile-infused lyrics concerning trends, poseurs, money, dishonesty, and how much he has come to despise such things. All of this is done with a healthy dose of Texan attitude displayed in Dimebag's bluesier soloing. In fact, Dimebag does his best to give a feeling of grand, metallic ferocity mixed with his more blues-based style in the main riffs and especially the solos in all the songs, leading to a truly distinct sound. Even the lead single sounds more genuinely pissed off and frustrated than lead singles they've released before. \"Drag the Waters\" is an imposing song despite its simple riff. It trudges angrily around, tempting people to bang their heads while Phil details stories of deceitful people with problems beneath the surface, including a judge's son who gets off easy due to his dad's position and a female junkie who leads her boyfriend into ruin through her habits. If you can stuff this much loathsome narrative into a simple song like \"Drag the Waters\" all while having a strong rhythm, you've got something really good going on. Thirteen Steps to Nowhere is even more hateful in its delivery, with a slow, creeping rhythm that jumps out with Phil's shouts about the prying eyes of the press, drug treatment failure, and accusations of bigotry following him around, making him feel like a prisoner in a dark, rotting house as Dime's riffs snake and wind around his verses, with slow passages to accent the feeling of sickness and decay. The Great Southern Trendkill is as angry and ugly as Pantera can get, and with much of the band making their anger on this album close and personal, they make their songwriting close and personal.\n\nBlues, country and sludge metal have a strong presence on this album, despite it still being principally groove metal. These genres are used effectively on the less aggressive parts of this album to create an extremely thick and morose atmosphere. Oddly enough, a smart usage of this is actually in the first part of the most aggressive song, \"Suicide Note\" where an easy-going, slow country piece is played to lull someone into a feeling of relaxed sorrow before exploding into part 2, which is as extreme as this album gets with shredding, squealing guitars and vocals that sound like they're straight off of a grindcore record. That two-part song uses contrast and pacing to make something so hellish, brutal, and grating, it's hard to believe it came from an almost mainstream act. \"Floods\" uses doom-laden country passages to make a song that's heavy just from the thick, dense atmosphere it carries rather than battering the listener with riffs. This kind of heavy-set melancholy gives songs like this an ominous air to them that sounds imposing, yet down-to-earth at the same time. These blues and country laden tracks give a rawness and depth that crushing riffage alone cannot deliver. It adds dimension to Trendkill, making it an album that shows that with all the bile and all the hardship, Pantera are still masters at channeling that suffering and anger into song, whether it be moody country and blues-inflected fare, or pure riff-focused and ultra-violent metal. The fact that just about every song in both styles does its best to stick with the listener, lay down a groove that catches ears, causes the listener to feel what the band feels, and makes you remember the song by name, is a testament to all the variety, conflict, and hard work put into The Great Southern Trendkill.\n\nThe Great Southern Trendkill is hands down the best album made by Pantera and it's a damn shame that this album is as overlooked as it is compared to the rest of their catalog. It's the darkest and heaviest thing they've released, as well as the most atmospheric and moody thing they've ever done. The riffs and rhythms do their best to make songs you will enjoy (albeit being angry or miserable) and come back to many times. The influx of influences from the Abbott brothers' love for traditional Texan music, plus Phil's sludge and extreme metal background gave a new arsenal of sounds for them to choose from. Add this to all the hardships, mistakes, and bitter feelings of this time, and you've set the conditions for an album that hits you with as much force as it can muster and make you feel every ounce of its pain. For someone looking for something catchy, groovy, brutal, and moody at the same time, look no further. I cannot recommend this highly enough.\n",
        "\nWhat do I mean when I say coasting along? I mean that Pantera was growing comfortable with their sound at this time. They were fresh off the success of Cowboys and Vulgar Display and thought that this sound was what they needed to maintain in order to be successful. This lead to them continuing to amp up the tough-guy image, slow down and simplify the riffs even more, and write songs that are more about exuding an aura of macho loathing than about matching that loathing with catchy songwriting and ferocious riffs. Are the riffs still vicious? Of course. Is the songwriting still memorable and hooky? Yes, it still is. It's just it feels like this took less effort than the previous two records due to Pantera's level of comfort at this time. This album was made before Phil Anselmo's notorious drug habit got out of hand and started to give him and the rest of the band new problems to worry about, and as such, much of the suffering and tension that would power albums like Trendkill just wasn't here. It's still a Pantera album and it's got a ton of great material regardless of how the band was feeling at this time. There are grooves a plenty for anyone coming to look for some fighting tunes, and the riffs still pack a hard punch and all the spirit of a cage-fighter brawling to save his life. Far Beyond Driven is the middle Pantera album, between the high speed fight-anthems of earlier and the suffering, loathing, and addition of more blues and sludge metal influence later on, and this album's style definitely shows that.\n\nOn terms of the music, you get something even angrier than on Vulgar Display. The riff patterns are oriented around beatdown chugs and Anselmo's singing has gone from merely sounding angry, towards being composed mostly of growls and bellows. While there is Thrashier fare here such as \"Strength Beyond Strength\" and \"Slaughtered\", but even here the riffing is powered mostly by a thundering base of chugs. This is especially true on the lead singles which largely rely on large, chug-based rhythms meant to be imposing, and at that, they succeed. The riffs to \"5 Minutes Alone\" and \"I'm Broken\" are particularly fight-ready and certainly work as better beatdown anthems than \"Walk\" ever was. The albums is mostly consistent in this style as mid-paced, angry songs are the norm throughout the entirety of this album. The lyrical topics also go more from general hostility towards more specific demons such as religion, dealing with snobs, father problems, and power-tripping policemen, all of which get their own songs rather than just getting quick, verse-long mentions like in Vulgar Display's \"Fucking Hostile\". The chugging is often accented by thrashy head charges and these blend together in a perfect way on \"Use My Third Arm\" which gives us some of the best, rumbling, combative rhythm and vitriol that this band delivers on the entire album. The music on here is brutish and menacing with all the impact of a freighter and the assault never lets up throughout the album. Far Beyond Driven, while simpler than past Pantera releases, still holds true to the band's style and is great for dispensing rage.\n\nWith all this aggression released on this, it is a hard album to ignore, especially when the grooves of the lead singles kick in. Far Beyond Driven, while not as iconic as Cowboys or Vulgar Display, or as morose and diverse as Trendkill, there are still plenty of roughhousing thrills to be had here. Every song is organized in a way that makes you want to clobber someone. While this album relies on much simpler music to get its points across, it does so very well. Far Beyond Driven is something worth checking out, especially for anyone who's a fan of Pantera.\n",
        "\nVulgar Display of Power, this is the Pantera album that fully realized their new, ultra-tough style into the style that they'd continue with for the rest of their career. Tough-guy anthems, menacing riffage, and an expression of outright... well... power make this album the one to kick off the genre of groove metal. While Cowboys from Hell was a strong album that was rooted halfway in thrash and halfway in the then-nascent groove style, Vulgar Display of Power eschews the 80's thrash style completely for a much more pure groove metal sound. The sound is bigger, the tone is thicker, while the singing is less dynamic, it's also more ferocious and more fitting to the sound and aesthetic of Vulgar Display. Everything is made beefier and fuller for conveying an air of undiluted macho rage, which Pantera pull off with the utmost strength.\n\nAs far as music is concerned, we have a beast on our hands. Many of their more scathing, intense, and iconic tracks cover this album like bruises cover the cover model's face after the shoot. \"Mouth for War\" begins the albums with Dime's thundering riffwork and Phil's battle cries go off with all the intensity of a bomb, sending listeners flying, and making necks sore from all the back and forth movement. It's the ideal opener with how it comes out of nowhere and all the energy it dispenses, not to mention the gnarly riff that carries the song and gives it its iconic status. Other fast pieces on this such as \"Fucking Hostile\" and \"Rise\" make use of faster tempos to convey their aggressive shredding alongside rousing choruses belted out by Anselmo at full strength. Anselmo's barking, paired with Dime's menacing, snaking grooves, and pummeling chugs, along with wild bluesy solos combine to give us the unofficial soundtrack to many a bar brawl or back-alley slugout. While \"Walk\" is a rather monotonous song with posturing lyrics, it still fits well among the much more superior fare that surrounds it, it also lays the ground for more agile songs that use its formula such as \"Regular People\" to a much greater effect, laying the groove down and making it as delicious as possible to keep a listener engaged with infectious rhythm. Sledgehammer riffing, an overall atmosphere of fierceness and rage, along with Pantera's penchant for making catchy songs around their riffs and choruses give us an album that unabashedly lives up to its name.\n\nPantera's second album after going from glam to groove certainly showcases how far they've come from that style in only a few short years. This is a punishing affair and while it may not be at Cowboys from Hell's level of consistency, it goes for a more ferocious and intense sound that roars in the listener's face and smashes everything to bits in its fury. From the death charges of \"Mouth for War\" to the morose, snaking rhythms of \"This Love\" this album is one big, muscular beast. For all of its aggression, there's still a catch, a hook, and many great songs to be heard here. For a truly hostile and strong piece from Pantera, this will do you well.\n",
        "\nCowboys from Hell is the Pantera that people have come to know and love over the years, whether they were a deep-digging metalhead or just someone who casually enjoyed the genre. It's the album that established their identity and personality. The Abbott brothers, along with Rex and Phil, abandoned their glam aesthetic in favor of a style much more fierce and punishing. They combine the sounds of Judas Priest, Metallica, and a little bit of ZZ Top to respectively show off the catchiness and melody of Priest, the rage, punch and intensity of Metallica, and the groovy, Texan rhythms of ZZ Top to create something that, while familiar as metal, sounded new and energetic. They took thrash and slowed it somewhat to put more of an emphasis on the riffing and rhythmic muscle behind their work. While still yet to evolve into the \"slug-you-in-the-face\" variety of groove metal that they would be known for later, there were signs that there was more intensity and punch in the riffs despite being mid-tempo. Cowboys From Hell is an album that goes for the neck and continues delivering punches, showing they can be as fierce as they want, regardless of speed.\n\nCowboys From Hell is a strong album as far as riffing is concerned. Almost every tune on this thing has an element of swinging, mosh-ready swagger about it that makes for great amounts of energy. The title track is the best example of this since it works hard to build you up and then launch you into a riff frenzy backed up by a strong rhythm and catchy hooks. This is also a consistent album as you can also find this on other punishing songs such as the catchy \"Domination\", the swinging and groovy \"Medicine Man\", and the head-on speedy charging of \"Clash with Reality\". Phil's more dynamic Halford-esque vocals do a lot to assist this as high, energizing shrieks do their best to complement the riff-rich beatdown and heavy tension-building being delivered by Dimebag. His shouts carry a more dynamic range of expression and it can vary as being anywhere, from angry and brutish on \"Primal Concrete Sledge\" to emotive and somber on songs like \"The Sleep\". Tension-building is also a strength of this album as it gears you up for the swinging and energetic rhythms, especially on softer songs like the aforementioned \"The Sleep\", which begins with a haunting acoustic guitar intro that slowly becomes faster and more dynamic when it switches to electric, going from simple stomp grooves into full-fledged epic melody, and long, killer solos. \"Cemetery Gates\" also excels at tension-building, using the same techniques mentioned before, but this time exploding into an outburst of pure emotion, carried by Phil Anselmo's soaring high notes and mellow singing, something he would abandon completely in his later career thanks to continually using rougher growls on later albums, which is a shame since he could do it so well on this early album. Between the iconic riffs belted out by Dimebag, the iconic lines belted out by Phil, and the muscular and vigorous rhythms supplied by Vinnie and Rex, along with a careful balance of crushing riffage vs catchiness, and dynamics vs consistency. Cowboys From Hell is an example of what happens when a strong album is delivered by people channeling these elements with all their might.\n\nCowboys From Hell, with all it's iconic songs, as well as attitude and energy, you would be doing yourself a disservice by missing out on this album. It's one of the earliest examples of groove metal and shows how the genre diverges from thrash more closely. It also popularized the genre, gaining significant traction at the time and allowing for Pantera to have a promising career ahead of them, as well as cementing them as an influential act in modern metal styles. Cowboys From Hell brings us an assortment of banging tunes, fierce grooves, and overall, a good time.\n",
        "\nDuring Pantera's \"Glamtera\" era, they managed to release four albums: \"Metal Magic\", \"Projects in the Jungle\", \"I Am the Night\", and this album, \"Power Metal\". Released in 1988, \"Power Metal\" was the band's heaviest album of this era. I really can't consider this to be a glam album at all. Honestly, it's a bit closer to the sound the dudes would adopt for their album \"Cowboys from Hell\" if only a bit more subtle and tame. This is not a full-on groove metal assault but it did incorporate a bit of the thrash metal influence the band would soon turn to and slow down a bit. Since \"Projects in the Jungle\", the band's sound had been getting progressively heavier. \"Power Metal\" was the final boot to the face before the band released their \"first\" official album two years later. Actually, right behind \"The Great Southern Trendkill\", this is my second favorite album Pantera ever released. \n\nBeginning with \"Rock the World\", it's apparent that Pantera was still somewhat rooted in their \"hair metal\" days. This song is more of a party anthem than anything and has some fairly cheesy riffing but also doesn't sound as awful as their earlier recordings. Along with this song, this album does boast a few other songs rooted in the glam metal genre, such as the metal ballad \"Hard Ride\" and \"We'll Meet Again\", which are actually two really beautiful songs. Dimebag Darrell's (known as \"Diamond Darrell\" at this point) solos are the cream of the crop, as ever. So yes, this album still has moments of the infamous \"Glamtera\" sound of the 1980s. \n\nHowever, as I said before, this album does contain a heavier dose of thrash metal in its sound. This is the heaviest Pantera got before hanging over to their controversial groove metal sound. The title track to this album is a pure assault of speed metal that sounds somewhat NWOBHM influenced as well. Other tracks like \"Over and Out\" delve into much thrashier territory and this song even contains blast beats. The solo in this song rips and is definitely one of the finest on the disc. \"P\u2022S\u2022T\u202288\" is another song that sounds quite thrashy and closes the album with a bang. Dimebag also preforms the vocals to this track if I'm not mistaken. \"Down Below\" is actually a rerecorded track from the band's previous album \"I Am the Night\" and sounds much better with Phil on vocals, although remains similar in sound. Being one of the heavier songs from \"I Am the Night\", it's no surprise Pantera wanted to choose that one to rerecord.\n\nBeing Pantera's heaviest 1980s album, this is also the first record to feature Phil Anselmo on vocals until the band's demise. He replaced the previous vocalist Terry Glaze. I'm pretty sure the reason for this was Pantera was trying to move towards a heavier sound and this displeased Terry, which is something I've heard. Or maybe they kicked him out. I'm not sure of this. Either way, Phil was a much better fit for this new direction of sound. He still uses some of the higher pitched vocals found on previous albums but his voice is far more gritty and harsh than Terry's ever was. He wasn't using the tough guy vocal style he'd adopt on \"Vulgar Display of Power\", thankfully, and his singing sounds fairly good here. I'll say that he does enhance the aggression of the music but the album's main selling point is the aforementioned guitar performance of Darrell. \n\nI know a lot of people have much distaste for 1980s Pantera but this album remains my second favorite, and it baffles me that they disowned this album. I mean I understand how they disowned the first three but this album is just so goddamn good! Oh well, no big deal, I guess.\n",
        "\n'Piss' here is a track that never made it onto Pantera's seminal 1992 album Vulgar Display of Power; it remained on the cutting room floor for over 20 years before being unearthed for the anniversary reissue of that album. This may sound like something of interest but the fact no one could be bothered to release the song in its entirety during the remainder of Pantera's career, when a new track from them would have been something in very high demand, does speak to its quality. It was an idea left on the cutting room floor and it should have stayed there; instead it found its way onto the album in question. As a bonus track on its parent album, this is by a long shot the worst song on there, far more so than much-maligned tracks like the corny semi-rapped 'No Good (Attack the Radical)' or the guitar bend-heavy 'By Demons Be Driven'. \n\nLike a lot of Pantera's material it rides a couple of very simple groove riffs, which means the song lives or dies by how engaging those riffs are. The issue here is unlike Pantera's simplest and most famous track, 'Walk', the two grooves here are in no way interesting enough to be used throughout the whole song. The verse riff should be familiar to Pantera fans; it's the same one that would be used during the breakdown of 'Use My Third Arm', and while on that track the riff was played in a minute-long contrasting section in an otherwise fast and grinding song, here the band ride it out for the entirety of the two verses and it gets tiresome very quickly. The other riff from the chorus and intro is a very generic chugging groove that is entirely forgettable, as is the melodic lead over double bass that follows it after each hook. The solo that pops up toward the end of the song is good though; it's simple and short but it's a much needed break from the rest of the song.\n\nThe vocals are good at least and certainly up to standard with the rest of the album. Phil's vocal style at this point was a fairly rough and gritty shout that still carried some melody, and is a good fit for the music as the melody from the riffs hasn't been entirely eschewed as it would be on Far Beyond Driven, but it retains enough aggression and power to go with the hard-hitting grooves the band would deliver. On the downside, the lyrics are unbearably stupid; the entire song reads like an anthem for someone who feels the need to assault people who to them, 'have their balls clipped'. It really sounds like the sort of thing you'd expect a stereotypical meathead intellectually challenged Pantera fan to relate to. The chorus isn't all that catchy either, due to it being comprised of more lyrics than anything else from the album, which is another way it falls short compared to everything else on there.\n\nIt's easy to see why this wasn't released; it may have professional production but it's honestly written like a demo or a rough idea for a more fleshed out track. It would have needed a lot more work if it was to have made the cut of the album at the time. The guitarwork here is played out and dull, managing to be repetitive and yet unmemorable, a decent hook wasn't figured out so even that wasn't memorable and the lyrics are too stupid even for Pantera. It says a lot when the best thing about it (the verse riff, which is squandered anyway) was re-purposed in a much more suitable context elsewhere with the rest of the track being discarded. This is trash, and should never have seen the light of day.\n",
        "\n\"Piss\"? The fuck, guy? Wow, what a title! I remember when this song was released in 2012 and when I heard it, I immediately thought to myself \"wow this is the most boring song I have ever heard\". Granted I don't feel that way now as I have listened to far worse music since then, but this song is still pretty damn bad. \n\nThis song wasn't necessarily new when it was released, rather an old track that the band had dug up from their \"Vulgar Display of Power\" days that remained unreleased until 2012. I'm not really sure what compelled the guys to reveal this song. Maybe to appease Pantera fans, sure, I mean that would make sense. But this song is, for all intents and purposes, worthless. It sounds like anything you'd expect from VDoP, really. Some of that album is pretty damn good but most of the time, all substance is lost within the endless sea of macho tough guy bullshit that the album stinks of. This is not one of the good songs like \"Hollow\", \"This Love\", or even \"Mouth for War\". This is more like another \"Walk\" except even more retarded and watered down. \n\nThe riffs are just simple groove riffs that sound mediocre and uninspired. I'm not really surprised that the band left this song off of the original version of VDoP but it probably wouldn't have mattered if they included it, simply because the album is already pretty much mediocre overall. There is, of course, a fairly decent guitar solo, as with most Pantera songs. No doubt Dime was a skilled guitarist and his solo here pretty much doesn't suck. This is, however, probably the only decent moment of the song, as the rest is just boring and stinks of piss (see what I did there?). Just avoid this unless you're a die hard Pantera fan that worships everything this band ever produced, no matter how shitty it may have been.\n",
        "\nNot sure why I'm reviewing bands like Slayer, Metallica, and now Pantera recently, but maybe it's because I consider these albums I'm reviewing important. For one reason or another, anyway. I'm not a huge Pantera fan and I find most of their fans either stupid, closed-minded, or just plain fucking stupid (wait I already said that...). Be that as it may, I enjoy a few of their albums quite a bit. The three albums I can listen to front to back and enjoy every time remain their fourth full-length album \"Power Metal\" released back in 1988, which I know the band themselves disown, \"Cowboys from Hell\", and this album, \"The Great Southern Trendkill\". With any of the other albums, I can find some songs I like here and there, but that's pretty much the extent of it. This album is definitely my favorite release from Pantera. \n\nThis album can really be summed up in two words: pissed off. There is so much anger here. So much attitude. So much hatred. This isn't teen angst anger, though; this is manly fucking hate that hits you like a shot of hard liquor chased down with fucking more liquor. Profanity aside, this album is pure, unadulterated aggression. And don't worry, we aren't going to hear songs like \"Walk\" here. This is Pantera at their musical peak. The guitars on this album still retain that heavy groove metal style the band has been preforming since 1990 when they abandoned their \"hair band\" days however this time around, it is multiplied exponentially. This is the heaviest Pantera ever became. Not only are the guitars heavy, but they are just played...better.\n\nThe title track, which is also the first song on the album, contains its fair share of groovy riffs and a solo that really lives up to the name of this song and album. It is a solo that borders on Southern rock and one of the best on the album, but definitely not THE best. \"Floods\" remains my favorite Pantera song to this date. Not only are there some really heavy, dirgy, sludgy riffs, but the solo in this song is one of the best Dimebag ever managed to compose. It's beautiful and has a somewhat melancholic vibe to it. The real crowning jewel with this song is its outro. I guess this can be classified as a solo as well but it's a slow, melodic segment that closes out the song. It is probably the most mellow moment of this album, rivaling the somber \"Suicide Note Pt. I\" for that title. Speaking of \"Suicide Note\", what's really interesting is how the first song is a calm acoustic piece, which again features that southern tone to it, and the second part to that installment is almost a death metal track. This is definitely a guitar driven album and although this band was struggling to create music at this point in their career, they managed to record their best album during a period of discontent. \n\nDuring this time, Phil Anselmo was struggling with a heroin addiction and tensions were at an all time high in the band. Interestingly enough, this led to the vocals being recorded in an entirely different studio, apart from the bass, guitars, and drums. Because this is Pantera's most extreme, aggressive album, Phil provided a lot of screaming. This is most notable in the title track and \"Suicide Note Pt. II\" but \"Drag the Waters\" showcases this as well. He still sings and actually his voice on here is probably the best it ever was, which is surprising due to all of the drugs he was pumping into his system. It would seem that he really poured his soul into recording this album and ended up giving it everything he had. The guy may be an asshole and at the time he may have been fucking himself beyond repair, but he really preformed quite well on this album. \n\nSo despite all of the tension within the band at the time of this album that seemed to center around Phil's drug problems, this remains Pantera's best release. It sounds real. The emotion sounds real, the music is completely real, everything sounds totally real. It actually would have made a great swansong because honestly, \"Reinventing the Steel\" was a highly lacking album that I personally could do without. It seemed that the band was just tired and wanted to push one more album out before they split but really, this should have been that album, because it has an apocalyptic, almost end of the world vibe that would have fit perfectly. With all its vulgarity (speaking of which, this is probably my most profane review in a long while...), this album is a testament to southern groove metal and a must have. Go ahead, buy it. \"Its on sale at the fucking dollar store!\" ...Well, not really, but I had to incorporate a lyrical passage from this album somewhere, right? Seriously, go pick it up. If you can grab that slippery snake!\n",
        "\nThis is the first album in Pantera's discography that the band didn't try to deny the existence of. I could say the overall style on \u201cCowboys from Hell\u201d pretty much sounds like \u201cThe Black Album\u201d with some stripped down bay-area thrash influences as well as some speed-metal elements of their previous release thrown in there. The band's new found attempt at incorporating more extreme thrash elements into their previous speed-metal template results in some classics here and there, but also left some duds.\n\nThe production here is mildly heavy yet a little sterile, especially when compared to their later albums, as well as other much heavier groove metal albums. Dimebag's guitar tone is thick and trebly, but manages to never really be that heavy. Vinnie Paul's drumming may pick up the pace here and there with some thrash influenced drum patterns, but it never is that aggressive sounding. Rex Brown's bass guitar is audible but only if you listen closely enough. The production isn't inherently bad, it's certainly professional, but it sounds too clean and tame most of the time, especially for the aggression and heaviness they were trying to go for. It makes even the most aggressive of songs here sound malleable and nonthreatening.\n\nTheir patent groove metal style has yet to come into full fruition here. The only track that could really fit that bill is \u201cPrimal Concrete Sledge\u201d, with its thick, bottom-heavy, syncopated power chord riffs and simplistic, chugging rhythms; foreshadowing what is to come on their upcoming releases. People who tend to hate Pantera's later albums as well as the groove metal genre in general, often love this one for its supposed thrash element. While present, the thrash ferocity only markedly shows its head on a small number of tracks such as \u201cDomination\u201d and \u201cThe Art of Shredding\u201d, while other tracks only contain trace elements, such as the title track and \u201cHeresy\u201d. If anything most of this album sounds like a faster speed-metal version of what Metallica and Megadeth were doing in the 90's with the the \u201cblack album\u201d and \u201cCountdown to Extinction\u201d respectively. The colorful nature of the album can also sometimes conjure a sound of their hair-metal days. Additionally, almost every song on this album follows a typical five minute verse-chorus format. Pantera's tendency of playing a cycle of most a song's entire riffs-set before the vocals even begin makes for a very predictable listen, leaving a lot to be desired. The strict and simplistic song structures make everything sound rigid, formulaic and almost pop-music like. This, in conjunction with the colorful nature of the music and production, the raw thrash elements are watered down significantly.\n\nA few of the songs on the album never reach above the level of decent to just plain average; drawing inspiration from all sorts of areas that sometimes border on stylistic larceny. \u201cPrimal Concrete Sledge\u201d is a pretty heavy track and sounds cool after a few listens, until you realize that it is pretty much a blatant rip-off of \u201cPunk Rock Classic\u201d by the Red Hot Chili Peppers. During the verses, Dimebag and Rex simply chug away at their lowest strings as Vinnie aimlessly flails away at the double bass and toms, making the drum work sound more like some sort of South American jungle tribal stomp than something appropriate for a thrash metal song. As well, those awkward moans Phil inserts between verses and the nonsensical chorus and song name makes everything all the more painful to listen to. The riffs on \u201cHeresy\u201d and \u201cPsycho Holiday\u201d sound almost like Metallica riffs, (notably \u201cDisposable Heroes\u201d), minus the epic arrangements, and are watered down into straightforward galloping rhythms that repeat with little variation. At the end of the day, despite their flaws all three of these songs are still pretty decent and listenable, but far from great.\n\nThe biggest hit to the album's quality is the four song stretch of B-side fillers \u2013 \u201cClash with Reality\u201d, \u201cMedicine Man\u201d, \u201cMessage in Blood\u201d, and \u201cThe Sleep\u201d. The riffs on these songs are dull, simplistic and repetitive, and they plod and saunter endlessly and go absolutely nowhere in the end. The biggest odd-ball of this all is definitely the sloppy \u201cClash with Reality\u201d. I honestly have no idea what the band were trying to do when they made this song \u2013 it sounds like an odd, confused mixture of radio rock, pop, and half-thrash, and the band for the most part just sounds completely lost. I guess \u201cMedicine Man\u201d is a fun little number, but is too hard to take seriously with its goofy and light-hearted nature. The same thing can be said for \u201cMessage in Blood\u201d and \u201cThe Sleep\u201d; while these songs are fun and competent, they are certainly forgettable after a few listens. It is clear that the band were forced to scramble to stretch out an extra 20 minutes with these songs. I remember seeing an interview with Phil where he states that the other band members did not \u201cappreciate\u201d thrash metal, and gave them a cluster of records to pool influences from; including artists such as Exhorder, Rigor Mortis, Slayer, and Metallica. This lack of care and disingenuous attempt and trying their hand at a style they did not \u201crespect\u201d definitely shows in these tracks.\n\nDespite all this, there is still a lot of greatness to be found here. The title track is an all time classic with its memorable shredding riffs, swirling rhythms, bluesy solo and infectiously catchy vocals and lyrics. \u201cDomination\u201d is a complete thrash monster with soaring machine gun riffage and a now legendary bridge section. \u201cCemetery Gates\u201d is an excellent, multifaceted half-ballad with a stellar introductory section and powerful vocals and soloing. Of course you have the riff-dense thrash-fest \u201cThe Art of Shredding\u201d, as well as the searing \u201cShattered\u201d - which sounds a lot like Judas Priest's \u201cPain Killer\u201d, with its screeching vocals and crystaline chainsaw guitar work. \u201cThe Will to Survive\u201d is a song that was recorded during the album's studio sessions but didn't make the cut, which is a shame, because it is definitely one of the better songs. It has somewhat thrashy guitar work that will later be recycled on their next album, and has shreaking melodic vocals that sounds not too out of place on their \u201cPower Metal\u201d album. Dimebag's soloing is simply amazing on all of the songs, including the filler tracks. There is always an inherit tunefulness to his shredding, which is best heard on the title track as well as \u201cCemetery Gates\u201d, \u201cDomination\u201d and \u201cThe Sleep\u201d. He sometimes employs an acoustic guitar, such as the masterful \u201cCemetery Gates\u201d.\n\nThe real show stealer here are the vocal acrobats of Phil Anselmo. Combining the gruff and masculine approach of James Hetfield, with the melodic range of NWOBHM legends like Rob Halford, Anselmo shows his strengths as a fast talking and high-strung front man looking for blood. His macho mad-lib lyrical style hasn't come full force yet, except for songs such as \u201cPrimal Concrete Sledge\u201d, which to this day I still have no idea what it's about. Phil's lyrics aren't that far removed from the fun, party-happy vibes of the past, but sometimes tries his hand at some more conventional thrash tropes, such as the politically driven \u201cHeresy\u201d, or themes of murder on the song \u201cMessage in Blood\u201d.\n\nAll in all, I mostly prefer the band's later offerings, as this sounds like a somewhat inconsistent bridge between their hair-metal debauchery days and their patent groove era. The album has some great classics, yet has many fillers as well. Pantera were much at better at trying to sound like Exhorder than they were Metallica or Van Halen.\n",
        "\nRead the title, and I did fucking write it. I like listening to Vulgar Display of Power, and its quality grows with EVERY SINGLE LISTEN I give it. Few are bands that evolve and improve with their releases, and Pantera are included in the list. From a power/thrash band that focused on grooves rather than technical efficiency, the band have eliminated their power roots and revolved their music on more groove-laden mid-paced thrash songs.\n\nLeave the lyrics aside, because we all know what they are- immature, NWA-ish, and poorly written- but badass, full of attitude, and deal with everyday street life- if it's racism (No Good), anger (almost the entire album), and love/hate:\n\n\"There comes a time within everyone \nto close your eyes to what's real \nNo comprehension to fail I vacuum the wind for my sail \nCan't be the rest Let others waste my time \nOwning success is the bottom line. \" (Mouth For War)\n\nFace it. They are one of the strong points of the album, for fitting well inside the music and being executed by Phil (\"white power!\") Anselmo, which his vocalic capabilities will be discussed later in the review.\n\nThe songs in this album are nothing but classic. I mean, take Walk, Fucking Hostile, and Mouth For War for example; it's more likely that you've heard these songs first when you were introduced to Pantera. (let's ignore Cowboys From Hell and 5 Minutes Alone for now, eh?) They feature the recipe for the perfect groove metal songs- Dime Darrell's tight riffing, killing drums, pounding bass, and the vocals. Some may say that they have degraded in their capabilities and range since Cowboys From Hell or Power Metal, but it was more than expected for them to do that (and that's why power metal vocalists shouldn't smoke nor drink, fellas!). They match the album's in-your-face and heavy attitude perfectly, and don't fall from their quality in the entire duration of Vulgar Display of Power. It happened with Paul Baloff in Bonded By Blood, and no one complained about it, so why now?\n\nLet's not forget the rest of the album. They don't fall from the quality of the more popular songs, with featuring strong and southern-tinged riffing with occasional thrash parts by the groove metal mastermind Dimebag Darrell. His riffs are surely headbangable, with having a certain flow feeling to them which is rarely seen in metal records (with the best example being Judas Priest's Screaming for Vengeance). Take the songs A New Level, Live in a Hole and Rise, which the riffs in these songs are perfectly weaved into the vocal lines and the tight drumming, with having a good dose of syncopated groove into them. There is also the more \"forgettable\" part of the album (tracks 7-10) which features some pretty good tunes which can be described as more groove laden than the rest of album (how can anyone come up with a badass groovy riff like the one featured in By Demons Be Driven or No Good?), and the more atmospheric songs This Love and Hollow which build up to a section where it matches the other heavy, distortion-based parts of the album.\n\nThe production sums up the whole album. Perfect. It is perfectly equalized, and has the trademark Pantera crunch to it. None of the instruments sound distant, nor taking over the other instruments or vocal lines, but accentuates and emphasizes them. Mandatory for any metal fan, and if you don't like this album, you can \"Walk on home, boy.\"\n",
        "\nThe thing that chews people up about Pantera is that they clearly appealed to a lot of people and knew how to write great music, but that appeal was not met with consistency in producing music that rewards depthy listening. Those rhythmic riffs don't work well when considered from a purely musical point of view, while the physical nature of them can satisfy much more in a live setting, when drunk, or when only paying half attention. For me, 'Cowboys from Hell' represents the most difficult Pantera album of all in this respect, since there are many signs of a purer musical heritage on display, though those elements are mixed with some blander groove-oriented material. In fact, this is a pioneering album; however, the genre that it pioneered is much-maligned and has often failed to pass the test of musical quality on the grounds that it is too simple and flavourless. As such, my mood goes up and down like a yo-yo throughout the length of this album.\n\nLet me start with the song 'Shattered'. Phil Anselmo is wailing at a ball-bustingly high pitch, Dimebag is sprinting through an edgy speed metal riff set, Rex Brown is groaning grumpily in a way that actually provides a lot of the song's momentum, and Vinnie Paul is keeping his arms hella busy too. The sound of this song is so classic, it wouldn't surprise me to learn that it was from 1980 instead of 1990, since it sounds like Judas Priest scrapping with Grave Digger or Running Wild over the tastiest scraps of the NWOBHM. Sure, it does sound like the sum of its influences, but when a song is awesome it makes you care less about its novelty, because the excitement makes it sound unpredictable. Nothing else on 'Cowboys from Hell' is quite that pure, but there are some awesome trad metal moments that stick pretty close to the aforementioned bands, while the presence of 80s thrash is less like a shadow than a big black dog snarling at the door. Songs like 'Clash with Reality' and 'Heresy' actually paved the way for bands like Overkill and Exodus to develop into groove thrash territories later in their careers, since the palm-muted guitars and stop-start riffs were not being used in the older template of Metallica and Anthrax until Pantera came along.\n\nMy enthusiasm for these updated thrashers is not too strong, since the two purposes of thrash were always speed and ferocity, both of which dwindle in this case, except on a song like 'Domination', which proves to be a close copy of some of the 'Master of Puppets' songs, specifically the main riff from 'Damage Inc.'. The thudding rhythms that break into that song dilute the rush of the faster sections, not melding with the adrenalized chassis of the song into a single vehicle of excitement and enjoyment, and thus making the styles feel separate and awkward. The same goes for some of Phil Anselmo's vocals, which are transitioning between classic high-pitch and tougher groove gruffness, although this facet of the album actually provides it with a fair bit of variety and unpredictability, as he often changes styles fairly quickly, providing an effect not a million miles from King Diamond's vocal work. Some of the purer groove songs like 'Message in Blood', 'The Sleep', and 'Heresy' (which blends thrash with a more stripped-down approach to chugging) lack momentum and spontaneity, except in their lead sections, which considerably up the quality of the songs in most places. Dimebag was a very spontaneous lead player and injects excitement every time he takes on the clearer lead tone, especially in the short fills of 'Medicine Man'. However, the sound sometimes feels thin with only one guitar, leaving a gaping hole behind the guitar with only Brown's quietly gurgling bass to fill it.\n\nThis brings us to the production and general sound of the album, which also caused Pantera problems on 'Vulgar Display of Power'. As a band with a single guitar, the bass must be accentuated more to fill up the bottom end of the sound, yet Brown isn't given the prominence to do so, relegated to a merely rhythmic role for much of the time. This means that the music sounds thin and dated at times, especially since Vinnie Paul's drums don't have a great dynamic range, but stay in one part of the sound. It's annoying, since some of the songs could have sounded more forceful with a better mix and warmer tone, but they stay at the door instead of kicking it down. As such, there are two disappointments that equally stunt my appreciation for this album. The first is the partial mixture of groove, thrash, and trad metal that sometimes ignites and sometimes is left smouldering gently. The second is the unfortunate sound quality that doesn't provide the album with its full power. As such, 'Cowboys from Hell' is worth listening to, but is too fractured and uneven to make it a true classic, not to mention the fact that it has aged worse than many of its influences. Decent, but no god.\n",
        "\nGah, why did I even listen to this. I found Pantera's 90s work to be hit and miss, why would I want to hear them try and be Motley Crue wannabes? Because I like to put myself in pain I guess. I even had that cheesy, dreadful looking album cover as a warning, but foolishly I carried on.\n\nWell, no use crying over spilled milk now, might as well follow the site rules and explain why I hated it. Its cheesy and poorly written. Simple as that. Now those aren't the only problems but those are ultimately the two that matter. From the not so subtle lyrics packed with intended sexual innuendo to the annoying suynthesizer parts, this adequately summarizes why so many metalheads hate glam metal. Its weak and lightweight, its one dimensional and simultaneously both hard and easy to relate to.\n\nI'm pretty sure most of us have those primal urges and certainly can relate to wanting a certain individual to ride our rockets (or to ride someone else's rocket) but when you literally phrase it as \"ride my rocket\" it might be hard for someone to take your proposition and advances seriously. In a very similar manner it causes a listener to be a bit uneasy, the lyrics are obviously all intended as clever innuendo but are so poor that anyone who knows what sex is will know exactly what you're referring to and wonder why you didn't just come and say \"hey let's have sex\", the lyrics come across as very immature and hard to take seriously. One might almost wonder if they're listening to a Steel Panther demo, except that Steel Panther rarely uses innuendo and still manages to be more clever.\n\nNow, when it comes to lyrics and themes a large part of it also relies on delivery. Well unfortunately the vocals were also rather poor. It sounds like a teenage boy simultaneously trying to mimic both Dio and Vince Neil of Motley Crue and not succeeding at either. Add to this his limited range and predictably nasally voice and it becomes almost offensive to the ears.\n\nThen add in your instruments. Some monotonous, bare bone guitar riffs performed with a guitar tone that lacked power and muscle. There are some repetitive synthesizer melodies that are usually sprinkled onto the chorus. There is a bass player who's basically mixed out and finally there is a drummer using simple and straights beats at a midpaced tempo. No one adds any intensity or bursts of power to the mix. \n\nIts a very lightweight, commercially safe sounding album with a bad production job and ridiculous lyrics. Pass.\n",
        "\n(Note: When referring to 'Pantera's discography' in this review, it refers to their 'official' albums from 1990 onwards, for convenience.)\n\nSo, this is it. The almighty Vulgar Display of Power. For many, one of their first metal albums, if not the first. One of the most polarising heavy metal albums of all time. An album that was a complete paradigm shift in metal - the birth of 'modernity' as a fully fledged concept, one which could define whole albums and styles, rather than just being relegated to a few small parts. Either this is when the heavy was put back into the metal, or this is the death of the genre and the birth of a whole host of bullshit groove metal, tough-guy hardcore and nu 'metal' bands.\n\nI would like to highlight those last two takes on this album and its impact, in order to rebuke them. No, this isn't exceedingly heavy. Yes, it is pretty damn meaty, but dig into the underground and you will find countless death, black, doom, sludge and stoner bands who are all far heavier and/or more aggressive than this. It is a pretty heavy album for something that went platinum, and it did keep metal in the mainstream, but really. This thing didn't save metal. It was alive and well, just not in the limelight. The '90s did kinda suck for thrash, speed, heavy and power metal bands for the most part, but more extreme forms took the metal scene by storm anyway.\n\nAnd onto that second opinion. No, this isn't the birth of nu 'metal', though the link to hardcore is a bit easier to see. Apart from a few dodgy moments on 'No Good (Attack the Radical)', this isn't nu 'metal'. Granted, Korn probably did take inspiration from this (which they wouldn't have if it wasn't in the mainstream), but this is for the most part, pure groove metal. The vocals are a tad too aggressive, there are riffs, the guitars aren't a muddy 7-string mess, there is almost no rapping or squealing out of tune pinch harmonic bullshit. Whiny cleans are also kept to a minimum, as are the angsty lyrics. This is metal, just a very hardcore influenced variety of it. Remember people, the only ones to blame for a trend are the pioneers. They are the ones who misconstrue past ideas and accomplishments for their own horrible creations.\n\nI mention all of this to make a point: From the end of this paragraph, I shall not mention this album's impact on the wider rock and metal world, for it really has no relevance in how I judge this. This album was a pioneer of groove metal, a subsection of metal that, while I am not entirely fond of, is still infinitely more fruitful in its gems than things like metalcore or what ever the fuck Soundtrack to Your Escape was meant to be. Both that and The End of Heartache are albums which I have trashed for their influence as much as their musical merit. And while this is pretty toxic musically (as in, it is easily fucked up through trying to copy it), this isn't nu 'metal' incarnate. This isn't the viral corruption, it is just something so inoffensive, easy to stomach and prominent in the mainstream that it was parodied to no end.\n\nAnd with that obligation out of the way, let us begin.\n\nVulgar Display of Power is quite an odd album, with respect to Pantera's discography. Though all of their albums contain good points, what separates the good from the bad is how consistent the album is. Both Far Beyond Driven and Reinventing the Steel suffer from having huge peaks surrounded by desolate valleys in terms of quality, leading to albums with songs like 'Hellbound' or 'Slaughtered' also having tracks like 'Good Friends and A Bottle Of Pills' and 'Goddamn Electric'. It makes for a very frustrating listen, especially with the latter, which feels like it was recorded in 2 different sessions. However, this album is incredibly consistent. Barring one little hitch ('No Good'), this doesn't throw any laughably bad or vomit inducing ideas at the listener. Though there are clear highlights, every track possesses some sort of merit, and are all enjoyable to a degree.\n\nAnother oddity is the production: It is actually very good. Pantera's 1994 and 2000 albums had shockingly bad production, with the former actually giving me a headache after a while. The drums were a clicky mess, the guitars were so off and over-distorted that you wonder how much money went into the production, and the vocals were too loud. That isn't the case here, quite the opposite. Though the album does eschew a discernible bass guitar tone, the low end from it is certainly there, and the result of this is a very heavy and thick guitar tone. It still has nothing on the underground stuff of the decade, but it is mightily crushing. The same goes for the drums, they have a full and dynamic sound, lacking the dull thud or click of other Pantera albums. Even the bass drums have some fucking BASS to them! The mixing is good too, with everything being well balanced, even the vocals.\n\nYou see, the issue with this album lies in its strengths, or rather, its strengths are indicative of its main weakness. This album is polished, refined and consistent. However, let's look at that another way: this album is inoffensive, safe and bland. That isn't to say it is pure background music, far from it. I can happily headbang to tracks like 'Mouth For War', 'Rise' or 'By Demons Be Driven'. It is just that I don't get quite such a visceral response from it as say, The Great Southern Trendkill. Hell, even Far Beyond Driven annoys the hell out of me and gives me a headache with its unerring grit and anger. Every Pantera album (barring Reinventing the Steel) pushes something to the extreme. It may be the vocals, the lyrics, the tempo, SOMETHING. This does none of that. It doesn't surprise me, I can't really relate to it on an emotional level, it isn't awesome, and it doesn't even annoy me like groove metal should.\n\nOne of the most contentious points about this albums are Dimebag's riffs. Now, I will admit that they are inferior to the groovy thrash riffs of Cowboys From Hell, and on the whole grooves are not as good as fully formed riffs. That said, some of these songs are proper thrashers with proper thrash riffs - 'Mouth For War', 'Fucking Hostile' and especially 'Rise' are all amazing high-tempo scorchers, having a focus and drive that Pantera generally lack. Other highlights would include 'Regular People (Conceit)' and 'Live In A Hole', which are songs of a more mid-tempo variety, and while not quite as focused on the whole, are still an entertaining listen.\n\nSadly, this album begins to fall apart on the other tracks, this album's share of mid-tempo groovers. 'A New Level' has such a boring chugging introduction, one that is repeated throughout the chorus, with even the more interesting fast section not making up for it. The same can be said of 'By Demons Be Driven', which despite its pummeling goodness, is mired by an irritating out of tune guitar squeal. And then there is probably one of the most infamous metal riffs of all time, up there with 'Iron Man', 'Smoke In the Water' and 'Master of Puppets'. 'Walk' has that same dumbass stop-start hardcore riff repeated for at least 3/5 of its runtime, and it gets kind of grating after a while.\n\nThe rhythm section largely follow suit in terms of quality and consistency. Rex Brown's bass isn't quite as distinguishable here, as in, it is providing low end rather than being exposed in the mix. As a result, I can't comment on what he does really, all he does is follow the guitars, but then he is helping to give a pronounced, well-mixed low end that contributes to the album's deep sound. Vinnie generally keeps time on this album, following the riffs rather than breaking free from the rhythm and throwing in a few fills. He does go on the double bass at times ('Rise' and 'Mouth For War') but other than that, it is a functional, competent but boring performance from behind the kit.\n\nPantera's trump card, their ace of spades, was Dimebag's soloing. Later on in his career, they would become less melodic, more effects-driven and more twisted on the whole, but for now they are still of an '80s persuasion. They help to drag even the most banal of Pantera's tracks up from the slums of endless groove, providing an interesting counterpoint to the body of the song. Pretty much all of his soloing on this album is awesome, a bluesy, noodling and trebly style that is just unmistakably 'Dimebag'.\n\nThe other most contentious point about this album is Phil Anselmo's vocals. Let's just put it this way: when I heard his work on Cowboys From Hell, I was quite surprised, as someone that had heard this album first. His range is practically gone, any attempt at high notes either has to be entirely sombre and quiet, or is ditched completely, in the name of sounding tough and aggressive. To his credit, his voice isn't the same monotonous quasi-death grunt that it would become on Far Beyond Driven, having at least some melody and expression to them. He can still sing, with the clean passages of 'This Love' and 'Hollow' being good examples of that. For the most part though, his voice is a tonal shout throughout, sometimes degenerating into mumbling (again, 'This Love') or some horrid attempt at rapping ('No Good (Attack the Radical)'). That last example really sounds as corny, ridiculous and forced as you would think, by the way.\n\nWhen all these elements come together, the results are mixed. On the one hand, pretty much every song is memorable in terms of construction, owing to every song utilising a small set of monolithic riffs and being very chorus-driven. On the other hand, there are no real progressive or atmospheric songs \u00e0 la 'Cemetery Gates', 'Floods' or 'Medicine Man'. Due to the pummeling, solely heavy nature of the groove, the transition from soft to heavy on 'This Love' and 'Hollow' is completely jarring and comes across as forced, wrecking any attempt at atmosphere. These songs also don't go anywhere, often repeating themselves far too often, with 'Walk' being a poster child for this. Barring that solo and the heavy ending, there are a whole 2 riffs on that 5 minute song. \n\nAnother, more serious issue with the song construction is a serious lack of focus. Faster tracks, or tracks with faster sections (the aforementioned 3 thrashers, 'Regular People (Conceit)' and I guess 'A New Level') manage to stay on target, not meandering or stagnating throughout their runtimes. However, most of the other tracks here, especially the overlong 'This Love' kind of lose the plot in a sense. They repeat the same few ideas, but it comes across as redundant and unnecessary as the song wears on. This can make the album a bit of a slog at times.\n\nThis doesn't sound too good, does it? Repetitive, clunky, one-dimensional, bad vocals, somewhat inconsistent, this does sound like something I would give a zero, right? Fortunately however, this album does have one redeeming factor, one saving grace that turns an annoying headache inducing bore like Far Beyond Driven or worse, Burn My Eyes into a rather enjoyable album:\n\nThis album is fucking dumb.\n\nFor real, this thing is so unbelievably stupid and knuckle-dragging that I can just about get behind its tough-guy posturing, its obviously false aggression. These riffs are so unbelievably primitive and repetitive that they just become something to mindlessly headbang to. The atmosphere here isn't quite the irritating, tired-sounding 'I'M SO TUFF, but so tortured at the same time' of Far Beyond Driven, rather every song here is a rally cry for all the world's boneheads and knuckledraggers. It is one of the dumbest forms of motivational lyricism imaginable, and just makes me want to break something whilst banging my head and shouting 'RE... SPECT! WALK! ARE YOU TALKING TO ME?!'. It is that sort of basic, chest-beating manly man kind of vibe that makes this work. Had this lacked its consistency though, and ended up throwing out overlong attempts at doom/groove metal ('25 Years') and bullshit ('Good Friends and blahblahblah') this would be a failure. It walks a fine line between consistency and predictability, between stupidity and retardation, and between refinement and safeness.\n\nI know it all seems a bit apologist, but really. This is actually a very enjoyable album. The good parts sound just as good once this perspective is applied, and even the worst bits can be excused as 'dumbass noise by a dumbass guitarist/vocalist'. It is genuinely fun to blast out of the speakers, to stomp about and air guitar to the soloing. Nothing here is truly horrid or grating, just boring if you aren't in the mood. It plays to its strengths well, with its most intelligent lyrics ('Rise') still being fucking dumb, having song titles like 'Fucking Hostile' and not trying to go for something overly progressive or intelligent in terms of song structure. Only during the soft parts does it break this image, because 'I AIN'T GOT NO TIME FOR SISSY ACOUSTICS! I WANT TO GROOVE, BITCH!', but even then the dumb fuck later half of 'Hollow' or the chorus to 'This Love' return to the groovy idiocy this album is good at reveling in. Dammit, it sucks but it works!\n\nOr, maybe I am just a simpleton. Either way, I recommend this to all of the people that need a bit more stupid in their collections. A polished, refined and consistent ode to an IQ of less than 65.\n",
        "\n(No apologies for the cliche title, fuckers!)\n\nFar Beyond Driven is a curious album, for it is both business as usual for the band, and yet a bit different. Outward appearances suggest it to be a better produced version of Vulgar Display of Power, but let me tell you that these two are not one and the same, despite their obvious similarities. It represents a very subtle shift in the sound of the band, and one that is indicative of the fucking awesome trendkilling to come. \n\nSo I should like it, right? Uh, no. This is way more inconsistent than the previous album, because while the thrashing numbers have gotten better, the groove has remained the same or gotten worse. Listening to this thing is a pain in the ass, and at times borders ear-rape with its sheer repetitive nature or through its downright awfulness. As you can imagine then, this is a fucking difficult album to have a clear opinion on. The general mood of the album remains the same, but the musical quality is all over the place.\n\nOne of the first things you will be hit by is the production, which just pisses me off because it is very difficult to sum up in terms of quality. Everything is clearer and sharper than on their 1992 album, with the guitars being more serrated in nature, the bass coming through more easily, and the vocals becoming very distant-sounding. That should be a bad thing, but frankly, Phil's voice is pretty poor on this album, especially when not being backed up by some incredible, truly aggressive music. At the same time though, there is just something wrong with this mix. I can't really put my finger on it, but it might be because it sounds really fucking dry and sterile, and thus just sounds off, despite being better than before. The guitars sound too thin and trebly and the drums are an irritatingly thin click, and while it can be tolerated on the first few songs, towards the end it gets goddamn grating and annoying.\n\nThis irritation isn't helped by the fact that Dimebag has become increasingly obsessed with his fucking groove riffs. They dominate the midsection of this thing, and makes the album really off-putting to listen to by being borderline suffocating with how boring the groovers here are. Oh yeah, and they seemingly go on for 3 times longer than they need to, just to add insult to injury. And to incite even more anger in the listener, occasionally he pulls out a fucking smoker of a riff! Listen to 'Strength Beyond Strength' or 'Slaughtered'. THOSE are the riffs Dimebag can produce. THOSE are far heavier than any of the groove bullshit on here, in addition to being way more exciting and legitimately threatening. Oh, and his soloing has gotten kind of odd too. They aren't as flashy or polished as they used to be, rather they attempt the 'sonic madness' he would perfect on The Great Southern Trendkill, by relying more on effects than before. It is a bit hit and miss to be honest, with the solo in the opener 'Strength Beyond Strength' sounding legitimately menacing, while in the very next song 'Becoming' the solo is this pinch harmonic driven, noodly and squirrely thing that doesn't live up to Dimebag's reputation at all. As always though, regardless of quality, they are a nice respite from the shite grooves, so hats off! (I guess).\n\nThe rhythm section is mostly competent and functional in what they do. Rex just follows the guitars around, and does a good job of giving the album a slight grit through its low end, but there are no bass breaks or imaginative bass lines to be found. Vinnie is even less creative, because unlike a bass, the drums can do some pretty inventive and intense shit. For the most part though, he just does his boring 4/4 crap, a rut he has fallen into since 'Walk'. Then again, when most of what he has to work with are mid-paced boring grooves, there isn't much room for any technicality or creativeness. Both members have their time in the spotlight, with mixed results. Rex delivers some of the most boring bass drones ever on 'Good Friends and A Bottle of Pills', while Vinnie provides a glorious clusterfuck of fills all strung together with miles of double bass on 'Use My Third Arm'.\n\nInconsistency also mires our good friend Phil Anselmo, too. You see, Phil is angry about... stuff. 'The man'. That punk down the street. You know, 'street topics'. So how does he best express his not-at-all marketable outer coating of obviously genuine anger? Easy, by attempting 'death metal' vocals which are more like monotonous and grating hardcore shouts that don't fit with the slow songs AT ALL. Because he has to hold out the syllables on the slow songs, his atonal, zero-range tough guy shouts really get on the listener's nerves. On faster tracks though, his shouts become indecipherable rants that work well as a percussive instrument, and on the aforementioned 'Use My Third Arm', his shouts border on death metal vocals, which is the first spark of life that is a sign of things to come. That said, his performance on 'Good Friends and A Bottle of Pills' is, uh... how do I put this politely? Oh yeah, it is ABSOLUTELY FUCKING TERRIBLE, because he goes for the shitty nu 'metal' approach of low, crappy mumbling and utterly ghastly high-pitched grindcore style screams.\n\nNoticing a trend yet? Well, that carries over into the quality of the songs: a sea of groove-based mediocrity with a few choice cuts and one absolute fucking stinker of a song. The best examples of the former would include the 2 singles, 'I'm Broken' and '5 Minutes Alone', which are this album's versions of 'Walk' or Pantera's attempt at writing 'Enter Sandman' or 'Sad But True'. Just think of a really boring, stagnant groove track, with bone-headed lyrics and crap vocals to boot. And then there are songs like '25 Years', which may as well go on for 25 years because it is too FUCKING long and boring. Pantera have the songwriting chops and riff craft to make 7 minute songs ('Cemetery Gates' and 'Floods' are both monumental atmospheric dirges), but choose not to use any sort of variation because they need to sound 'FUCKIN' TOUGH', by repeating the same goddamn groove over and over at the same fucking tempo! HOW can people like this shit?!\n\nMust I even talk about 'Good Friends and A Bottle of Pills'? I don't think so, but for those who haven't got the hint: IT SUCKS!. There are no riffs at all, these stupid pinch harmonic effects that are headache inducing, to be honest, and Phil's vocals, which I have already covered. Have the skip button ready for that one. On a more positive note though, there are some really fucking good thrashers on here that wouldn't look too out of place on The Great Southern Trendkill were it not for the production. I have mentioned them already, but 'Strength Beyond Strength', 'Slaughtered' and 'Use My Third Arm' are fucking amazing, and show everyone in the band in top form. They are lethal thrashers that are legitimately some of my favourite Pantera songs ever, and give the Slayer album of the day a run for its money.\n\nSo, the order of the day here is a fucking inconsistent album. Most of it is truly boring, though it gets slightly grating towards the end and there are some ups and downs along the way. One thing to note though, and one thing that separates it from its predecessor, is the subtle shift in tone here. With Vulgar Display of Power, that was a surprisingly \u2018clean\u2019 and inoffensive album. Nothing about it inspired any particular passionate response in me, and it had a slight sense of melody borrowed from its predecessor, Cowboys From Hell. It was a very safe release, with any and all rough edges sanded off. Here though, Pantera are 'Becoming' darker and more hostile. It is only slight, but this thing, at times, does not drag its knuckles along the floor. It can be a pugilistic, violent album. This darker tone hints at what would come, for both the band and its music. It isn't Trendkill by any stretch, and it lacks the sheer hatred of that album. \n\nThe best way to view this album is a cross between Vulgar Display of Power (which is essentially Cowboys From Hell diluted to like, 5% concentration) and The Great Southern Trendkill, watered down to about 60% concentration. Doesn't sound that appealing, does it? There is a reason for that. This thing, despite the hostile tone, is as gasmask_colostomy put it, 'unsavoury'. It is very unfriendly and oppressive in nature, and while I have some respect for that, it does mean that it is very annoying at times. My verdict here is AVOID.\n",
        "\nPantera's finale really screams 'mediocre!' right from the off. The cover art is half-arsed, I never hear this album mentioned by casual Pantera fan or metalhead alike, and it is not lavished with praise like their 1990 and 1996 albums, or even as divisive as their 1992 and 1994 albums. And for once, outward appearances are correct. This is a somewhat confused, drained, and dull record, and yet is passable. It is completely inoffensive, at worst being boring. That is all Pantera ever were at their worst - largely boring and inoffensive, with the odd moment of sheer disgust ('Good Friends and A Bottle of Pills' or some of Phil's vocal work circa '92 - '94).\n\nThis release is much more of a disappointing and frustrating release than an outright bad one. Coming off of The Great Southern Trendkill, which I honestly believe is THE masterpiece of Pantera and groove metal as a whole, this is a massive fucking disappointment. I know that the preceding album was quite situational, and thus difficult to fully replicate or expand on, but this is a huge goddamn regression. Take for instance, the production. It is the bloody opposite of The Great Southern Trendkill's job, in that the drums sound like a dull plastic thud, it is too quiet, the guitars are muddy and in the odd case nearly inaudible, and the whole thing lacks bass or a low end. It is completely hollow and soft, a massive step down from the loud, abrasive production from 4 years prior.\n\nAnother thing to note is the sheer inconsistency of this release. While every 'official' Pantera either consists of lots of throwaway groove and a few choice thrashers, or a little bit of groove with slower and faster thrashers being mixed with atmospheric balladry, the mood of the album remains constant. Whether it be the marketable faux-aggression of Vulgar Display of Power and Far Beyond Driven or the fire spitting, acidic hatred of The Great Southern Trendkill, the atmosphere was present throughout. Here though, the album spends most of its time dithering about in the former, while occasionally getting its shit together and caving the listener's skull in (i.e.: it sounds like the latter). It is utterly confusing and annoying, and serves to throw off the continuity of this album completely. Even previous thrashers like 'Strength Beyond Strength' and 'Mouth For War' never did that to their respective albums.\n\nCompounding this inconsistency is the level of musicianship at work and the type of song these respective levels of quality spawn, as well as the mood produced as a result. Groovy numbers have always bashed heads with thrashers of the mid-tempo and fast strain with Pantera, with ballads occasionally wafting into the fray too (a good indicator of quality is a higher number of the latter 2). However, the aforementioned loss/gain of driven anger makes the transition a hell of a lot more jarring, in the bad sense. This album spends a fair amount of time in boring groove land, with Dimebag churning out yet more 3 second, 3 note riff fragments known as 'the groove'. Vinnie and Rex closely follow suit with boring beats and unimaginative bass support, with the shit production not helping at all. Seriously, 8 years of this crap and numbers like 'We'll Grind That Axe For a Long Time' and 'You've Got to Belong to It' are just as boring and unimaginative as past songs like 'Walk'. Like most groove metal songs, Pantera have not made any progression in any way on this front. The crap, marketable variety of tough guy anger makes several appearances on this album, and all seems about normal for this band (Trendkill and Cowboys are exceptions to the groove genre, not the rule)...\n\n...and then a song like 'Death Rattle' or 'Yesterday Don't Mean Sh**' (censorship, real fucking tough you guys!) just comes out of nowhere and hits the listener like a goddamn freight train. Phil goes from his worsening 'death metal' voice to a much more lethal shriek and a more aggressive and dynamic thrash shout. Dimebag sends forth his best thrash riffs from the days of yore to pummel the listener to death, and Rex and Vinnie are doing something other than following Dimebag's riffs. Songs like this and 'Hellbound' or 'Revolution is My Name' are shot through with the southern spirit of The Great Southern Trendkill and sound genuinely hateful. What the fuck? I never understood that, how can a band write a full album of songs like this, and then only muster up about half the number the next time round? Surely tensions in the band had gotten worse, how could this not be more lethal for more of the time?\n\nThe lyrics are really fucking bad. Normally that is to be expected for Pantera (even Cowboys From Hell had some pretty insipid tough guy stuff) but the last album proved Phil could write nearly-intelligent lyrics with 'a lethal dose of American hatred'. However, here he just roars forth his lyrics about being a tough guy who once again, is 'GONNA FUCK YOU UP!'. Seriously Phil? The better tracks here manage to make these lyrics sound something close to the concepts of 'sincere' and 'threatening' but even then the writing still sucks.\n\nAnother issue I have with this album include a lack of variety and overall banality to the proceedings. It is still quite animated, as Pantera always were, but the creative synthesisers and guitar effects of the previous album are pretty much gone, with one of the few exceptions being the one in 'Hellbound'. Other examples of this include a reduction in soloing, so some songs here lack the one thing that made groovy Pantera rise above the mediocrity they helped make during the period, and there are no ballads at all here. This albums reeks of a lack of inspiration and being rushed on the whole, with the production, inconsistency, lyrics and cover art being further indicative of that. And yet, I can't hate it. This doesn't really offend me so much as it does bore me with its typical grooves, confuse me with its inconsistency, especially with the circumstances surrounding the album and frustrate me with how they managed to throw away yet another great sound in the name of 'sounding tough'. I would say this is for the fans only, but even they don't take too kindly to this album. Even so, it isn't horrible, and for all its flaws is kind of entertaining in the right setting and mood. A bargain bin gem is the best way to sum it up.\n",
        "\nWriting off bands as worthless - it is a pretty bad idea. Though I still maintain my stance on Machine Head (yeah, 10 minute long groove metal songs, great fucking idea Flynn!), acts like Six Feet Under, Underoath or Dimmu Borgir have all pulled a few surprises out of their collective hats. And the late Pantera is no exception - this is what they were trying to be all along. This is their culmination, their masterpiece, and undoubtedly the greatest groove metal album of all time. What is found here is pretty much everything I love in my metal.\n\nFor one, never have I heard an album with so much attitude, so much vitriol, so much... balls. This is pure, fire spitting southern groove at its absolute saturation point of rage. Not only does the music sound angry, but you get the sense that the band themselves are fucking pissed. The vocals and lyrics don't carry this sense of aggression alone, for every element of the music conveys the murderous, acidic hatred that the band is trying to put into the music. From the very first seconds of the title track, with Seth Putnam's (R.I.P.) opening scream, you know you are in for one hellish ride.\n\nThis sense of anger was never quite there in this band's previous 2 albums. It sounded angry, but it never felt the same way - it felt contrived and marketable to the lowest common denominator. One reason for this, and indeed one of things I hate most about Vulgar Display of Power and to a lesser extent, Far Beyond Driven, is Phil Anselmo's pretty poor vocals. A certain satanic unicorn once described Phil's voice on their 1992 effort as sounding like 'a dying bullfrog'. Though his voice here is superficially similar here, it sounds far more angry and evil. He still can't do death metal vocals, but instead has morphed his voice into a very aggressive thrash/hardcore shout, with a seriously raspy shriek at times that borders on black metal. Especially when he layers his voice on tracks like 'Sandblasted Skin', he sounds like a monster.\n\nThis is a very fitting vocal performance for the sheer hatred that Anselmo is spewing forth. The lyrics on this are a marked shift from their previous fits of tough-guy idiocy (Vulgar Display of Power) and the crap self-loathing / tough guy idiocy of Far Beyond Driven. Essentially, rather than Anselmo shouting about how 'HE'S GONNA FUCK YOU UP!' he is now shouting about how everyone around him should 'FUCK OFF!'. Almost as bone-headed? Yes, it is. Way more effective? Of course it bloody is! Hell, 'War Nerve' literally begins with these words:\n\n'Fuck the world, for all it's worth!\nEvery inch of planet Earth!\nFuck myself, don't leave me out!\nBut don't get involved, don't corner me!'\n\nThe song itself is a big middle finger to the media, who were talking shit about Phil after a controversial speech made on rap music and black power. This is another thing this album possesses: genuine drive. The band actually had things to be pissed about now, whether it be Phil's drug addiction ('Living Through Me (Hell's Wrath)' and '10's'), the speech ('War Nerve'), or the trends (the title track, 'The Underground in America' and '(Reprise) Sandblasted Skin'). It is not a marketing tool anymore; this is genuine anger in musical form!\n\nAnd let\u2019s not forget about the music behind the fire-breathing frontman. The riffs are notably more 'sludgy' in nature, as well as taking more influence from thrash metal and southern metal, particularly Down. The best examples of this are intense scorchers like 'Suicide Note Pt. II' and the title track. Being Pantera, there are still grooves here, but songs that are predominantly groove metal, like 'Drag the Waters' or 'Living Through Me' are still bolstered by the aforementioned distilled anger and the production, which I shall come onto later. Dimebag's trademark soloing is as noodly and effect driven as always. Before, he served as a respite from all the boring groove, now he is one of several excellent things about the album. Vinnie's drum work is truly pummelling in nature, hammering away and adding to the overall loudness and vulgarity of the album. Even Rex Brown makes his contributions here - the album, in particular the guitars, sound goddamn meaty, and that low end can't all be the production, can it?\n\nAnother thing that helps the album along is its loudness. Now, I am normally one that favours a sense of dynamics in production, and thus shun just about any album that is loud all the time. Here though, this is a different case. Every instrument has been through a fair amount of filtering, with the loudness turned up a lot in the process. The drums and bass in particular, are exceptionally weighty in sound, and the guitar tone is very distorted and thick. The mix is pretty much spot on, with the low end not consuming everything else in reverb, and Phil's vocals given a good prominence in the mix, where he doesn't obscure the instruments or be consumed by the pummelling fury beneath him.\n\nFor an exceptionally angry and 'shouty' album, it does show a sense of variety. There are fucking sledgehammers like 'Suicide Note Pt II' or the title track, which grab the listeners by the neck, and then proceed to cave their skulls in with their barrage of screams and riffs. Slower, heavier numbers like 'The Underground in America', 'War Nerve' and '13 Steps to Nowhere' are equally sinister and destructive, while beating the listeners to bloody pulps. There is more typical groovy work, but even 'Drag the Waters' and 'Living Through Me' with their somewhat meandering structures and repetitious grooves are forgiven due to the overarching atmosphere and aggression.\n\nAnd then there are the ballads. They go for a subtle, atmospheric approach, immersing the listener in the tortured words of Phil and the oddly calm and in some cases, beautiful acoustics of 'Floods' or 'Suicide Note Pt. I'. They are all the more poignant due the odd contrast they share with the rest of the album, and serve as rather shocking numbers to first time listeners, having just come off of this album's usual furious groove (the transition from ballad to typical track here is almost as shocking).\n\nThere are also little sonic and atmospheric touches that pepper this album, normally in the form of synthesisers. Take for instance, that eerie as hell middle section of 'Living Through Me', or the manic guitar effects that lace 'Suicide Note Pt. II'. On a related note, the psychedelic synthesisers on the first part of 'Suicide Note' are highly atmospheric and beautiful. Even the micro-bends that litter '10's', that are normally indicative of nu 'metal', sound like a tortured, demented soul in guitar form, and fit the drug related lyrics perfectly. The storm sound effect combined with the pummelling grooves of 'Floods' before the end solo, or that obnoxiously loud high pitched synth screech at the end of 'The Underground in America' is fucking sinister, and well, angry. The demonic shrieking pulled off by Phil is highly indicative of black metal, only accentuated by the layered screams he does. They further add to the vitriol of the songs.\n\nEven the title of the album is fucking cool! 'The Great Southern Trendkill'. It warns us all of the potential death a listener could suffer trying to make it through this sonic catharsis! They finally nailed the badass factor with the cover art - never mind the tryhard drill-through-head/anus or man-being-punched bullshit of old. Nothing is cooler than a snake.\n\n...I am rambling a bit here, aren't I? In that case, I shall sum this up: Seriously, this is one of the greatest metal albums of all time. Never have I heard the artist's message so well conveyed through factors outside the lyrics, i.e.: atmosphere. When the instruments themselves sound possessed and tortured, you know you have one quality album right here. This is so heavy, so cathartic, so aggressive... it is the culmination of groove metal and Pantera, artistically. This isn't really one for the faint of heart (Pantera at their worst never were) or those who prefer the old school (Cowboys From Hell is right up that road). However, for those that don't mind a little bit of modernity in all the right ways, or as Phil puts it, 'blending the '80s and '90's with hate', then I highly recommend this. Seriously, it had an impact only albums like Reign In Blood or De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas has had on me. Not to compare this to those - but it is that profound, musically, lyrically and atmospherically. Turn it up loud and say it proud - 'THE TREND IS DEAD'!\n",
        "\nThe Great Southern Trendkill is easily Pantera's best album. Its predecessors had both their weak and strong points to them, but this giant amongst them all is Pantera's most solid record to date. The mix of groove and some thrash metal with acoustic parts is just so fantastic. It's not just one thing that makes this album so good. Every aspect of the album has something good to contribute here. Despite a few bumps here and there, The Great Southern Trendkill will always be my favorite Pantera album.\n\nBecause there are so many positive attributes that this record possesses, it was hard to pick one. However, I think what I love most about this album is that there isn't one song that is completely filler. Every single song is original and unique and could stand on its own. Therefore, there was a wonderful mixture of different arrangements, ranging from the mostly acoustic \"Floods\" to the ballistic and spastic \"Suicide Note Pt. II.\"\n\nThe songwriting abilities of Pantera had also reached their peak during the making of The Great Southern Trendkill. There was so much material being produced here that some songs, the \"Suicide Note\" songs, had to be broken into two desperate pieces of music. \"Floods\" showed off the sensitive side of Pantera in a similar way that \"Cemetery Gates\" did in 1990. The title track of this record also brought a lot to the table. It's one half pure chaos, and the other half is some southern influenced shredding. Southern influenced? Chaos? I think that The Great Southern Trendkill sums up the band's sound, image, and some of their philosophy very well.\n\nPantera has always been shedding its skin and evolving into a different kind of beast on each album. One thing that you will notice here is how wacky the guitar riffing is here. Dimebag Darrell's sound when you listen to the \"The Great Southern Trendkill\" is not natural from what I can hear. The sound of his six-string beast sounds like it has been used, abused and altered beyond belief. I will be talking about this later in my review, but this can be off-putting to some. However, you can see right away that this worked to his advantage on a few tracks like the one mentioned above, and \"Suicide Note Pt. 2.\" \n\nThe biggest problem concerning this album is the production. Just about everything gets a ten out of ten from me on The Great Southern Trendkill, but the production was the loogie in the punch bowl that ruined the party. The most obvious flaw is the lack of bass sound. Rex Brown is almost inaudible throughout the entire album. Dimebag once again takes center stage with the melodic sound as Brown's sound is choked out. My listening experience was altered as I tried to search for traces of his bass tones within the wave of guitars drums and Anselmo's screams. Just about all of the instruments here sound very artificial. It seems as if they have been put through filter after filter to point where you can't even hear the original sound anymore. Even Paul's kit sounds altered beyond belief. The snare hits and kick tones sounded exactly alike. Although I don't think it happened, it sounded as if every last beat Paul played was recorded by itself and looped. \n\nDespite this disappointment The Great Southern Trendkill was an instant classic. It was extremely heavy, caustic, and wonderfully atrocious. Phil Anselmo as a singer and screamer had reached his peak here, as well as the rest of his legendary band. With only one more album to come, I still think of this as the last true Pantera record that still draws the attention of seasoned listeners and those new to metal alike.\n",
        "\nLet me tell you about the things I hate. I hate stinky tofu, I hate being interrupted while reading the last 5 pages of a book, I hate days that are cold and rainy, I hate music that has no aim to it, and I hate haemorrhoids (though I merely dislike American spelling). I hated Pantera's 'Far Beyond Driven' so much that it currently has my second lowest review score on the Metal Archives. But I don't hate this album. 'Vulgar Display of Power' is not a cold turd left outside your window all night, nor is it even a loose fart in an elevator as Pantera's final two albums were. In fact, a lot of it is pretty good.\n\nGet this: my sister bought me this album for Christmas one year, I think when I was 15. I listened to it on Christmas day, probably still wearing my pyjamas, and I thought it was great, though in that skeptical way where you're not sure exactly whose opinion you used to make a judgement. There was something that didn't sit easily with me, which - on reflection - was likely the recording quality, since at that time most of the music I listened to was modern (post-2000 anyway) and had a much fuller production, without such clear definition of individual instruments. Indeed, 'Vulgar Display of Power' does have a slightly dry production, coming from a distant, echoey room on the quieter songs ('This Love' and 'Hollow' both have the same, almost 80s ballad-like quality) and grinding and chugging rather dirtily during the heavier parts. Maybe it's lazy to say so, but I'm reminded of the production on 'The Black Album', which doesn't make the album flow out of the speakers very smoothly (it's slightly too rhythmical), even if it sounds heavy as hell for the uninitiated.\n\nTo be perfectly honest, I was one of the uninitiated. The following year, my sister bought me Marilyn Manson's 'The Golden Age of Grotesque', which I took an instant shine to and probably play more regularly than this album. I came at Pantera from a nu metal standpoint: my music collection was entirely heavy, but leaned towards Korn and Mudvayne and Slipknot, with just a few Iron Maiden, Machine Head, and Chimaira albums to instruct me on the purer traditions. Now, I've seen it written a few times that an album like this one was a stepping stone in the evolution towards nu metal and, while I agree that it may have signposted the genre, most of the songs left me cold in that regard, ferocious groove riffs aside. The thing is, groove metal is not really a strain of metal in its own right, more like a mishmash of several genres played with a markedly different emphasis on style - the same thing that has been argued about Darkthrone's 'A Blaze in the Northern Sky', which is essentially a death metal album played in a black metal style (and some of that grooves with the best of them). Pantera come partly from the direction of classic heavy metal, as one can hear from the leads; they come partly from thrash metal, with its greater intensity, distorted vocals, and chugging power, which these guys put the brakes on; on this album, they also come from a hardcore background (one might even say they foreshadow metalcore) with many of the flatter, lower riffs, such as on the introduction of 'A New Level', the sloganeering vocals of which also come steeped in hardcore's essence.\n\nAs such, this album doesn't end up either very pure or very progressive, because the classic elements are modernised to attempt stylistic development, though not developed to the extent that they actually highlight the commencement of a new style. This album is thus disliked by both purists and modernists, because it straddles the divide: it was captured leaving the realms of traditional heavy metal, but not yet breaking the new ground that bands such as Korn, Disturbed, and Killswitch Engage would expand in the following decade. Hence, I was unsure about it back then, when I found it a little heavy and complex, and I'm unsure about it now, when I find it slightly plain and unimaginative.\n\nThe actual music hits more often than it misses, with no really awful songs. 'Walk' is hugely overrated and really quite tedious, while 'This Love' and 'Hollow' are mostly too heartfelt or hamfisted, depending on which section of the song one listens to, while 'Regular People (Conceit)' only has one good riff and a solo, which isn't enough for five and a half minutes. Everything else is worthwhile, with a few nice riffs per song and always inventive soloing, whether in melodic or frenetic style. Some of the songs, like 'Rise' and 'Fucking Hostile', slip over the boundary into thrash territory, contrasting with 'No Good (Attack the Radical)' and 'Mouth for War', both of which are deeply satisfying groove odysseys that don't give up on being heavy. I'm not fully decided about my favourite song (even after eight and a half years), though it might well be one of the two just mentioned.\n\nLike most of Pantera's albums, there is a good deal of frustration to put up with for 80% of listeners. All the musicians are skillful, Dimebag Darrell being the standout of the bunch, but they don't always play the way one believes they can. Why, for example, did such an outstanding guitarist come up with an iconic riff like the one on 'Walk' (annoying as that song is, the riff is distinctive and provoking), then do nothing to progress that idea throughout the song; why did he feel it was acceptable to include two clean parts on the album, both of which resemble one another so closely; why don't any of his solos have the backing of a second guitar to allow him to shred with wind beneath his wings? Some of the oversights are absurd, including Phil Anselmo's vocals. I don't think he sounds truly dreadful on this album, but he doesn't even come close to his performance on 'Cowboys from Hell', nor does he do a lot to change up his style for different songs. It's meathead singing replacing metalhead singing, simple as that. The rhythm players don't cock up a great deal, though it is this rhythm section that results in the album's overall grooviness and frequent lack of fluidity, which is my major gripe with the style - it just doesn't feel free or dangerous, as the best albums should.\n\n'Vulgar Display of Power' is therefore a significant marker in metal's history, yet not a release that rewards regular returns from a listener such as myself. It provided a bridge for metal genres that later dispensed with some of the more conventional trappings of the Sabbath/Priest/Maiden template and proves that groove is not a genre, merely an effect of style. Sadly, the only people that it can truly satisfy are those without much knowledge of what stands on either side of it, since only those listeners can experience it for what it is and love it for what is actually there, rather than what is missing.\n",
        "\nWhen I began listening to metal music back in the day, Pantera was one of the first bands I discovered. Mainly thanks to the videogame DOOM, as some of the music tracks from the game were based on Pantera songs (such as E3M1, based on the song Mouth of War). I immediately fell in love with the band's explosive and aggressive musical style and to this day they still remain one of my absolute favorite bands.\n\nCowboys from Hell isn't Pantera's first album, but both the band members as well as the fans (me included) consider this Pantera's true debut. And it's easy to see why, Cowboys from Hell was Pantera's first album in which the band began to show off their true colors. Gone were the glam looks and pop metal music, and in came a sound that was more brutal and intense than anything the band had produced before. They exchanged M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce and Twisted Sister for Slayer and Black Sabbath and the result is beyond awesome.\n\nThe album starts off with the title track and the epic, powerful opening guitar riff gives you a crystal clear hint of what the band has in store for you with this album. Pure, unadulterated metal with a groovy, catchy sound to it. Then the bass and drums kick in and you can't help but get sucked into the music. And when Phil yells \"ah come on,\" the ice is completely broken and the thrashing fest begins!\n\nAs the album progresses, you can clearly feel this is the type of music Pantera has always wanted to make. You can hear the band's confidence flourish through the album. Phil's vocals are sung with conviction, Dimebag Darrell has the time of his life with his guitar and that combined with Rex's fast paced bass and Vinnie's intensive drumming gives the album a highly energetic feel.\n\nNot all of the album's songs are fast paced thrashers though as some tracks, such as Psycho Holiday and the Sleep have a slower, deeper style to it with Darrell using more melodic and classical guitar styled solos instead of the more harsh riffs as in other tracks such as Domination or the album's title track. Phil's vocals are also different in these songs, as he sings more cleanly and higher pitched than in other songs from the album.\n\nMy personal favorite track for the album is without a doubt Cemetery Gates. Darrell's beautiful acoustic guitar opening (and let's not forget the solo in the middle part, definitely one of his best performances) combined with Phil's honest to god vocals about his personal grief for the loss of a dear friend and him struggling to move on with his life. It's easy to see why this song became one of Pantera's most famous. Another favorite of mine is the little known track The Sleep. A slow, dreamlike tune with an awesome guitar solo put in between.\n\nThe album's cover is nice but isn't as badass as those from Pantera's later albums. I would have suggested a picture of the band members in cowboy clothes standing beside each other and pointing their revolvers towards the camera. Other than the cover, there's nothing really negative for me to say about the album. Overall, Cowboys from Hell perfectly serves as an introduction to Pantera's music. It isn't their best or heaviest work, but this album certainly is well worth listening to even after all these years. Now go and enjoy the art of shredding!\n",
        "\nThe biggest question with a live album is always this: Does this album give the same nearly indescribable angst-ridden vibe that the show produces? Can you feel the sweaty, excited fans in the mosh pit throwing each other about, and the emotion that the musicians of the band are trying to convey? These were the question that I asked myself before listening to this release. \n\nThe record begins with the audience shouting \u201cPantera\u201d on the top of their lungs and then the unmistakable feedback of Dimebag Darrell\u2019s guitar begins whipping up the first song of the night, \u201cA New Level.\u201d And you just know that its going to one hell of a show if that\u2019s the first song performed. And what a hell of a show it was. I especially loved Phil Anselmo\u2019s banter and the long angry rant he goes into after the end of \u201cSandblasted Skin.\u201d He is one of the most outspoken and entertaining people in heavy metal and he showcases this with his powerful voice and personality on this record so well. Another thing about this record that I like is that I can hear every instrument to a decent extent but also that each one sounds so great. I can close my eyes and see Vinnie destroying his set and Rex, Dimebag, and Phil running about the stage preaching their views on the \u201cphilosophy of Pantera.\u201d \n\nThe song selection by the band was very good and featured Pantera\u2019s best work so far in their career. It was nice to see \u201cDom / Hollow\u201d on this album because Pantera plays it live at every show and always mixes the two songs together. I knew that the guitar solo that is put at the end of \u201cDomination\u201d was cool, but when Dime played it at this show it absolutely shattered everything in its path. The version of \u201cCemetery Gates\u201d on this record was interesting mainly because it was shortened at the beginning. And when Mr. Philip H. Anselmo sings the first verse of the song his voice produces a tranquil echo-like effect that amplifies the demeanor of that part of the song. The listener can tell right away that this concert was for reminiscing and barely at all for showing off new tracks due to brand new songs \u201cWhere You Come From\u201d and \u201cI Can\u2019t Hide\u201d being shoved to the end of the set-list. It would have been more fitting in my opinion if they ended with a one of their more known hits versus some new songs. \n\nThe album artwork of this record is full of symbolism directly relating to Pantera\u2019s roots. For example, the phrase 101 proof is a direct reference to moonshine which is very present in southern culture and has a high alcohol content at 50% (101 proof.) The bottle on the album cover is a Jack Daniel\u2019s Whiskey bottle usually featuring the number 7 on it, but because that this was Pantera\u2019s fifth record, the band put the number 5 on the bottle\u2019s label. Featuring the message \u201cPure Against The Grain American Metal\u201d Pantera gives its listeners an awesome live album that will remain one of the best metal live albums of all time. It\u2019s a shame that this was the only live album that this band did, because I would have definitely bought that one too. \u201cThe trend is dead!\u201d\n",
        "\nSo it turns out Pantera wouldn't release any albums I like front to back (maybe their glam stuff but I'm really not interested to track that stuff down) and sadly their legacy in my eyes comes down to a very mixed bag career of solid tracks and songs that aren't worth the amount of space they occupy on the internet. The other half of their legacy comes down to their heavy influences on nu-metal, metalcore and groove metal, which as genres are as hit and miss as Pantera themselves.\n\nI think this would have been a better way to end their career then Reinventing the Steel or that Piss single that came out recently. First off the guitar work is better. It actually has substance and the band was still cohesive enough to pump out some solid songs.\n\nThe guitar work is closest to Far Beyond Driven but slower. Dimebag has a lot of slower riffs (Drag the Waters and 10's) mixed in amongst the faster riffs (The Great Southern Trendkill and Suicide Note Pt. 2). His sound is deeper and heavier then ever before (or after) which of course leads to a sound that is more naturally heavy and less forced. His soloing sounds very emotive on 10's (which fits the track well) but on the other hand in The Great Southern Trendkill its breakneck shredding. His riffing actually has melody now which actually works beautifully with the rhythmic groove style and shows growth in his style, this is the first album his guitar work has kept me interested and entertained from front to back. He even gets an acoustic section on Suicide Note that is probably the best bit of compositional work he's ever done. He shows a lot of versatility on this album and I would consider it to be the highlight of his career.\n\nPhil manages to make his vocals the best they've been since CFH (which was his highlight). He's very emotive (10's and Suicide Note Pt. 1), lays off the tough guy act quite a bit but still manages to sound masculine, but now he sounds naturally masculine which is a 100% improvement. His range hasn't returned but he makes his way just fine without it. His lyrical content has expanded and the amount of substance in the music has skyrocketed.\n\nThe rhythm section is tight. The drummer knows when to use speed and when to lay off a bit. Still simplistic but far more forgivable. The bass player can actually clearly be heard for the most part and the rumors were right, this man is the perfect match for Dimebag, there parts intertwine almost seamlessly.\n\nFor all its ups though there are also downs. Suicide Note Pt. 2 is the weakest song here, despite lyrics about suicide this track still seems like an excuse to be mindlessly heavy and vulgar and its just rather weak, insipid, substanceless and (minus the first time when it will floor you with speed, anger and aggression) is extremely boring. In fact the two softest most balladic songs here Suicide Note Pt. 1 (which is now my favorite Pantera song) and 10's, a band who's reputation is those tough guys who never lay off and go soft and their best tracks are ballads, I swear there is an irony in that.\n\nStandout Tracks: Suicide Note Pt. 1, 10's, Drag the Waters and The Great Southern Trendkill\n",
        "\nOf the 4 Pantera albums I've reviewed so far this is the best, ignoring a few tracks on Cowboys From Hell and some nice solos on Reinventing the Steel Pantera has provided a catalogue ranging from boring (Yesterday Don't Mean Sh**) to just straight up bad (Walk). This album is still a far cry from perfect but on average it felt like a pretty worthwhile listen\n\nPhil has basically abandoned his vocal range altogether at this point. If there were any moments where he tried to take a moment to shine they were easily forgotten, I doubt there was though, I'm fairly confident he has destroyed his voice by this point. He does fully utilize his screams here though. They take awhile to get used to. His lyrics have moved away from being mindless drivel about masculinity and beating people up and have focused on other (still extremely masculine) topics, its a nice change even if it sticks close to the tree.\n\nThe guitar work comes next, again no technicality or melody. Just that rhythmic grooving that he loves so much. His tempos are up and he remembers to utilize riff changes so he does a much better job at not getting stale. Pair this with the new lyrics and it adds in some desperately needed substance to the music. His soloing, while still borrowing heavily from Slayer's screeching and Van Halen's effects, also incorporates shredding in a much better way and his signatures style finally sounds unique and somewhat innovative. Also, this is Dimebag we're talking about, expect screeches everywhere (Strength Beyond Strength) also expect some pinch harmonics here and there. His guitar work over all is far more interesting and demanding of praise (except maybe his screeches, he's usually pretty competent at how he uses those).\n\nThe drums are faster then before but are still mostly just time keepers, very simplistic and nothing you haven't heard the likes of before. He uses the double pedal to its fullest and there is more variation between his beats as it seems he's trying new things. The bass player sadly is mixed out. Again, I hear he is the perfect match for Dimebag, but I can't actually HEAR him for most of it, I mean come on turn the guy up a notch or two will you, I'm sure he deserves it.\n\nThis album would have gotten 10% higher except there is one stinking turd on here that simply cannot be ignored. That stinking pile of turd goes by the name 'Good Friends and a Bottle of Pills'. The bass is clearly audible but uses a single one note rhythmic groove through the entire thing. The guitar is mostly screeches that sound like they were thrown together with no real thought. The drumming is slow and reminiscient of a rap beat (which would normally be excusable in my book funny enough). The vocals are have no emotion or energy and are just spoken drivel, I would say its a bad attempt at rapping but that would require him to at least sound like he was trying to stick to a particular rhythm or pattern which he doesn't in any way.. The lyrics are about 'fuckin yo girl while you was asleep homie' with as much unnecessary vulagrity as possible. The best part though is that it sounds like it ended and then you hear the drums and bass pick up again just so they can fade out, like seriously, what was the point in that?\n\nMost of the rest of the album is quite enjoyble with maybe 2 or 3 tracks that are pretty boring but man this one was just bad.\n",
        "\nThis is probably as bad as Pantera would have ever become had it not been their last album. The most unfortunate part is how Ill fated it was, everything that made them good or even tolerable is lost. Skill wise, writing wise and as far as how it blends together, it is just bad on all sides.\n\nI honestly don't get how this band gets the praise that they do. They say this band saved metal in the early 90s but ignored oh... I don't know... Sepultura, Slayer, Megadeth, Dio, the blossoming death metal scene etc. who were all pumping out well received albums at that point as well. Fast forward to the release of this album. Dio is still pushing his hardest to keep the scene going, Megadeth returns to their thrash roots, death metal and black metal have both reached the global market, Iron Maiden welcomes back Bruce Dickinson. Point being made that Pantera are nowhere near the saviors of metal that their fans claim they are. While were talking about saving metal, isn't this the same band that inspired groove metal, nu-metal and metalcore, some of the most hated subgenres you'll find.\n\nWhat else doesn't live up to its hype? Dimebag Darrel and his playing. He's always had a style that relied on repetitive rhythmics and screeches but he really out does himself here. All that progress made on the last two albums is gone. These are some of the worst riffs he would ever write. They aren't melodic by any means, no technicality at all, overly repetitious, and not catchy in any way (plus there are a couple one fret riffs to be found here as well). Besides being present and being heavy they don't really do much. They might drive the songs forward, but even that seems like a stretch. What could have caused this, band issues, laziness, freshly out of ideas? Whatever it was Dimebag just didn't provide much passable work here; it is beyond boring, it is straight up bad. How about his screeches? Yeah, he relies on those very heavily now but unfortunately screeching is never solid enough to save a performance, add to this that some of these are just terribly placed and the guitar work just winds up as a total mess. Some how despite this all he still has some good solos up his sleeves (Yesterday Don't Mean Sh*t).\n\nIt would seem smoking and screaming have now caught up with Phil. His range has gone down the toilet and the general sound of his voice has become unpleasant. Once again he tries to pin you down with that tough guy attitude but even this seems to push the boundaries of his new range. His screams have become a high point but these also aren't as great as they once were. Plus it's overly vulgar, this kind of language is nothing new to Pantera, but good lord, take out all the swearing and you come to find out most of the lyrics seriously lack depth and thought of any type, even the overly manly themes seem poetic and legendary in comparison.\n\nThe rhythm department also seems to be running out of ideas, all the drumming is either stuff I swear I've heard on previous records or it is an all speed (with nothing) else attempt to pound his way into the spotlight. The best part about the bass before was that it was always perfectly matched with the guitar (had this still been the case it would have helped both performances) but alas no more. He comes here to round out the sound and awkwardly try to work his way in with the rest of them, he accomplishes this just barely and often slips up. In fact the tight coordinated and well put together group known as Pantera has fallen into full disarray, they had great chemistry and worked with each other perfectly at one point. Now they sound so amateurish in how they try to come together.\n",
        "\nIf you're going to talk about the 90's, it's worth mentioning the sorry state of metal at the time. Now I know that groups like Alice in Chains and Soundgarden played some of the heaviest mainstream rock at the time, but the fact of the matter is that history remembers them as grunge bands, and grunge fans were known not to pay lip service. The heyday of thrash was gone, and we didn't even have nu-metal to at least put people in the right direction. So as you can imagine, the good ol' boys in Pantera had quite a responsibility with the torch they were carrying. If metal bands were to maintain any sort of credibility with the masses, Pantera was the best they had. However, like with Slayer, \"intelligent\" was probably not how the average listener described their music; a lot of it had a down-and-dirty \"don't fuck with us\" attitude, which in this case was arguably as famous as the music itself.\n\nBut like with all artists, Pantera was destined to put out something more complex, and this is what fans got in 1996. The Great Southern Trendkill, the way I listen to it, is a unique release in that it really sounds like the band has been fucked with. In its monster title track and opener, the first words out of Philip Anselmo's mouth are, \"It's wearing on my mind, I'm speaking all my doubts aloud.\" From that point on, you know that the album is his personal lashing-out against the music/social scene of the time, as well as himself. The title song attacks popular but unoriginal artists that passed off the Southern/blues style as their own, while \"The Underground in America\" is a rant against privileged youth who sold their souls to punk rock degeneracy.\n\nIt only gets darker from there. \"War Nerve,\" \"13 Steps to Nowhere,\" \"Living Through Me,\" all straight-up, dirty, drug-fueled misanthropy against people most of us probably know. \"I broke your fucking mold, then threw away the cast,\" said by everyone to nearly anyone else. Meanwhile, the \"Suicide Note\" songs probably scrape the bottom of Anselmo's desperate mind. Part 1 solemnly reflects upon the self-destructive path he followed, while Part 2 is him preparing for the \"obvious\" solution. Cathartic stuff.\n\nAnd then what to say about \"Floods?\" Honestly, I'm trying to start another paragraph for the song, but it really does leave a good part of me speechless. It's what I can only call an apocalypse ballad. Pantera is a Southern band, so there's no hiding the religious aspect of their identity. They took their hatred and put it on a spiritual level. Theirs is a vengeful God, and for a mankind \"playing with grenades,\" with \"deaf ears sleeping,\" what else but a flood of Biblical proportions could be over the horizon?\n\nObviously, Pantera was a groove metal band, but I think even the music is full of surprises. Fans of their usual style won't be disappointed, because \"War Nerve\" and the single \"Drag the Waters\" are rock-solid and all about the riffs. Interestingly, the album actually begins and ends with a more death/thrash style, which shows strongly on the blisteringly-fast \"Suicide Note Part 2.\" It wouldn't be a Pantera record without some slower material, but on \"Trendkill,\" I think they perfected this style. The progression on \"Floods\" and \"10's\" is just exquisite, and they include some of Dimebag Darrell's finest and most melodic solos.\n\nSo overall, this is easily one of the most diverse metal records I've heard. It's groove, sludge, thrash, death, and Southern metal all rolled into one, yet Pantera made it all their own. It didn't have as many singles as earlier releases, but the fact it had any is a credit to the band, because they were breaking new ground here. In the end, The Great Southern Trendkill (ironically a 90's release) stands as one of my all-time favorite albums, metal or otherwise.\n",
        "\nThis is Pantera's follow up to their debut Cowboys From Hell and third undeniably legitimate metal release and unfortunately instead of showing growth or progress it seems to travel backwards taking the Cowboys From Hell sound and watering it down.\n\nThe lyrics are still dominated by being a macho man but now they swing at street life. Maybe you like the basic lyrical idea (I say basic as not every track focuses on these topics but it seems to be the focus and drive of the album) however for many this seems eerily similar to what many rappers were doing at the same time. As far as how the lyrics are delivered Phil likes to really try to emphasize his masculinity in how he performs. It just doesn't come off as that way to me though. He sounds like he's forcing it, trying to hard to be over the top macho and while doing it he ruins the actual quality put into his singing. I think the guy probably is all that he's trying to show but he doesn't know how to let it flow naturally. In the end his vocals fail to leave anything impressive or to be desired.\n\nThe guitar work subpar. Dimebag once again uses the same groove riff through the entire course of a song only stopping to throw in his solos. This method was largely very boring before but still managed to pump out some quality songs. Here though much of it is slowed down and even his greatest riffing suffers from it, the repetition becomes more intolerable with midpaced tempos (funny since that means it gets repeated less), the speed takes away a lot of the power. Dimebag's guitar tone is too trebley and lacks in heaviness and power meaning that these slow riffs generally become hard too listen to for the whole song. His solos sound like Van Halen meets Slayer, very screechy squealy but with a ton of added effects and unfortunataly here the guitar compositions sound improvised, not in a virtuoso kind of way but like an amateur guitar player trying to show some chops. Skilled playing on the solos but very poorly composed and written.\n\nUnder this lies a bass that followed the guitar in slow groove riffs. He doesn't show much skill or much spark in the composition department but he must be respected for his ability to be a team player. While Pantera's music lacks many elements chohesion is not one of them, the chemistry between the members is solid and even strangely professional. The drummer also mostly keeps it slow to match his buddies and he doesn't get very much time to shine, he mostly keeps a consistent beat and holds time but every once in awhile he gets to throw in some double pedal and pound down that set as hard as he can.\n\nThere aren't any tracks I really enjoyed so I won't be posting any standout tracks.\n",
        "\nAfter actually enjoying some White Zombie I thought I'd freshen up on some other groove metal bands and see if they had grown on me. These guys didn't, so sad considering they started the whole thing and have been a major influence on many other bands that I have loved.\n\nFrom the first track, the title track Cowboys From Hell I gathered that this album would be mediocre at best. The song had a boring monotonous riff, the rhythm section was repetitive, the solo sounded like a Slayer rip off with Van Halen effects thrown in and the lyrics were basically all about being a big macho man, but it did groove and had a good sprinkling of force and power. Not really a bad song, but not really good either, just pure unadultered mediocrity. If all the songs had been like this it would have been an exact 50%.\n\nThe basic ideas of Cowboys From Hell are the same basic ideas for every other track. Keep a strong rhythmic groove going that someone can headbang to. Have Phil try to make the lyrics and singing as masculine as possible. Have a heavily screech reliant (and usually much needed) solo. Keep all these things up within a basic song structure (intro, verse, chorus, verse, chorus, verse/solo, chorus)- and you have the basic format (and formula, yes it feels very formulaic) of Pantera. For the most part its just for mindless headbanging, not something designed to be flashy and intricate. Its basically bland and boring to listen to the whole album front to back, what's presented here are tracks best fit to stand alone through radio or shuffled playlists because if you listen to them all in a clump you'll get tired of most of them by the time you've finished track 2.\n\nI guess there is also an element of disappointment. I think we've all heard the Dimebag hype. I hate to talk bad about the deceased, especially since from what I've heard he was a great guy but he doesn't live up to the hype here. He's expressed as this guitar god but most of his riffs here are midpaced and simple. The man has skills, but a god? Only because of untimely demise and openminded and open hearted spirit. Some of the riffs here are basically hitting one note over and over a again in an odd rhythmic way (like the main verse riffs of Cowboys From Hell and Primal Concrete Sledge). He is in love with his screeches, you will not hear a single solo on hear that is heavily dependent on them. He also loves to use them as intros (Cowboys From Hell, Heresy and The Art of Shredding) it makes for really weak intros but they're short enough to not do any substantial damage to the track. I guess he is the one who set the standards for groove metal, very rhythmic but not very melodic or technical, that is the best way to sum up his style,\n\nPhil really tries to hammer you down with his tough guy lyrics but he also tries to prove it in how he sings. He's not always successful as he often seems like he's compensating, he has a good range (for now) though and is capable of laying down some good work, he just tries a little bit too hard to force it in. I'm sorry Phil you try a little too hard, focus a bit more on what's being delivered and less on how its delivered. Lyrical diversity would not hurt your band's scores at all.\n\nThe drummer plays fast but its simple. He keeps a beat going and that's about it, he keeps time for his buddies and provides a basic beat to keep it going (I'd say he uses his beats much the same way a rapper does, more of a way to get you hooked on it then anything else). The bass player was mixed out, what a shame because I hear he is the perfect match for Dimebag's style. Pantera's biggest strengths is that they are heavy, catchy (by repetition, not composition) and that the band members have excellent chemistry, they know exactly how to work with each other. I can see how this caught on, and I certainly don't have as much disdain for it as I once did, but it is disgustingly overrated.\n\nCemetery Gates, Medicine Man, Primal Concrete Sledge (that one grew on me a lot) and The Art of Shredding were all worthy songs. Most of the rest is stuff I wouldn't actively pursue for a listen, I might listen to them if they come up on Pandora station but I'm as likely to skip them. There also a few songs I won't give another chance beyond this; Shattered, Heresy and The Sleep to be specific.\n",
        "\nI would like to take a second to say this is clearly not a single but an EP. Then I would like to say even a Pantera fan would probably have an issue deciding to spend money on this.\n\nIt starts with a 'cervical edit' of Walk. There is an odd sound to the guitar, I believe it is a production thing. It takes away from the guitar's edge. The vocals sound distorted and have effects thrown into them, this takes away from the performance. \n\nMaybe you've heard the original version of Walk, it has a slow groove that doesn't drive anything, it has power but doesn't do anything. The solo is weak. The vocals are that of a guy trying to show he's a big tough man. Original song was boring but now the guitar power is gone and the vocals sound way too distorted. They took a song that was boring and made it into a song that is not passable.\n\nThe next two tracks are like that too, Fucking Hostile and By Demons Be Driven. Well these two have the added defect of having ending that are way too drawn out. They could have ended 10 maybe even 20 seconds earlier, but didn't and put me to sleep, not even exaggerating.\n\nThen there is a remix of Walk, that was worthy of like a 10%. A ten for managing to put something together that was at least structured, but it gains no credit for anything beyond that. Throws the production into places where they shouldn't go. Puts the song out of order jumbling up the parts and making the lyrics sound like nonsense while adding in some annoying siren sounding electronics and effects. Also adds in some really boring, simplistic and repetitive instrumental breaks that last like a minute.\n\nThis is finished off by some live tracks. The original songs were boring and the live versions didn't change my opinions of that. The band definitely put their energy into it but that doesn't mean its better then it is in studio. Phil sounds strained frequently through out Cowboys From Hell, I'm not sure if this is his voice going out, maybe he relies on studio too much or maybe this was just an off day for him (after bands go on stage whether their vocalist is in proper condition or not, but I imagine if this was it they would have chosen different recordings). Some of the screeches on the guitars sound literally like screeching as in two pieces of metal being scraped together, its not a good sound.\n",
        "\nI don't think I've ever been reconciled to this album, ever since the first time I bought it. I already had Vulgar Display of Power, which I liked pretty well, mostly because the guitar playing was heavy and catchy. This album was darker and less accessible - there's a very overt intention to oppress the listener on Far Beyond Driven, from the extremer than thou lyrics to the slightly murkier production to that sinister feel that hangs over the guitar melody on the opener. Overall, I would call it unsavoury, in both senses.\n\nTo get an overview of the album, I'll take a brief look at the roles of the quartet. Everyone has their own take on Phil Anselmo's vocals, so I won't go into a lot of detail, but he's shouty and incoherent rather than the brutal snarl that he can hear. Drums are overdone on here: Vinnie Paul is skilled behind the kit but is either trying to do too much and just making a noise or doing the wrong thing. Rex Brown is guilty of the same thing with his bass, except the addition of having a thundering tone and coming up with about 3 good parts all album. Dimebag Darrell pulled off some tasty solos on Vulgar Display of Power, but they are largely gone to shit on Far Beyond Driven, and two thirds of the riffs are just complete garbage.\n\nFirst song 'Strength Beyond Strength' provides a good place to start working out this album turns me off. It's one of the more popular songs on here and (to me anyway) is notoriously two-paced. The opening riff is a nasty, grinding piece of something that I don't want to examine; the second riff is a bit thrashy and much tastier; the song switches between the two of them, then the slower groove riff comes in with that ominous backing guitar and Phil Anselmo being slow, deep, and hard; the lead builds up really slowly, bursts out for a moment, and the groove riff is gone; repeat the first 2 riffs and we're home.\n\nIf that sounds boring or unappealing, that's because it is to some degree. The following 2 songs have really, really terrible stop-start riffs: 'Five Minutes Alone' rides an awful 3-note chug until it finally becomes alright after 3 minutes (for about 60 seconds), while 'Becoming' is actually excruciating because the shitty groove non-riff has an ugly pinch harmonic thrown in. Dimebag Darrell was a good guitarist, but the band really didn't have a clue what riffs sounded good here. Just because it sounds like someone hitting their head against the wall, doesn't mean I want to headbang to it. The first success comes in the form of 'I'm Broken', a very solid swaggering track which - while I wouldn't quite call it a riff-fest - has a number of swinging and stuttering riffs that work nicely in the same sort of style as before, though they sound godly in comparison.\n\nThe latter half of the album is more interesting than the beginning, provided that we sidestep carefully round 'Good Friends and a Bottle of Pills' like the 4-day-old pile of puke that it is. '25 Years' has the single worst one-note bang bang bang BANG riff that sees Phil Anselmo stomping over it like he's trying to dislodge excrement from his shoes (he is), plus one or two passable groove sections that actually count as riffs. Weirdly, 'Shedding Skin' has the audacity to actually not suck and 'Use My Third Arm' flings in a fairly convincing death metal riff, before we tumble out of the washing machine with a complete copy of Sabbath's 'Planet Caravan', which is easily the most pleasant song on the album.\n\nThe original cover art for this album was supposed to be a corkscrew going into someone's anus. The music isn't quite that unpleasant and painful to listen to, but we aren't far off. In terms of the idea, Far Beyond Driven sounds about as unsavoury as that image.\n",
        "\nPantera, few bands in all of music have people as divided in their opinions like Pantera. For those who don't know, Pantera is a metal band formed in Arlington Texas in 1982. They started out life as a hair metal band *shivers*. Those were dark days for Pantera, so dark that Pantera disowned them. Their first 3 records are derivative boring copies of an already derivative and boring sub-genre. Then Phil Anselmo joined. His entering the band saved them. His influence in the fate of Pantera can't be understated. He didn't do much at first, as he was the new guy, but he did enough to make Pantera's 4th album, if not great, a serviceable album. Listen to the jump in quality between \"I Am The Night\" and \"Power Metal\", and the difference become quite clear. However, that album didn't show the true interest of Anselmo, and it is on this album that we get a picture of what he wanted for the band. \n\nThis album is basically Phil's proving grounds. His vision gave Pantera the make over they needed. Not to say the band wouldn't have gotten heavier, in fact the main reason Phil is even here is because the band wanted a more metal singer, but Phil took them to places they never would have on their own, and took them there faster. On this LP, they really become Cowboys From Hell (I'm not 100% what that actually means, but I think you get the picture). This is a band that is pure heavy fucking metal. No pop trends and radio friendly stuff here, this is METAL. Not that the guys were total wimps before, but it sure seems that Anselmo kicked them into pure ass kicking mode. This is his real importance, not that he is a poor singer or anything, but his ability to make the band heavy outweighs anything he can do as an artist or singer. \n\nAlong with Anselmo, the other man who really made this album is, of course, \"Dimebag\" Darrel. I am not one of the people (*cough*all Pantera super fans*cough*) who worship DImebag as a god, but he is a great guitarist. He isn't the Jimi Hendrix of metal, but he knew how to use his axe better than most guitarists even dream of doing. His riffs are among the catchiest and heaviest in all of metal without ever sounding try-hard. They never ever feel forced on this album, they seem very relaxed (in an angry metal kinda way) and natural. His solos are furious and textured, and a real treat. On Pantera's last releases, Dime often had, as Allmusic puts it, \"Halen-isms\" that often ruined his otherwise stellar playing. Here, he drops trying to mimic others, and makes his own signature sound, and with it creates a large part of the Pantera sound we've come to know and love.\n\nI didn't mention it earlier, but the other thing Phil brought with him was a wide array of influences. His influences help this album have a much more varied sound to it, and experiment more. There are thrashers, ballads, and of course groove metal tunes abound. This is still a band that likes to stay with a comfortable sound, but here they do expand further than they would in the future. \n\nAll of Pantera's past lyrical themes are dropped here. This album is mostly about war or kicking ass, although songs like \"Cemetery Gates\" do get more personal and deep. This is a good thing, as it helps the lyrics avoid being cheesy and thus ruining the feel of the music. Phil doesn't have is drill sargent bark yet, but you can hear the authority in his voice. His singing is sharp and gruff, fitting in nicely with the badass attitude of the music. His voice also helps the songs sound angrier than they would, adding a punch they so desperately need. Don't expect this to be a deep and emotional album, as, aside from \"Cemetery Gates\", there isn't anything here that's exactly you tear up, and even that song gets most of it's emotion from Phil's delivery. \n\nAlso, I want to point out the rhythm section, made up by drummer Vinnie Paul and bassist Rex Brown. Vinnie does less work with his arms than he did on previous records, instead focusing largely on the bass drums. This may or may not be a sound you like, but it's essential to the Pantera equation. Until this album, Rex wasn't exactly audible. Now, with Pantera finally having good production, you can here his usually great bass parts. He usually stays behind the melody, playing parts that mostly spice up things while Dime drives the song. That makes it sound like he is unimportant, but quite to the contrary his parts are what really make these riffs as great as they are. Not that they were bad with just Dime, but Rex's counter melodies texture the riff and make them truly memorable.\n\nFor my money, this the essential Pantera album. Every album after this, they offer up the same music with less new ideas than before. Not that the following records were bad, but this is the only one I feel is really a \"must have\". That said, there are MANY Pantera die-hards that will take the other side of this argument, saying that Pantera redid the formula better and better each time, so it's really up for you to decide how you personally feel about that. But, one thing is for sure, we can all agree this is a great album, and one of the defining moments in 90's metal.\n",
        "\nAh Pantera, the band that (kinda) saved thrash and kept it relevant during the 90's. They were also the vehicle for Dimebag Darrel, a truly great guitarist (even if also truly overrated). There are as many fans of Pantera as there are people who can't stand them, even from within the metal community. Vulgar Display is often considered their masterwork, but in my opinion it just doesn't meet my standards for a classic.\n\nAfter the success of Cowboys From Hell, the pressure was on Pantera do deliver a follow-up that could match CFH. Many bands choose to not change the formula after their breakthrough album, but few bands have changed as little as Pantera does on this album. Not that that's a bad thing really, Pantera knew what they were good at and so they stuck to it, it just doesn't improve the sound so it feels like almost the same album in terms of sound. If you've never heard Pantera's music, it's basically thrash metal with a groove to it. Imagine if Metallica took advice from Stevie Wonder and threw in some detuned power chords. The result is better than it may sound, but it's also inconsistent. \n\nOn one hand, when the formula works, the songs are awesome. Songs like \"This Love\" and \"Walk\" are absolute metal classics, and there are many other classics here as well. Dimebag's solos are awesome as usual, Vinnie Paul's drumming is great, and the vocals from Phil Anselmo are wonderful. Rex Brown's bass work isn't as good, they in it's own right is of good quality. This is a skilled band, and when they hit the mark, their proficiency really helps carry those songs to places they wouldn't have otherwise.\n\nBut also, many songs here are more than a little boring, such as most of the second half of the record. Like Cowboys From Hell, the best songs are put at the beginning of the album, in the hopes that their momentum will carry the album. It worked on Cowboys From Hell because the weaker songs were not all that weak, but here the weak songs truly aren't that good. The last 20ish minutes of this album is completely forgettable. Not to say they are BAD just they are not even close to the heights of the first half. \n\nIf you like the bands other work, or are a fan of bands like Exhorder (but if you've heard of them it's almost a given that you've listen to Pantera) you'll find yourself happy here. Classic thrash fans may enjoy the difference from regular thrash, and won't feel put somewhere completely foreign to them. However, this album is not the best example of this sound. In my opinion, Cowboys From Hell is the better album. Still, this is a good album, and totally worthy of being picked up.\n",
        "\nIt takes me by surprise that this album is as heavily criticised as it is, because I initially always thought this was held in as high a regard in the metal community as Cowboys From Hell was. Personally, for me, this is the album where Pantera struck gold. The album where all of their attitude came fully into place. The album where Pantera fully became Pantera. I am obviously not knocking Cowboys From Hell: that was the starting point of the band's major success for a good reason, but Vulgar Display of Power pushed their brand of groove metal further. The band had gone from a simple, young, copycat glam metal band to an innovative dynamic band with a \"take no shit\" attitude that - let's be honest - worked for them. It was also the first full Pantera album I had listened to, and it would eventually turn me onto listening to all their other stuff.\n\nThis album is chock full of heavy anthemic tunes with powerful riffs courtesy of Dimebag Darrell. It's much darker in tone compared to Cowboys From Hell and all of the less-known albums before it, but still perfectly showcases the band's growing musical prowess. There are songs that just make you want to mosh and beg you to chant along to them whilst you do, like the mid-tempo opener \"Mouth for War\", the slower march-like \"Walk\" and the much faster \"Fucking Hostile\". On the other end of the spectrum, we have songs like \"This Love\" and \"Hollow\" that mix haunting melody with the heaviness of the aforementioned songs. The melodies are pretty much perfect for a band like Pantera, as they're enough to send chills down your spine. \"This Love\" contains a fantastic breakdown, similar to the one heard in \"Domination\" but with more frantic screaming from Phil Anselmo to top it off.\n\nSpeaking of Phil Anselmo, his vocal style is different here to what it was on the previous albums Power Metal and Cowboys From Hell. His vocals are suitably more aggressive for the most part, using more growls with the screams as opposed to primarily singing with a lot of screams thrown in. It works very much in the album's favour due do its musical style and attitude. However, he sings in a much softer tone for much of \"Hollow\", allowing himself to show off to the fans that he can portray multiple emotions in his voice. The album's lyrical themes include shooting down vicious rumours (\"Walk\" following accusations that fame had gone to the band members' heads), learning to channel the hate inside of you (\"Mouth for War\") and anger and resentment following a relationship (\"This Love\"). This was a band who wished to clear the air with people, and shoot those down who dared to stand in their way. \n\nAs a whole, Vulgar Display of Power fares much better sonically than Cowboys From Hell did. The production is slicker, eradicating much of the echoing of the band's instruments and giving the guitars more of a crunch. This also gives the rhythm section of Rex Brown and Vinnie Paul time to shine on several parts of the album. The ballads give us an insight into the emotional textures of the band that were not so much explored previously. The band wanted to make their heaviest album and they achieved that by writing darker riffs and darker lyrics, creating a much more intense atmosphere for the listener. The themes of the album were also more inspired than Cowboys From Hell by the members' personal experiences that pissed them off. They channeled their anger into an album that holds a special place in metal, and their influence is definitely heard in a lot of newer metal bands. Many of the songs from this release would go on to become big metal hits and/or fan favourites.\n\nDespite my previous thoughts about this album's reputation, it is now definitely clear to me that Vulgar Display of Power is somehow underrated despite its influence, though it certainly shouldn't be. This album should be enjoyed for what it is: a monstrous hour of both the heavy and the mellow varieties of metal which can serve to get you through a tough day when all you want to do is break something. Even if you're not in that state of mind, it's still a fantastic album with raw, honest emotion.\n",
        "\nTake one look at the ratings and reviews on this album, and it becomes clear that Pantera is a point of division among many a metalhead. To their fans, they were one of the greatest bands of their time and helped get heavy metal out of the rut that the grunge explosion had forced it into. To their detractors, Pantera was little more than mindless butt rock, and responsible for the nu metal disease at the end of the nineties. Much of this controversy ultimately comes down to one album, \"Vulgar Display of Power\".\n\nRight off the bat, I'll get \"that song\" out of the way. \"Walk\" is perhaps Pantera's most famous song, and ironically, one of their worst. The three note riff repeats itself ad naseam, while Phil Anselmo barks out the juvenile lyrics. \"Respect! Walk! Are you talking to me!\" are the words that should be coming out of a c-list gangsta rapper, not the man who displayed a Halford-like vocal range with their previous effort \"Cowboys from Hell.\" As for the repetition of the main riff, it's not that I have an issue with musical repetition, being a fan of AC/DC, the Ramones and Burzum (all three of whom are infamous for musical repetition, though for different reasons). But while the aforementioned bands could write songs that moved, \"Walk\" goes no where. It simply drones on at an annoying midpace.\n\n\"Walk\", though only one song, is an extreme example of the two main flaws with \"Vulgar Display of Power\": repetitive riffs and incoherently juvenile lyrics. Lyrics like \"shit on, pissed on, stepped on, fucked with, pointed at by lesser man\" show not much thought going on in the writing sessions beyond deliberately trying to come off as a \"tough\" band, while the monotony going on in the riffing of songs such as \"Live in a Hole\" and \"A New Level\" grows old quickly, a fact not helped by the mid-tempo of most of the songs making the repetition all the more obvious. There are certainly the standout tracks on this album, among them \"Mouth For War\", the brutal thrash assault of \"Fucking Hostile\", \"Rise\" and \"Hollow\", where the musical talents of Pantera's four members come together and remind you why they attracted the large crowds they did. \"This Love\" has a decent opening, though the song's transition from soft to aggressive feels more unfocused than progressive, and pales in comparison to \"Hollow\".\n\nThe saving grace of this album, as with any Pantera album, is Dimebag Darrell. He has an ability to write impressive, somewhat bluesy lead solos that contrast with the simple, rather dull riffs, and you get the sense that he played every note with a sense of passion few guitarists are capable of pouring into their playing. Phil Anselmo is passable as a vocalist, though I preferred his vocal performance in \"Cowboys from Hell\" to his hardcore shouts, and in \"Hollow\" and \"This Love\" he shows himself capable of clean singing still. I'm sure Rex and Vinnie were good at their instruments, but the truth is, they don't stand out much compared to Dime and Phil, and they are mostly just there to provide the rhythm. There are plenty of Pantera detractors out there who have compared this album to Exhorder's \"The Law\", and while there are certainly unmistakable musical similarities, both albums were released within the same year, so I doubt Pantera had much to rip off of them as some have claimed.\n\nAt times it may sound as if I hate this album, This is not the case, though I cannot stand \"Walk\". There are certainly good songs to be found in here, and Dimebag is at the height of his talents in the lead guitar department, but there was much more Pantera was capable of putting out at the time, had the temptation not been to try and out heavy every band while clinging to a \"tough-guy\" image. Me, I like enough songs on the album, just not enough to listen in one sitting without skipping here and there.\n\nMy rating:\n\nm/ m/ m/ out of m/ m/ m/ m/\n",
        "\nEverything that ruined metal is documented in this one album. This album paints a picture of AC/DC shirt wearing pickup truck drivers heading to the meth house after swigging too much malt liquor while watching a marathon of Maury and Dog the Bounty Hunter. It's this single piece of drunken bafoonery that sapped all the creativity out of metal by showing people that they too can make money by playing groove based rock with faux-aggressive vocals and throwing pot leaf designs on t-shirts. It is the prototype for Korn.\n\nLyrically, everything that's wrong about metal now is found here. Phil Anselmo in all his heroin addled wisdom thought that, instead of coming up with something interesting to talk about, the mundane themes about the \"tough street life\" would resonate more with the hip-hop culture of mainstream America and, unfortunately, he was right. This was one of the key elements that were needed to allow angry suburban youth and meth head trailer park dwellers to relate with the stupidity of Pantera. All of these things are best exemplified in the after school special-isms of Walk and the cheap emotional appeals of This Love and Hollow. The f-bomb abuse suggests not a lot of time was spent on them, and feels more like something the Wu-Tang Clan would have come up with. The change to a more \"urban\" appearance in promo pics suggest about as much. These lyrics would make bands in the future reduce themselves to writing about mundane topics (the hood, street life) and shouting a bunch of disdainful words that mean nothing. It's just vague anger to \"get people through a bad day\", like the hip-hop or radio rock songs of the day.\n\nThis is barely metal aside from some guitar playing techniques. Pantera is really just groove based rock in how the focus is placed on sparse 2 note rhythm riffs being played for a \"swaggering\" hip-hop derived feel that will allow suburban kids to \"get down with it\". It is an urbanized version of banging on rocks in a wasteland. By removing all the intellectual aspects out of metal and dumbing it all down to a series of chugga chugga noises and hillbilly solos, Pantera remove any melody that could be found in Prong's groove riffs, further lowering the role of the guitar into being a percussive instrument to allow for Anselmo's bird squawking noises (\"vocals\") to take the forefront. Contrary to Anselmo's \"I Hate Alternative Music\" shirt he would often sport at this time, the grunge-isms in the verse of lead single \"This Love\" suggest an attempt to also appeal to the whine rock scene of the day since it was the most marketable guitar oriented music they could dress up as metal at that time.\n\nWhen the home videos are more memorable for the jokes than the music, you know this band wasn't good. Unfortunately, jokes and some pot leaf design t-shirts were all it took to sell this \"cool\" album about \"real street topics\" to the impressionable morons of the day. The birthplace for Limp Bizkit rests in this album.\n",
        "\nMany people say Pantera \"sold out\" with this album. Sure, it's not as fun and technical as Cowboys From Hell, but calling them sellouts for putting out Vulgar Display of Power is a little far-fetched. Do we really think Pantera was trying to sell out by making face-melters like Mouth For War and Fucking Hostile? Rewind to 1991, when this album was being recorded. Metal was seemingly on its way out, crippled by the monster that was grunge. Pantera needed to try to do something different if they wanted any sort of reputation.\n\nBands should never be limited creatively by a record company, by a fan base or anyone else. Even the thought of a guitar virtuoso like Dimebag and a dedicated frontman like Phil letting a record company dictate exactly how the album sounded is laughable. Pantera came up with a new formula beginning with this album and rolled it out for the rest of their career. And it worked. This formula essentially revived metal, created a huge fan base for the band and kept the music true to its heavy roots.\n\nThis album is not supposed to be super-technical, progressive, complicated, or what have you. Look past that and you'll see that this album is, as another poster put it, \"good for what it is\". This is early groove metal from an American band, not some overly-technical European prog-death. If you can enjoy it for what it is, you'll see that this was a well-done, groundbreaking effort that contributed to helping metal stay afloat in the '90s.\n\nThe album is brutal, simply put. To me, it's just as brutal today as it was the first time I ever heard it, years and years ago. Dimebag's guitar tone on this album cuts into your consciousness and slams you against the wall. The riffing isn't anything prodigal, but it's solid, heavy, and unforgiving. Cleaner guitar parts appear here and there, most notably throughout \"This Love\" with a daunting, creepy, and well-used passage.\n\nThe lead guitar work is excellent as expected. Vinnie Paul's drums won't quite blow you away, but they provide a solid foundation for the aggression. Due to Dimebag's guitar tone, you can barely hear bassist Rex Brown through the album. Phil's relentless demeanor may not resonate well with some pickier metal fans, but he supports the balance of aggression quite well. Throw in a few clean vocals here and there and Phil belts out a solid performance.\n\nThe strong and weak points of the album are debatable. I could tell 100 people Walk and Fucking Hostile are a couple of the weaker tracks on the album - probably 55 would agree, 45 disagree. Regardless, I'm particularly moved by the opening aggression of Mouth For War, the high and low riffing of Live In A Hole, the southern-fried yet disturbing guitar work of By Demons Be Driven, and the tension and anxiety of This Love. While some songs are stronger than others, I don't believe there's one truly weak song on this album. Yes, Fucking Hostile could be the soundtrack of meatheads far and wide and A New Level is pretty generic and uninspired, but how can you call the relentless riffing and pounding pulse of these songs \"weak\"? \n\nThose whose metal tastes don't go far beyond flawless musicianship won't enjoy this album. This is where this album falls short of what the masterpiece that is Cowboys From Hell was. This is probably what pissed off so many fans of \"pure\" metal and led them to label Pantera \"sellouts\". But this album isn't all about the musicianship. It's about the disturbed ambiance it creates through face-melting riffs, impressive guitar solos, and pure aggression in the vocals and lyrics. \n\nAnd what this album and band did for metal as a whole, keeping the genre legitimate and respectable at a volatile time, is one of the most antiquated aspects of this album. Maybe Vulgar Display of Power did influence some shitty core bands who turn out crap nowadays, but that's not their fault, so enjoy this album for what it is. I'd advise you not to compare it to Cowboys From Hell because it does get dwarfed by that giant of an album. However, Vulgar Display is still rock-solid and is one of the more important metal albums of the early '90s.\n",
        "\nTo many, as I have observed, Far Beyond Driven is not a solid Pantera album. The criticisms I have heard are that the album is too far removed from the Cowboys from Hell/Vulgar Display of Power sound, or that it is not as consistent as The Great Sothern Trendkill or Reinventing the Steel. While each argument certainly has bearing, I feel that there is a certain necessity to Far Beyond Driven that bridges the gap between the two sounds. In fact, Far Beyond Driven is just that: a bridge album. Certainly, it deviates from the Cowboys from Hell sound, and it does not have the same power as The Great Sothern Trendkill, but in its own right, the sound of songs like \u201cBecoming,\u201d \u201cI\u2019m Broken,\u201d and \u201cFive Minutes Alone\u201d opens the door for that alteration from one well known and certainly appreciated sound to another.\n\nOne particular difference in sound is Phil Anselmo\u2019s scream vocals. The guy\u2019s singing on his first two albums with the band is amazing and added a level of force that helped establish Pantera as a powerhouse act. With Far Beyond Driven, he takes his vocals to the next level. This transformation is evident in the less consistent \u201cGood Friends and a Bottle of Pills.\u201d Now, this was my first Pantera album, and, admittedly, I did not care for Pantera or metal when I bought it. This was the album that changed all that. That being established, I pretty much skip over this song when it comes on. Its greatest value is in Anslemo\u2019s use of screeching vocals during the chorus. This is the first song that exemplifies this particular style for him, and he only develops it further with the following two albums and to much greater affect. Songs like \u201cThe Great Sothern Trendkill\u201d (title track from the album of the same name), and \u201cI\u2019ll Cast a Shadow\u201d (one of my personal favorites) display similar vocalizations in more structured and much more appreciated songs. \n\nAnother alteration the band makes through this album is Dimebag Darrel\u2019s guitar work. His speed riffs (known well by those who favor Cowboys from Hell) are traded in for a heavier, thrashier sound. Where once his riffs were the speed and clarity heard in \u201cDomination,\u201d they are now the heavy shrieking sound heard in \u201cBecoming,\u201d a song that is fitting for this transitional album and easily my favorite song both from this album and Pantera\u2019s overall catalogue. This banshee sound continues throughout the following albums, notably in Reinventing the Steel\u2019s \u201cGoddamn Electric\u201d and \u201cYou\u2019ve Got to Belong to It,\u201d while the heavy riffing is abound in almost all subsequent songs from Far Beyond Driven. In fact, Dime\u2019s heavy riffs are the one consistency found in Far Beyond Driven, which, while it gives it its strength, it is also the albums weakness.\n\nFar Beyond Driven is definitely Pantera\u2019s least consistent and weakest album, yet it remains a staple in their discography as it represents a change, a becoming from one great sound to another. Its value as an album is therefore important, and many of the songs on the album, most songs in my opinion, are excellent. Certainly, the two follow albums are much better for a myriad of reasons, but this album is, again, a bridge. It is not the finished product of the change. It IS the change.\n",
        "\nSo this is how it started out for the boys in Pantera, but I wouldn't call it a great start. First off, the sound quality is not that great, which it rather forgivable given that they were a small time glam band from Arlington, Texas and this is their debut. It's gritty and doesn't do the music any good. But I'm sure Jerry Abbott, father of band members Vinnie Paul and Darrell Abbott, did the best he could with what he had.\n\nThe album starts out strong and straight forward with Ride My Rocket and I'll be Alright, songs that bring bands like Diamond Head and the early stuff of Def Leppard to mind. As does other songs like Metal Magic and Widowmaker, which is a sound that kinda suits them. But mainly this album has an aura of glam and Kiss influences about it and I would say it's rather evident that this is not their strong suit. They do pull off some nice melodies and rythms here and there, like the verse in Latest Lover and the chorus in Biggest Part of Me, but the rest of their more glammy approaches comes off as generic and boring. Sadly, most of the album is glam and thereby mostly dissapointing.\n\nThe album also features one of the worst album covers I have ever seen, comparable in quality to the debut of Aerosmith. A ripped panther on two legs coming at you with a knife, I cannot fathom how Danny Leatherman or the band thought of this as a good design.\n\nA good thing about this is that even early on could you hear the brilliance of the brothers Abbott, Vinnie Paul's steady but playful drumming and Darrell's rather unique guitarchops. Rex Brown's bass playing is as allways flawless, even in these early days. And Terry Glaze, despite giving the weakest performance, does a fairly good job singing. But still, if I was an A&R guy I wouldn't sign them based on what I heard here. Funny where greatness can come from.\n",
        "\nThe Great Southern Trendkill is groovey, raw, in-your-face, varied and angry. It's metal done with a lot of style, filled to the brim with great riffs. Some of them are pure groove, highly reminiscent of Pantera's earlier career. Great drumming and interesting hooks make those really fun. However, most of the riffs have a certain rock vibe to them. Sometimes they sound like something Black Sabbath would have done, other times they may remind you of Kiss, combined with Pantera's characteristic raw groove. Drag the Waters and Hell's Wrath are both good examples. \n\nThen, there are some fast, extreme metal moments - Suicide Note Pt. 2 and the title track are both joyfully furious songs. All in all, most of the tracks are very catchy, bursting with energy. It's a great album to listen to when you're pissed off. Mind you, it's not mindless - the energy isn't the only thing that's good about it.\n\nIt's the rockish riffage that grants this album its cool factor. It's not very dark. It's not about Satan, dragons, dead lovers etc. It's straightforward, self-confident anger. It's probably as \"intelligent\" as metal gets. I'm not referring to the language used, but to the content and style. The Great Southern Trendkill's Phil Anselmo is too cool to be singing about cheap horror cliches. The mood corresponds to that.\n\nMy biggest complaint goes to the slower, psychedelic \"ballads\" - Floods, 10s and Suicide Note Pt. 1. They're pretty uninspired. There's a great Sabbathy riff and a very good solo, both found on Floods, but otherwise, these songs seem to go nowhere. They're not bad per se, they're just not very interesting. \n\nThe sound on this album is amazing. Dime's guitar is very ballsy. It feels sharp as knife when he's playing higher tones and very chuggy when he's playing heavier riffs. The same goes for Anselmo - he compliments his usual tough singing style with a lot of screams and shrieks. It's very varied, catchy and fun. Combined with great riffs, it makes one hell of a record.\n",
        "\nThe first four Pantera releases are so frequently either overlooked, unheard of, or completely maligned, that it becomes impossible to find anyone who is willing to give this a fair shot in today's metal community. So ridiculous is the idea that Pantera were once a traditional heavy metal band, that nobody gives this a chance to show its quality, and this is absolutely silly in my opinion. What we are treated to on the final of these albums, Power Metal, is a fun, enjoyable ride featuring thrilling guitar work and some great vocals. Also worth noting is that this album was made during a period in which it was not unheard of for rock musicians to cross dress, as bands such as the Motley Crue were doing at the time, and Pantera did not avoid this trend. The album cover has a very glam metal tone to it, but this is where Pantera were a little different from many of the more popular bands of the time, and the one thing holding them back from the success they would achieve on future releases.\n\nMusically, this album is one of Pantera's finest, featuring all of the members that would later go on to make Pantera famous, but boasting a completely different style. There are not quite as many pinch harmonics that Darrell would utilize so frequently on future albums, but are instead just straightforward riffs that make for one fun listen. This is an album that is simply an energetic band enjoying themselves, regardless of how unsuccessful they were throughout this period. However, this is clearly where the roots of their thrash metal sound of Cowboys From Hell is found, being considerably more aggressive and up-tempo from previous releases, in particular the title track, which is also one of the standout songs of the album. The guitar riff that gallops along is as exciting as can be, and Phil Anselmo shrieks his lungs out, providing a faux Bruce Dickinson style to the vocals that were as cheesy as could be, but still very good to just kick back and listen to.\n\nWe'll Meet Again and Death trap are plagued by cheesy lyrics, but are interesting enough songs to listen to, and provide a degree of variety to this otherwise one-dimensional album, showing that Pantera even then had numerous stylings. The ballad sound of songs such as This Love is found on a couple of songs, as is the groove nature that would be truly developed on Vulgar Display Of Power. However, on this album, neither of those ideas is fully formed, and are merely hints of what was to come, making this as historically significant as the album that would follow it was. Here we have a collection of strong songs that, whilst never threatening their own comfort zone, are great fun for the odd listen, and are criminally underrated.\n\nPower Metal is the beginning of Pantera's true stretch of good albums. What had come before was nothing special, and frequently undermined the band's ability, but this was all to change on this album. This is a great album, and the title track and Proud To Be Loud are definite must owns in any true metal heads collection. Definitely consider checking this out, as it will not disappoint.\n",
        "\nNow, I've been listening to Pantera for nearly 10 years, and I'm quite familiar with how this band has changed over the years, mainly because of Phil's almost unbelievable personality and almost fanatical egocentrism. This album is actually quite a good record, far better than what Slayer or Metallica have been doing in the twilight of their careers. However, it is far from what I expected after a solid release like Trendkill 4 years earlier. \n\nFirst of all, Dimebag Darrell is probably one of the greatest metal riffers in history, he isn't a virtuoso or mad artistic genius, but he can write heavy metal. On each of the preceding records, he always had a kickass riff here or there, in almost every song (even on Far Beyond Driven). However, there are a handful of songs on this already short album that actually have good riffs. \"Revolution is My Name\" is perhaps the only real 'Dimebag' song on this record, because it revolves around an unbelievably kickass riff and a well written solo. Its probably his best song, at least for me, but unfortunately, thats all there is to this album. There are a few catchy riffs here and there, but nothing quite like most Pantera fans would probably expect. Additionally, it is worth noting that besides the aforementioned song, there isn't a single decent solo on this record. I'm amazed at how Dimebag managed to forget about the solos, considering he's written some classic solos in the past. What ever happened to the guitar player who wrote \"Hollow\", \"Drag The Waters\", \"Cemetery Gates\", \"This Love\", \"10's\" and \"Floods\"? Disappeared: signature Dimebag is completely absent from here, which is the biggest letdown in the album. \n\nMy biggest problem with this record how is redundant, reductionist and flat out stupid some of the lyrics are. The lyrics to a songs like \"Uplift\", \"It Makes Them Disappear\", \"You've Got To Belong To It\" and \"Yesterday Don't Mean Shit\" sound like Phil Anselmo just ran out of brain cells and wrote a bunch of macho man lines to sound tough, it's drunken heavy metal on steroids - he used to be able to sing too, but on this record he grunts his way through several songs, an abomination really and one of the main reasons this record just doesn't resonate, the complete absence of any lyric with meaning. Again, a few songs are actually well sung, but besides that, its his worst performance on probably any heavy metal record. \n\nNow, the album gets a good rating because overall, \"I'll Cast A Shadow\", \"You've Got To Belong To It\", \"Revolution Is My Name\", \"Hellbound\", \"It Makes Them Disappear\", \"Death Rattle\", \"We'll Grind That Axe For a Long Time\" and even \"Goddamn Electric\" are great songs, while \"You've Got To Belong To It\" is somewhat decent, its nothing special. Besides that, this album really doesn't offer anything more than a couple of classics, a few decent heavy metal songs and a couple of fillers which serve no real purpose. Now, the songs are well written and heavy as can be, but the ingenuity of Dimebag and the actual singing of Phil Anselmo are just completely lacking here. \n\nHowever, I'm obliged to give props to Vinnie, he can produce quite well and is still a beast of a drummer. Unlike other big time heavy metal drummers, Vinnie is always trying to inject some groove and creativity into every song, and accomplishes quite convincingly. He's an unbelievably good drummer who's talent lies in how he's able to complement each and every song rather than just play along (ala Lars Ulrich), play fast (Dave Lombardo) or try to outshine the band. He's the one musician on this record who seems to still have his shit together and always throws in drum lines that go against 'conventional' heavy metal drumming. \n\nTo conclude, this is a heavy record, true to Pantera and true to heavy metal, parts of it are absolutely incredible, these guys can still write some of the heaviest music on the planet without descending into jibberish or obfuscated nonsense. Any heavy metal fan will enjoy this record, but as a Pantera fan, there are definitely things lacking here.\n",
        "\nAh, Pantera\u2026I remember when I was 17. I had all that teenage anger and stuff. You know, \u2018Fuck this math test, fuck being grounded, fuck popular kids.\u201d. Yeah, that was my Pantera period. Unfortunately, I was not qualified to remain a Pantera fan, as I wasn\u2019t muscular, fat, huge, bald, and didn\u2019t throw punches in the pit. Sorry, I\u2019m stereotyping. It\u2019s just that I sort of put Pantera fans up there with Slayer fans and Manowar fans as being awful people. And while I know realistically, and as with most groups of people, it\u2019s a few assholes that make a whole group of people potentially look bad, I still avoid any human being I may meet who is over 6 feet tall, sort of a mix between fat and muscular, and wearing a Pantera shirt with the sleeve cut off so I can see their armpits. I once heard someone refer to these people as \u2018bro-metal\u2019. And I think that\u2019s damn perfect. \n\nAs I grew and discovered new types of music, especially metal, my interest in Pantera sort of faded. I now consider their best album to be \u2018Power Metal\u2019, and really only throw on anything that\u2019s not \u2018Cowboys From Hell\u2019 on for nostalgia. Looking at you \u2018Vulgar Display of Power\u2019.\n\nWell, there is another exception. \u2018The Great Southern Trendkill\u2019 follows \u2018Far Beyond Driven\u2019, what I consider to be a pretty awful album for Pantera. And metal. But this was actually my first Pantera album. But I assure you, my praise isn\u2019t mindless nostalgia talking. This album has many things that many other Pantera albums lack. Riffs for one. Although not totally not out of the woods as far as \u201cI\u2019m going to chug on an open-E string for a few minutes while Phil yells\u201d shit Pantera likes to pull, the songs here feel more well-written in that it sounds like someone took a moment to write them. \n\nBarring a few songs, the lyrical themes here are more interesting than I\u2019m used to from Pantera (the concept of selling out is a good bit of it, questioning the motives of others, contemplating suicide\u2026and floods), and better than the ones of the previous few albums (being a hardass, beating the shit out of others, respect, walking on home).\n\nLet\u2019s start with the good. The title track gets shit going out of the gate with some intense screaming and a massive flood of noise assaulting your speakers like a Pantera fan assaults a black man. It\u2019s a faster paced, solid song and a good way to kick off the album, which continues to not fuck around, as it slaps you in the face with \u2018War Nerve\u2019 like a Pantera fan slaps a woman, as it exclaims with complete manliness \u201cFUCK THE WORLD, FOR ALL IT\u2019S WORTH!\u201d. Anselmo is even a gentleman and includes himself. Seriously though, I\u2019d say that the lyric \u201cYes, my cock is getting hard\u201d instantly puts this song up for worst lyrics on the album. And yet, the song still kicks your ass. Like a Pantera fan kicks your ass. \u2018Drag the Waters\u2019 actually starts sort of confusingly. It almost sounds like the last song didn\u2019t end and just went into one of those shitty \u2013core sounding breakdowns Pantera was busy pioneering. But no. It eventually becomes a song. Not the most impressive song on the album, but it works. Can I also get away with mentioning that this song has more cowbell? \u2018Suicide Note\u2019 is a two part song. The first part starts off quiet and dark, almost brooding, as Phil sings (might I add in a fantastic deep clean voice as opposed to his usual shouts, which I love) about doing cocaine and attempting suicide, much like a Pantera fan after finding out Dimebag Darrell died. Actually, aside from the \u2018scars on my wrists\u2019 part, it seems more like it\u2019s a song about drug addiction, possibly referring to it as a slow suicide, which may make sense considering Phil\u2019s heroin issues. Although maybe I\u2019m over analyzing, this IS Pantera after all. Then comes part two where Phil continues being an angry badass and shouts about how even though he\u2019s totally going to kill himself, suicide is dumb, so don\u2019t do it...except if someone is going to kill themselves, let them, 'cause no one needs your shitty advice.\n\nSo about now you should be tired of this onslaught of aggressive music, right? Well, pretend you are, because much like a Pantera fan\u2019s brain after looking at an algebra problem, Pantera slows things down a little. Aside from the first half of \u2018Suicide Note\u2019, the album features two slower songs. '10\u2019s' is a dark atmospheric tune, and although the band is more restrained, Phil\u2019s badass vocals still work very well. I\u2019ve always thought Dime\u2019s solos on the slower songs were more interesting than when he shreds. While maybe not his best work, this is a solid solo with a few memorable parts. Not that it won\u2019t be blown out of the water in about 15 minutes with \u2018Floods\u2019, which I understand is sometimes called a bad song with a great guitar solo, but I love this fucking song. The acoustic parts have great atmosphere and when the electric guitar comes in for the breakdown, it\u2019s actually a very cool contrast. Phil\u2019s voice works well and although I sometimes think the parts where the line repeats is corny, it doesn\u2019t bother me. And the solo. Has enough been said about it? It usually comes up in top 10 best metal guitar solos lists and anytime there\u2019s a conversation about best solos, it\u2019s sure to come up. Coupled with the very cool outro riff, this is some of Dime\u2019s best work. And being honest, when I was first made aware that it was one of the so-called best solos ever, I wasn\u2019t too sure how I felt about that. but I\u2019m totally okay with it at this point. No, this song overall may not top \u2018Cemetery Gates\u2019, but it\u2019s still absolutely phenomenal. \n\nThen there\u2019s the \u2018okay\u2019 stuff. \u201913 Steps to Nowhere\u2019 is one of those songs I never thought much of. It\u2019s not great. It\u2019s not shit. It\u2019s just kind of there. Like a Pantera fan in-between songs when Phil is ranting about black people and he has nothing to mosh to. In fact, \u2018Living Through Me (Hell\u2019s Wrath)\u2019 is the same story, except is somewhat better and with a catchy chorus, but is still just kind of there like a Pantera fan with no one to punch and yell at incoherently about respect, except is somewhat better and with a catchy chorus. \u2018The Underground in America\u2019 and \u2018Sandblasted Skin\u2019 end the albums as aggressively as it opened and may actually be the most aggressive songs on the album. They sort of fade into each other, one part being a little faster, but both being generally about fakeness and the trend following in the scene, sometimes almost horrifyingly mirroring the bro-metallers that are quite often their fans\u2026\u201cthe smart ones stay on the outside while drunken heads and arms erupt, centered man swings a punch, spits a tooth, postures odd, a punk rock escapade, five bucks a head to be king dick in the crowd.\u201d. \n\nThe album ends solidly, but at this point the aggression is a little stale for me. Still, these remain decent songs to headbang to. The album may not really leave behind anything more memorable than the opener and \u2018Floods\u2019, however an impressive aspect of this album is a clear lack of music I consider to be bad. While maybe not entirely mindblowing, the album stays consistent and even including Power Metal, this is the only Pantera album where I don\u2019t need the skip button.\n\nAll of that is perfectly fine as I don\u2019t ask Pantera for a lot. If I\u2019m listening to Pantera, I\u2019m either nostalgic or pissed, and not only is this nostalgic for me, but it\u2019s a good fucking angry album. Yeah, there\u2019s better angry music out there. Hell, this may not even be good as \u2018Cowboys From Hell\u2019, but it\u2019s fucking good, and in my opinion is better than \u2018Reign in Blood\u2019. Yeah. I said it. Come at me, bro. So while 85 may seem a little high, as far as groove metal and '90s Pantera go, it doesn\u2019t get a whole lot better than this.\n",
        "\nOh, Pantera. This album...I thought it was quite something when I was younger. But I've gone on to more mature tastes since then, and this album isn't the Holy Grail I once thought it was. However, it is far from devoid of enjoyment. Vulgar Display of Power is NOT an album to be scrutinized. A lot of people don't enjoy Vulgar Display, but perhaps they take it a bit too seriously. Anyway, let's observe this puzzling little phenomenon of a CD. \n\nVulgar Display starts out with a pretty great riff by Dimebag Darrell, one of my favorite metal guitarists of all time. Mouth For War is a good opener, and probably one of the LESS stupid tunes on Vulgar. However, something starts to go amiss on A New Level-for example, we hear the line \"...shit on, pissed on, fucked with\"...and you begin to wonder HOW seriously Pantera themselves took this CD. After the first chorus of Walk, you abandon all hope of seriousness. Finally, you take off your thinking cap and start to enjoy the album as it was meant to be-asinine fun. \n\nThe riffs throughout Vulgar are rock-solid. Dimebag always delivers the finest as always, even on the with the \"Duh-nuh-nuh-nuh....duh-nuh-nuh-nuh....duh-nuh-nuh-nuhWEEOWEEOW\" on Walk. It's silly and simple, but you'll probably remember it when the CD is over. Strangely, the album's outtake Piss had some of the more memorable guitar work. You could probably just buy Piss and listen to it 12 times and get a gist of Vulgar Display of Power. But I digress. Dimebag pulls the time-honored bait and switch riffs on us on several tracks-start with one riff, stick with it for 20some seconds, then change it just in time for the lyrics to kick in. \n\nOh god, the LYRICS. The whole album is permeated with a \"WE'LL PUNCH YOU IN YER FUCKIN' FACE\" spirit, and the effectiveness varies from \"not feeling it\" to \"hilariously failed\". In fact, the ONE TRACK that doesn't try to do this (This Love) is the most hilarious, because of how out of place it feels, and how fast it changes from the crooning, Layne Staley-esque self parody to the downright funniest chorus on the album-I won't spoil it, but it's classic in all the wrong ways. Plenty of cheese throughout the lyrics. \n\nThere are some ultimately notable tracks-This Love, obviously, and No Good (Attack the Radical). Now, what makes me bring up No Good is that it has one of the strangest, most out-of-place moments in what is already an awkward enough disc-Phil Anselmo's attempt at rapping. This is BARELY any better than James Hetfield on Some Kind of Monster, but I enjoy it much more because of the pure corniness of Phil's delivery. There is another one that I want to mention-Rise. Anselmo's vocals on this track are so bad you wonder at times if he's speaking or just singing WAY off key. A lot of people seem to like Hollow, but to me it's too much like This Love to really grab and hold me.\n\nUnless you are a morbidly obese 12 year old who feels like his parents don't \"understand\" him, you will feel no \"emotional\" connection to this album. The heaviness is there, but at times it's forced, like on the chorus to This Love. The riffing is the strongest point here, but really the deciding factor of the album is this: Did you like Primal Concrete Sledge on Cowboys From Hell? Enough to listen to it again 9 times with some awkward, poorly chosen \"ballads\" and *snort* a RAP song? If the answer to both of those questions is \"yes\", Vulgar Display is for you. If not, then just walk away, and wash your hands after touching it.\n",
        "\nHaving a new Pantera release with material that hasn't been released before is something that really excited me. Add to it that this song is a leftover from VDOP, one of Pantera's strongest efforts in my point of view, makes it all the more interesting. But if it hasn't originally been included on the LP, does that somehow indicate that it is weaker than the rest of the songs?\n\nThe song's strongest point is most definitely the guitar work (not unusual for Pantera). There are quite a lot of riffs here for an average 90's Pantera song, and they are even distinguishable from each other by style. The solo isn't really something worth talking about here, though, and after having listened to the song two times, I don't even remember a single part or melody of the lead section. On the other hand, right after the solo comes quite a groovy riff, and probably the most enjoyable part of the song.\n\nAfter the guitar, there isn't really much to say about this song, because it seems that the rest of the band just tries to stick with the tempo of Dime's riffs just for the sake of it and doesn't attempt to stand out any how. Phil's vocals are pretty average for his 90's style here, even a bit lazy at times. I would go as far as saying that some of the lazier vocal parts is the most annoying thing for me on this track. Vinnie is just absolutely sophomoric here and while listening to the song for a minute I forgot that they actually had a bass player. The quality of the lyrics matches that of the performance of the band excepting Dimebag.\n\nAll in all, Piss is a quite groovy at times, but not too catchy song. I greatly prefer this song over Use My Third Arm, which contains a riff from Piss and has been said to be a \"later\" version of it, but then again, Piss as a song by itself isn't a hit in my book. Does VDOP miss this song? I doubt that, because I feel that almost any song from that album is superior to Piss. However, if you're a Pantera fan (somewhat of a bigger fan than me I guess), you might easily like this song and it will probably give a good punch of 90's nostalgia in your face.\n",
        "\nThis album has been described and tagged in many ways, including groove, thrash, heavy, power-groove, thrash-groove, you name it. The problem with Pantera's post-80's output always was that it was quite difficult to put any of their work into one genre, because they've always included elements of different genres into their music, mostly groove and American heavy metal, sometimes thrash. THIS album is the one where they probably included the most elements into one record. It isn't their most experimental record (I'd give that title to The Great Southern Trendkill), but despite that it's still a one-of-a-kind LP that doesn't really compare to any other metal album that I have ever heard. And damn is it good!\n\nOne of the most standout moments in this album is Phil's vocal performance. You can hear a dose of Rob Halford worship in his falsettos, but at the same moment he isn't exactly trying to imitate anyone. When he's not delivering his amazing high's like in the outro of Cemetery Gates, he becomes a solid thrash vocalist in songs like The Art of Shredding and Domination, and other times he makes good use of more peaceful, yet atmospheric singing in the album's heavy ballads (Cemetery Gates and The Sleep). Overall, this albums is probably the best proof of the fact that Phil Anselmo (at one point) was one of the most powerful and unique vocalists in metal.\n\nThe other man to thank for making this album a masterpiece is the great Dimebag Darrell. Even though he has watered down his rhythm playing and isn't quite the same riff-machine like he was in the 80's, he still has created some of the most memorable and catchy riffs ever for this record. But where he truly reigns is his soloing, almost every song's lead section is completely genius. Each solo is packed with emotion and soul. You will probably get goose bumps more than once when listening to the solos on this album. Just because of the lead section, I can never get tired of songs like The Sleep, Domination, Cemetery Gates and Message in Blood.\n\nThe rest of the band keeps up with the former two as good as they are able to. Thanks to Pantera having a decent production for the first time in their career, we can now hear how interestingly Rex Brown swims beneath Dimebag's solos with his bass. He doesn't really have his own highlights on the album except for the beginning of The Art of Shredding, but at least his bass is perfectly audible. Vinnie Paul doesn't do as much fills as he did in the old times, but he has his moments none the less, notably his work with the bass drum.\n\nWhen you compare the songwriting with the 80's output, the one here is less straightforward and has more experimenting throughout. The songs in general aren't as speedy as some of the 80's work, but it doesn't make them any worse. The songs are groovy as hell, often catchy, and sometimes thrashy. There is more variety than in the 80's, due to the already above-mentioned influences from numerous genres, even in the songs themselves, take for example Domination. It starts out as one of the more thrashy songs in the album, but when the solo section comes in and later the outro, it takes a breakdown not very unlike what you can hear in modern metalcore. If you have heard some of Pantera's 80's work and some of their 90's work, but not this album, then surprisingly, it is still quite difficult to explain to you how this album sounds, because it doesn't really sound like anything they've done before or after it.\n\nI'm not going to take a quick review of each song on the album, but to make things easier, I will just point out the songs I didn't like on the album:\n\n-Primal Concrete Sledge: the song is actually half-decent, in a way. It's got a nice attitude, but it's just too short and somehow directionless. I think it's safe to say that it is even a filler song - it's like a hardcore punk song in a solid metal album. It just doesn't fit.\n\n-Psycho Holiday: I don't see the reason why this song was chosen to be made into a single, it is easily the most mediocre song on the album, not a single outstanding moment to be found, yet it is one of the most well known songs by the band. I can swear to God that the album would have been better if this song wasn't included in it.\n\nThere isn't much to say about the lyrical content here. The latter is quite average, with Cemetery Gates being perhaps the only song that hits you a bit stronger than an average metal song. But that may just be because of how well Phil delivers the song on the emotional side.\n\nThe production has vastly improved over the one we've heard in the 80's. The drums are loud and in a good way, the bass is perfectly audible, but the guitar is a bit muddy for some reason. This may lead to the rhythm guitar sounding a bit monotonous throughout the album.\n\nWhat can be said in the conclusion? Cowboys from Hell is truly one hell of an album! Whether you are into traditional heavy metal in the likes of Judas Priest or more aggressive thrash metal, whether you enjoy music for the breathtaking lead guitar work, or you're into pure groove, I would still recommend this album for you. I am pretty sure that anyone who simply appreciates metal, regardless of its form, will find something for him/herself in this kick-ass piece of groove.\n\nHighlights:\nCemetery Gates, The Sleep, The Art of Shredding, Message in Blood, Domination... damn, too many to name.\n",
        "\nIn the grand scheme of Pantera's albums with Anselmo, I'm torn between deciding which one is the weakest, Vulgar Display of Power, or this one. This one has cleaner production and heavier riffs, but lacks the depth and clean sections that managed to keep Vulgar loosely tied to Cowboys From Hell. But album comparisons aside, the tracks here come down to three standards: good, mediocre, and downright fucking awful. \n\nThe good: \"Strength Beyond Strength\", \"Becoming\", \"Slaughtered\", \"Use My Third Arm\", \"Throes of Rejection\", and the cover of \"Planet Caravan\". \"Strength Beyond Strength\" is a nice, brutal opener with a good deal of thrashiness to please even the most hardened Pantera critic. \"Becoming\" is all groove, but because of the cool addition of pitch pedal and relatively short song length it doesn't become another banal groove-fest like \"Walk\" or \"5 minutes alone\". \"Slaughtered\" is essentially modern metalcore minus the limp-wristed groove and gothenburg inspired hooks and melodies. \"Use My Third Arm\" is the most varied track, alternating between thrashy grooves, tremolo riffs, blast beats, and a fairly decent breakdown. I've always had a soft spot for \"Throes of Rejection\", probably because it's one of those few groove songs that is just balls-to-the-wall pure anger and hatred. Being a sucker for covers that stay true to the spirit of the original track, I can't complain about the Sabbath cover. \n\nThe mediocre: the radio hits \"5 minutes alone\" and \"I'm Broken\" and the ballad \"Shedding Skin\". All these tracks follow the same general principle of grooving over some decent riffs for about five to six minutes while Anselmo barks out a hybrid of Hetfield and Cobain. \n\nThe downright fucking awful tracks that ruin this album: \"Good Friends and a Bottle of Pills (my vote for Pantera's worst song)\", \"Hard Lines, Sunken Cheeks\", and \"25 years\". These tracks exemplify everything that was ever wrong with Pantera's music, and groove metal in general. \"Good Friends...\" tries to channel Mr. Bungle and Faith No More with the rage of eyehategod, but falls so short of any of those marks and sounds more like a pre-cursor to awful \"mathcore\" garbage like iwrestledabearonce. \"Hard Lines, Sunken Cheeks\" and \"25 years\" both take the cake for awfully long and uninteresting limp-wristed groove that tries to emulate eclectic doom metal like Type O Negative's debut, but comes out as a heavily watered down version of the black album.\n\nI fail to see why people think this is Pantera's finest hour, being half full of solid thrash/groove tracks and the rest being either the 90's equivalent of pop metal or absolutely awful attempts at experimenting with other genres. If \"Good Friends...\", \"25 years\", and \"Hard Lines...\" were all cut out, this would probably score a 65 or a 70 in my book. But either way, if you want Pantera in true form, go with Power Metal, Cowboys From Hell, and their sludge/groove masterpiece, The Great Southern Trendkill.\n",
        "\nOh, look at this, an outtake from Vulgar Display of Power. This surely spread like the smell of rancid shit, which is to be expected, as that's what it is. This is essentially a bunch off \"dun dun duh\" groove riffs with the breakdown from \"Use My Third Arm\" used as the verse with the standard Pantera production turned down about five notches.\n\nWhat do I really hate about this song? Well, beyond how it spread through word of mouth and the internet with people talking about how Pantera is still alive through their fan base and commercial legacy, it's the ass-faced lyrics that praise violence as a way to fix peoples character flaws. I can see why they left this out of VDoP as the level of ass-hattery exceeds critical levels. Where the majority of that album had well-meaning, but still knuckle-dragging positivity, this just reeks of \"Oh look at how I'm better than everyone else.\" The attitude present in this song is an apt description of all these mouth-breathing metalcore/deathcore/pop punk junkies I'm surrounded by, the majority of them being the living embodiment of unwarranted self-importance. You know those kids that think they're hot shit because they have a band, wear the latest fashion, and have every Emmure/Job for a Cowboy/Acacia Strain CD on their shelf and see themselves as the police of their local music scene? Yeah, those moronic fuck wads. But I digress, as this has very little relevance to the song. The hamfisted lyrics show why people have zero trust in metal culture as they're basically promoting beating the shit out of someone you don't like, simply for the sake of fixing their flaws or displaying some bullshit feeling of supremacy. Yeah, because violence is always the answer, no, it's the sign of how our species is still just a bunch of stupid monkeys. If you want to prove metalheads aren't a bunch of dumb, violent motherfuckers, try writing some intelligent social and political commentary and maybe throw in some humor as well.\n\nIf you want to hear Vulgar Display of Power condensed, watered down, and with retarded lyrics, give this a couple spins. If you want intelligent metal that has honesty and musical direction, look elsewhere, probably any '80s thrash outfit.\n",
        "\nWell this is an album with a rather unfortunate reception on this site. I was actually shocked to see the average score for this album being under 50% when I first checked out Pantera's page. What's actually so terrible about this album? Yes, it may not be a masterpiece, but it's still rather enjoyable. Why don't we look at it with a more fresh look? By saying that, let's not look on this album as a \"magnum opus for influencing mallcore\", but rather just an album by a metal band.\n\nWhen compared to previous records from Pantera, the first thing that has notably changed is the production. I personally have mixed feelings for the production here. For a heavy record, it's rather clear, but some things might have been done better, in particular, the guitar tone. It might be greatly influenced by the way Dimebag tuned it down, but when producing the album they seemed to have fucked it up even more. To describe it in a short way, it feels like every riff just sounds like every other riff on the album, because the guitar sound is so heavy in contrast to the drums and the bass that it's just too messy, and hearing the palm muted riffs with this kind of tone is one of the most undelightful things you may experience. Phil Anselmo's vocals seem to have been worked out in a similar way. The production wasn't really that good on CFH either, but at least on that album the drums were way louder and the bass was clearly audible. Here, it looks like the album was produced in favor of the band's two most significant figures to stand out from the other members.\n\nSo, what about the musicianship? Well, there isn't much to talk about the improvements from the previous record. In fact, there is none. Phil has dropped his Halford-inlfluenced vocals he used in the previous records and now just seems to imitate Kyle Thomas. While he is in my honest opinion rather better at what he's doing here than Thomas, I miss his falsetto-vocals from Cowboys a lot. Dimebag's lead work is still impressive, but the riffs have just been toned down dramatically. Yes, there is some groove in them, but there is something frustrating about hearing chugga-chugga riffs in the verse of almost every song, and every non-chugga riff sounds almost the same. Vinnie Paul can't help but to do his best what he can by fitting into the toned down songwriting on this album. Rex Brown still swims below Dime's leads as always, and doesn't have any standout bass lines to offer. It's a shame that Pantera have gone towards this kind of musical direction with VDOP, because while the music is enjoyable for the bigger part, you'd expect something more from them after releasing Power Metal and Cowboys from Hell. Judging by those albums you can be sure that they are competitive musicians, but here, they seemed to have jumped on the bandwagon of commercializing their sound, something that lots of bands who were great in the 80's did in the 90's.\n\nDespite the annoying production and weakened musicianship, the music on the album is actually mostly enjoyable and with an open mind you'll most likely be pleased with the album most of the time when putting it on a full spin. Though weak compared to what he was capable of, Anselmo's vocals have some sort of personality on this album, and it goes well with the album's groove-driven sound. Though on most songs the vocals are screamed/shouted, we can enjoy some of Anselmo's more clean singing on the album's two power ballads, \"This Love\" and \"Hollow\". I personally loved the vocals on the latter a lot, in my point of view, they gave an already nice ballad even more depth. There's A LOT of groove here, mainly thanks to Dimebag's riffs and Anselmo's accompanying moody shouts, and the lead work is top notch as always. Even though Dimebag likes to abuse them chugga riffs on this album a bit too much at times, there are several memorable riffs that you could recognize at any given point, like the legendary \"Walk\" riff, the main riff of \"Mouth for War\", the haunting main riff of \"This Love\" and some others. Despite being simplified in comparison to Dime's previous efforts, the riffs are still incredibly melodic and are definitely played with a soul. Vinnie Paul fits into the songs with his drumming nicely, as always, though like the rest of the band, he also sacrificed some of his talent for the musical direction the band took. In the 80's albums he used to play a lot faster and did many nice fills, now, almost all of that magic has been lost. A shame, considering that in the old times Vinnie was basically as talented on his instrument as his brother was on the guitar. A strong point on this album is the diversity of songs, we start out with a fairly mid tempo-ed track which changes it's attitude to a more thrashy one towards the end, followed by a similar song with tempo changes, then to a slower, heavily riff-driven hit song \"Walk\", followed by a more hardcore-punkish quickie \"Fucking Hostile\", then a lengthy power ballad, then again a more thrashy song and so on. Finally, the album closes with yet another power ballad, a rather more sad-toned one, and smartly does so, because those kind of songs always leave at least a decent impression after listening to the album on a full run. And yet, even that song changes it's attitude to a more aggressive one towards the end.\n\nAs far as the lyrical content goes, admittedly, there is a bit too much tough-guy bragging going on most of the songs, but there are some exceptions. \"Hollow\", similarly to \"Cemetery Gates\" from the previous album, deals with the death of a close friend or relative, \"This Love\" is about keeping a relationship with great struggle and \"Fucking Hostile\", just as it is musically, it is lyrically also similar to a hardcore song, expressing raw anger against society, in particular, the police. Lines like these:\n\nThe truth in right and wrong\nThe boundaries of the law\nYou seem to miss the point\nArresting for a joint?\nYou seem to wonder why\nHundreds of people die\nYou're writing tickets man\nMy mom got jumped -- they ran!\n\nshow that Pantera still have some lyrical depth left in them, despite what most people would think.\n\nSo, in the end, what do we have? Vulgar Display of Power, in short, is a good groove metal album with a stinky production. It may not blow you away, but it will leave a special place in your heart in one way or another. I am pretty sure that this album holds a special place in the hearts of all metalheads, whether that's a good thing or not. If you like groove, variety and nice lead work, this is an album you should listen to before you die.\n\n\nHighlights: Mouth for War, A New Level, Hollow\n",
        "\nBefore I start, I would like people who are about to read this review to drop all their prejudice of this album (assuming you haven't listened to it). Pantera's groove era work is not the pinnacle of their creativity, and just because this is a glam metal album written by an inconsistent band as Pantera is, this is actually some of the best glam metal you can possibly find, and I'll tell you why.\n\nFirst off, calling this album just a glam metal one isn't entirely correct - it's notably heavier than average glam metal, with some speedy moments thrown in, so maybe heavy/glam is the most accurate description of this record.\n\nWhat might be an issue with this record is its production - the rhythm guitar is too muddy and the drums sound a bit weird in the mix, the same goes for the vocals. The production isn't nearly as bad as the early Death/Mantas demos, but it doesn't fall into the category of \"good bad production\" that we can hear on some black metal either. It's something in between them. But it's not unbearable, and in fact, it doesn't cut down the enjoyment.\n\nNow for the music. This is where this album surprised me. Going by the tracks, I'll tell you straight off - Ride My Rocket, with an intro ripped off from Detroit Rock City by Kiss is probably the only weak track on the album. Going further, the next song, I'll Be Alright is one of the albums highlights with its awesome riffage. The album isn't very consistent, but nearly every song on the album has at least 1 or 2 memorable riffs and a few catchy moments that make them stand out. Songs are mostly medium-tempoed, akin to traditional heavy metal, though there are a few speedier ones (Ride My Rocket, Metal Magic, Rock Out). There is also a very fine power ballad thrown in (Biggest Part of Me), so the album doesn't miss variety either.\n\nFor a young band like they were back in the day when this album was released (for instance, Dimebag was only 17), the musicianship is rather fine. Dimebag is a complete riff-machine on this one, and does some decent leadwork as well, his older brother Vinnie isn't far behind with his drumming. Terry Glaze is objectively a pretty horrible vocalist, but he has his own depth that fits in the songs rather well. Rex doesn't have any standout moments to name, but overall, the band sounds great together.\n\nAs for the lyrics, well, yeah, there isn't much to say about them. In short, they are so bad that they're good.\n\nTo sum it up:\n\nPros:\n\n-Guitarwork - great riffs, quite catchy tunes and decent leadwork\n-Very good catchy moments, provided by the fitting drumming and Dimebag's outstanding riffage\n\nCons:\n\n-Production - muddy guitar sound and weird overall mixing\n-Cheesy vocals and lyrics\n\nHighlights:\n\nI'll Be Alright, Biggest Part of Me, Sad Lover\n",
        "\nA full 20 years after Pantera became a commercialized idol for every pissed off jock who wanted to beat the hell out of someone smaller than them, and 8 years since the death of the man who provided the six string foundation for one of the more redundant and lackluster sub-genres of metal, a lost song suddenly became found. My own bias in this eventuality notwithstanding, there is a level of curiosity regarding a song like this given both where and when it came from. Questions such as \u201cwhy did this song get dropped?\u201d and \u201cdoes it sound more like the album that came before it?\u201d naturally come into play, and even a person who hated Pantera\u2019s mid 90s output can give this a spin just to see what\u2019s going on, especially given a name like \u201cPiss\u201d.\n\nTo put it bluntly, the answers to these 2 questions are far from positive, as the reason why this song was ultimately dropped was not that it hearkened a little too closely to the brilliant niche that was \u201cCowboys From Hell\u201d, but rather because it\u2019s a watered down, dumbed down, bad version of what made \u201cVulgar Display Of Power\u201d a bad album. Amid the 4 hypnotic riffs that vary from low to mid tempo grooves with maybe an occasional turnaround is a song that is about as dry and boring as a 3 hour seminar about the mechanics of a curling iron. This is basically a slightly more complex version of \u201cWalk\u201d meets an utterly gutted version of \u201cPsycho Holiday\u201d with no real drive to it at all, just a slowed down version of primitive thrash and doom riffs with a near monotone shout thrown over top.\n\nSure, Dimebag plays a decent solo and the rhythm section doesn\u2019t skip a beat, but this song is so vapid and indistinctive that the sufficiency of all the parts at work is canceled out. But fear not, for the train wreck that is Phil Anselmo\u2019s new vocal style (which is basically a frat boy shout after too many shots and 3 packs of cigarettes) is here to save the day. Somewhere mixed into this rhythmic line of rasp and aimless rage is an implied melody, but for the life of me I can\u2019t find it, probably because of the outright idiocy of the lyrics. To make a long story short, this song is the anthem to the ego of every douche bag bully ever encountered in public school, right down to the thug\u2019s own sanctimonious sense of purpose in showing everybody what is what and how it\u2019s his own god decreed duty to take out the trash. Suffice to say, in reality this sort of person is more often the culprit in inspiring somebody to shoot up their school rather than actually doing something worthwhile.\n\nAs best as can be discerned, Vinnie Paul probably resurrected this piece of crap for some nostalgia dollars, in between butchering peoples\u2019 ears with his usual output with Hellyeah. While it\u2019s maybe a step up from what passes for groove metal out of the surviving Abbott brother, it\u2019s not much of one, and it\u2019s a sizable step down from what Pantera was even doing at their creative nadir. Top it all off, there is a music video going around that accurately reflects the pointlessness of the song, featuring a guy saying in a semi-tough manner at its onset \u201cI\u2019m going to die in the same town I was born in\u201d. My advice to everyone who thinks that this is some sort of ideal to live by is; aspire to more in your life, pick up a guitar and broaden your horizons beyond the rigid, banal orthodoxies established in the 90s, just be somebody for fuck\u2019s sake.\n",
        "\nWell, look what we have here. They did some digging around and found an old track leftover from the \"legendary\" Vulgar Display of Power. I can imagine that all of the Pantera fans are flocking to this like I flock to Red Robin when they're serving some new burger. Anyway, this track caught my attention when I saw the music video for it. I must say, I'm quite fond of seeing people get punched in the face. However, as interesting as the video is, it means nothing if the music behind it isn't up to snuff.\n\nAs soon as \"Piss\" begins, you realize that this is definitely a Pantera song. It has that almost nostalgic guitar tone that you can recognize from a mile away. It starts out with a mildly thrashy riff that at least halfway made me interested. Then it kinda goes on and ends up boringly meandering along in a slow-paced groove. The verse riff really doesn't do much for the song. The whole time I'm thinking that it felt like more of an afterthought. Overall, there's really only 3 or 4 actual riffs in the song, and the verse riff seems to waste a lot of time. However, as expected, Dime's solo is fantastic. The solo is probably the saving grace of the song that made me bother to listen to it more than once.\n\nClearly, the guitar work seems to be the only important thing in this song. Almost as if he stopped trying after a fantastic performance on Cowboys From Hell, Phil Anselmo just half shouts angry stuff over the whole song. The vocal performance really \"piss\"ed me off. The lyrics aren't really nothig to be desired either. They range from buttheaded to just plain stupid. Another unfortunate thing, none of the other instruments stood out other than the guitar. It's as if Phil and Dime are the only ones they care about, and Dime is clearly more important than Anselmo. This really is a guitar driven song.\n\nThough, if you liked Vulgar Display of Power or are one of those people who worship everything Pantera has recorded after Power Metal, you'll probably like this song. For me, I'd say that \"Piss\" is decent at best. There's better Pantera tracks out there, but this one is fresh for everyone. You might as well get SOME enjoyment out of it while you can.\n",
        "\nPantera's \"Vulgar Display Of Power\" is one of the most controversial releases in the whole metal genre and recently got some fresh popularity with the release of the track \"Piss\" that didn't make it on the original album and was released twenty years later as a single years after the band split up. This is an occasion to take a look on this famous record again as there will be a new edition coming out quite soon.\n\nThis album has nothing to do with the band's early glam rock music or the thrash metal genre and is a rather straight record with some hardcore and groove metal influences. The guitar riffs go in your face but sound one dimensional and the same patterns always come back and lack of surprises. The bass guitar sound is rather inoffensive but has a few good moments on this release at least. The drumming is fast and technically accurate but the sound is not professional at all and sometimes it feels as if you were listening to the table tennis finals in China or a broken drum computer instead of an actually gifted drummer that plays on a real kit. The vocals are aggressive and dominated by angry shouts that bring the offensive lyrics to life but they lack of any other emotion than this. The final result sounds like a mixture of groove metal tracks, hardcore bashing passages and some grunge worship in a few calmer moments. The lyrics are simple and seem to be written by a bunch of angry kids that get mad about anything and felt like using as many swear words as they could find. The most redundant example might be the infamous \"Fucking Hostile\" as you might have guessed from its title.\n\nA couple of tracks from this record rose to fame, for example \"Walk\". The track is still played in any hard rock discotheque or in a track list of any metal festival in the whole wide world during the shows of the different bands. The lyrics are very one dimensional and childish, the riff is boring and the track lacks of surprises. I don't get warm with this groove track at all but must admit that it has a catchy flow and won't easily get out of your mind once you've heard it. It's the same thing for the shallow ballad \"Hollow\" that sounds rather like a grunge track than a metal anthem but even this failed epilogue has something addicting somehow and I must give the band some credit for get a maximum of success with a minimum of ideas.\n\nThe only track I truly appreciate on this record is \"This Love\". The sudden changes between calm and psychedelic passages and the angry chorus is predictable but effective and the contrast works very well while the other tracks only focus on the aggressive or the psychedelic side. This kind of music has a certain kind of vision and is a hint at the sound of modern alternative rock music around bands such as System Of A Down who would later base their sound on these kinds of contrasts. My second favourite track is indeed the new bonus song \"Piss\" that has some minimalistic but effective changes of style between slow groove passages, faster parts dominated by a catchy and melodic riff and a change of drum patterns even though the sound of these drums is still a disaster and hasn't been changed in twenty years. Even the bass guitar is audible and the middle part adds another dose of energy to this catchy song that should have made it on the regular record without a doubt. Anybody who likes the original record will adore this new tracks as even those like me who didn't appreciate the original album much are able to recognize the hit potential of this solid effort. Apart from these two songs plus the shallow but catchy \"Walk\" and \"Hollow\", the record is though not quite spectacular and also fails to grow.\n\nIn the end, we have a quite consistent record that has a coherent flow with some catchy and emotional moments. On the other side, the music has been adapted to the trends of its time and remains a superficial mixture of hardcore, groove metal and grunge with some worn out thrash riffs. Anyway, people may still discuss about this album in the next twenty years to come and that's why it has such a special status that not many other records have. This controversial energy is what makes this album so strong and this is what it's all about. From a subjective point of view, I might only give a forty percent rating but from a more objective point of view, this unforgettable record is easily worth eighty percent and I decided to choose the middle path of neutrality. Try this record out at your own risk but you should at least listen to this once to get an idea of what everybody's always talking about and what made Pantera so famous along side the record \"Cowboys from Hell\" that you might also check out while the rest of the band's discography is more or less forgettable.\n",
        "\n'Metal Magic' and 'Projects' have never done much for me. In fact, when it comes to Pantera, I only really LOVE this album, Power Metal, Cowboys..., and selected songs from all the others. This, in my opinion, is where Pantera \"became\". \n\nUnlike the previous albums, this album has a more rocking sound and doesn't focus on cheesy glam ballads. Songs such as \"Hot and Heavy\" have a sound that is, yes, glam because of the ultra-cheesy lyrics, but so rocking and catchy you must listen to it over and over. Other songs like \"Valhalla\" are the same. The ballad, \"Forever Tonight\", is one of my favourite Pantera songs, mainly because its so awesome. \n\nHowever, the bad news is the production. Dime's tone is, as usual, awesome, but as for Vinnie and Terry...well that's different. Vinnie's toms are the cheesy electric '80s toms you would hear in songs by Rick Astley, and Terry's voice sounds weak at some points. Dime's solo in \"DGTTM\" is an amazing solo, but is rendered FUBAR by the unnecessary and silly sound effects in the background.\n\nDon't let the horrible toms in the intro of \"Hot and Heavy\" put you off, because this album is where Pantera got really good, the first GREAT album imo, and needs a listen from everyone that calls themselves a metal fan.\n\nHighlights:\nHot and Heavy\nForever Tonight\nI Am the Night\n",
        "\nThis is the most honest and hard-emotional album Pantera has ever made, and by hard-emotions I mean that Max Cavalera feeling from the \"Arise\" album. It's straight on hard, heavy and and ear-popping with some brilliantly pulled off mood changes through out the songs. From \"Strength Beyond Strength\" song till \"Planet Caravan\" cover It makes you want to break all hell to the world and rub shit in some politicians face or some asshole that stepped on your nerve.\n\nSo riffage is the most responsible agent for this explosion of bad-assness, with some pretty much mind bending solos that rip your brain cells like heroin does to a junkie. The riffs are pretty much simple at some points, and I read in some review that, I quote \"anyone could have thought off this shit\". OK, AC/DC's riffs are all pretty much simple and basic, and yet many people, including me, appreciate them and their work, and If you don't you're a fucking retarded. Another example is Burzum, which is one of my top 10 favorite bands. If that isn't simple music I don't know what is, and still it's considered one of the best metal bands (one-man-bands) of all time. But let's get back to the riffage on this album. Like i said, they're simple at some points, though many of the guitar techniques redeem the simplicity and fit in perfectly, thus making the guitar sound like a true Texas chainsaw. And that's called riffage ingenuity of one Dimebag Darrell , creating something simple, yet not so simple for others to cover it properly, and yet so impressionable on the hearing part. So riffage get's pure 20% for genuine awesomness.\n\nAbout the vocals on this album I could talk for days, but I'll try to keep it simple. Though I really do like Phil's vocal style, they're pretty much not so \"great\" on this particular album due to his drug addiction. But still he managed to fit in perfectly with the guitar sound and the whole \"I'm fed up with this shit\" idea. He ranges sometimes from NYC style punk shouts to some high pitch vocal fry, or from that same punk style mixed with growl shouts to a pinch of the southern \"heat\" dirty singing, which makes the whole vocal thing much more interesting to listen to. Now many people don't like this, but really, it's metal, it's not supposed to be \"beautiful\", he's not supposed to sound like a fucking princess Peach from Super Mario or Kirby(I INTENTIONALLY INSULT POWER METAL, even though I do like some bands of that genre). So vocals get 20% for being just what they're supposed to be, crude, rude and loud.\n\nAs far as lyrics go, they're pretty much OK, and standard Pantera. They're not idiotic, they're not poetic either, but a quite good mixture of surrealism, sarcasm at some points, and straight-forward punk \"fuck you, you're shit\" stuff. The lyrics basically, just have a good straight point, they're not mindless at all, and they really depict quite well the \"personal struggles\" theme. So lyrics get 15% for keeping up that consistent hateful, strong message for the 3rd album now.\n\nBass and drumming are quite complementary, filling the hole of the second guitar deficiency. Drumming is an excellent thick rhythm monster, filled with bass line's bass bombing thus making it all sound like a one individual instrument, instead of 2. Vinnie really does his job well, keeping the whole band in rhythm shape, and Rex pulls his real hard wrapping it all out in one single moshable bomb. So drumming gets 20% for being a fucking machinery, and bass line gets 15% for being one hell of a bass-bomb.\n\nSo final thought is this: This album is most certainly much hated, but it shouldn't be, and I don't know why groove genre is so generally hated. Yes it has some idiotic bands, and some ups and downs, but so do other genres. Personally this is my 3rd favorite metal genre, with thrash being No. 1 and death metal on the second place, and I don't find anything critically bad in it(like in some other groove band's work), and I didn't start with metal just yesterday. So all in all this album Is worth it's praise, It's definitely worth listening to, and even more if you like any bit of hardcore punk, either NYC style or other, mixed with some blues based thrashy death riffage and good moshable-headbangable atmosphere.\n",
        "\nWith all of the bands that had their \"underground\" start in the 1980s and soon rose to fame in the '90s, the story of Texas-based band Pantera (who am I kidding, you all probably know who Pantera is) is the strangest beginning story of all time. Pantera was not always the flame throwing metal rompers that they are known for. In fact this album, \"Projects From The Jungle\", sounds very Def Leppard-influenced. The production is a HUGE step up from their less-than-mediocre debut, and this album at times does suffer from the fabled \"sophomore jinx\" that many bands happen to suffer. There are a few bumps in the road. For starters, it could begin with the second track, \"Out For Blood\". The song seems like a speed metal song (the positive) with cheesy, half-assed lyrics (the negative). There is the album closer, \"Takin' My Life\", which features a cheesy outdated-sounding synthesizer that overpowers the guitars at times. \n\nBut with the negatives there are good things about the album. For one, the production is really good on this album. \"Metal Magic\", Pantera's debut, sounded as thin as a dime (no pun intended). The drums were pushed back in the mix along with the guitars and the bass and vocals (awful, awful vocals) were at the forefront of the mix. On PFTJ, the mix is equaled out and Darrell's talent really shines through. Just listen to the amazing solo on album opener \"All Over Tonight\" (the song itself sounds like a really good, High And Dry-era Def Leppard clone) and it will surely give you a picture of the future in, say, about 6 years. The solo instrumental \"Blue Light Turning Red\" is a showcase of a 19 or so year old Darrell and while short, it is surely enough to blow minds and raise a couple of eyebrows. \"Like Fire\" has a very Def Leppard-ish riff and is pretty good considering that this is only the band's second album. \n\nWith that last piece of the final sentence of that paragraph, it must be taken into mind that this was only the band's second record, and it's not all there yet. The band got a much deserved lead vocalist change a couple years later and I say, if this was recorded with Mr. Anselmo, it would be a whole different monster to tackle. Another mention on this topic is the cover art (more like cave scrawling). The artwork on the first three Pantera albums were awful. They looked as if they were drawn by a 3 year old kid who entered an art contest at his/her pre-school back in '84. Yeah, it's that bad. But do not let the horrendous cover art fool you as there are some diamonds in the rough on this album, such as \"All Over Tonight\", \"Like Fire\", and \"Killers\". Not recommended for the Pantera die-hard.\n",
        "\nNow almost everyone knows of Pantera as the bullet-spitting groove metal act that ruled the metal realm of the over-decadent 1990's. Little do most know is that the amazing brothers Dimebag Darrell (then known as Diamond Darrell) and Vinnie Paul as well as bassist Rex Brown had a lead singer that was NOT the great Phillip Anselmo, but a glam-influenced one that went by the stage alias T. Lee, as well as 1990\u2019s Cowboy\u2019s From Hell was NOT their first album, but what we\u2019ve got here is the REAL Pantera debut that was released in 1983, preceding CFH by almost 10 years, but not quite on the dot. Early Pantera material is very reminiscent to that of Def Leppard and Motley Crue, if the two got together in the bed and made some horrible glam hybrid with elements of KISS and others. \u201cMetal Magic\u201d is the true debut by the Texas powerhouse, and I must say it sounds like early Sunset Strip glam metal. To tell you the truth, it was not up to what I hoped it would be. I have read bad review after another and I must say that everyone is justified in my book when they say that this sucks.\n\nThe lyrical content on this album is mainly fairly juvenile and undeveloped. Songs like the self- explanatory \u201cRide My Rocket\u201d and \u201cTell Me If You Want It\u201d are as bad as Pantera gets. The songs are mainly awful. The album would be a whole lot more bearable if Dime had developed his trademark guitar acrobatics as showcased in the so called \u201ccommercial years\u201d of Pantera. There are (somewhat) worthwhile songs such as the sort of mediocre \u201cWidow Maker\u201d and\u2026maybe the title track. The riff is okay, but the vocals and the lyrics suck. The album\u2019s production is very cold and lacking. The drums sound way too high in the mix, but they do not have enough bass to push through vocalist Terry Lee\u2019s high pitched Vince Neil/Joe Elliot crossover. The bass is always at front of the mix. I was scrolling through eBay one day and someone was actually pleading the viewers to take this album off of their hands. Yes, it is that bad. \n\nWould I blame anyone in the right frame of mind for wanting to erase this mess from their collections? No, I would not! That is just how terrible the album is. As much as I hate this album, I still give it points because I love Dime. If you are one of those diehards that must have everything made by a band, then by all means buy it, but you will soon find out that it is more filler than killer, making it a permanent space filler in your collection, as it did mine.\n",
        "\nToday, February 21, 2012, is the 20th anniversary of one of the most divisive albums in metal history: Pantera's Vulgar Display of Power. On the one hand, it's almost universally acclaimed as the band's greatest work, and one of the most influential albums in metal history. Outside the core metal audience, that is. You can predict with near-certainty that any casual metalhead over 25 has a copy in his collection. But the more outspoken, critically-minded metalheads hate it with near-unanimity. Metalheads on the whole are pretty well divided.\n\nMuch of the hatred toward the album is based on what it's not, rather than what it is. The band's prior record, Cowboys from Hell, is reasonably well-loved among metalheads. It's a good example of thrash, with hints of the band moving toward groove metal. But Vulgar is clearly not a thrash metal album. Yet, you'll see many reviews call it a terrible thrash album. That's like ripping on a pickup truck because it doesn't get gas mileage like a compact. It doesn't make any sense.\n\nPerhaps more prevalent is the hatred directed at Vulgar precisely because of its influence. The stripped-down, simplified, slowed-down approach hasn't been seen as bringing Sabbath back into metal (which would be a perfectly legitimate opinion) but instead as ushering in nu metal, and the bad groove metal of the late 90's. The vocal style and mosh-readiness of the music is blamed for the tough-guy posturing of metalcore bands like Hatebreed or hard rock bands like Drowning Pool. But plenty of great albums have led to terrible imitators. It doesn't make any sense to tear down Thergothon just because there are bad funeral doom bands out there.\n\nTaken on its own terms, Vulgar Display of Power is an adrenaline rush that will pump up your blood like few others. Even the ballads, \"Hollow\" and \"This Love\", have crushingly heavy and aggressive parts. Yes, I said crushingly heavy, because at the time this was one of the heaviest records ever released. The songs are infectious, too. Who doesn't at least occasionally want to sing along to the \"Don't fuck with this\" in \"Regular People (Conceit)\"? And how could you not get into \"By Demons Be Driven\", which has what is easily one of the greatest choruses in metal history?\n\nIt's deceptively simple, like Sabbath. But each and every song on it is loaded with dynamism. Riffs change often, and with little warning. Tempos and moods range from headbanging thrash to depressing ballad to mosh-ready hardcore, often within the same song. The questionably-legendary Dimebag Darrell also imbued each song with his own touches, the pinch harmonics, squeals, and some great solos.\n\nDynamism and great songwriting are what set it apart from its many imitators. But Vulgar isn't perfect, by any means. \"Walk\" has a silly riff, and for the life of me I can never figure out why people cite it as a highlight. \"No Good (Attack the Radical)\" isn't great, either. But the great stuff here is really, really great.\n\nSo, it's not what people expected. That's how you make your mark. Well, Pantera made their mark, and it will be remembered for a long time.\n\nThe Verdict: Twenty years later, Vulgar Display of Power still holds up well. It's one of the most influential metal albums of all time, with some of their followers good, but most of them bad. But most importantly, it's got plenty of adrenaline-pumping shout-along anthems for those moments when you need it.\n\n(originally written for http://fullmetalattorney.blogspot.com/)\n",
        "\nAh, Pantera, a source for controversy, mainly from the media's accusations of Anselmo being a racist. Now I don't see how any of Pantera's lyrics could be interpreted as racist. If anything, most them have to do with being a macho tough guy, drug addiction, and other whiny, pretentious dribble. Let's face it, most of the lyrics on VDoP and FBD sucked ass, as did the overall structure of said albums. But this album is different, the band gets real, lyrically and musically. They ditch the billy badass lyricism and groove wankery for properly structured heavy metal and lyrics that talk about the real world. Another thing, this album probably has the clearest and heaviest production of any Pantera album. \n\nNow onto the music itself. Overall, the album has only two songs that feel like filler, 10's and Living Through Me (Hell's Wrath). On its own, 10's is a decent track, a bleak, bluesy atmosphere and a really good solo, but in the context of the album it stops everything and just blurs by leaving the listener confused as to what he just heard. Hell's wrath is the perfect example of what filler is, a few decent riffs dragged out longer than they should be. I think the album would been greatly improved if 10's was removed and Hell's Wrath was cut short.\n\nNow for the good stuff. My hands down favorite tracks are the noisy and immensely brutal title track and Suicide Note Pt. 2. Loaded with the speed of Power Metal and Cowboys and with the fury of the faster tracks from Vulgar and FBD, they just bombard the listener with blast beats and crunchy grooves. Phil and Seth assault the microphone with shrieks, yells, and what feel like proto-metalcore growls. One thing that does stick out about Phil's voice on this album is that it seems to be layered, but not so layered that it turns to mud. I'd say the layering adds a nice touch, and makes his voice sound better than the two previous releases. \n\nFloods is a dark and sinister ballad about the apocalypse. It drones out for several minutes over a simple, yet effective chord progression. The solo is fucking fantastic. Phil's vocals are all over the place, with tons of layers and effects. Suicide Note Pt. 1 is an equally bleak acoustic ballad about mental illness and drug addiction. \n\nWar Nerve, Drag the Waters, and The Underground in America are all standard groove metal tracks, but have enough variety and intensity to keep the listener interested. They show how Pantera evolved musically from the two previous records. Compare these songs to the really popular tracks from VDoP and FBD (Walk, 5 Minutes Alone, and I'm Broken) and note how they aren't stale and boring as fuck. War Nerve and Drag the Waters still center themselves around basic chromatic and pentatonic riffs, but they just have that 'X' factor that makes them much come off as more savage alternatives to the majority of what's present on Vulgar and FBD. \n\nFor those that utterly despised VDoP and FBD, tread lightly with this album. If you're like me and are indifferent to those albums, dive in head first, you're in for a rare groove metal treat. Some could attribute the change to Phil's time in Down, but seeing as how he recorded the vocals in Louisiana while Rex, Dime, and Vinnie recorded in Texas, it just doesn't work out geographically.\n",
        "\nAnd I've never even listened to any of their other albums! Yeah, I know that sounds callous and dooshy of me, but what can is say, I've judged for myself. Trapped in between a trio of lame glam albums and their catalog of boring groove rockers, this unique beast in Pantera's discography is pure, cool as fuck heavy metal with elements of glam, speed and even thrash. I can say for that, that it is certainly Pantera's best, most straightforward album.\n\nAll the classic line-up is here and accounted for. Vinnie Paul pounds it out on the drums; he has some pretty damn fast moments here and keeps the beat steady; gotta love his faster work on \"Over And Out\". Rex Brown is up and running on bass; very crunchy, catchy and he lets loose a number of great riffs. The late, great, legendary Dimebag Darrell (credited here as Diamond Darrell) shows how awesome he really is; he's one mother of a shredder. He can go fast, faster, slow, heavy, thrashy; man was a god. Replacing the annoying Terry Glaze on vocals was then new guy Phil Anselmo. His voice is great; he's very flexible. Occasionally he belts out some growls similar to his future groove days, but mostly he sticks to great, melodic, Halford-esque wails. The best lineup has been created.\n\nThe songs are great. There's a few little snags, but even they're tolerable. \"Hard Ride\" and \"We'll Meet Again\" are probably the most glam-oriented cuts on here, and even they're not too bad. \"Hard Ride\" is at least a bit heavy, and \"We'll Meet Again\" is slow, melodic and inoffensive, but both are just a bit forgettable. Everything else though...WOAH! Speed, traditional, and thrash elements all across the board! Opener \"Rock The World\", while a tad cheesy, is catchy as all get out, with a great riff and a toe-tapping groove to it. The title track is ever better with it's amped up speed and another good riff. Fellow speeders \"Proud To Be Loud\" and the near-thrasher \"Death Trap\" come atcha at 150 MPH with some wicked Dimebag shredding and crazy vocals from Anselmo, going from wails to shrieks at some points. Particularly worth of note is \"Over And Out\". While still a trad metal song overall, it's very, VERY thrashy. Anselmo's vox are aggressive, everyone chips in with gang vocals, the solos are blazing and frantic (particularly the vicious last few seconds), and the cool chorus is urgent and memorable.\n\nOverall, aside from two, maybe three so-so songs, this sucker is definitely worth a look. Anselmo is a worthwhile vocalist, and the speed/thrash/traditional metal mash-ups make for a fun, awesome listen.\n",
        "\nThere are a handful of bands out there in the metal world that are particularly divisive; people tend to either love them or hate them. Pantera is one of those bands. What exactly causes a band to gain such a rabid following and a merciless wake of naysayers? In Pantera's case, it was the attitude of the band members and the music they created, and the subsequent influence they would have on heavy metal music. \n\nVulgar Display is all about attitude. If you wanted to break down what the message and feel of it are at the roots, it's about saying \"fuck you\" and punching someone you hate in the face. To make it perfectly clear, this is depicted on the album's front cover. Really, the cover is perhaps the most simplistic way to sum up the album's contents. Vulgar Display is the soundtrack to punching someone in the face. But is that a good thing or a bad thing? Really, it's all about your tastes. I, for one, think the cover is hilarious and love how it's so forthright about what is to be found on the disc contained inside. \n\nThe music varies widely in tempo and composition. There are a few passages that are clearly meant to be slower and atmospheric. Much of the rest of the album is absolutely blistering. The shift in Pantera's sound from their previous effort Cowboys from Hell is apparent from the very beginning. Cowboys was an eclectic but nonetheless catchy and overall heavy album. Vulgar Display takes the sound from Cowboys and cuts out the remaining traces of glam influence, replacing them with ferocity. Many years after first hearing this album and perhaps one hundred times listening to it since then, there is one word that still sticks with me to describe it: fierce.\n\nIn total seriousness, this album is ferocious. The anger and frustration is absolutely palpable. Phil's vocals are very memorable, whether you like them or not. They're mostly shouted, as they would be on a thrash record, but they have a much stronger delivery than one would expect from a thrash group and they border on screams. That's not to mention the several times that Phil actually does scream, all of which are executed quite well. The vocals are the source of much of the album's attitude, and in that vein they are a tremendous success. Dimebag's guitar work is thunderous and unrelenting throughout, but he never gives up his characteristic twang - perhaps the most obviously southern influence apparent in Pantera's music. In the rhythm section, the bass and drums really hold the album together. There's nothing exceptional going on there, but the execution is nearly flawless. The production for the drums is probably my favorite out of all the instrumentation. It's very sharp, but in no way overshadows the rest of the group.\n\nAs for the songs themselves, they deal largely with issues of frustration, anger, and hate, which certainly seems appropriate given how blunt the album's cover is. The opening track, Mouth for War, is simply remarkable. Pantera wastes no time in getting directly to the point, within seconds of the album's start laying down the framework for what would become groove metal. The performance is sharp and strong, and the energy of it all is empowering. In particular, roughly the last fifty seconds of the song are absolutely pounding and drive with tremendous force. It closes with a bang, and one of my favorite riffs ever.\n\nA New Level is also fantastic, featuring a simple but effective main riff and generally outstanding guitar work. Dimebag puts on a great show of technical work and a great solo, as he is well-known for. No Good (Attack the Radical), Live in a Hole, and Regular People (Conceit) are also excellent exhibitions of Dimebag's abilities. Live in a Hole, in particular, is one of the most memorable songs from the album because of how bizarre and non-conventional it is. Regular People has a superb into section that I've found myself wanting to listen to again and again for years now. Furthermore, the lyrics are catchy and hilarious, featuring Phil seriously insulting the integrity of some unspecified nemesis, informing him that he doesn't have the balls and that his head is up his ass. It may be considered immature, but maturity is not the point of this music.\n\nOn the slower side, the album features two \"ballads\": This Love, in the middle of the album, and Hollow as the closing track. Both of them have sections of more atmospheric and aesthetic work, along with passages of clean vocals, which contrasts with the rest of the album. This Love is notable for the contrasting vocal sections and more so for the breakdown. It's perhaps the most simple breakdown ever recorded, but it's heavy as hell and incredibly effective. Hollow is worthy of discussion because it's easily the most serious and mature song to be found here, the lyrical subject matter dealing with an emotionally shattered and distanced friend. Once more, an outstanding vocal performance from Phil can be found here, but what I remember the most is how fierce the song's latter half sounds. It's unpleasant to the ear in the most strangely satisfying way, and the fade out at the end is almost what I would describe as eerie. It really sticks with me.\n\nFucking Hostile, along with Rise, are the song's most unrelenting and heavy tracks. The delivery is ferocious for both of them. The only reason the album loses any points from me is that those two tracks, along with the overrated Walk and the odd By Demons be Driven can get somewhat tiresome. Outside of that, though, I really don't feel that the album has any flaws. Good, bad, or indifferent, it has had immense influence on the development of heavy metal in the past twenty years, and that cannot be denied. Don't hate it for what it spawned - love it for what it is.\n",
        "\nIn my opinion, the only time Pantera really \"reinvented\" anything was themselves c. 1989, before the mammoth release of \"Cowboys from Hell\" the following year. That's not to say that this album, their \"fifth\" and final album, is all that bad. In looking at Pantera, whether you love em, hate em or don't mind em, you can easily define each of their albums post-Cowboys From Hell.\n\n\"Power Metal\" (1988), their first with Phil Anselmo and their last \"glam\" record, began to show traces of their new trajectory. \"Cowboys from Hell\" was heavy, thrashy, and still fundamentally \"heavy metal\" at heart. \"Vulgar Display\" expanded on the band's newfound heaviness and yielded some pretty good songs. Generally by now we can assume that Pantera got heavier with each album.\n\nNow, \"Reinventing the Steel\" is not perfect, and you cannot blame this entirely on musicianship. Pantera circa turn of the millennia were about to explode, not like in 1990, there was tension. This album was likely recorded with a lot of tension between the band, least of all the Abbott brothers and Phil. The album is not lacking by any means, though there aren't any \"Cemetery Gates\" or \"I'm Broken\"s on here.\n\nTwo songs that really stand out for me personally are \"Revolution Is My Name\" and \"Goddamn Electric\". Now these songs are pure unabashed Pantera, I feel a culmination of their work. Some people may disregard this album and the band around the year 2000, and opinions are warranted, and understandable, but \"Reinventing\" is not all bad, just not all good either.\n\nAside from those two songs, the rest don't really stand out, not that the musicianship is bad at all, I mean Dimebag's on top form, but it just as if you can sort of feel the internal tension. Although \"We'll Grind That Axe For A Longtime\" is another decent track, and sort of ironically ominous. If Phil had stayed friends with Dimebag and Vinnie a tragedy in the metal world could have been avoided, and maybe we'd still see Pantera, happy and grindin' on today, but for now we have this album, not their best, but hey not the worst piece of shit they could conjure.\n\nPros:\n- Classic Pantera\n- Dimebag at work\n- A few standout songs\n\nCons:\n- Feel the tension\n- Not all standout\n- Not their finest either\n",
        "\nLet me first start this review by saying I am NOT a Dimebag Darrell worshipper. I respect admire the guy and believe he is one of the most inspiring guitarists. However, I prefer to worship bands, as a whole, as opposed to one individual in the band. \n\nPantera\u2019s Power Metal is a hidden gem in the Pantera history. Pantera wants to believe that their first four albums prior to Cowboys from Hell did not exist. These include \u201cMetal Magic\u201d \u201cProjects in the Jungle\u201d \u201cI am the Night\u201d and \u201cPower Metal\u201d During this era they were still finding their sound and it would eventually take them 7 years to later to be officially signed to ATCO, which would in turn release \u201cCowboys from Hell.\u201d This band would go through various types of metal in their respective history; glam metal, traditional metal and groove metal, but this is by far their best album. It is the perfect mix between glam metal and traditional metal.\n\nBefore you criticize me and become skeptical of my views, let me state something; I have all Pantera\u2019s album in my discography, these include their four glam CDs. I did not read reviews from Amazon and decide to condescend because glam metal is cheesy and \u201cgay.\u201d The truth is if you bought this album, or have it in your collection; you would agree with me that this is their best album! \n\nThe best part of this album is Phil Anselmo\u2019s voice! I want you to remember Rob Halford\u2019s voice in Stain Glass, Screaming for Vengeance and Painkiller. I place Phil\u2019s voice on par with these three great albums in metal history. Phil shrieks in the album, Phil sings like a banshee in the album, Phil shows various tones to accompany the aura of the song. He shows in his debut album with Pantera that he is varied in vocal compositions. From the first song on the album \u201cRock the World\u201d the listener can hear a young and inspired Phil Anselmo, which has amazing range in his voice. Check the chorus out on \u201cRock the World\u201d and Power Metal and you will be in disbelief that it is Phil. \n\nOn the ballad song \u201cWe\u2019ll Meet Again\u201d Phil tones his down voice and treats the listener to a deep, dark and monotone voice, present during the verses. During the chorus he sings at a higher pitch and is comprehendible while singing. The solo in this song is amazing and I believe it is one of Dimebag\u2019s best solos. In \u201cOver and Out\u201d and \u201cProud to be Loud\u201d Phil and Pantera do things that would be non-existent in their career. They shriek with vocals and guitars through the verses, ala \u201cOver and out\u201d and turn the treble up on the vocals and the guitar, the guitars and the vocals complement each other very well. \u201cOver and out\u201d shows a progressive side to Pantera with the opening riff. On \u201cDown Below\u201d we are presented with Phil\u2019s dirty and ratty voice that sounds so incredible! Listen to the first and second verses of that song, it is wicked! This was a song that appeared on \u201cI am the Night\u201d however; Pantera picked the speed up and made it more (power) metal. \n\n\"Death Trap\u201d and \u201cHard Ride\u201d shows a side of Pantera that was not present in the first three albums a dark and enigmatic side. These songs have great riffs and excellent solos. I love the song structure on \u201cDeath Trap\u201d and \u201cHard Ride\u201d futures blazing guitar solos by Dimebag and a memorable bridge. \n\n\"Burnnn\u201d is my personal favorite on this album. The band begins with a thrashy riff from the start and Phil sings the 1st and 2nd verses with that ratty and gritty voice that he is famous for on this album. The guitars during the pre-chorus are catchy and sharp. During the solo break Dimebag shows why he will be one of the most influential guitarists, with two solos back to back and a sharp guitar riff that will cut you like a knife!\n\n\"P.S.T. 88\u201d (I will let you figure that one out) futures Dimebag on vocals. It is another well played song with more excellent sharp guitar riffs and a great solo. Dimebag does a great job of not only playing the guitar, but singing. \n\nThis album is very memorable; sure it is not the Pantera people idolize, but it futures excellent singing by Phil, with his varied singing and his high pitched voice. The guitar work by Dimebag Darrell is phenomenal, too. Good check out the guitars riffs on the \u201cPower Metal\u201d song or on \u201cDown Below\u201d the riffs are sharp. The band as a whole sound like Judas Priest, Metallica and Megadeth mixed into one. The riffs are thrashy and the treble is turned up to max on the guitar and Phil sings as good Rob Halford (Judas Priest), Mike Sanders (Toxik) and Eric Adams (Manowar).\n",
        "\nIt has to be said that the more popular a band is upon their demise the more numerous the compilations tend to be chronicling their work. These numerous cash grabs are meant to invoke the casual fan to shell out their hard earned money upon seeing a familiar song amongst the track listing, providing little insight into the band as a whole. In this modern era of mp3s and playlists, such compilations seem obsolete but that certainly does little to stop the onslaught of such releases from contaminating store shelves.\n\nPantera is a band many love to hate, despite or perhaps because of, their immense popularity and the creative avenues they took to get there. The disparity between albums like \u201cCowboys from Hell\u201d and \u201cFar Beyond Driven\u201d are relatively massive, especially if you examine the different vocal styles used and the different songwriting concepts employed, even if stylistically speaking they are not all that removed from one another. Since this is a band who encompassed a few different eras, any compilation looking to catalog their material has its work cut out for them and that\u2019s where this skimpy little number misses the mark.\n\nAnyone who obtained the \u201cFar Beyond the Great Southern Cowboy\u2019s Vulgar Hits\u201d will find this immediately pointless, if nothing more than a scaled down version of that already lacking compilation. What we have here are ten songs to document the career of a band that scaled 20+ years. Everything from their 1980\u2019s repertoire is missing, which is a shame since I would have been tickled pink to see a few songs off \u201cPower Metal\u201d here even if their inclusion would have only added to the inconsistency of this set. The \u201cCowboys from Hell\u201d album is represented well enough, taking up three of the allotted ten tracks. \u201cPsycho Holiday\u201d was a good choice in alongside the title track and \u201cCemetery Gates,\u201d even if I believe \u201cDomination\u201d or \u201cThe Art of Shredding\u201d might have fit in better here. \n\nWhat really assaults the listener\u2019s ears is the discrepancy between something as elaborate and sincere as \u201cCemetery Gates\u201d and something as toned down as \u201cMouth for War.\u201d The \u201cVulgar Display of Power\u201d material clashes with its predecessors, not to mention the fact that the overlong \u201cWalk\u201d was tacked on here, a spot better suited to something like \u201cRise\u201d or even \u201cHollow.\u201d \u201cFar Beyond Driven\u201d is represented by its two token singles in \u201c5 Minutes Alone\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m Broken,\u201d completely ignoring the better songs off that album like \u201cStrength Beyond Strength\u201d and \u201cSlaughtered.\u201d \u201cDrag the Waters\u201d and \u201cRevolution Is My Name\u201d represent \u201cThe Great Southern Trendkill\u201d and \u201cReinventing the Steel\u201d respectively. I can understand the latter case only getting one song, but its hard to imagine one measly song doing the \u201cTrendkill\u201d album justice, an album which surpassed its more famous predecessors and successors.\n\n\u201cA Decade of Domination\u201d was a poor title choice for this little piece of plastic, since it most certainly does not represent Pantera in a dignified manner. Mostly these are the songs that the public is the most familiar with, not the ones which best represent Pantera on a creative level. This Texan outfit was certainly not the most prolific metal band, far from it, but I find it hard to believe that anyone who took this band halfway seriously could do the same for this useless waste of space.\n",
        "\nReinventing the Steel is an album plagued by egocentrism. \n\nRight off the bat, the album cover really fucking sucks. With this amateurish artwork, the band is trying hard to prove that they are the wildest, \u201creal-deal\u201d heavy metal dudes out there. Typical Pantera. \n\nThen you might think, it's all about the music itself and the artwork shouldn't matter. Unfortunately, the music is just as unimpressive. First of all, Phil Anselmo can still scream like a demon for sure, but lyrically this album ranks among the worst of Pantera records. EVERY goddamn track, it seems, is about the band and how much of a rebel they are. Arrogant bravado gets really old after 44 minutes of it. \n\nBut it's not just Phil that's the egocentric culprit here, Dimebag Darrell and Vinnie Paul are equally guilty of resting on their laurels too. As the primary composers for the band, the Abbott brothers had plenty of time since the last album to write and record \u2013 almost four years of dormancy with little touring to do because Phil was busy with other projects. Regrettably though, we, the fans, are treated with one-trick pony of loud grooves after another from start to finish. Its general lack of dynamics in favor of nonstop pummeling is akin to Far Beyond Driven, only this time it's less threatening, and definitely more uninventive than FBD. \n\nSome of the songs even sound like a rehash of older Pantera songs too. \u201cDeath Rattle\u201d is essentially a second-rate \u201cSuicide Note Pt. II\u201d, even recycling that rattlesnake theme from the previous artwork (it's also laughable that Spongebob sampled this song). Then there is \u201cIt Makes Them Disappear,\u201d which attempts to be Reinventing the Steel's \u201cCemetary Gates\u201d or \u201cFloods.\u201d Sadly, it not only lacks the sense of emotional climax and epic swagger, it is supplemented with a rather unmemorable solo, which is rare feat for Dimebag. \n\nThis time, Dime and Vinnie also produced the record. This also meant that Dime and Vinnie basically hogs the attention of the listeners, and Rex Brown gets only one real spotlight (on \u201cIt Makes Them Disappear\u201d), and that's after the first 8 tracks are already over. For the vast majority of the record, he's buried in the background like Jason Newsted on Metallica albums. I suppose that's expected when the record is produced by two guys who ridicules Rex as being the \u201cfree meal-deal\u201d and don't recognize his talent and contributions to the band. \n\nTo be fair, I still enjoy Reinventing the Steel a little. This album still kicks more ass than a lot of mainstream metal records out there, and you still get that superb performance from each band members, especially Dimebag. Some tracks are kinda cool, like \u201cRevolution is My Name,\u201d which features the best and plentiful Dimebag solo of the record. Reinventing the Steel IS listenable really, but this is Pantera we're talking about. At the end of the day, solid performance isn't good enough for a band like Pantera if it's not backed by good show of creativity. \n\nUltimately, Pantera made a caricature of themselves with this one. Reinventing the Steel sure has the attitude, instrumental prowess, and plenty of heaviness, but lacks a sense of purpose. I hate to sound hyperbolic, but Reinventing the Steel sounds to me like Pantera's best days were already over \u2013 or specifically, Dimebag's most creative days were over. I wish as much as anyone else that Dimebag didn't is still alive, but listening to Reinventing the Steel, I get the feeling it's probably for the best that Pantera no longer exists.\n",
        "\nAfter being quite stunned by the amount of negative, and quite ignorant - reviews for this album, I felt it was time to bring some perspective to this great and important album.\n\nSeriously, there are reviews here written by kids who were 6 years old when this album was released, and given a whopping 0% score. Give me a fucking break.\n\nBack when this album was first released, metal was in a quite dismal, beaten up state. Not many bands were around carrying the torch, but the few that were are undeniably important. Pantera, Sepultura, Slayer - all of these bands helped push metal through the 90's, without it rotting in the gutters.\n\nFor some reason, Pantera always get slammed for being a \"fake\" thrash band. Uh, I don't ever remember them saying that they were a thrash band to begin with. They are what they are, and comparing them to classic thrash bands is pointless and retarded. Anyone expecting a \"Beneath the Remains\" from these guys is even more retarded. The ones who constantly say that they just ripped off Exhorder are even dumber.\n\nAfter the legendary \"Vulgar Display of Power\", I firmly believe that Pantera did a great job of following up that record. Here, the songs are a bit slower and much, much heavier, with the trademark Pantera sound. Dimebag's playing on it is relentless throughout, well planned, and well executed, with shit loads of devastating riffs. \n\nSure you have the classics that everyone knows - \"Becoming\", \"5 Minutes Alone\", \"I'm Broken\", etc, but this album offers a whole lot more. It's not just 3 good songs, with just mindless shit for the rest. Take \"Slaughtered\", a complete mammoth of a song - huge, deep riffs heavy enough to rattle your eyes out of their sockets. \"Shedding Skin\" also features some downright excellent guitar work, and throughout the whole album the band performs great.\n\nNo one ever even talks about \"Throes of Rejection\".. I just don't get it. A complete fucking kick to the head, yet it gets no praise whatsoever. When the massive riff kicks in at 0:58, you better be ducking for cover. Just totally awesome, raw, pure aggression. \n\nTheir cover of Sabbath's \"Planet Caravan\" is also a nice touch, and a fine way to end the album.\n\nMost of the reviews on here are those dumb, metal elitist types who still think Gorgoroth writes good music. It doesn't make sense to review an album if you weren't even fucking born when it was released, so please fuck off and do something productive with your time, because those reviews aren't clever or cute, and actually quite misleading for those genuinely interested in picking up the album.\n\nPantera were playing sold out venues during the 90's, being quite busy with kicking everyones faces in, while most black metal bands were still releasing albums which sounded like they were recorded in a giant tank of horse shit. No thanks, I'll take Pantera any day of the week.\n",
        "\nProbably best Pantera\u2019s album ever. Certainly, for many people it might be blasphemy, stressing the great value of his predecessors. \nAnd this was, perhaps, the reason that makes this record so underrated. \n\nThe band was in its worst period: too many internal disputes, Anselmo with his alcohol and drug problems mitigated the stability of the band, with the Abbott brothers suffer. Think about the fact that the beloved Phil Anselmo recorded his vocals in another studio than the rest of the band. The situation, therefore, was very difficult. And indeed, this record transmits all the anger and the suffering that the band felt at the time: just listen to the first 10 seconds of the initial, phenomenal, The Great Southern Trendkill. \n\nAnselmo transmits his fury with tortured screams, angry and devastated growls (helped, to accentuate the violence, by the evil Seth Putnam of Anal Cunt). Darrell tortures his Dean with deep, obsessive riffs, long bendings and, as usual, with the recognizable southern blues sound so dear to the 5 Texans. The brother Vince, on drums, is unleashed, with difficult and heavy rhythms, sometimes fast (with a dominating double bass), sometimes filled with Groove sounds. Rex, always equal, enriches the whole with his dark and heavy bass riffs.\n\nThe album mixes the classic groove metal, trademark of the Texas band, with death, thrash, doom influences and a hot and sweaty sound, clear of southern matrix. The sludge matrix of the band is very evident in this album.\n\nEach song has a different sound, while the lyrics deal mainly topics like drugs, suffering, and suicide. \nTGST is fast and furious, with an instrumental outro, where Darrell and his Dean seem to communicate. War Nerve is pure groove, Drag the Waters is a sort of angry version of \"Walk\" (this is the single chosen from the group, although personally it is perhaps the \"worst\" of the disk, if you have to find one). With 10's we hear even grunge influences, from Alice In Chains, with a suffered and poisonous tone. 13 Steps To Nowhere reprises the iconic sound of Vulgar Display Of Power, full of groove and blues riffs. Suicide Note, Pt. 1 is a hot country acoustic song (here you can hear the southern influences of the group). The second part change radically, with a fast and telluric thrash, with an unusual riff and a beautiful chorus, with a wild Anselmo and Vinnie Paul into a state of grace. Living Through Me is a modern and calculated thrash, with a chorus that relies on daring guitar riffs by Darrell. In the central part we hear noises and suffered voices of a never so exciting Phil Anselmo, and everything ends with a violent restart, that flows into the main riff. \nFloods deserve another speech, without emphasizing that alone worth buying the album. 7 minutes of great music: classic acoustic start, with Anselmo that interprets at his best the suffered atmosphere of the song, singing and whispering (putting the chills). The riffs are, as always, very inspired. At the third minute the song comes on, with an electric riff, obsessive in his gait. Then begins the masterpiece: acoustic interlude, followed by (perhaps) the best solo of Dimebag Darrell\u2019s career. Everything changes abruptly, with the entry of the usual riff that repeats itself in an obsessive way, before the final discharge, with riffs, beats and thundershowers sounds. The finish is an amazing outro, worthy end of the best song of the band's career, in my opinion. \nUnderground in America takes the obsessive groove of War Nerve and 13 Steps To Nowhere, driven by the riff that will be the main of the following song, the final Sandblasted Skin (Reprise). The band decides to close with a bang, with a fast and aggressive song. \n\nA perfect album: varied, inspired, angry. The band came to perfection, which will not be achieved in the future, accomplice to the murder of the genius Dimebag Darrell Abbott (RIP). We may remember them by turning on the CD players and enjoying this essential disc for any metal fan, in my opinion.\n\nP.S. Why not 100, you could ask? Well, Drag The Waters and Underground In America don't deserve a so higher mark (even if the other songs deserve 110!). But, we know, nothing is perfect...\n",
        "\nI'm not going to go on about Pantera's overall career path or the horrible influence they had on metal later on. Cowboys From Hell is a solid American heavy metal album from 1990 and if you liked 80's Megadeth and Metallica there was a good chance you found this album appealing when it came out. I emphasize that it was good for its time and setting in U.S. metal but this is not quite classic stuff. There are some thrash rhythms peppered in and about many songs but this is groove metal with a shadow of the glam metal sound they previously played. And I don't care what anyone says, Dimebag was an amazing heavy metal talent on guitar. Yeah, he's nothing special from a writing standpoint but you will never mistake his groove riffs or the energy levels for anyone else. I could pick many instances on this album to demonstrate this but I think I will use Psycho Holiday as the one. His construction of pure metallic verse riffs on this song are timed with style and virtuosity. This makes the solo sound remarkable when its introduced. What you're listening to is a guy who can command the speed of a transition at will where it seems almost improvised on the spot; it's just second nature to him. It's one reason why Dime never actually used to sit down and just practice playing.\n\nI want to go on record and say that Rex Brown is an awesome bass player and it's a shame he never really got much attention on Cowboys From Hell(or any other album by them either). The reason for this is his style is un-showey and is not given to much complexity but his timing is rigorous and strict; never missing a beat. Domination is the best song and in no small part to him. He lays down subtechnical jazz rhythms that excel at being transient for Dime to move in and out of channel. When Dime's speed changes they flawlessly move into mini-solo mode. His bass playing is very perfect for this band. I've isolated Rex's bass tracks on this album and they sound like a hidden album within an album. You might want to check out the song Shattered for another grand demonstration of his ungodly precision underneath very fast riffs. \n\nYou can't go wrong with Primal Concrete Sledge. What an excellent groove metal song this is! It's mean and blunt all packed in and ready to do some headbanging trauma. What I admire about it is there is nothing \"wasteful\" about it. It's all going in one direction and doesn't wander about needlessly with any extra chords. Even the guitar solo sticks close to the brunt of the overall rhythm. The Art of Shredding is another sharp groove laden highlight. I know this song alone must have attracted many Overkill and old Anthrax fans Pantera's way. This is a song that dares to be New York thrash once it hits its stride. Very alluring indeed. \n\nThe two songs that I don't care for are Cemetery Gates and Message in Blood. While Gates was ok at first, I grew tired of it quick. Maybe I've heard it too much on the FM channel but it sounds like it was built too much as a single. The acoustic beginning doesn't sound that interesting. The first eight seconds of Message were extremely promising but then it succumbs to excessive variety of corrugated groove riffs and a solo that has Dimebag cramming too much wankery in a slowed down tempo. Maybe The Sleep could be another weak song but I actually think Phil's falsetto screams are standout. He by the way, is very impressive on the album as a whole. \n\nCowboys From Hell is not a sophisticated album but then again I don't exactly look for that in a heavy metal either. What I look for in something like this is dash and banging riffs. Pantera gets it done on their own terms. Forget the glam days, this is the record that they find themselves.\n",
        "\nOne of the most controversial set of bands to discuss in the world of heavy metal most comfortably belong to the groove metal genre. It can't be plainly stated enough how quickly these groups divide the various metal circles out there with almost equally divided fans. Amongst these, I often find myself embattled as what to really say about Pantera, since their own career was divided between focused, aggressive music and something akin to this album, which runs amok with little concentration and a heavy emphasis on the predictable.\n\nI now and will always wave the albums \"Cowboys from Hell\" and \"The Great Southern Trendkill\" as this band's two best offerings, with \"Vulgar Display of Power\" and this one being something of an anomaly. It seems strange that two mediocre efforts could be sandwiched inbetween two albums full of focus and quality material other than perhaps falling victim to the trend oriented tendencies of the decade. In theory, one could liken Pantera's career 1992-1995 as something similar to Anthrax, as simply watching a once gifted band pissing away their potential by making sub-par material. Since this would all crash and re-emerge as \"The Great Southern Trendkill,\" an album even diehard Pantera fans ignore, I guess one could argue that Pantera were trying to feel out their style since \"Vulgar Display\" but the pop-oriented metal songs of this album tell a different story.\n\nAs with most things Pantera recorded in this era of their career, Dimebag remains something of a saving grace. Granted, he can't directly pull this album from the depths of mid-90's mediocrity, but he does help it become a much better version of what Skinlab would be doing a few years later. He does offer a few more magical moments here than was present in \"Vulgar Display\" which helps this album eek out a better score. Phil Anselmo has actually taken a turn for the worst here, evolving his hardcore-esque bark from the previous album into something that sounds like quasi-death grunts shouted into a tin can on a string. He always seems to sound distant in the mix, which is probably all the better since I personally couldn't stand this version of his vocal style and we can all thank our deity of choice he didn't do it again beyond this album. \n\nEven with the above musicians who aren't on their \"A\" game, this album could have been better than it was. Much like the previous album, Pantera wrote their songs several minutes too long, something fellow Texan band Pissing Razors would remedy by cutting their songs to 2-3 minutes. Here, its more likely to be 4-5 minutes, with \"Hard Lines, Sunken Cheeks\" and \"25 Years\" going 7 and 6 minutes respectively and both are guaranteed to bore you senseless. \"I'm Broken\" is a similar story, despite its iconic status, and \"5 Minutes Alone\" would be another example but its made slightly better by being more memorable and focusing less on driving a repetitive groove into one's skull.\n\nDespite the mediocre material that runs rampant here, there are songs that help salvage this listen. The opener in \"Strength Beyond Strength\" is one of the more notable, as it filters in some thrash influences while also helping to craft a better version of groove metal into a three and half minute song, ideal for this genre. \"Becoming\" is another good example at only three minutes, and manages to maintain focus instead of launching off into endless groove land. \"Slaughtered\" takes my pick as the best of these, manifesting a style that would become a template of sorts for some like-minded songs on the next album. Phil's constipated coyote barks become more in the range of full fledged death grunts and suit the song very well. \"Slaughtered\" remains one of the few songs I still listen to from this album, and probably the best off either \"Vulgar Display\" or this album.\n\nFor all the pointless mediocrity on display here, this album does have a few tracks worth salvaging, though I'd be hard pressed to bring up a reason why anyone would look into purchasing this from anywhere other than the bargain bin. Even the cover of \"Planet Caravan,\" which is essentially a bonus track tacked on due to its being left out of a Black Sabbath tribute album, is particularly lackluster. If one could find \"Strength Beyond Strength,\" \"Use My Third Arm,\" \"Becoming,\" and \"Slaughtered\" from an outside source, they'd already have the best songs this album has to offer. As such, this isn't anything I listen to much of anymore as I still champion the superiority and unfortunate one-time only of \"The Great Southern Trendkill.\" That album had focus and set forth to aggressively answer some questions about this band and their standards. \"Far Beyond Driven\" does none of that, and instead finds Pantera lost in a haze of lacking ideas and the misconception that all good music needs is a heavy dose of groove.\n",
        "\nFor some time now, I havn't felt overly compelled to pen any opinions about this album, or anything that Pantera did between 1992-1994. Both \"Vulgar Display of Power\" and \"Far Beyond Driven\" were albums that I wasn't incredibly fond of even when I listened to Pantera on regular occasion. Having heard the better side to this band's creative process on \"Cowboys from Hell\" and \"The Great Southern Trendkill,\" and some extent their late 80's material, I knew what Pantera could do when they set their minds to it. \n\nI decided to reverse my previous decision and pen some lines about this particular album. My views aren't firmly planted with either the usual Pantera bashing crowd nor the usual Pantera worshippers crowd. I don't really see \"Vulgar Display of Power\" as a monumental effort worthy of its classic status and recognition by the media, nor is it really the worst thing that metal has ever concieved, probably far from it. Instead, I would agree that Pantera took a serious gamble in expanding their sound here. Some have said this expansion and change in songwriting style was a mad gamble for radio success, which might hold some ground. However, considering their varying changes over the course of the 90's and considering even their diehard fans reject \"The Great Southern Trendkill\" as their weakest album might put a heavier focus on merely a change in musical direction. A rather poorly planned and poorly executed change in direction, but an honest one nonetheless.\n\nComing off the thrash/power/groove hybrid works of \"Cowboys From Hell,\" I will be the first to admit that this album is complete step down in terms of quality. For one, the riffs are limited as was/is common in the American groove metal (post-thrash) genre which this album firmly belongs to. Second, Phil Anselmo's once majestic Rob Halford tribute vocals have now been changed drastically to that of a militaristic bark, or \"tough guy\" shouts as some prefer to call them. This leads to an obvious departure of both the power metal and thrash metal tendencies of the previous album, and replaces both will similiarities closer to that of a more metallic version of the early 90's hardcore scene. \n\nSince this album's track list has been analyzed numerous times by now, I won't go into a complete track by track breakdown. \"Mouth for War\" is a good opener, definitely setting the tone for the majority of the album which is based on the heavy groove. There is a little speed metal influence tacked onto the end, but it doesn't really add much to the song as a whole. \"Rise\" manages to flesh out some speed metal ideas, and it should come as no surprise that the song is one of the best off this release. \"This Love\" provides some interesting moments that contrast one another, eventually going on to mesh relatively well from the creepy but tranquil sections to the usual post-thrash metal style displayed elsewhere on this album. \"Hollow\" also echoes this to a degree, although it can be broken down in a more simplistic manner as a half-ballad, with the ballad at the beginning and the usual Pantera coming at the second half.\n\nUnfortunately, there is a copious supply of throwaway tracks here that represent underdeveloped songs, which also became a characteristic of the bands who became influenced by Pantera. \"Walk\" and \"No Good (Attack the Radical)\" are all too obvious examples of this, the former as a five minute borefest with very little of interest going on and the latter with its quasi-rap spoken word sections that probably influenced some of the rapcore acts that would follow in succeeding years. None of the other songs here are quite as offensive as those two, but none of them are really anything of interest, either.\n\nBefore I enter my concluding statements, I would like to address one reason for contempt that many have used. This charge that many hurdle towards this album is that it should be scoffed upon solely for influencing nu-metal. Well, I don't have any real doubt that Korn's first album did carry some degree of influence from what Pantera and other groove outfits were up in that time period. These accusations, while somewhat true, are frequently handed out without taking other similar instances into account. However, I can't seem to find anyone who is willing to bash Suffocation or Carcass for influencing Job For A Cowboy and the subsequent wave of deathcore bands, despite that influence being all too obvious in their music. Nor could I find anyone to criticize Sleep or Kyuss for influencing retro hipster bands like The Sword. Its more or less a convienent but empty point to make since disliking a band simply for superficial issues like their audience or what music they influenced is pointless.\n\nSo, it seems my overall opinion of this album doesn't differ too much from its other detractors. This is made even more clear because I still enjoy some of Pantera's music from time to time but generally avoid this album and \"Far Beyond Driven\" altogether. I wouldn't call it excruiatingly bad, as I have heard worse but its not something I'd go on to place on a pedestal. There are better Pantera albums to be heard, particularly \"Cowboys from Hell\" and \"The Great Southern Trendkill,\" so I'd advise those curious check in either one of those two releases. If one must seek out this album, then I'd advise checking for this \"classic\" in the bargain bin.\n",
        "\nIn years past, when I first started getting into the massive world known as heavy metal, I became a big fan of bands MegaDeth, Sepultura and Pantera. I still retain a heavy dose of enjoyment from these bands and their music, but in the case of Pantera, I have come to realize a few things. For one, too many fans are concentrated on deciding if \"Vulgar Display of Power\" or \"Far Beyond Driven\" deserves the crown of the band's best effort. The real champion of their later 90's works undoubtedly sits with \"The Great Southern Trendkill,\" for reasons explained in that review. On the other side of the 90's decade, sits \"Cowboys From Hell,\" the best album this band ever put forth.\n\nAfter a good deal spent fighting their way to the top with a slew of glam rock releases in the 1980's, Pantera settled on a new sound. As described by some other reviewers, this album can be described as being power metal, groove metal, hybrid glam and hybrid thrash yet being none of these in itself. The minimalist speed metal makes itself present on a number of occasions, something that became increasingly hard to detect as time moved forward with this band. The fact that Dimebag Darrell (credited as Diamond Darrell here) continued to shred up a storm in an era when such things were disappearing is just icing on the cake for anyone into guitar performances.\n\nBefore getting onto the music, its absolutely necessary to point out Phil Anselmo. Hated by some and loved by others, Anselmo has always come off as ego driven which eventually became one of the reasons I disliked him on a personal level. His ego has usually outweighed his talents, but on this album I have a hard time holding that against him. Anselmo's incredible vocals on this album definitely bring to mind some of the operatic vocals of the NWOBHM movement a decade earlier, with Rob Halford a particular mention. While I do not hold a doctorate in power metal vocalists, I do know enough to say that Anselmo's performance here is more than respectable. With a voice like that, its one to wonder why he devolved into a tough guy bark on \"Vulgar Display\" and later quasi-death grunt echoes in an empty room on \"Far Beyond Driven.\" At one time, I actually disliked Anselmo on this album, now I realize that was completely moronic on my part.\n\nTo speak of the music is to notice we have a good deal of variety here. Pantera definitely throws in some power metal attributes on the title track, an anthem of sorts that carried this band until their demise. The emphasis is placed on the guitars and anthemic chorus, two things I've always noticed is prevalent in power metal. Other songs of this nature would be the incredible \"Cemetery Gates,\" which is at the top of the list in terms of guitar performance of Dimebag's entire career. Yet the majority of this album is consumed by hints of Metallica and speed metal worship, with Anselmo even cutting into some James Hetfield territory when things slow down. I do not count this as a bad thing, given that Pantera's filtering in some Metallica influence definitely works better than alot of Metallica worshippers I've heard. Songs of this caliber include \"Primal Concrete Sledge,\" \"Domination,\" \"Clash With Reality,\" \"Message In Blood,\" and \"The Sleep,\" the last of which includes some intricate acoustics.\n\nOne song in particular I found interesting is \"Medicine Man.\" It seems like a combination of a multitude of styles, which is exactly what this album embodies anyway. The slower sections seem to filter in doom metal, a genre of metal I'm always happy to hear, especially when its done right. Yet the song also cuts more into the mid-tempo groove Pantera would later become famous for, though there are enough changes to avoid becoming tedious. I enjoy hearing Anselmo's vocal shifts, moving between his usual high pitch and lower end spoken word parts that appear in the verses. \n\nThere is not a single reason why any Pantera fan should not recognize this as the band's crowning achievement. Its an interesting brew of a variety of styles, yet it does not exhibit any of those styles in and of itself. \"Cowboys From Hell\" also throws in the best performances most of the band members here have ever contributed to the medium of music. Dimebag Darrell set forth performances here that he would never overcome (or really even attempt to overcome) and the exact same could be said of Phil Anselmo. I often question why this band did not evolve further, carrying the sounds of this album to another level. In any event, this represents the best album Pantera ever put forth into recorded history, and is something power metal and even thrash metal fans might be interested in. It isn't either of those genres in their purest forms, nor is it close, yet there is enough of both to draw attention. \"Cowboys From Hell\" undoubtedly ranks as one of the best albums of the year 1990 and the greatest summit Pantera would ever achieve.\n",
        "\nConsidering their capable career during the 1990's, not to mention the struggling on the local circuit for seven years, its no surprise \"Reinventing the Steel\" turns off a good deal of fans. Even during my years when I was most enthralled by this band, my approach to this album was always lukewarm. Its not so much that there isn't anything worthwhile on this album, but rather that it contains some great songs surrounded by forgettable groove. This comes as unusual in the case of \"Reinventing the Steel\" because both \"Vulgar Display\" and \"Far Beyond Driven\" are the exact same story, yet both of those are always heralded as some kind of 90's classics.\n\nThe key issue here is that the better songs on this album are actually quite good, but in contrast the other songs are that much worse and/or boring. The fact that the sound quality of this album is about as low grade as Pantera ever got in their later career doesn't help things, with the guitars becoming somewhat annoying at times. The enjoyable crunch they had at one time is replaced by a hit or miss syndrome that sometimes listen well and other times can come to the point of grating you to press the skip button. Confound this with an obvious step down in songwriting on almost all fronts and you have a pretty lackluster way to end this band's career.\n\nThe album itself, in terms of song quality, is a mixed bag. You have some great songs, some decent songs and then some unbearable songs. The great songs are obviously the ones that cause the listener to remember why he enjoys Pantera (or if you never did, remind you of why you dislike them.) This includes the opener in \"Hellbound,\" which I'd say is one of the best songs this band ever did. Its short and to the point, not a lot of needless repetition or meandering for five to six minutes. The song even has a sense of build-up to a climactic ending and is fairly memorable, not to mention it just works on all fronts. \"Revolution Is My Name\" is next, again a worthy mention in the context of Pantera's career. Its a song that has ambition, more so than the average mid-tempo groover that Pantera is known for. It takes my pick as the best song on this album, and challenges the better moments from earlier in their career. \"It Makes Them Disappear\" and \"I'll Cast A Shadow\" are longer numbers, but both work equally well although they are a bit short in terms of quality to match up with \"Hellbound\" and \"Revolution Is My Name.\" The only real complaint from these two is that \"I'll Cast A Shadow\" seems to refuse to end, dragging on about a half minute too long.\n\nThe decent songs begin with \"Yesterday Don't Mean Shit,\" which is a fairly enjoyable song. This one in particular seems to showcase a step down in Anselmo's lyrical writings, which were a highlight for me on \"The Great Southern Trendkill.\" While I agree with the song's message, its like he couldn't come up with anything better than \"on the fly\" lyrics to these songs. \"Death Rattle\" is another short number and decent enough, but nothing special. \"Uplift\" is more of the same, though its lyrics get a bit comical and I imagine that isn't the intention the band was going for. \n\nThe remaining three should have been cut entirely, for they serve little more than reasoning to press the skip button and to dock points off the album as a whole. \"Goddamn Electric\" is utterly boring, not to mention more of the same with Anselmo's lackluster writings here. \"You've Got to Belong to It\" could have been a decent tune but that incessant guitar effect is absolutely annoying as hell and kills the song completely. \"We'll Grind that Axe for a Long Time\" is positive only in that its shorter, but completely useless and devoid of ideas. Considering this band folded just a couple of years after this album was released, the whole concept of the song seems more contradictory than anything else.\n\nThe fact that \"Reinventing the Steel\" had potential to be a decent end for this band only makes it that much harder to really listen to it as a whole. Had about half of these songs gotten the boot things would have been much better. Pantera should have released an EP with \"Hellbound,\" \"Yesterday Don't Mean Shit,\" \"Revolution is My Name,\" \"It Makes Them Disappear,\" and \"I'll Cast a Shadow,\" this would have been a more enjoyable listen and would have scored a 78%. It would have been called a step down from \"Trendkill\" in almost every way but a fairly solid way to end the band's career not to mention being a lot easier to listen to as a whole instead of getting your finger ready for the skip button on every other track. That being said, this was not a good way to end things for this group, and on the whole, is about even with \"Far Beyond Driven\" as the worst of the band's \"main\" career. I picked this up second hand many years ago for $5, which is perfect because I got five songs worth a damn and I cannot see why anyone should go much higher.\n",
        "\nThough I originally got into heavy metal thanks to a collection of my father's cassette tapes of bands like Dark Angel and MegaDeth, one of the bands I truly enjoyed early on was Pantera. As time has moved on, I began to break apart this band's music, focusing on the albums as a whole as well as the songwriting approach taken. Call it maturity or realization, but my almost fan boy adoration of Pantera has slowly subsided over the years, being replaced with a sometimes mild, sometimes excited reaction to hearing this band's music. The two albums that get the most out of me these days are \"Cowboys from Hell\" and \"The Great Southern Trendkill.\"\n\nWhile \"Cowboys from Hell\" was an excellent blend of various metal genres including more traditional styles and minimalist thrash with lots of prowess from Dimebag Darrel, \"Trendkill\" takes a different route. What is present on this album seems to be a darker yet even more hostile version of Pantera. The music seems specifically designed to charge forth like a battering ram through Phil Anselmo's enemies both real and imagined. The album also showcases a more creative machine that was Pantera at this point in time, including being the band's most varied album post-1991. While \"Vulgar Display of Power\" and \"Far Beyond Driven\" could get a good thing going at times, they would also become stalled in middle of the road metal. Both those albums were, most of the time, like placing a brick on the accelerator of a car that was suspended on a lift: sounds good, but you're never going to go anywhere.\n\n\"The Great Southern Trendkill\" survives the pedestrian metal attempts on its two preceeding albums by making some changes. For one, the music is much more focused instead of directionless hostility. Someone already beat me to the explanation for this, which includes Anselmo's ever increasing volatile nature, accusations of rascism, increased substance abuse, internal problems within the band, so on and so forth. Phil Anselmo probably makes the biggest change in the band, putting forth some seemingly current lyrics that are relevant to this day about trends and the subversion of hipster disciples who jump on each new trend like a street walker does her clients. The 1990's were a rampant time of trends, one of the most horrid in which was the mainstream's fascination with halfwit alternative rock bands of the day.\n\nAnselmo's other major contribution to this album is his change is vocal style. While \"Vulgar Display\" had that militant bark and \"Far Beyond Driven\" had that quasi-death grunts shouted from halfway across a parking lot feel, \"Trendkill\" finds Anselmo charging forward with shrieks more akin to his work in Superjoint Ritual. I would argue, however, that his work here is far less nerve racking thanks entirely to the better ideas and musicianship on this record, which keeps Anselmo grounded. The record is also layered in its vocal affects, which gives songs like \"13 Steps to Nowhere\" and \"Sandblasted Skin\" a demonic feel. This comes again from the internal issues of the time, as Anselmo was not even in the same state as Rex, Dime, and Vinnie during the recording sessions.\n\nThe unusual creativity exuded on this album come in the forms of songs like \"Floods,\" \"10's,\" and \"Suicide Note Pt. 1.\" \"Floods\" is an excellent example, and while a bit too long, possesses an interesting contrast between somber darkness and later in the song when things begin to pick up. \"Suicide Note Pt. 1\" is an unusually serene number that comes off as a dark country song (I mean country music, not this Kenny Chesney nonsense) that stacks up as one of Pantera's very best. \"10's\" is the least of these, which has a nice atmospheric tinge to it, but for its entire duration refuses to kick things up a bit when such a change would be most welcome. \n\nThe remaining songs either fall into Pantera's usual (though improved) Southern groove or faster versions of such. \"Suicide Note Pt. 2\" is an excellent example of the faster songs, and works very well for the band. With a song like that, it begs to know why Pantera couldn't throw in more songs like these in their time which would have undoubtedly improved \"Vulgar Display\" and \"Far Beyond Driven.\" The title track also throws in some faster sections, albeit temporarily and showcases Anselmo's new found lyrical approach against the mainstream media. \"War Nerve\" is more mid-tempo work, but is a much better than song than anything found on the previous two releases. \"Drag the Waters\" is another example of this, throwing in some cowbell to alleviate your fever. \n\nUnlike the more celebrated releases by this band, I could not find a single dud here, except maybe \"10's.\" They all possess merit of some kind, and with perhaps the exception of \"Living through Me\" manage to avoid becoming mindlessly repetitive or suffer from aimless meandering. Its definitely an improvement over preceeding works for this band (not to mention the one that would come after it) and is quite possibly the best album they put out. Songs like \"Sandblasted Skin\" and \"War Nerve\" help one to forget all about the stagnated groove fests of \"Far Beyond Driven,\" which for some unknown reason is a more cherished album than this one. In fact, this is the one Pantera album that never gets much respect, even though the live versions of these songs that appeared on \"Official Live: 101 Proof\" were killer and the highlights of that album.\n\nLike some have already said before me, this is a Pantera album for Pantera fans and non-fans alike. I can certainly see those who couldn't care less about this band getting into this, considering I know some who have. Its especially far removed from their other material in terms of aggressive and focused attack, yet still planted enough to win the adoration of Pantera fans. I for one continue to enjoy this album more than any other this band has put out, and recognize it as their best second only to \"Cowboys From Hell\" in terms of musicianship. It would have been interesting to see Pantera continue down this road, which obviously did not happen given the step down that \"Reinventing the Steel\" was. I also like this album for its statements, particularly against the \"hip\" crowd and their trends plus against the stereotypical outlook on the Southeast U.S. This is all just icing on the cake for a Southerner like me, but for those who couldn't care less, I can definitely recommend this to non-Pantera fans. Its removed from what most media outlets celebrate about this band, to the point that many Pantera fans seem to skip over it entirely.\n",
        "\nSad beans it is, that Pantera had to end on a really disappointing note, especially considering their last output, the godly Trendkill. Sadder still, that Phil and the rest of the boys couldn't get it together for one more and had to end the band on the note that it did. And, probably the saddest of all, was the horror that was Damageplan and the tragic event that transpired. Yup, if Pantera was still a band, Dimebag would still be alive, Down would still just be a side project, Dammitplan would never have existed, and Pantera would probably be playing possibly some death/thrash hybrid. Hey, I can dream right? I can't? Oh bah.\n\nEnough with the bellyaching, on to \"Reinventing the Steel\". If you're hoping for \"Trendkill Pt II\", you'll be disappointed. If you're hoping for more songs in the vein of \"Walk\", then you should consider a career around downed power lines and slippery wet surfaces. Yeah, it bears little resemblance to the previous offering and shares more in common with \"Far Beyond Driven\" minus all the lame-ass groove. Mind you, the groove is still here, just not facefucking you nonstop (\"Vulgar\"),as much as it is punching you in the shoulder every 30 seconds to one minute. The riffs....not many of them stick out and dickslap you like the ones from \"Cowboys From Hell\" did, and a good number of them are boring and generic groove based riffs. The drumming is actually not bad, Vinnie gives a good if unspectacular performance. Rex's bass is clear as always, though nothing eye-popping is on display, he's there and audible. As for the vocals....well Phil's vocals seem to be love it or hate it for the vast majority. Personally, I have no problem with them, though I do miss his higher pitched singing a la \"Shattered\" but that hasn't been seen in years so no surprise that there is no highs to be found. He just sticks with what he's done since \"Far Beyond Driven\", that being his lower growls.\n\nThe songwriting is also weaker than Trendkill. No surprises like \"Suicide Note Part 1\" to change the flow. Aye, most of the songs are midpaced and adhere to the \"verse, chorus\" structure whilst clocking in between three to five minutes in length. But not all the tracks on hand are losers. Opener \"Hellbound\" contains an explosive (by this album's standard) chorus and the bridge near the end isn't too bad. It's also the shortest track. \"Revolution is my Name\", to my ears, is not bad for being a single, certainly it's assfuckloads better than the other singles released for radio back in 2000 (i.e. Limp Dicklick, StinkinPark) and for that, it's win, besides the intro riff, which I never cared for. \"Death Rattle\" is probably the fastest song on the album, and the only one that could have fit on \"Trendkill\". The solo is almost pure noise but it fits the song well so no complaints. \"We'll Grind That Axe For a Long Time\" is filled with groove but I can go without skipping it most of the time. Don't know why, but it sorta kinda works. Finally, \"Uplift\" has a fun chorus riff and some nice drumming. The rest of the songs aren't horrible piles of banal groovefuck like a certain song of Pantera's that happens to rhyme with \"cock\", but they're nothing special either. The only one I tend to skip over alot is the closing \"I'll Cast a Shadow\". It just never clicked with me.\n\nAll told, Pantera's last studio output would prove to be a disappointing end to one of metal's most well known bands. Aye, it's best to just put this on and pretend that Damageplan and HellYeah never existed. If you're unsure whether to buy or not, download \"Revolution\" and if you dig that, chances are you shouldn't have too many complaints with this.\n",
        "\nWell, I can say one thing for sure about this record: I'll never forget the day I've listened to it for the first time. It was 1997, I remember myself walking into a 1 hour photo and, for some obscure reason, there were some Cd's for sale in that shop, including the one I'm reviewing. Seeing that there was a snake on the cover and looked pretty badass I decided to buy it, then I went home and listened to it. Well, my response after just 10 seconds into the first song could be translated in English as \"Holy Fucking Jesus what the fuck?\" That was more than 12 years ago, I was very young and just got into metal music, I wasn't prepared for such an outpour of rage in music form; at the time I thought heaviness in metal music came more from the speed at which notes where unleashed upon you or from the complexity of the songs rather than from the volume and intensity of them. Ten years later I understood what this album showed me back then, something that at that time unconsciously prompted me to instantly make a copy of it on cassette for my friends to experience what I labeled \"The Heaviest Album Ever\". Did I really say that? Yes, but it was years and years ago. Do I still mean it? Yep...\n\nThe fact with this album is that its heaviness doesn't come from how fast the songs are, or how heavy the distortion of the guitar is (well, maybe just a little bit), it's not something that was thought over and then conveyed in the studio. No, the heaviness of this music comes from the souls of the very people who wrote it and played it. The execution has little or nothing to do with it. And, for the record, I, as I bet almost everybody else out there, have in all these years listened to stuff that was played faster, louder and with heavier production (and even with more layers of guitars), but nothing comes even close to the brutality of this album, the lethal dose of hate that T.G.S.T.K. is.\n\nNow, I don't know what happened in the two-year time that occurred between this and its predecessor, Far Beyond Driven, but, believe me, it turned Pantera's music from the poser \"let's-kick-them-asses\" redneck crap that boosted them into the pantheon of sell-out MTV metal-whores (along with Korn, White Zombie and all the other bitches) into a genuine, mountain-sized, 40 minutes long, ugly growl of hate towards everybody and everything. I mean, let's pretend to forget the fact that the sounds of all instruments on \"Trendkill\" are much thicker, deeper and heavier than they've ever been on a Pantera album; let\u2019s also forget that, on here, carefully orchestrated harmonies, vocal melodies and jaw-dropping guitar solos left place to demonic, keyboard-driven dissonances, unrelenting death-growls and eardrum-raping noises; let's pretend to forget all this, but don't we still remember that Phil Anselmo guy, the same guy that only two years and one album prior to this was singing about his dad getting drunk and kicking his ass, about his friends turning their backs on him and then, again, kicking his ass... he was essentially singing about him getting his ass kicked. Well, this same guy is now back with a vengeance and an infected throat filled with spite and hate towards the whole fucking world and with an overwhelming desire to destroy it. He really takes on everything, from the media, to the justice system, to the low-lives and the common people. Religion, industries, families... he doesn't leave anybody out. Not even himself.\n\nAnd if the lyrics are pure manifests of anger then the music is the most appropriate I could think of. Dimebag Darrel was a talented guitar player, one of the most inventive in the 90's scene and one of the most original and with a distinctive sound. Yet, starting from Far Beyond Driven he dared to challenge himself and his own talent by filtering his fluid, very technical style with some more atypical, whistling, ear-raping... what do you call that? Noise. Now, why would anyone in metal music (a genre that is already more than too often referred to as \"noisy\" from common people, even when they are talking about Metallica and the Irons) adopt such a style, when everything before was going just so well, if not because he's had enough and doesn't give a shit anymore? The riffs are simplistic, very heavy and groove oriented, leaving more and more open space for inhuman screams and demonic guitar-noises to breathe (see \"Living Through Me\", \"Drag The Waters\", \"Sandblasted Skin\", for example). But even in a chaotic ordeal like the one he\u2019s putting you through, be sure, if there's a ballad, chances are good ol' Dimebag will grace your ears with some amazingly beautiful and heartfelt guitar solos. His best on T.G.S.T.K. must be the solo he played on the track \"Floods\", a quirky semi-ballad with and holocaustic undertone. Another great one is on the other semi-ballad, \"10's\", while a special mention goes to the bluesy southern boogie that wraps up the title track, notable. Cherry on top of his performance is the only real ballad present on this album, \"Suicide Note Pt.1\u201d; this one is a highly depressing tune, with lyrics referring to somebody's life destroyed by drug addiction, somebody who's loathing into madness and decides (obviously) to take his own life. And, I swear, never ever has music been so in theme with such negative lyrics. Even before you read the booklet or before the singer starts singing the guitar sets already a funereal tone all over you, and you already know that this ain't gonna end in a good way... a little masterpiece. \n\nThe bass sound is really great, unlike other Pantera albums where you could only hear the bass in the solo section due to the fact that the band don't have a second guitar. In this album, fortunately, Rex' bass lines are allowed their place in the spotlight along with all the other instruments; and I say fortunately because he does such a great job it would have been a shame to mix it out of the final product like had happened in the previous records. Not that what he does is technically unbelievable or amazing in any \"aesthetic\" means, but firstly because the guy chose one hell of a sound for this record and then the much more simplistic approach to song-writing from Darrell allowed Rex to stick his head out of the swamp of riffs and lay his own ideas here and there during each song, adding to the overall quality and general eclecticism of the \u201cTrendkill\u201d. Highlights in his performance here are the guitar-bass duet in the chorus of \"Living Through Me\", the bass lines that accompany \"Floods\"' guitar solo and, in general, the fast thrashers of this album, like \"Suicide Note Pt.2\", the title track and \"War Nerve\".\n\nVinnie Paul does a fucking amazing job on the drums. As usual. I am very proud of this guy, for the way he handles the groove so fucking tightly, for all the amazing double bass flavour that he adds here and there and for his tasteful, genuinely southern approach to tribal rhythms (listen to the song \"13 Steps To Nowhere\" to understand what I mean). We must note that, in this album, the guy unleashes some of the fastest beats he's ever played, especially on \"Suicide Note Pt.2\", which are really very close to blast-beats.\n\nSo, in the end, I think it's safe to say that this album is a good recommendation to give to someone who wants to experience a little pain while listening to the music he loves. Especially the unrelenting screaming of Anselmo (helped by Anal Cunt's Seth Putnam) can result, for the first couple of listens, in a very painful experience. I swear, these guys never stop yelling, especially during the first three songs. But it's also one hell of a schooling in a matter that is very important, probably vital to heavy metal music: I'm talking about HATE, and ANGER, and DISDAIN. Because that's what metal music comes from and what it represents, and if a band can't express that then it means they\u2019re merely entertainers, they're fake. And so is the listener if he can't take it. A wiser fella than me once said: \"If you can't stand the heat, then stay out of the kitchen!\". Well... I\u2019ll say if you think you can\u2019t stand 40 minutes of the most hate-fueled heavy metal you\u2019ve ever heard, then don\u2019t listen to this.\n\nSo, after 12 years I could finally share my thoughts about this album with whoever will take the time to read this. I've done my best to retain the feelings I had upon my first listen of this album, and even though much time has passed I can say in all honesty that the story hasn't changed much: this album still manages to brutalize me every time I play it. And I'll forever thank Pantera for it.\n\nR.I.P., Dime!\n",
        "\nThis album is terrible. I'm not going to be subtle about this point. Pantera is something that can only be compared with child rape, spousal abuse, and a rising infant mortality rate. They are far beyond abysmal and a vulgar display of trailer park mentality. The last album might've been just bad in that normal way, like say you're sandwich wasn't too good because the bread was stale and the meat was old. Vulgar Display of Power is like being forced to eat a sandwich consisting only of cow shit and menstrual blood from aging goats.\n\nVulgar Display of Power is Pantera's first official album. As we all know they started off as a horrendous glam band that no one liked . They released albums featuring such fabulous songs like Ride My Rocket (get the reference there?), Metal Magic, Heavy Metal Rules, and Hot N' Heavy. For some unknown reason, they never made it with those songs of epic prose. The band decided they needed a change. So they kicked out \"pussy\" Terrence Glaze (that's the worst stage name ever) and picked up \"tuff guy\" Phil Anselmo. They miraculously got \"meaner\" and \"heavier\". Well not really, but they convinced a lot of shitheads they did. Their first album with Herr Anselmo wasn't horrible, definitely their best, but by no means a classic. But no one bought the album and it was later deemed to be not \"badass\" enough. But soon they got a major label deal and an Exhorder demo in the mail, so Pantera were finally ready to claim they actually recorded the next album coming out. The next album was a sad attempt to mix brain-dead thrash with southern boogie. Harlequin fetuses would be fitting allusions to the results. But remember that Exhorder demo? Guess who they ripped off on the next album?\n\nEven though Cowboys From Hell was terrible, people are stupid and many bought the album. Feeling that the next logical step for Diamond (he wasn't dimebag or dirtnap yet) Darrell and co decided to get even meaner and heavier. So they decided to listen to Exhorder's first album, take the vocals, riffs, and drumming style; but drop the Slaughter in the Vatican credo, the complex song structures, and the varying tempos and wah-la: Vulgar Display of Power. Oh yeah, they also weren't able to write coherent songs and added \"i'm angry and I was raised in a single-wide muthafucka!\" lyrics. Also every song sticks to an irritating mid-tempo groovestomp that even 2-year olds with downs can nod off to. An atrocity ensued.\n\nEver seen Gummo? Remember the redneck party that includes chair wrestling in a roach-filled kitchen? Well this music conjures that up to mind. The simple song structures that aren't much different from your standard hard rock of the time and Philip's attempts at being tough come off as well as your neighborhood wigger comes off at being ghetto. The riffs are bland and contrite. Take the most famous one from Walk. I think the sound my dish washer makes is more subtle and complex than that. Seriously it's the musical equivalent a beeping sound that you can't stop and have to endure for five minutes. Oh but remember: RE- SPECT- WALK(fuck you Anselmo). This Love has virtually no direction with the song reverting back to the acoustic part without any sense of progression. For seven minutes it's acoustic, ANGRY PART, acoustic, ANGRY PART, diamond noodling. It also boasts the worst lyrics on this piece of shit. \"As it turns out/Deeper within me/ Love was quickly twisted/and pointed at you.\" \"You keep this love, fist, scar, break\" (what?) Fucking Hostile is a fucking trainwreck with the guitars, vocals, and drums all sounding out of sync and trying to keep up with the others in pace. A fast-paced track that falls flat on its face. People who like this album don't even care about the second side of it, so neither should you. The complete lack of any inspiration is astounding on those songs. The rest of the music would be perfect for Ford Truck commercials. That big, bad gasguzzling machine needs some Neanderthals from Dallas to provide the soundtrack. One more thing, I don't give a shit how good Dimebag's leads are, nothing can save these songs from the pit of musical inferiority.\n\nThanks to this album other bands with even worse music were able to make a career by applying the formula found herein. Korn, Limp Bizkit, and Slipknot took the simplified and artificially heavy riffing and sold millions. The first roots of Deathcore can be traced to Vulgar. Disturbed loved that beeping sound on Walk so much that that they covered it. Pantera were claimed to be the defenders of metal in the 90s, but they were really the Judas Iscariots. Ripping off a genuine heavy metal band like Exhorder that didn't start out as a glam band and had no chance of mainstream success and watering it down so much that it could be theme music for monster truck rallies and inbred hillbilly hoedowns is inexcusable. Grunge might've killed metal in the mainstream in the 90s, but Pantera did irrevocable damage to the genre as a whole. Every genre that elitists love to hate (nu-metal, metalcore, and to an extent melodic death metal) owes a huge debt to Pantera. Pantera is the reason that the majority of people think that metal must be for semi-literate morons only.\n",
        "\nAmongst the metalhead community, Pantera is usually considered one of those bands for inexperienced n00bs who are just getting into the metal genre. Anyone who claims that \"Far Beyond Driven\" is one of the greatest metal albums is lowered to about the same level as those who think koRn \"used\" to be a good band and those who claim that Slayer never sold out. However, it is \"acceptable\" to consider \"Cowboys From Hell\" a good album (which it was) and a slightly smaller but still influential circle deem that finding that \"The Great Southern Trendkill\" was an unfairly overlooked and underrated album is an acceptable point of view. Personally, I don't really give a damn about following the opinions of the metal community (I think Avenged Sevenfold is metal, so what?), but I bought into the hype surrounding this album. I quickly snatched up a brand new copy of \"The Great Southern Trendkill\" in the clearance bin at a local record store (for only $5). I was quite proud of my find because at the time of the purchase, this album was out of print and not as easy to find (it has since been re-released and is readily available).\n\nIt turns out that perhaps this album was hyped a bit too much, for even though there is nowhere near as much awful \"groove\" type stuff, this isn't that \"far\" removed from the previous album. The main change is in vocalist Phil Anselmo's vocal approach. He adapts a tone more similar to what he used with Down's first album, as opposed to the fierce but also tedious yelling of \"Far Beyond Driven.\" There's also a slight decrease in the macho tough-guy posturing, but those expecting a return, lyric-wise and vocal-wise, to the \"Cowboys\" days will be disappointed.\n\nThe album actually starts off in great fashion with the title track, featuring yells from Anal Cunt's Seth Putnam. Dimebag has a couple of good riffs and has a decent solo at the end where he actually shreds, although he drags and plods a bit by repeating himself for the second half of the solo. This is probably the last heavy Pantera song that can be considered \"very good\" (I would hesitate to call it \"great\"). Also, we have an amazing, oft-overlooked acoustic song in \"Suicide Note Pt. 1.\" The atmosphere of this song is just so intense; it's a shame that Pantera did not try something like this again, choosing instead to pursue mindless heaviness. What's even worse is that part two of this song is just awful. It borders on noise and is one of the worst songs on the album, completely destroying the atmosphere and feeling of part one. \n\nDimebag continues his descent into obscurity throughout \"The Great Southern Trendkill.\" With the exception of the title track, Dimebag's solos are pretty much effects and screeches, which are more boring than anything else. The riffs are mostly stale and one has to wonder whether the lackluster guitar work, both on rhythm and lead, is a result of misguided actual effort or just laziness. Dimebag has shown that he has the talent, but his often mediocre work keeps otherwise decent songs like \"10's\" and \"Drag the Waters\" from taking off.\n\nI guess for fans of metal that seek only loud music to bang one's head to, this might be a worthwhile purchase, but even then there are better albums out there that achieve similar and/or even better results. For the standard non-Pantera-fanboy metalhead, this will probably be at the same level as the albums that bookend \"The Great Southern Trendkill.\" The best bet is to download the title track and the first \"Suicide Note\" part on Itunes or some similar program. For those who are a bit more curious, feel free to search bargain bins everywhere, but your money is best spent elsewhere.\n",
        "\nPantera's The Great Southern Trendkill is a very interesting record. Its similar to their earlier records but unlike Cowboys From Hell, Vulgar and Far Beyond Driven it has only one bad track. Its an evolution of Pantera's earlier sound and its the only album they nail perfectly. It's got fast and aggressive, slow and grinding and even the experimental tracks sound great.\n\nThe album starts off with the title track and its a great way to start the album. It changes from grinding verses to thrashy parts that'll make you bang your head instantly. The solo is great too. Next up, its War Nerve and its a change of tempo. Its still one of the better tracks though. Drag the Waters follows, and its the only single of the album. Its good, but it drags on a minute too long.\n\n10's is next and its the only track I don't like. It sounds somewhat like the fillers off of Far Beyond Driven but thankfully the next track, 13 Steps, makes up for it. After it, the Suicide Note part 1 and 2 come up. The former is a ballad and the latter is Pantera's most aggressive song ever. It starts off really fast and later it slows down to a sludgy ending. Great stuff. Hells' Wrath is the next and its one of my favourites, with good riffs and choruses, although the pause in the middle is a bit too long. Floods is next and its the second ballad, but this one's more aggressive and has Dimebag's best solo which really suits the track. The album ends with the pair - The Underground in America and Sandblasted skin, both of which have good riffs and the latter is my favourite off the album. Fast drumming, death growls and killer riffs. Great way to end the album.\n\nI've saved the best for the last. Phil Anselmo's vocals here are his greatest ever. Here he has perfected his growling vocals, and even does a few black metal screeches on the faster tracks and never sounds annoying, unlike on VDoP and FBD. In my opinion, if it weren't for his vocals this would have been an above average album. His work makes the songs have more variety and stop the album from sounding monotone. In addition to that, the lyrics on this album are much better than those on earlier albums.\n\nIn conclusion, this is Pantera's best album and one of the best groove metal albums, and I recommend it to any metal fans.\n",
        "\nFollowing his departure from Judas Priest, Rob Halford seemed to be just everywhere during the mid-90's. He replaced Ronnie James Dio for a few Black Sabbath concerts when everyone's favorite elf refused to open for a certain Ozzy Osbourne and also released two studio albums and an EP as the leader of the thrash/groove metal tinged Fight. And as a special treat for the \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\" movie soundtrack, Halford got together with the members of Pantera and recorded this interesting single.\n\nMusically, the song's style is pretty much what you already expect it to sound like: Rob Halford singing for Pantera. The riffs churned out by Dimebag Darrell and Rex Brown are packed with plenty of mid-tempo grooves, Halford's signature wail soars at a high pitch during the verses and turns into a lower pitched bark during the choruses, and Phil Anselmo manages to contribute some backing vocals from time to time with his controversial sandpaper yells. In fact, this sounds a lot like something Fight would've done. It's a little more raw than anything on \"War of Words,\" but it wouldn't sound too out of place on that particular album. Kinda makes one wonder why it wasn't remastered along with the rest of Halford's solo material...\n\nAs much as I can enjoy \"Cowboys From Hell\" and \"Vulgar Display of Power,\" one has to admit that this song may be the best thing that the boys in Pantera have ever been a part of. Bringing Halford in to collaborate with the band seems to brought some control into the songwriting process and successfully downplays several of the flaws pointed out by most metalheads when listening to Pantera's regular albums. The guitar riffs still go at that signature Pantera mid-tempo pace, but they seem to be a little tighter in their execution than usual and Dimebag's guitar squeals show a little more restraint whenever they pop up. The lyrics also show a little more subtlty than anything Anselmo than ever put to paper and feature some cryptic but cool phrases. I even like the dramatic effect that Anselmo's backing vocals bring during the song's choruses; say what you will about his leading abilities, but his howls are pretty effective when placed in the background...\n\nIf there's one thing that you can get out of listening to this, it's the persisting question of why they didn't go further with the idea than a mere single. Much like Halford's very brief stint in Sabbath, it would've been really cool to see a full-length album come out of this. It sure as hell would've been better than anything on \"Far Beyond Driven...\"\n\nPros:\n1) Halford's songwriting skills bring a little more organization to the famously sloppy Pantera\n2) The riffs are tight and the vocals sound great\n3) The lyrics are interestingly written\n4) Phil Anselmo makes a good backing vocalist\n\nCons:\n1) Some listeners are bound to be still irritated by the groovy riffs and the mere presence of Anselmo.\n2) Why the hell didn't they make a full-length album out of this?!\n",
        "\nIn the golden years of the 1980\u2019s Pantera produced 4 albums to the Metal world. The band\u2019s sub-genre in Metal in those days was more Heavy / Glam and sometimes was recognized as Speed Metal, unlike their era in the 90\u2019s which went to more Thrash / Sludge Metal. Unfortunately, Pantera in the beginning of the 1990\u2019s decided to disavow their 80\u2019s heritage and start out fresh with a more heavy sound and a new meaning. But, aside from that, the main focus of this review will be on their second album, Projects In The Jungle from their classic \u2013 older era which was mainly influenced from Kiss and Van Halen, but with a much heavier approach.\n\nThe album\u2019s music is everything for the Hair / Glam / Heavy metal fans of the 80\u2019s can hope for. In general the music is heavy and melodic that can sweep the listener off his feet. It\u2019s got power that reminds sometimes of Judas Priest and the older era of Accept. For the fans of Dimebag Darrel (R.I.P), which then was called by his Glam name Diamond, can expect an excellent treat with high pitched, fast, melodic and crushing solos that cannot be heard on the band\u2019s 90\u2019s albums. One example is the instrumental track that emphasizes Darrel\u2019s abilities with melodic solos of the 80\u2019s era. In the rhythm section, both Darrel and bassist Rex Brown work with good synergy, producing the melodic sound of true Heavy / Glam Metal. Loud high pitched and melodic vocals can also be found from the first class, Terrence Lee, aka Terry Glaze , that in some parts gives the screams of Judas Priest\u2019s Rob Halford but with much less a Metallic voice. Lee\u2019s voice contributes the music, in the more Glamish songs, the little touch of sleaziness and mostly the expression of emotions like in the songs \u201cTaking My Life\u201d, \u201cIn Over My Head\u201d. The pace by Vinnie Paul gives the music a large part of its power with crushing snare and fast pace double base that sounds like early Def Leppard and Accept.\n\n\nGenerally, all the songs in the album are good but Projects In The Jungle offers some standout classics like \u201cAll Over Tonight\u201d, which has also a video , maybe the only one from that era of Pantera. The song is a melodic Heavy / Glam Metal, has pounding pace, heavy Guitars and catchy chorus. Another hit is the song \u201cLike Fire\u201d which really gives the real Impression of what an 80\u2019s Glam song should sound like.\u201dKillers\u201d is a fast paced, breaking track with a good speed and melodic rhythm and can easily be found in an 80\u2019s Thrash / Heavy Metal piece. \u201cIn Over My Head\u201d has a small touch of AOR with keyboards and bring out a good melodic track. Finally, the closing song of the album, \u201cTaking My Life\u201d is a well done combination of AOR and Glam Metal ballad with keyboards which provides the atmosphere with the addition of Lee\u2019s emotive voice. \n\n\nThe album, Projects In The Jungle, presents the wild Glam / Heavy Metal side of early Pantera. Some will probably say it was the worst era and some, when the band was around, probably still longed for it to come back. This Metal piece is one of the reminders of a true Metal band that changed its way to march ahead for an alternate future. For the band , the album and the two that came along after, provided a doorway to more turn away from Glam and the conclusion is already known. The most impact on the Metal world came after the band\u2019s decision in 1992 to disavow their earlier albums in the 80\u2019s and to put an end to a legacy.\n",
        "\nThis is the album that represents the realization of one part of the Pantera evolution, as this album is a mix of the glam elements of their (hidden and forbidden) past and their \"heavee as fuk\" future.\n\nTo me, this is the best of their \"major label\" releases. I have little knowledge of their past other than a few tracks off \"Power Metal\" (which I enjoyed). I'll admit, what makes this album took a very long time for me to catch onto. When I first heard this record in 1990, I wrote it off as a watered down version of what I was already listening to and, while knowing of their glam past, wondered more about what direction they would go in from there. \n\nIt was, in fact, the direction they took forward that makes this album the stand out of their (known to all) catalogue.\n\nThose of us who remember the 80's remember that glam was best summed up by the Poison singing \"don't need nothin' but a good time.\" While there are some sonic elements that are reminiscent of their glam days (some drum fills here and there, the ending to \"Shattered\" and the 2nd main riff in \"The Art Of Shredding\" struck me instantly) perhaps the overriding \"glam\" aspect of this record is the fact that the boys set out to make a \"fun\" record. This album doesn't beat you between the eyes and, unlike later efforts, doesn't try to. This isn't groundbreaking stuff here by any means, just a fun record and an enjoyable listen.\n\nYes, there are some good, good tunes on here and there are some lesser lights as well. Personally, when I listen to this album, I skip \"Medicine Man\" and \"Message In Blood\" entirely while listening to \"Primal Concrete Sledge\" and \"The Sleep\" every single time for one simple reason. If you eliminate the two tracks I skip when I listen to this record, you have an album that flows as well as any record ever made by a metal band...to the point where some lesser songs end up sounding better as part of the whole than they do on their own.\n\nPantera really had an opportunity to carve itself a different kind of niche with its \"power groove\" sound, however chose to trade in much of this album's technicality and \"good time\" vibe in an attempt to be the \"most baddest of the bad asses\" on the block. While I won't reflect on that here, what I will offer in conclusion is that this album breaks no new ground and probably never really intended to, however this is just a fun and enjoyable album to listen to every so often and, yes, it is a shame they forgot about the \"fun\" part of their sound moving forward\n",
        "\nUndisputably a very influental album, \u201dCowboys From Hell\u201d is often remembered as one of the foundations of groove metal, and thus, metalcore, and some criticize Pantera for popularising the style of metal that they claim to have started the modern metalcore trend, which is generally disliked by metalheads. However, Pantera influences can be found from rather surprising albums, such as Symphony X:s \u201dParadise Lost\u201d, where Michael Romeo's guitar rhythms are like a proggier version of Dimebag's, and Russel Allen sounds like an even more versatile Phil Anselmo. Similarities can be found from contemporary albums aswell, especially in the groove metal genre, but even albums such as \u201dPainkiller\u201d by Judas Priest. It can be argued that \u201dCowboys From Hell\u201d started, or at least led, a new movement of metal in the 90s, which ended up influencing surprisingly many metal genres, as well as modern rock and post-grunge. Regardless, this album is a very controversial one among metalheads, which is strange considering how average and inoffensive it actually is.\n\nCertainly a turn in musical direction, Pantera's near-legendary groove metal album is catchy, heavy and very riff-based, with Dimebag and his groovy rhythm riffs as well as solos astounding in how technical they are. Phil Anselmo's vocals, too, also of great technical ability, are an important part of this album's sound: ranging from sandpaper-throated fry-grunts to soaring falsetto (implementing Anselmo's huge vibrato) and the middle ground between these, a melodic type of half-growled shouting, Anselmo's aggressive style of singing is a definitive trademark of the sound Pantera is known for. The rest of the band assumes a much more minor role, but both the bassist and the drummer do play a role in defining the sound of \u201dCowboys From Hell\u201d. There is a prominent thrash metal influence here, or at least it's clear that Pantera derived their sound on \u201dCowboys From Hell\u201d from thrash metal to a noticeable extent, but Dimebag's guitar rhythms are by far more groovy than most thrash, and as a result, much simplier and possibly not quite as energetic, giving the album a funkish vibe at times. Using downtuned start-stop rhythm guitar riffs, the songs are mostly mid-paced, well-flowing pieces of constant head-nodding and foot tapping. However, while technically very impressive, Dimebag's leads and solos often fail to seem related enough to the rest of the music, making the so much acclaimed and praised shred moments seem rather disappointing. Since the music isn't as fast or energetic as thrash metal often is, the solos that utilize the mood and feeling of the songs, like in \u201dCemetery Gates\u201d, work much better than extremely fast shredding. Sadly, Dimebag was never the most emotional of guitarists, making most leads and solos appear either awkward or rather misplaced in their context. Each solo seems like a mandatory kind of thing that just had to be implemented due to Dimebag's phenomenal shred skills, not really caring whether it improves the song and elaborates its themes further or simply is there just for the sake of it \u2013 the solos often interrupt the songs and make them seem badly constructed, but thankfully, the flow is quite excellent as long as Dime sticks to his rhythm guitar riffs.\n\nCertainly the grooviest and catchiest song on the album, \u201dCowboys From Hell\u201d invitingly opens the album. Abound in simple start-stop riffs and groovy rhythms, it's an excellent opener as it describes the overall mood and the attitude of the music: energetic, masculine and aggressive. \u201dPrimal Concrete Sledge\u201d implements even more aggressive and hardcore-influenced moods and influences, where as \u201dCemetery Gates\u201d is a much grander and more dramatic song, though it lacks much of the epicness that ballads require. \u201dDomination\u201d features some of the best riffs on the album, and coincidentally (or not), it's the most thrashy song on the album. The album is full of different styles and moods, which brings some much needed variety to it. At times, the music is aggressive, volatile and very brash, and at others it's hard-rocking and almost laid-back in nature. Sadly, while there's potential for a very interesting listening experience on the album, the production causes everything to sound tame, docile and monotonous. While the production is tight and clean, the sound really lacks life and colour, making the music tedious and plodding even at its most energetic. The music itself never stoops to the level of uninspiredness that metalcore is known for, but it often sounds equally tedious \u2013 though not quite as watered-down, over-theatrical (or prententious) and bland \u2013 because of the weak production, simplicity and too much focus on Dimebag's guitars. The music does become fully insipid drivel at some points, like in \u201dThe Sleep\u201d, mostly due to riffs greatly lacking in taste, making this album not only rather boring in nature, but also quite inconsistent.\n\nThough quite catchy and fun, the music doesn't really grab the listener's attention. It doesn't cause uncontrollable headbanging, nor is there enough emotion or atmosphere to make the music otherwise compelling or interesting enough. The album has a lot of potential, and the performances here are certainly those of very skillful musicians, Dimebag's in particular, but it hardly rises above the average metal album when it comes to artistic expression (unless expressing tough guy attitude counts, since that is pretty clearly elaborated here), or even merely good composing. Indeed, \u201dCowboys From Hell\u201d comes greatly short of being outstanding, let alone a masterpiece, but it's a fun album to listen to regardless for more open-minded fans of metal, as well as all fans of energetic and heavy kinds of music. A decent if a little inconsistent piece of metal that most fans of the genre should be able to enjoy, for those who are looking for something really catchy, aggressive, and particularly groovy in the rhythm section, \u201dCowboys From Hell\u201d is quite essential.\n",
        "\nPantera's \"Official Live: 101 Proof\" is one of the finest examples of what made Pantera one of the greatest heavy metal bands of all time, not to mention a killer live act. The album captures in spades all the energy and intensity of a live Pantera show, featuring stellar performances from each member of the band. One of the most redeeming qualities of this album are early Pantera classics (off of \"Cowboys From Hell\" and \"Vulgar Display of Power\") given steroid injections via Dimebag's updated and far more brutal guitar work (circa 1996), resulting in much heavier versions than the originals. \n\nThe previous reviewers are right to point out that this album is not recorded from one solitary show. If the album was recorded poorly and/or felt disjointed I would hold this fact against the album. However, the production here is among the finest of any live recording I have ever heard, and the transitions between songs from different shows are both smooth and coherent. The tracklisting of any live show is going to disappoint some fans, but the selection of tracks here shouldn't surprise anyone seeing as they are all staples of a Pantera show (\"Angel of Death\" is an obvious choice for Slayer, but we would all be pissed if they didn't play it, right?). Granted, it would be cool to hear some of the lesser played Pantera tunes like \"Heresey\" or \"Throes of Rejection,\" but their absence doesn't detract from the album.\n\nWhile there are many subtle live variations throughout, the standout (and most obvious) tracks are the combination of Domination and Hollow, and the chorus riff from Ted Nugent's \"Cat Scratch Fever\" thrown into \"Cowboys from Hell.\" Phil Anselmo's rants between songs are another great addition to the album, not only because they are hilarious but because they fit perfectly with the spirit and attitude of a Pantera show. \n\nThe final two tracks, recorded in the studio, are as strong as any Pantera material around. These are definitely not b-sides by any means. Had Pantera decided to record another studio album between \"The Great Southern Trendkill\" and \"Reinventing the Steel\" these would have no doubt been on it. Be forewarned: Dimebag's solo on \"I Can't Hide\" will make you shit your pants. \n\nIn the end, if you dislike live records and/or Pantera, don't bother with this album. However, if you want to hear some of the most brilliant, innovative, and downright heavy guitar work ever, get this album. Don't let jack-asses who are more concerned with Pantera's success than their music get in the way of listening to metal of the highest order. \n\n--DIMEBAG FOREVER--\n",
        "\nPantera. The mere utterance of this word among a group of metalheads can either spawn a multitude of comments of how they were awesome, amazing etc... or it could do the opposite and invoke the wrath of many anti-Pantera metalheads. Most Pantera fans point out Vulgar Display of Power as the high point of their career, where they finally shed all all their melody in favor of a more straight forward and \u201ctough\u201d sound. Detractors of this album claim the exact opposite. They believe that this is the album where Pantera \u201csold out\u201d etc... going as far as to claim that this album \u201ckilled thrash.\u201d Honestly speaking, that is probably the most hilarious thing I've ever read in my entire life. An album killing an entire genre? Give me a break. I'm not going to dwell on that further, though. This IS a review of an album, after all.\n\nBefore I continue, I must confess that there was a time when I hated this album with a passion. This was one of the first metal albums I heard after being introduced to the genre via Iron Maiden, and I hated it. It took me more than 2 years to fully grasp what this album was about, and why it could be so highly praised by the \u201cmetal press.\u201d \n\nOn Vulgar Display of Power, Pantera set out to push their newly discovered sound further into uncharted territory. In order to do develop your sound and define a genre, it is imperative that you shed some of the \u201cexcess baggage.\u201d Slayer did that with \u201cReign In Blood\u201d, Anthrax did that with \u201cAmong the Living.\u201d Hell, even Iron Maiden did that in \u201cThe Number of the Beast\u201d. Pantera did the same here; they discarded a lot of the things that made Cowboys From Hell what it was. They weren't \u201cselling out\u201d here, they were simply pushing their sound further, pushing the groove metal sound further. The riffs are no doubt simpler and the tempo is definitely slower, but I ask why is that a problem? The same people that worship Black Sabbath songs like \u201cThe Wizard\u201d and \u201cEvil Woman\u201d hate the songs like \u201cWalk.\u201d \n\nWith the exception of the aforementioned song, the songs here aren't exactly very catchy. Being catchy was probably the last thing on the band's mind when they were recording this album. The songs on this album are the complete opposite of what the masses' concept of \u201ccatchy\u201d is. The songs here are extremely hard to get into and understand, but they are extremely good at doing something else. VDoP focuses on the slow outtake of aggression, as silly as it may sound. The simple riffs, coupled with Anselmo's hate filled (yet somewhat irritating) screaming (death metal vocals? Hah!) creates a genuinely crushing atmosphere. While thrash metal bands usually featured fast songs with a no-holds-barred approach on their albums, Pantera did the opposite, while at the same time using (simplified) thrash metal riffs. Not all the songs are slow, though. There are two notable up-tempo tracks here, \u201cRise\u201d and \u201cFucking Hostile\u201d, and the position of the tracks couldn't have been better. I don't know any better way to describe the effect it has on the overall sound, so I'll describe it this way: conserve-conserve-conserve-ATTACK!-conserve-conserve-ATTACK!\n\nA lot of the riffs here are the usual \u201cchug-chug\u201d riffs but they often make way for an infectious groove to slip into the music, which succeeds at drawing an unaware listener further into the music. The first two songs and the second-to-last track show this aspect of the music very well. The drums are extremely simple, and a little more variation and a better overall performance would have contrasted well with the riffs. I don't have much to say about the solos, because I don't know an awful lot about guitar solos and that stuff, but I seem to enjoy them, so yeah.\n\nThe two main problems I have with this album is that 1.) Anselmo's vocals are extremely irritating at times, but I think that with enough patience most people would be able to get used to it. And 2.) The bass is hardly audible, and can only be heard when Dimebag releases one of his earth shattering solos, which is a real pity because the bass could have really added to the crushing tone of this album.\n\nOverall, this album is probably the best album Pantera have ever released. It's extremely consistent, and shits on most groove metal albums. This album is not a thrash metal album, so if you listen to this expecting a truckload of riffs and fast songs, you're going to be extremely disappointed. This is a groove metal album, and hence should be treated as one. And considering that this is a groove metal album, it's damn good.\n",
        "\nJudging on the band\u2019s previous two efforts (Projects in the Jungle especially) Pantera have proven themselves capable of writing damn good 80s glam metal songs, as well some pretty killer speed metal as well. Annoyingly, they\u2019ve also proven themselves capable of writing really awful ballads that sound exactly the same and are just there for the sake of having ballads. It was this single flaw that prevented the previous album from achieving a near-perfect score. The production was great, the instrumentation was great, the good songs were great. The ballads were the concrete shoes that forced the album to drown in a sea of tedious mediocrity.\n\nWith \u201cI Am The Night\u201d, the band have clearly come to their senses, sat down and pulled their shit together and release a full blown highly consistent heavy metal album. And have they succeeded? Well, upon close observation I\u2019m delighted to discover they have.\n\nI would like to point out at this point that I love glam. My Winger records sit happily next to Wintersun\u2019s in my collection, as is the way they should. It\u2019s marvellous. Even if I wasn\u2019t such a glam fanatic though, I don\u2019t imagine I\u2019d like this album any less. Oh, it\u2019s certainly glam, but speed metal songs like \u201cDown Bellow\u201d with it\u2019s hard hitting thrashy riffs, and the awesome power metal number that is \u201cValhalla\u201d make the album worthy for anyone who likes a bit of good old fashioned headbanging steel. And then there\u2019s the title track; what a riff! The late Diamond Darrel treats us to a few seconds of his killer fast shredding that he\u2019d later become famous for, before bursting into a vicious speed metal riff, that develops into the heaviest song on the album, and easily the most evil sounding thing they\u2019ve done up till this point (and would do for a good few years yet) with it\u2019s fun shout along choruses. I AM THE NIGHT!\n\nFor the more casual glam metal fan, there\u2019s material here for you as well. The opener track \u201cHot and Heavy\u201d is easily in my mind a glam metal classic, had it been heard by the right people, it may have got the attention it deserved. The whole song is memorable and catchy, and despite the cheesy lyrics at some parts (\u201cTake a look at my ice-cream cone babe. Go ahead, take a lick.\u201d \u2013 Hey, it is glam!) it has all the makings of a killer heavy metal anthem. Don\u2019t forget to check out the video for this on YouTube. \u201cCome-On Eyes\u201d is another fun glam track. It doesn\u2019t have quite the impact of the first one, but it\u2019s certainly worth a listen.\n\nVirtually everything is an improvement over the previous album, and aside from the severe case of balled abuse, that album was already very very good. The production here is pretty much what you\u2019d expect for an album of this style and era, and it does the job very nicely. Terry\u2019s vocals had already taken a huge step forward over \u201cMetal Magic\u201d on the previous album, and here things are even better; this time sounding like a cross between Rob Halford\u2019s falsetto \u201cPainkiller\u201d-style shrieks and AC/DC\u2019s Brian Johnson, maybe with a bit of Dee Snider and Vince Neil thrown in as well. A great combination, I must say.\n\nMy biggest beef with the previous album however was the fact that they filled up what was otherwise a brilliant album with a bunch of lame ballads. This was like baking a perfectly lovely cheesecake, and then topping it with Marmite. Happily, with the bands third effort, the ballad is made of nice fresh strawberries. And it is just a ballad, as opposed to three of the sodding things (Three!! If you added all the ballads of the first two Poison albums together, you\u2019d still be one less), and I\u2019m happy to say that it\u2019s a winner. Terry sings the whole thing in falsetto Darrel\u2019s guitar work is done perfectly; it gives off a great atmosphere and sticks in your head. This is what a ballad should be like, not those three identical pieces of crap that haunted the previous album.\n\n\u201cI Am The Night\u201d is easy one of the greatest releases of 1985, and runs rings around M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce\u2019s album of the same year. There is a throwaway track by the name of \u201cD*G*T*T*M\u201d bit this is merely a little instrumental thrown in for reasons I don\u2019t know, so it\u2019s not really fair to deduct much points from the album because of that. I guess \u201cDaughters of the Queen\u201d and \u201cRight on the Edge\u201d can get a bit boring at times and could be seen as filler, but really, now I\u2019m just nitpicking \u2013 they\u2019re still pretty cool songs. Fans of Skid Row, Twisted Sister and the earlier works of M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce and 80s metal fans in general can find something to love about this album, and should without hesitation download it or buy a bootleg over Ebay or something, as I\u2019ve seen original copies of the album up for bid at over \u00a3150\u2026\n\nIt\u2019s such a sad thing that this great album never truly reached the audience it deserved, as these days most of the people that give this \u2013 and the other Pantera releases of the 1980s \u2013 are angsty groove metal \u201ctough\u201d guys, who will see pictures of the band at this time and make their decisions then and there. If this album had just got a bit more promotion, a bit more attention, it wouldn\u2019t have gone down in history as an embarrassing past for a band, but as what it truely is; a no nonsence, balls out, headbanging, pure heavy metal album.\n\nPlease Pantera, do the right thing and re-release your past 80s gems. The world already knows they exist, so why keep pretending that they don\u2019t?\n",
        "\nSo this is where Pantera started out as a band. This is way back in 83 when glam was just starting to become a mainstream force. This album is pure glam with the occasional speed metal moments which are present in both I'll Be Alright and Metal Magic. This album is pretty cheesy even for glam. This is no Projects From the Jungle more to less Power Metal. \n\nWhat this album sounds like is a second rate Poison/Bon Jovi fusion. So for those who do not like either band, you will probably hate this album, as evident with the amount of shit it has gotten from both metalheads and Pantera fanboys alike. However, if you're like me, and absolutely love 80s hair metal, you'll at least dig this. For a glam album, it's pretty consistent, though at times it does get rather bland.\n\nThe main thing that holds this album back (for me anyway) is the production. The sound is just too raw and unpolished. For a thrash album, this kind of production would be great, but this is 80s glam, and therefore, it just doesn't sound right. \n\nThe best songs on this album would be Ride My Rocket, Tell Me If You Want It, I'll Be Alright, and Metal Magic. The first two mentioned songs are very catchy and upbeat rockers. Ride My Rocket is pretty up tempo, but doesn't qualify as speed metal, because of the lack of riffs. The last two mentioned tracks, however, are two awesome speed metal songs, that would eventually influence the rest of their career as musicians. Metal Magic is probably the closest to thrash that this album gets, and sounds like total Judas Priest worship though with cheesy lyrics. They would do this speed metal number even better on their next album, Projects in the Jungle.\n\nHowever, there are two songs here that bring the score down a bit. These are the last two tracks, Sad Lover and Rock Out. Both songs are rather dull and generic glam songs, and Rock Out tends to get a bit boring at times. These songs aren't really bad, but there just pretty avarage for glam standards.\n\nFor the most part, this album is pretty consistent. However, I can't really picture anyone outside of glam metal fans that would appreciate this album. If you're into thrash, stay away from this album, you'll hate just about every moment of it, outside of the title track. If you're a Pantera fan, you might want to give this a listen to see how the band started out. However, if you're an 80s glam fan, I'd recommend this you, especially if you're into Poison or Ratt. This album is pretty much impossible to find at a reasonable price, so just download it instead.\n",
        "\nDun dun DUDUDUDUNN, I\u2019m BROOOOOKENNNN! Yep, its time to crack open an MGD and party like it\u2019s 1994. I would crack open a PBR, but that swill gives me the shits.\n\nSo in these dark days of Canadian bacon-blasting death metal, rawer than your knees after a visit to the rectory Black Metal, and more polished than yer knob metalcore, it\u2019s easy to lose sight of how many of us got into the genre in the first place. Sure, some metalheads were born in 1498 and were rocking to the brutal drumming in \u201cSpace truckin\u2019\u201d while sporting a Mot\u00f6rhead shirt, some were born several years later and watched Lars Ulrich get burped by his mother in Fort Lauderdale, and then there\u2019s the kids who just graduated from emo to the big leagues and seem to have the harshest criticism for bands that aren\u2019t \u201cmetal\u201d enough. But right in between there is a generation of youngsters who grew up on \u201cMaster of puppets,\u201d \u201cDoggystyle,\u201d and \u201cFar beyond driven.\u201d It is for these folks that I will now review the \u201cSouthern Dallas cowboys\u2019 greatest fuckin\u2019 hits and racial slurs and heroin overdoses and shit\u201d album.\n\nNot that I\u2019m one of those people, mind you.\n\nSure, I grew up in that timeframe where Pantera and Metallica would have been appealing to me, but I\u2019m ashamed to announce that I was very much into punk and really didn\u2019t see what all the fuss was about. Then a little album called \u201cSoulless\u201d came along and changed my life, but that\u2019s a whole different story. Basically, I went right into extreme metal snob mode and missed out on those transition bands that bring so many into the fold. I\u2019m rediscovering some of them now, and they do supply some nice easy-listening when I\u2019ve had enough Hypokras for the day.\n\nWhat does all this personal history garbage have to do with Pantera? Nothing, really. Just an over-long intro to a review about a greatest hits albums full of songs that most people already know. Why review a greatest hits album of a band who went to number one in the charts? Why bother releasing this in the first place? If someone\u2019s even a mild Pantera fan, they\u2019ve got all these tracks already. Is it the dreaded CASHGRAB?\n\nI\u2019d say not. It seems to be a nice cherry-pickin\u2019 of what Pantera\u2019s put out over the years. Let\u2019s face it, there\u2019s a whole lotta filler on every one of the Greatest New Jersey Child Pornographers\u2019 albums, so it\u2019s nice to cut right through the dross and get to the singles. Of course, there\u2019s some filler on this one too (please stop covering Black Sabbath, PLEASE), but it saves the skip button some exercise. Plus they throw in a bonus DVD of Pan\u2019tera Patrick\u2019s greatest beer bonging groove metal urinary tract infection videos, most of which look like they were filmed at the same concert.\n\nDoes this sound appealing to you yet? No? Well, take into consideration that I got it for free. There ya go. If you have moderate nostalgic erection for das half-metal of the 90\u2019s, find the Halford scream in \u201cCemetary gates\u201d funny every time, and can get this fucker for free, do so. If not, just buy a few six packs of cheap beer, put on all of your Pantera albums on shuffle with the skip button at the ready, and use your vivid imagination to create tuff guy videos in your mind. Then smoke weed, do heroin, and avoid ex-Marines.\n\n7 greatest anal screwdriving funky bunch southern fried vulgar displays of bird ownership out of 10\n\nNB: Surprise surprise, there ain\u2019t any shit from their glam metal days on here.

        "\nI can tell you with utmost confidance that this is the EXACT point where Pantera sold out. Cowboys From Hell was great, despite the obvious direction it was heading in. I remember I used to listen to this and Far Beyond Driven when I was 14, and I thought it was the heaviest thing around. After less than a year, it grew old. I discovered death metal and black metal, started listening to true thrash as well, and this sounded fake by comparison. I will maintain that Pantera have only done 2 good albums, and they were Power Metal and Cowboys From Hell. Everything else blew balls because it was too commercial. \n\nI'm sure you know what the music sounds like, but if you don't, it's basically a tuff guy shouting over dull groove riffs and dumbed down drumming. The bass is inaudible, and I'm sure Rex was only there for the money. Gone are the searing riffs, gone are the ear piercing screams, and gone is the double bass heavy drumming of the past. \n\nLots of people claim this is where Pantera got good, and will hail this and Far Beyond Driven as the pinnacle of Pantera's thrash. Well, first off, this isn't thrash. It's thrashy, but do not confuse thrashy with thrash. Slipknot is thrashy, but they are not thrash by any stretch of the imagination (nor are they metal, as you all know.) This is a member of a genre I have grown to hate, groove metal. Everybody knows how many thrash bands quit innovating and quit shredding when it ceased to be cool to do so and started grooving. Grooving is a code word for writing uninspired one string riffs that are fun to play for a few seconds while you're fucking around in a jam session, but are pretty much useless for anything else. \n\nNow, I will devote a special section of this to Walk. FUCK THAT SONG. The most overplayed, overrated, and shitty song Pantera ever made. At least on future releases they managed to have SOME kind of complexity. This is 0-0-1-0-0-0-1-0-0-0-1-0-0 repeat. That's not a riff. That's dinking around on the lowest string. That's numetal territory. Even Got The Life by Korn has a better riff than that. And the drumbeat is no worse. Unlike, say, Stengah by Meshuggah, where it's excusable because the drumming saves it, the drumming does no such service here. Here it's all basic 6/8 stuff even a novice could do. What really pisses me off about this whole affair is that I KNOW Darrell Abbott and co. are clearly capable of better. I know Vinnie Abbott can drum better, or at least catchier beats, I know Darrell Abbott can come up with better riffs, and I KNOW Phil Anselmo is capable of better singing than this. This is that strained \"tuff guy\" singing that everybody from Trivium to Annihilator does nowadays, and it's such a shit way of singing. If you're gonna sing, sing right. If you're gonna growl, growl. But don't do this halfsies shit. Such a fucking waste of talent. \n\nNow that I'm through ranting about Walk, that above paragraph pretty much applies to the whole album. Oversimplistic shit riffs, oversimplistic shit singing, oversimplistic shit drumming, and inaudible bass that might as well be oversimplistic and shit. Notice a common theme here? I have never seen such an outbreak commercialis selloutus before or so clearly defined. They clearly traded good riffs and good songs for fame and fortune. Maybe they decided that it took too much effort to write good songs, so they decided to halfass it. While this isn't nu-metal, it so clearly influenced nu-metal that it might as well be nu-metal, much as how although Iron Maiden weren't power metal, they so clearly influenced power metal to such a high degree they might as well be power metal. The only difference is that power metal is fucking awesome, and nu-metal is fucking shit. So guess where that puts post-cowboys Pantera? That's right, in the fucking used bin. \n\nGuess what I did with Far Beyond Driven and Vulgar Display of Power? I sold them at Rasputin for a combined amount of 11 bucks, and bought a gram of weed and a bluntwrap with that money. And you know what? Even though I'm clean now and am in Narcotics Anonymous, I must say that 11 bucks was much better spent on grass, who's effects only lasted me a few hours, than the twenty something odd bucks combined I spent on those terrible CD's.\n",
        "\nThis album is currently in my personal list of the most hated metal albums ever. And why? Because it was absolutely essential to the creation of the so-called groove metal genre, which now, with metalcore, dominates today's metal scene. Nevertheless, Pantera still is a respectable name within the \u201ctrue metal\u201d community (other bands that play groove metal, like Machine Head, are often neglected within it), mainly thanks to the extraordinary talent of the guitar player Dimebag Darrel, who, as everyone know, died some years ago. \u201cCowboys from Hell\u201d is generally considered as the pinnacle of Pantera's career. But, hey, is this album good? Is this album the classic that many say it is?\n\nNo, no, no.\n\nThis ISN'T good, goddamn. This is like Metallica's \u201cBlack Album\u201d mixed with some thrash/power influences and the result is a very divergent and inconsistent record. Anyways, there are some redeeming factors here.Darrel's riffs are quite decent for those who like groovy rhytms and such.The drumming is also pretty good, Vinnie Paul is a very very competent drummer, sometimes overusing the double bass drums, but that's a minor issue after all. That vocalist is a problem though. Phil Anselmo had the potential to become a good (if not great) metal singer, if he used his falsetto a bit more instead of trying to sound like a very strong and tough guy. He is absoluteyl terrible when trying to sound aggressive. He sometimes even reminds of me of some hardcore/metalcore vocalist. Fuck.\n\nLet's get to the songs now. They are divided into three categories: the good, the average and the weak. First: the good... \u201cDomination\u201d is the best song of the album. Headbangable, fast and featuring that vocals that, for once, fit the atmosphere, yeah! Its doomy outro is excellent too and so is the solo, which is accompanied by some tasteful bass lines. If I had to pick up some thrash songs out of \u201cCowboys from Hell\u201d, I would pick this one. \u201cShattered\u201d is also good, the chorus is catchy and it also features some very thrashy sections. Finally \u201cPsycho Holyday\u201d is good too, mainly thanks to the catchy chorus, that will remain in your head forever.\n\nNow, the average. Meh, the tittle trak is a very overrated song, I really don't get why it is considered a classic. Ok chorus, mediocre riffs, awful vocals, meh... \u201cThe Art of Shredding\u201d is a bit better, being relatively fast and carrying a nice sing-along chorus. \u201cCemetery Gates\u201d could have been a much better ballad than it is... It begins quietly with some acoustic guitar lines, but when Anselmo's vocals kick in... Man, he tries to sound very emotional and all, but he ends up sounding like a fucking copy of Corey Taylor. Emotional vocals? Heartfelt vocals? My ass! Then, the song gets heavier with a crushing guitar riff that is another reason why I don't like the song. While the riff isn't that bad, it is repeated so fucking much that I get headaches everytime I hear it now. The highlight of the track is the falsetto scream of Anselmo, near the end of the song, great great scream. Have I already mentioned that he had potential to become a much better singer? Finally, \u201cHeresy\u201d is the last average tune, its intro riff probably is the best riff of the album. The problem is that that riff is the only thing that will remain in your head after hearing the song, all the rest is very forgettable and generic.\n\nMeh, all the other songs I didn't mentioned are weak. \u201cPrimal Concrete Sledge\u201d is the weakest though. Terrible terrible song. \u201cClash with Reality\u201d is another aberration. All the rest is very bad too.\n\nSo, we have here a very weak record, very inconsistent and full of unnecessary fillers that you don't need to hear. Download \u201cDomination\u201d, \u201cShattered\u201d, \u201cPsycho Holyday\u201d, \u201cCemetery Gates\u201d and \u201cHeresy\u201d and there you go, that should have been the final tracklist of \u201cCowboys from Hell\u201d. Absolutely NOT recommended, unless you like Machine Head and those bands. Ah, and another thing... THIS IS NOT THRASH, right?\nOne final word to the production, which is pretty good, since all the instruments are audible (the bass included) and powerful.\n\nBest Moments of the CD:\n-the beginning of \u201cDomination\u201d.\n",
        "\nI like some Pantera... and I like probably 3 to 5 of the live songs on here. They pretty much threw their popular songs on this one and let it sit worthlessly on the shelf. I'm pretty sure this album was overdubbed and thrown together from several different soundboard recordings from shows. The crowd doesn't sound natural in some parts... it just seems like it's all copy and pasted together. They decide \"Hey let's do a live album.\" Maybe they should've picked the songs where Phil doesn't sound like he forgot the vocal pattern mid verse. Well, maybe these were the good picks? That wouldn't be a shocker. The two new songs aren't all that bad... but nowhere near as good as the material on The Great Southern Trendkill. The song choice is \"what you'd hear on the radio\" and Suicide Note Part 2. They played F'ing Hostile? What a surprise. So did the local radio station every damn day.\n\n\nPhil Anselmo manages to record just how terrible he was live in the mid-late 90s. I can't imagine seeing them doing this version of Strength Beyond Strength live... he sounds like vomitting from having too much whiskey is flowing out of his mouth during this song. Oh, and the mumbled verses on This Love were also a nice touch. Dimebag's riffing is pretty good and tight. Some of the solos sound completely messy while some others are dead on. As a fellow guitar player... I think he used way too much gain. Rex has some nice bass work too... Hey i'm glad I can actually hear the bass. Vinnie Paul sounds like he always does - bland, mediocre drumming with a complete lack of variation.\n\n\nOverall I think this album is just a stack of crap to make some money. The studio songs were pretty well done, considering the rest of the album. They should've just done an EP or something.\n\n\nSongs I think they should've done instead: Slaughtered, Floods, Shedding Skin, and The Great Southern Trendkill.\n\nSongs on here I actually enjoyed: Dom/Hollow, I'm Broken, Sandblasted Skin, and Suicide Note Part II, Where You Come From\n",
        "\nThis album fucking sucks.\n\nI really wish I could just write that, submit it and have it accepted. No, instead of bluntly bashing this album, I'm going to have to try to eloquently explain why I hate this album and why you should not listen to it.\n\nNow, I'm a reasonable man. I give every album I own a fair shake. If I don't like it at first, I'll give it another shot later. Usually they grow on me after some time. I've been working on Reinventing the Steel for five grueling years and I hate it more and more with time.\n\nIn fact, I hate it so much, I'm going to complain about something completely irrelevant about the album: The album cover. Seriously? A dude in boxers jumping through fire with a blurred-out bottle? It tends to remind me of that part in Full Metal Jacket where the drill instructor discusses Texas' cheif exports. This is PANTERA. I would've expected something more badass.\n\nReinventing the Steel is Pantera's fifth post-glam/half-thrash/groove/whatever-the-fuck-you-wanna-call-it album. After Vulgar Display of Power, it became abundantly clear that Pantera was running out of ideas. Reinventing the Steel is the point where the band apparently ran COMPLETELY out of ideas.\n\nI once read an interview with Dimebag Darrel about this album and he said something to the point of \"its got ten songs because we trimmed off all the fat\". Great. I can't even fucking imagine how terrible the shafted songs were after listening to boring, uninspired track after boring, uninspired track here.\n\nIts a shame, too. Pantera were always top notch musicians.\n\nAnd as great of a guitarist as he may have been, Dimebag's performance here is utter shit. The riffs are dull and forgettable. In fact, I was listening to the album five minutes ago and I still can't remember one. The guitar tone is awful as well. It sounds they were recorded underwater.\n\nVinnie Paul and Rex hold down the fort like you'd expect them to. I was not wowed by Vinnie Paul's performance here like I had been on earlier releases, though. Again, it is a shame.\n\nPhil Anselmo decided he was going to be angry some more and shout in to the microphone for forty-five minutes again. Remember when he used to be able to sing? He had a great range there, didn't he? Apparently sounding like every other hardass frontman was more important than his natural ability.\n\nReinventing the Steel pretty much sounds like a talentless wanna-be Pantera band in a crappy recording studio. Avoid it.\n",
        "\nThis is the live album that Pantera endorses. The reason I wonder if it is actually live is, 1. Pantera, at no point, gives the location, of where (or when) they are playing, and 2. There are actually two different shows being played on the same disk, but I'll delve into that later.\n\nThe song list consists of songs from Cowboys From Hell, Vulgar Display of Power, and Far Beyond Driven. Notice, no Power Metal, or anything else from their early years, in fact, the album booklet (actually a poster) doesn't even mention the albums. Nothing special about the songs here, as most of them sound like the studio versions. However, because it is a live album, they are not quite as flat (namely Walk), but that's expected when something is live.\n\nSadly, there is not enough variation of the live versions from their studio counterparts. The songs that are differnent are Walk, where the crowd finds out they are being filmed. The only real high point (in the live portion) of the album is Domination/Hollow, where Domination is cut down to the minute long base solo at the end. \n\nThen we get into the two show deal. At the beginning of \"I'm Broken\", Phil says it's the last song of the night. Well, for that show, it is. However, after it fades away, a completely different show comes in and begins Cowboys From Hell. NOT a good move in my book. If you are trying to make a live album, don't make it look like you just slopped some shit together, put pictures of yourself perfoming, and then try and call it live.\n\nMost of the other variations are just verbal rants by Phil, bragging about FBD becoming number one, and how the 'experts' don't like heavy music. Also, at the end of Cemetery Gates, it takes a full 90 seconds to try to convince their mostly angsty teen/redneck fanbase to play Fuckin' Hostile. \n\nThe album also contains two bonus songs. The first one, Where You Come From, is alright, but not memorable. Plus it tends to drag on at just over five minutes. The second song, I Can't Hide, is actually fairly good, and gives the album fairly redeemable qualities. It's a mid-fast paced tempo thrash song with bass piece in the last 20 seconds of the song. By no means is it a masterpiece, but considering some of the other stuff on here, it's pretty good. \n\nAll in all, not a good album, but considering that Vinnie and Dimebag were probably three sheets to the wind on Blacktooth Grin when producing this, it's not a bad introduction to Pantera. If you are new to metal or Pantera, or if you are one of those angsty teen/redneck fanboys I talked of earlier, get it. Otherwise, you are wasting your time.\n",
        "\nWhile it pains me to say this, this album is much less consistent than it\u2019s predecessor, \u201cMetal Magic\u201d. And while the better songs on here are of twice the quality than those of the first album, the filler on this album prevents it from earning a near perfect score.\n\nBut lets look at the good things first. The production on \u201cProjects in the Jungle\u201d is a huge improvement over the debut, which was horrible and felt really rushed. Here, the band has clearly taken some time to give it album style production, rather than the almost demo-like feel of the debut. The songs here sound crystal clear, definitely an improvement.\n\nMoving onto the music itself, some of the songs on here are absolutely amazing. The music sounds so much tighter and more professional now, with Terry Glaze really showing his capabilities as a vocalist. Diamond Darrel is really starting to pump out the riffs now as well as some great leads and solos, nicely backed by the rhythm styling of Rex and Vinnie. From the hair metal anthems of \u201cAll Over Tonight\u201d and \u201cHeavy Metal Rules\u201d to the full blown speed metal tracks like \u201cOut For Blood\u201d and \u201cKillers\u201d. Remember the track of the first album? That song was also a full-blown speed metal number held back by a crappy synth intro. The title track here has no such drawbacks, full of thrashy riffs and catchy vocal lines that you\u2019ll find yourself singing along and banging your head to the second time you\u2019ve ever heard them. Definitely the heaviest track the band have done up to this point. Also worth noting is the more mid-paced song \u201cLike Fire\u201d. While nothing particularly exciting compared the to previously mentioned songs, it is certainly undeserving of the skip button.\n\nSadly, the same can\u2019t be said for the rest of the album. Notice something missing so far from this review of a hair metal album? Yup, that\u2019s right, ballads. The previous album has one ballad, which, while slightly forgettable, wasn\u2019t completely horrible. When it came on, you found yourself thinking, \u201cOh, this is the ballad. I might skip this\u201d. On this album, that thought will enter you\u2019re mind as well. And shortly after this one will appear \u201cDidn\u2019t I just skip this song?\u201d and when you get to the last track \u201cIsn\u2019t this the same song again, except with the intro from \u201cStreet\u2019s of Rage\u201d?\u201d. Needless to say, these thoughts, and more importantly, their accompanying songs will begin to wear tedious. The skip button on you\u2019re CD player will break due to overuse. The album will slowly sink to the back of you\u2019re collection, only occasionally being taken out to listen to the good tracks, and you will have to suffer the ballads thanks to your broken button. And it\u2019s not just because they\u2019re ballads that they are crap, it\u2019s because they are the most forgettable ballads ever written. \u201c18 And Life\u201d this is not, nor \u201cHome Sweet Home\u201d, or even \u201cEvery Rose Has its Thorn\u201d. Unlike those songs, these ones won\u2019t stick in you\u2019re head. I can barely distinguish between the lot of them. The first two ballads on the album are also exactly the same length\u2026hmm\u2026\n\nThere is another song on this album, but this will merit the first assault on the skip button. It is nothing more than Diamond Darrel\u2019s attempt at Eruption. Forgettable.\n\nYou may or may not have noticed that I have actually spend more time talking about the four bad songs on here than the six good songs, which leads me neatly onto what angers me most about this album. If the band had decided to focus on writing good metal songs \u2013 a thing they clearly can do -, instead of trying to fit into the then-current trends by over loading the thing with lame ballads that all sound the same, this album would easily get a near perfect score. They could have created one of the greatest glam metal albums ever, but they didn\u2019t. They held back.\n\nSo in conclusion, I do recommend you give this album a listen, some of the songs are pure classics that the band should finally acknowledge as part of their discography just be prepared to break you\u2019re skip button, unless you like lame ballads of course\u2026\n",
        "\nAlthough that\u2019s not to say it\u2019s a bad album. Quite the contrary, Metal Magic easily shits all over Pantera\u2019s 90s material (with the soul exception of Cowboys From Hell, which, to quote hells_unicorn \u201cwas seen as an 80s album by nearly everyone\u201d), and as with all their other 80s releases, is deserving of a re-release.\n\nThe main thing that sets this back from their next three albums is without a doubt the production. There is very little depth in the guitar tone, which is often buried beneath the cheesy 80s synthesizers, which leads me neatly onto the album\u2019s other biggest problem. The synth intro to the album is annoying for two reasons: It\u2019s part of the first song, so you can\u2019t skip it to go straight into the opening track, like the nice chaps in Motley Crue let you do with their release of the same year. The title track suffers from this problem as well, which means you have to wait an annoyingly long amount of time before you can listen to what would otherwise be fine songs. Someone clearly wasn\u2019t thinking when they recorded those intros. And the second thing about them is that they just sound crap. The really sad thing is though that if the band took a bit more time to make the synths less tedious sounding, the song \u201cTell Me If You Want It\u201d could have been a much better song than it already is.\n\nFortunately the song is good enough to stand up against the poorly executed synths, and is still enjoyable to listen to. While this album\u2019s production and synths are pretty damn bad, they don\u2019t manage to cripple the entire album. Anyone who is a fan of glam can\u2019t help but enjoy fun upbeat songs such as \u201cLatest Lover\u201d, the speed metal number \u201cMetal Magic\u201d, the cheese-laden \u201cSad Lover\u201d, and even the balled \u201cThe Biggest Part of Me\u201d isn\u2019t actually completely horrible to listen to (it\u2019s synths are actually rather tastefully done, with a cheap sounding strings section sound used).\n\nAnd while the whole album is a very cheesy listen \u2013 as glam generally is \u2013 it still stands to bare the name glam METAL. Despite being fully of KISS worship, this is nowhere near the pop display of bands like Poison Bon Jovi - can you see either of those bands playing a speed metal song? -, and by no means sounds like a demo the former would have recorded, as stated by an earlier review. Terry Glaze does a pretty good job of handling the vocals, but certainly something any despiser of glam would, well, despise. He doesn\u2019t display the hard edge future vocalist Phil did during his peak (that would be his first two albums recorded with the band), but would certainly improve over time, unlike Phil, who by 1992 was putting out some of the worst vocals I\u2019ve ever heard.\n\nIf you can ignore the poor production, synths and somewhat disturbing artwork - and I know that\u2019s hard - this is actually a very consistent album. Aside from the closing track, which is a bit of a none event, there isn\u2019t really a bad song on here, although certainly nothing to special either (especially if the riffs department, not Dime\u2019s strongest effort). It\u2019s really sad to see such an enjoyable album held back by poor production and tasteless synths, as if it weren\u2019t for these this album would certainly be earning another 20 points to it\u2019s score.\n\nSo in conclusion, if it\u2019s well produced polished riff-based glam metal from 1983 you\u2019re after, go and buy Shout at the Devil instead, which in every single way Metal Magic can\u2019t hold stick to. However, if your standards are slightly lower and you just want a fun glam metal release that doesn\u2019t have the pop riddled sound of Poison, or you merely wish to here where Pantera came from, download this from an illegal P2P network now, since the band themselves are to ashamed to admit that once upon a time, they weren\u2019t the crappy groove false thrash metal band they turned out to be. Maybe one day the band will grow out of this stupidity and re-release (and in this album\u2019s case, remix and re-master as well) their releases on \"Metal Magic Records\", but until then: www.limewire.com\n",
        "\nBeing the band that essentially introduced me to metal, I\u2019ll always have a soft spot for Pantera, plain and simple. And being the first metal album I purchased, I\u2019ll always maintain a certain amount of nostalgia for Cowboys, as well, though I don\u2019t think it\u2019s Pantera\u2019s best by any means.\n\n\nIn Pantera chronology, CfH is the latter half of the band\u2019s \u201cturning point,\u201d which began with Power Metal. PM was progressively heavier than their previous independent glam releases and CfH stayed true to that form, with the band evolving into a harder, heavier sound, though not polishing it to perfection quite yet.\n\n\nAmong the (limited) negatives on this album, is that it is relatively simplistic at times and some of the tracks can seem repetitive. I don\u2019t think it would be unfair to presume that there is more filler here than any other Pantera album; certainly there\u2019s more than can be found on any of the next three. Among those \u201cfiller\u201d tracks are \u201cClash With Reality,\u201d \u201cMedicine Man,\u201d and \u201cMessage in Blood.\u201d I don\u2019t find either to be especially bad, but they certainly lack the same degree of originality that can be found elsewhere. \u201cThe Art of Shredding\u201d is another less spectacular track, though I find it\u2019s wild, winding groove riffs, especially the opening one, quite catchy.\n\n\n\u201cShattered\u201d and \u201cHeresy\u201d are, by Pantera standards anyway, purist thrash. \u201cHeresy\u201d I find less inventive, however, \u201cShattered,\u201d is a very exciting, fast-paced piece.\n\n\n\u201cPrimal Concrete Sledge\u201d is an interesting deviation from the overall sound of the rest of the album. Though its purely a groove song, it\u2019s a short (~2:00) two-part track that is isn\u2019t really comparable to anything else on CfH and is largely unspectacular but for an interesting bridge between choruses.\n\n\nSome of the stronger tracks include \u201cCowboys from Hell,\u201d \u201cPsycho Holiday,\u201d and \u201cThe Sleep.\u201d All three feature verses pronounced by characteristic Pantera walking riffs. \u201cPsycho Holiday\u201d and \u201cThe Sleep\u201d stand out for their classic Dimebag solos, highly melodic interludes to the songs\u2019 chord-driven main riffs. \u201cCowboys,\u201d the band\u2019s signature/most popular song (which I feel is unfair, as it doesn\u2019t really represent the best of their work), is a very pure groove track, with an overlooked bass performance by Rex Brown backing Darrell\u2019s riffs. The solo, though not nearly Darrell\u2019s best makes the track, in addition to its overall energy, a la Phil\u2019s \u201cheavier,\u201d less Halford-ish voals.\n\n\nThis brings me to what I pretty much consider the crown jewels of CfH, \u201cCemetery Gates,\u201d and \u201cDomination.\u201d \u201cCemetery Gates\u201d is a classic metal ballad that, while reflecting some glam characteristics, is sufficiently dark and heavy and features one of Darrell\u2019s best solos. \u201cDomination\u201d may very well be the most intriguing track on the album; more than any other song on the album, (and, perhaps more than any song, by anyone, period) it is truly a \u201cgateway\u201d song with essentially equal elements of groove and thrash. It features a couple classic Darrell solos and is probably my favorite track, lyrically, closely followed by \u201cCemetery Gates.\u201d\n\n\nAll in all, this is not Pantera\u2019s best album but it\u2019s intriguing, indeed vitally so, as a firsthand presentation of the band\u2019s transformation and the forging of the groove subgenre as a whole. There is something everyone can get a kick out of on this seminal post-thrash album.\n",
        "\nPantera is one of my favorite bands and one of the few bands that delivers some awesome kick-ass metal (others are Megadeth, Sepultura etc.). I don't really understand why so many think they're bad or so, at least here the most seems to find them good at all. Anyway, I love Pantera and here's my review and my opinions. Read it or not, it's your choice...\n\nEven though Pantera claims that \"Cowboys From Hell\" was their debut, I really think they should reconsider about using \"Power Metal\" as the official debut because it rocks. Anyway, it's not like that right now but at least we're sitting here with Pantera jewel number 2 and that's at least as great. The legendary opening \"Cowboys From Hell\" is a little swingy due to the awesome guitar riff by Mr. \"Diamond\" Darrel (which he still was here) and a really heavy backing support on bass and drums. \"Primal Concrete Sledge\" is a somewhat pretty strange song, the only thing I'm thinkin' of while hearing that one is \"huh? what's this?\". It's only a little longer than 2 minutes and really intensive. \"Psycho Holiday\", another \"hit\" that could be a headbanger's ball classic is powerful and it sure kick your ass to God's home called \"heaven\". \"Heresy\" goes through with it's thrasin' anger before it's time for the great classic \"Cemetary Gates\". This one starts off with a really beautiful acoustic intro for about 2 minutes when it suddenly goes into a heavy, awell as catchy, 5 minute long headbanger. \"Domination\", maybe a strange song at the first listenings but after you melt it down into your 3 braincells (you're a headbanger, right?) then you'll love it for eternity. The next 5 tracks are aggresive, heavy, swingin' and all but I don't have any special thoughts about these, they're all good and especially \"Shattered\" and \"The Sleep\". The final track, \"The Art Of Shredding\", is so cool. It starts off with some mid-tempo double bass drumming with a pumping bass to it before a really catchy guitar riff finally jumps into the whole thing aswell as Phil's awesome vocals.\n\nThe production, well, there's not much to say about it. It's one of most perfect, awesome and heavy produvtions I've heard. Everything's balanced and you clearly hear everything. It's not like the old mid-80's classic that sounds like a raw but pretty good rehearsal recording. They've succeeded when it comes to guitars. The guitar sound is really awesome, everything is but especially the guitars.\n\nThe cast is built on some of the greatest musicians the world has ever seen. \"Diamond\" or as I prefer, Dimebag, is phenomenal. A true genious and both his brother Vinnie and friend Rex on drums and bass respectively is really good. Phil is one of my all time favorite singers so I just give him 2 thumbs up and say \"awesome job, Phil!\".\n\nSo finally to my last comments on \"Cowboys From Hell\"...\n\nThis is one of the best albums ever, especially in the thrash history. Pantera is one of the best bands to have walked on this earth and now they're splitted up and Dimebag has left uss all tragicly but probably has a better time with all the other gods up in the heaven of rock 'n' roll!\n\nI think you should check out this masterpiece, it's a very special album from a very special band. You can watch some videos by Pantera from this release at the net, you should be able to find \"Cowboys From Hell\" and \"Psycho Holiday\" immediately if you search on the on google or youtube.\n",
        "\nThe essence of all metal is anger and if you don't have the fire inside you, then you might as well play a different type of music. I've heard albums that were a lot louder and heavier than this, but as for angrier, I can't say that I have. \n\nHere was a band that was on the verge of firing their singer who cost them their popularity on the radio and MTV because of a controversial speech he made on two separate occasions during the tour for Far Beyond Driven and was struggling with heroin addiction. In addition to the loss of commercial popularity and internal tensions, groove metal (along with death metal and funk metal) was losing popularity to the growing black metal and nu metal movements that (in most circumstances) emphasized atmosphere over actual talent and were threatening to destroy the creative bands formed in the early 90s by oversaturating the market with music that even a five-year-old could play. (Unfornately they succeeded but at least black metal evolved and nu metal died when its audience graduated high school and learned what real metal was.)\n\nPantera knew how much was on the line after almost single handedly saving metal in the early 90s along with Faith No More, Cannibal Corpse, White Zombie, and Rage Against the Machine. This precarious situation only pushed them to create their greatest album despite recording in two different studios in two different states.\n\nLyrically, Pantera grew up. Gone was the macho posturing of CfH and VDoP, as well as the self-pitying of FbD. Instead came an album full of pure focused anger. The self-pitying gave way to self-hate and that angry attitude became an opened Pandora's box of rage at the media that turned Phil into a tabloid has-been. Hell, the last two tracks seem to be tearing up the metal cliche's of the time by ripping on music videos that feature lesbians making out at wild drunken parties while vapid commercial metal plays in the background which seems to be destroying the band's own image in the name of art.\n\nEven the ballads were aggressive, dealing with subjects like suicide, the self-loathing caused by drug addiction, and praying for the end of the world via a deluge. This was just pure fucking anger that could showed how a band can be both diverse and genuinely pissed off throughout.\n\nMusically, it was also a high point, featuring both acoustic songs and the band's fastest tempos from their groove period. Not to mention the fact that there are some truly great solos on here.\n\nBasically, if you want to both see a band at their creative peak as well as actually getting more hateful as their career went on, then this is the album for you and it remains the single greatest groove metal album off all time. It's just a shame that this was followed up by they lyrically banal Reinventing the Steel.\n\nR.I.P. Dimebag Darrel\n",
        "\nAlright, first of all, let it be known that I damn-near worship Dimebag. I'm not going to start off on a rant about how I'm his biggest fan and he changed my life, but he IS my favorite guitarist (no one comes close) and he did inspire me to play guitar.\n\nThat being said, the one thing I probably hate most about this album is the guitar work. Whoah, whoah, whoah, don't crucify me yet. Hear me out. First of all, seeing as my best friend is arguably Randy Rhoads' biggest fan, I've become incredibly familier with his playing and his style. Keeping in mind that Dimebag took a lot of influence from Randy Rhoads (among other people), it's just annoying to listen to so many Rhoads-inspired riffs on this album. The riffs are definitely amazing; it's like everything Pantera's later albums weren't. Fast, technical, and aggressive. But Dimebag is my favorite because of the way HE played guitar, not because of how Randy Rhoads (or any of his other influences) played guitar, so to hear an album which is so heavily influenced by ANOTHER guitarist just sort of ruins it for me.\n\nThat brings me to my second point about the guitar work. The solos are LAME. They're fast and Dimebag definitely shows off his shredding on this album, but that's all it is: shredding (for the most part). If I want to listen to shredding, I'll pick up and Yngwie Malmsteem album or a DragonForce album (in his defense, DragonForce wasn't out yet, but still). I loved Dimebag's solos because they were so imaginitive and emotional. Cowboys from Hell, Walk, Floods, Cemetary Gates, etc. That sort of \"feeling\" I got from his later stuff (later being CFH and on) just isn't here.\n\nBUT! That's minor. Well, not minor, but it's only ONE thing to complain about. And despite some of the goodness being gone, the guitar work will still kick your ass nine ways to Sunday. I won't pretend like I listened to the bass and review it like usual. To be honest, I don't give a shit about the bass unless it's abso-fucking-lutely amazing, which Rex isn't. But he's good and it doesn't sound BAD, so I'll assume it's pretty tight with the guitar as it should be. There are a couple places where I can hear it and it's pretty cool. Some nice walking bass lines here and there.\n\nVinnie's drumming is probably the best it's ever been. I love listening to his drum work on this album, and on the title track, half the song is just drumming and singing, so he definitely gets to shine. True, there are no amazing double-kick frenzies or amazing drum solos, but it's fast and fierce as it should be. Plus, he keeps the beat, and when you're headbanging, does anything else really matter?\n\nPhil is GODLY on this album. I think I like him a bit better on Cowboys from Hell, personally, but his Manowar-esque shrieking is top-notch. I can't really pick out a single track where he stands out. He's giving it his all on every single song, and I love it. But I've gotta say, on the title track, the chorus is just epic! \"You say you want some metal...I'll give you all I got! My deadly grasp is lethal; this force will never stop! POWER METAL!\" It gives me goosebumps.\n\nReally, I'd love to give this album a higher rating, because in truth, it deserves it. Everything is about as good as it can be, really. But when it comes right down to it, I love Dimebag for what he did with a guitar, but he just ain't doing it on this album, and it's a shame. I guess it took him just a couple more years to finally find his style. Thank god he did.\n",
        "\nAllow me to point out something that I think very few people are aware of. The word \"vulgar\" meaning crude or obscene is something of an evolution. Though archaic, the word can mean \"common\". This was it's original meaning. It's not hard to imagine how amongst the upper class, things that were \"common\" and \"crude\" were viewed as one in the same. It's also not hard to imagine that they'd bear the same general negative connotation.\n\nThat said, the title of this album is incredibly ironic. Pantera is a band that produced nothing in their career but imitation pseudo-thrash yet were hailed as legendary for absolutely no reason that anyone can come up with any semblance of an excuse for. The irony of the word \"vulgar\" in the title, is the fact that they are the ultimate generic, faceless band. For the common kind of folks who would be considered casual metal fans. If such a thing existed. But it doesn't. I don't know anyone who owns this album, and a Venom album - enough said.\n\nMy point is: It's not unusual to find a \"common\" teenage male, i.e. one who does not listen to metal, listening to this album. It has the rare distinction of being so bland that it can somehow appeal to any ordinary person. It is vulgar. It's tailor fit for any angsty male to relate to this on some vague, juvenile and generic level.\n\nBut anyway, the music - the fathomlessly awful, unlistenable music:\n\nThe band's sound is comprised almost entirely of two things: a very transparent, bland influence, being Metallica (with a touch of Black Sabbath), and a style they stole, yet take credit for, the sound of Louisianna thrashers Exhorder. Prior to hearing Exhorder and deciding to rip their sound off, Pantera played glam metal.\n\nThe production on this album is obnoxiously crisp, and the guitar tone is passable at best. There is approximately two thrash riffs on this album, both of which would be on Mouth For War. Again, a good deal of the riffs are rearranged Metallica and Black Sabbath riffs (Irony: two of the most \"commonly\u201d recognized metal bands). The rest borrow the rhythmic riffs and vocal approach of Exhorder. Exhorder was good, not great, but at least they were actually thrash. This contains too much groovy and sluggish parts, with much too passive vocals.\n\nThe vocals are far and away one of the worst parts of this ridiculous excuse for thrash. It's clear to see that many less than favorable styles of music were influenced by this, namely tough guy hardcore and nu-metal. That is precisely what these vocals are. Weak, fringe vocals - wanting to put up the facade of aggression, but making it moderately clean, lest the mainstream wouldn't accept it. Sometimes just shy of Kurt Cobain other times sounding like a poor man's version of James Hetfeild. Occasionally distortion is exploited to feign harshness (such as in \"Fucking Hostile\") In a couple of songs Phil even attempts to sing. It's really embarrassing, off key, and 120% cheesy. Absolutely unlistenable, but then again, so are the rest of the vocals. Generally speaking, it is rare to find music that is actively bad, and in actuality - unlistenable. Some unlistenable bands are those that try much too hard to be different or sonically offensive (pick any retarded bedroom black metal project or absurd avant-garde band) However, a lot of music, under any genre is mostly made up of people imitating greater bands, and doing it well enough that they can't be god awful - and the irony again here is that Pantera are complete music thieves yet manage to completely fail in every conceivable aspect, yet still earn endless praise.\n\nFor being one of the most revered guitarists in mainstream \"metal\", Darrel Abbott certainly seems to be missing an assortment of things required to make a great guitarist. His tone is unbearably overproduced, far too trebly and not particularly very heavy. The solos are nonsensical, and aimless. He runs through two octaves of a scale, does a divebomb and everyone's impressed. It's not that 1992's standards were much (if any) lower than they are today. I really don't get it. The riffs are just inane. Daft. Goofy. Impotent. Inept. Boring. There aren't enough demeaning words in the English language to fully express how poor these riffs are. Some riffs are one chord played in a dull rhythm. Abbott manage to take Metallica, Black Sabbath and Exhorder riffs, slap them together and make them completely bland, and harmless. Legendary guitarists are normally so deemed because of innovation (Jimi Hendrix) or technical prowess (Yngwie Malmsteen) - neither of whom do I take much of a liking to, but I can certainly understand their popularity, especially among guitarists. But what did Abbott do? He's certainly not innovative in the least, and his technical prowess hardly extends beyond any given guitarist with a decent amount of chops. Pick a country, and I'll give you 10 bands that were playing way better, more innovative stuff in 1992.\n\nThe song No Good features a spoken word part that sounds better suited for a jazz song. And the lyrics - another defining point of this band. Boorish, lowbrow, and perfectly geared toward temperamental teenagers who are angry that they're parents wouldn't buy them a new car. They mostly consist of themes about beating people up and how generally tough they are. The poster child for juvenile lyrics. Again, I'm pretty sure this influenced every tough guy hardcore band in the world. Not to mention Nu-metal. Just listen to the main riff of Walk - if that's not nu-metal, than Slipknot is the most brutal death metal band ever to grace the planet.\n\nIt would be one thing for the band to be as horrendous as they are - but to be so influential, and such obvious hacks - it's a travesty. How could such a completely worthless band become so popular and widely acclaimed? I could believe it's a conspiricy bigger than the JFK assassination, The Illuminati, Skull and Bones, Roswell and 9-11 combined. How else could I hope to explain that and still retain any sort of optimism toward humanity?\n\nThis music - and I use the word mildly - is a complete embarresment and a bad influence on popular music and culture. Literally, only two of these songs are even listenable - Rise and Mouth for War. Saying they\u2019re listenable is by no means clearing them from the abysmal ceaspool that the rest of the album stews in. I would think one\u2019s knowledge of metal would have to be infinitesemal to believe this band is worth a second of your time in the sea of bands that utterly obliterate this in every way, shape and form. You would have to know just as little about guitar playing to think Darrel Abbott is anything but a hack. Too often the term \u201cunlistenable\u201d or \u201cunbearable\u201d is thrown around, because here I truly mean it - I absolutely cannot make it through all but two songs on this album. This is one of the lowest points in the history of metal, and one of the worst albums I\u2019ve ever heard.\n",
        "\nThis is my absolute favorite album from Pantera. GSTK contains Phil with every more inspired death metal vocals, and Dimebag becoming increasingly experimental with the whammy bar and wah pedal. This album differs from their previous albums in that it is a concentrated album. It's such a concentrated effort that it is almost a concept album, and that concept is HATE(and drugs). \n\nThis album is unique in my opinion because it contains two pairs of two part songs, and only one possible filler. \n\nFrom the first 9 second death scream from Anselmo on the title track, to the ending riff of Dime's on Sandblasted Skin, the album seems almost completely original. The album deals with a range of topics from fake street kids to drugs and the media. \n\nCommon songs on this album that are called \"filler\" are 10's, 13 steps to nowhere, and Living Through Me (Hell's Wrath). However the only one of these i see as possible filler is 13 Steps to Nowhere. 10's is a riveting ballad of drug addiction that contains the best solo on the entire album in my opinion, and Living Through Me (Hell's Wrath) has a very catchy groove riff that has one of the best vocal performances on the entire album. 13 Steps in my opinion isn't a filler song though it is just merely misplaced on the album. I feel it would make the album flow better if it was placed after War Nerve, it is couched between the slower songs 10's and Suicide Note Part 1 on the original, making it's upbeat tempo seem awkward. In fact the song I feel doesn't belong most is actually the single, Drag the Waters. It's just too catchy and groovy in between the slow driving War Nerve, and 10's.\n\nGSTK is an album mainly fueled by rage as seen in tracks 1,2,3,5,7,8,10, and 11. Therfore apart from the slower ballads, which are powerful in their own right, the album doesn't lose it's intensity. It seems mixed well, each instrument has it's limelight on the album, but it seems that the vocals and guitar get a tad more emphasis than drums and bass.\n\nThis album was a definitive mark on the music scene during the mainstreams shift from alternative grunge to rapcore, and is just a brutal assault on all your senses. It is my favorite Pantera album due to it's overt brutality and experimentation. My only complaint though is that the songs could have been arranged better on the album to not give such an awkward feel sometimes.\n",
        "\nNestled right in the middle of Pantera\u2019s upward climb, I Am the Night serves as a transitional album, showing aspects of both their glam metal beginnings and their thrash metal peak. There\u2019s still more than a fair share of the glam elements, but the band were getting progressively more metal as the years went on. And that can only be a good thing, especially considering where these guys started out (see: Metal Magic).\n\nThis was the band\u2019s last album with singer Terry Glaze and the decision to boot him couldn\u2019t have come at a better time. While he was fairly entertaining on Projects in the Jungle, here he begins to show his true merit as a vocalist. His performance is average at best, pretty much indistinguishable from the brunt of the other hair bands\u2019 singers. He is actually the primary reason that this album still retains ties to the hair metal sound; his vocals being typical of the era and his lyrics being among the band\u2019s most embarrassing yet (see \u201cHot and Heavy\u201d if ye doubt). What keeps this bearable is the increasingly skillful playing of Darrell Abbott, who shines throughout. It\u2019s hard to believe that he didn\u2019t achieve renown until after Cowboys from Hell; his playing on this album is phenomenal. His guitar tone is crunchy and his riffwork could\u2019ve been stripped right off an Accept album. Actually, if some of these songs were a tad bit faster they could\u2019ve been on an early Razor album. There\u2019s some pure speed metal with the title track and \u201cValhalla,\u201d a handful of mid-paced rockers with \u201cDaughters of the Queen\u201d and \u201cCome-on Eyes,\u201d one half-assed ballad, and then some stuff that is best described as power metal (\u201cRight on the Edge\u201d). There\u2019s a shitty instrumental (\u201cD*G*T*T*M\u201d) that would be a decent display of neoclassical chops if it weren\u2019t ruined by all the dumb sound effects in the background. Darrell does make up for it with a solid offering of worthy solos in the rest of the songs, so it\u2019s somewhat excusable.\n\nRex Brown and Vinnie Paul still play an important role on the album, but their presence is overshadowed by Darrell\u2019s playing. If you\u2019re a big Dimebag fan, his playing on here will definitely justify some of the album\u2019s crappier characteristics. Otherwise, this is merely average hair metal with a not so average axeman showing his skill amidst some really lame 80\u2019s anthems that never made it big.\n",
        "\nI've always said that Pantera would have one hell of a \u201cbest of\u201d compilation, but until then we'd have to put up with mediocre albums. Honestly, Pantera would have been better off making that best of, because Reinventing the Steel sure isn't contributing much to it. \n\nThe average Pantera album consists of 3-4 extremely good songs, and 7-8 pathetic songs. The band's final offering has addressed this problem and made a consistent album, that doesn't drop down to any truly abysmal songs. However, it's got even less standout tracks than earlier albums.\n\nThere's some changes from the standard Pantera mould here, it's still got heavy groove, probably the bands thickest slab of southern influence, and very simplistic riffs which make up the band's core sound, but Reinventing the Steel offers up a lot more fast material than usual. Not as much as on The Great Southern Trendkill, but more than the few albums before it. In fact most songs have moments that are at the verge of being thrash. Note that it's just quick pulses of thrash thrown into a vast sea of groove. But it's there. Along with this, there's a big step up in the quality of song structures and dynamics, featuring less linear approaches, and more than 4 or 5 different riffs in a song.\n\nProbably the most notable change is the lowering in the numbers of solos. Now there\u2019s not one in every song. Most still have one, but \u201cHellbound\u201d doesn't have one, and even the complex \"Revolution is my Name\" doesn't have a clearly defined solo section, among others. Even then, the solos are really a long step down from Darrel's best work. They still have the Dimebag unique touch, but it's not that stunning. This is pity because Pantera have relied on Dime's solos to really take the songs to being more than stupidly easy-to-play groovers. Instead, this album has a little more complex riffing for its technicality fix. It's still slow as hell most of the time, but the guitars definitely have a lot more going on than usual. The results are a mix in quality, some songs have interesting guitar work, but most of the time it's only average. Still, there's no three note riffs like \"Walk\" on here, most of the time they've got a very southern rolling approach.\n\nThe problem with that album is that it's so safe sounding. There's a little more emphasis on some areas than usual, and other sections of the album are less in depth, but for the main part, the band just plays it safe, and sticks to what they have always done. The solos are dumbed down or just plain absent, the drums are pretty dull, rarely showing any off any of Vinnie Paul\u2019s skills beyond his ability to play complex things with his feet, whilst not losing any arm mobility. This is still a good piece of drum work, but he doesn't seem to be overly powerful or meaty. Phil's screams are almost exclusively limited to his low growl, with his higher screams only coming out on a few songs. I never really liked his high screams, but you know, they're still missing resulting everything being a little one dimensional. And the lyrics are pretty bad. Really, it's quite a cop out even for Pantera. Usually there was at least an immature sense of \"Yeah, this song makes me want to fight people\". But now we get songs about Texas, or about a passage of time. There's really no silly badassness to it. It's just so tame.\n\nAll over the album there are signs that the band simply didn't give a shit. the cover art is stupid, basically it seems like the band decided they wanted a picture of fire, found one, it happened to have a scrawny guy in boxers jumping through it, but they gave up looking and accepted it. Then you've got the lyrical edit on \"I'll Cast a Shadow\" at around the 4 minute mark, which no one seemed to notice. It just seems to hint that there wasn\u2019t too much effort put into the album.\n\nPantera\u2019s final album wasn't really a particularly bad one; it was just an uninventive, tame one, with no real drive behind it. And it shows, with most of the album being kind of dull. It does have it strengths, and it is catchy, and due to its consistency, you probably won't be forced to turn it off before it's done due to utter repulsion, but it just lacks the attention grabbers to get you to put it on in the first place.\n",
        "\nWhen you takes anger, violence and aggression, mix it with a shitload of heavy groove, you gets something far beyond driven. This is one of the more brutal stuff existing on earth, much more than all these ludicrous grindcore bands which can't carry a brutal track for longer than a minute...or half.\n\nIf you followed Pantera's discography till 1992, it will be pretty predictable for you to guess that this album gonna be heavy like a shit, and that's right. \"Vulgar Display Of Power\" was pretty vulgar, but this album had taken some steps farther (listen to \"Good Friends and a Bottle of Pills\", you'll know what I mean). The lyrics are much more straightforward: \"Fuck you and your College dream\", \"The president in submission, he holds out his hand on Your television \", \"A crippled America\", \"I fucked your girlfriend last night, while you snored and drooled, I fucked your love.\" \"I can see you, can fuck you, inside of you\".\n\nYou got that point.\n\nNow, the way the lyrics delivered is flawless, just fits perfect. 'Philip Anselmo' shouts powerfully the lyrics like a killer and the excellent riffage of \"Dimebag Darrell\" is harsh and heavy and combines perfect with the vox. The guitar has a real heavy tone, sometimes it also down tuned so it sounds extremely heavy but still remains clear so it doesn't sound too much dirty and hard to comprehend. This album has one of the best guitar sounds I've heard in metal. It's very heavy, very piercing but still remains clear. There is also a lot of use with whammy bars and diving solos which adds a vibrating sense within the album, especially in the exciting solo in \"Hard Lines, Sunken Cheeks\" which is one of the best solos I've ever heard. What else? Vinnie does an amazing job here and shows an awesome skill with double bass drumming. The bass lines are also pretty intense due to the pure production and adds a groovy feeling, it actually can be heard and that's a huge plus for this album.\n\nTo sum up: \"Far Beyond Driven\" is easily one of the best metal albums from the 90's. It got a lot of headbangable riffs and exciting shreeding solos, agressive vocals and interesting song writing which remains awesome for the whole 56 minutes of it. Simply a must have for each headbanger!\n",
        "\nIf you have not yet listened to this album, picture yourself sitting on the couch, eating Doritos, playing videogames and listening to a metal album which afterwards you can't adequately describe. You groaned at some points, but you know that at least half of it was good. You know this is a groove band, but you're sure that the thrash was definitely there. Many of us have our 'shame bands' that we listen to, but if confronted by a fellow metalhead about this you'd probably rate this album with a \"meh\" so as to not lose your precious social status. That just isn't right though; when this album is good, it's very good. Yet, a \"meh\" would be far too kind for the garbage found here. Overall, where would this lie?\n\nAnd in an album of such uncertainty, there's even more to be found because the listener isn't quite sure what genre some songs are. 'You've Got to Belong to it' has a main riff which is thrashy, yet doesn't progress like thrash riffs should. You really have to listen to this bullshit to believe it: if I may describe it in such a way, it's \"chugga-chugga-chugga NCDUF&GCU$*GC$HJ chugga-chugga-chugga NCBV^EU&TIE$GHBVHS\". Hey, don't look at me like that. Pantera probably wrote this shit with crayons themselves. And then afterwards, it's all groove. 'We'll Grind That Axe For a Long Time' isn't as mind-numbingly awful, but it's still mind-numbing nonetheless. Two wankers could argue whether the riffs here are groove, thrash or are just plain old, straight up heavy metal riffs, but it doesn't matter because it's boring. Nothing about it says \"give a fuck about this song\", so you shouldn't.\n\nI wouldn't be surprised if anyone found themselves enjoying the track 'Goddamn Electric'. In many ways this is the stand-out track and representative of Pantera themselves because, yeah it's a groove-oriented song, but it isn't plodding. Typically I dislike groove metal although I do find that if musicians assert themselves to do so they could pull it off without suffering from the usual tediums thereof. This pretty much shits on the aforementioned tracks, and it's because they nailed it here whereas they fucked around on the other tracks, probably just to meet a track quota. Moving on...\n\nThe opening track 'Hell Bound\" is pretty good although when you take out the vocals it sounds a little too much like stock music (Just like '5 Minutes Alone' and a whole bunch of songs from Vulgar Display of Power except that this isn't the works of drudges like those were). As soon as I heard that riff I knew it was from a motor cross or an insurance ad or something. Nevertheless, 'Death Rattle' is a neat slab of thrash. Not in the \"let's pack as many riffs in here as possible\" sense, but Pantera have at least written something memorable here. The chorus and other sections could be construed as featuring groove, but it never abandons the idea that the song must go on and thrash. At approximately 2:29, the best riff of the song and perhaps even the album kicks in, too.\n\n(Minor aside: that's the funny thing about Pantera: a lot of the time they were mediocre and boring, but then they'd do something really effective and simple like that.)\n\nAgain with the thrash: 'Yesterday Don't Mean Shit' and 'Revolution is my Name' are more advanced in their structure than the other thrash songs and are both thoroughly enjoyable. Catchy sections, good solos, strong rhythm sections. Everything's as it should be.\n\nIn the end, everything comes full circle. The good parts of Reinventing the Steel are worthy of your attention and appreciation, and the bad parts are worthy of the skip button. Songs with a mish-mash of unsuitable ideas thrown together prove to be a red herring between the actual good songs to distract the listener about what they're actually listening to. Surely you will remember what parts you liked about this album, and the parts you didn't quite like almost make you want to listen to them again in case you \"missed something\" due to the confusing nature of them. Ironically, the groove-oriented 'Goddamn Electric' is formidable in being memorable and underlines that through thorough, careful writing any style of song doesn't have to be awful. Beneath all of the confusion, the bottom line is that this album is more deserving of a more positive than negative feedback. Not because of the experience from the first listen, but from the actual content; some of it is poorly written, but more often than not it's good.\n\nOverall this is recommended to Pantera fans as usual, but for anyone else it's worth downloading the good tracks. Even if you like those there's only a slight chance you'll be happy with actually purchasing the album. Nevertheless this is a solid release, and parts of it don't get boring even upon repeat, if nothing else.\n",
        "\nThe timeline of Pantera\u2019s career very much resembles the visage of a grand mountain peak. From humble beginnings in the dregs of glam metal excess, the band began a steady climb of success, incorporating speed and power metal elements until they were a refined, respectable thrash metal unit. Then they began an equal and very opposite descent, incorporating more and more groove elements until they were a parody of their former selves. The summit of their career was Cowboys from Hell, a powerfully executed display of technique that is not only heavy as shit, but is surprisingly catchy from start to end. This would be their last great album, even though the band would like you to believe it\u2019s only their first.\n\nThere\u2019s quite a bit more groove on this album than I\u2019d like to admit, but it\u2019s perfectly infused between thrash riffs and the transitions flow quite naturally. I don\u2019t care what anyone says, this thing absolutely rules. There\u2019s some bona fide thrashers on here in the form of \u201cHeresy,\u201d \u201cShattered,\u201d and \u201cDomination.\u201d If Dimebag Darrell\u2019s guitar playing was not revered up until this point, it certainly was from here on out. The lead work is monstrous, more technical and more melodically-enlightened than anything he had done or would go on to do. And though solos are his true craft, the riff work suffers not. Check out the sweet opener/chorus riff to \u201cMessage in Blood\u201d for example. Rex Brown is still relevant on this album (and his bass tone rules, most readily apparent when there\u2018s no overdubbed rhythm track under the solos, a classic Pantera maneuver.) while Vinnie Paul acts as a crushing and dynamic pacemaker, really mixing it up on this album more than usual. The band is clearly at their instrumental peak and it serves this album well.\n\nI hate to admit it, but the star of the show here is the generally loathsome Phil Anselmo. Having been initially introduced to the band through Vulgar Display and Far Beyond Driven, I was under the impression that Phil was attempting his best death growl parody while choking on a big meaty cheeseburger. Little did I know he used to wail with the best of them and had managed to completely destroy his voice by the early 90\u2019s. Holy shit though. On here, he still has that bastardly tone he possesses on all their future albums, but is capable of actual singing, as well as some very 80\u2019s metal wailing. He almost sounds like fucking Halford at moments in \u201cShattered\u201d while his performance on this album\u2019s power ballad masterpiece \u201cCemetary Gates\u201d is awe-inspiring. Just listen to that pre-chorus and try and tell me that guy couldn\u2019t sing. \u201cThe Sleep\u201d is a really good example too.\n\nOkay, so this isn\u2019t purist thrash metal (\u201cPrimal Concrete Sledge\u201d is pretty nauseating), but for what it is, it\u2019s really, really fucking good. I guess their bravado comes off a little strong at first, as opposed to their glam-ish albums, but if you can get past it, there\u2019s some magnificent songs here, as well as great vocals, wicked solos, and hell, even some cool lyrics.\n\nHighlights: Everything but \u201cPrimal Concrete Sledge\u201d\n",
        "\nThe second chapter in Pantera\u2019s glam origins is, thankfully, much better than the first. Exchanging much of their obvious Kiss influenced stylings with some old-school speed metal a la Judas Priest, Projects in the Jungle is the first step up towards the truly great Pantera material. It\u2019s not perfect, but it beats the living hell out of the atrocious Metal Magic.\n\nNow this is still undoubtedly glam metal, but it\u2019s much more focused, refined, better produced glam metal. Actually, I\u2019d much rather listen to this album, with its inherent cheesiness, than the likes of Winger, Cinderella, Whitesnake, etc. The improvements over Metal Magic are significant. First off, the production on this is fantastic. Everything is crisp and clear and so delightfully 80\u2019s sounding (think Scorpions), and the terrible synth effects are never brought right up front when they roll around. The album just sounds really damn good. Secondly, and perhaps more importantly, all the band members have really pulled their shit together. Terry Glaze, the third-rate Vince Neil wannabe, absolutely rules on this album. The lyrics are dumb, but his vocals are perfect (for this style of music anyway). Diamond Darrell really starts to strut his stuff on this one, delivering catchy, coherent riffing and some mighty fine lead work worthy of his reputation. Add to this the consistently effective bass work of Rex Brown and the ever potent drumming of Vinnie Paul and the instrumentation on this album is complete.\n\nEven the song structures are better, venturing more often out of the mid-paced rockers into speed metal territory. Check out \u201cOut for Blood,\u201d \u201cKillers,\u201d and the sweet title track for examples, though the rest are pretty good as well. The only sore spot on this is the track \u201cBlue Light Turnin\u2019 Red,\u201d Darrell\u2019s attempt at his own \u201cEruption.\u201d He does some scale runs, some tapping, and plays with a harmonizing effect. Unfortunately, he\u2019s no EVH, so the track comes off as presumptuous and ineffective. But even so, this is one of the nicer albums that glam metal has offered the world and it\u2019s a shame that Pantera were too ashamed to consider it a part of their official discography, as it's a hell of a lot better than the garbage they'd start putting out in the late 90's. \n\nRecommended, at least for a listen.\n",
        "\nIt pains me to give any Pantera album anything less than 85, but this just doesn't cut it. I love Pantera and I love glam but this is the bad kind of glam. You know, the kind that you watch, and everyone has fucking make-up all over their faces, the kind that makes you think \"Jesus, the hell is Bret Michaels thinking?\" Well, this is the kind. Subsequent albums will be a different issue, but it seems that in their first album Pantera really just didn't know what the hell they wanted. \n\nThe album begins with the song Ride My Rocket, and has glam's obligatory goofy intro (\"In this time of metal magic, we need rock and roll... we need... Pantera!\"). It's actually a very good glam song, and has the merit of giving a good start to the album. However, the rest just completely fails. Whether it's the cheesy sexual innuendo of \"Tell Me If You Want It,\" the boring \"Rock Out\" which just goes nowhere, or the make-you-barf sweetness of \"Biggest Part of Me\" (no, it's not a song about Terry Glaze's cock), this is just your average glam album, possibly slightly worse. And it truly pains me to say this about a Pantera album, seeing as it is my favorite band of all times.\n\nWhy a 60 then? Because it's still not Poison, in all fairness. There's some good stuff on this album. I think that, for example, Ride My Rocket (this one, I'd imagine, actually IS about Glaze's cock) and Widowmaker especially are very good songs that every fan of glam and / or Pantera should know. And anyone who loves glam and grew up with glam can't help but smile when listening to Latest Lover and Nothing On (But the Radio). \n\nIn conclusion: I keep this album around mainly out of loyalty to the band. Anyone who holds no such sentiments towards Pantera should go ahead and get the four better tracks mentioned above, and move on to the next albums, those of the 80s and, if you've been living in a hole for the past decade and a half, those that came after them too (and then you might get the reference in this last sentence, too!).\n",
        "\nAccording to Pantera, this is where they really starting to get \u201cgood\u201d. However, this album is far from good, more to less decent. Most of it is a bunch of mediocre slowed down groove metal fueled by the \u201ctough guy\u201d image. By this time, all they really cared about was being tough popular which is hypocritical, considering that they claim to be \u201ctrend killers\u201d. However, the album does have it\u2019s moments. Fucking Hostile and Rise are really the only two awesome songs on this album. The formal is an extremely fast and aggressive thrash song that has some pretty good riffs, and the later having some pretty good riffs and drumming as well.\n\nMouth For War starts off pretty good with a nice opening riff. It starts to slow down though, when Phil starts singing. His new style of vocals, though they may be appear to be cool, and badass are just shitty. They being said, that\u2019s the only really shit factor in this song. Everything else is pretty good. The solo is pretty cool, and drums fit in perfectly. The song really gets good towards the end when everything speeds up. The riffs are heavy as fuck! It\u2019s a pretty good song. 8/10\n\nA New Level isn\u2019t really anything special though. Phil still sounds like shit, but at least the riffs are decent. The song is pretty boring though. Dimebag\u2019s solo saves this song a little, but it\u2019s still just average at best. 7/10\n\nWalk is about poseurs, and how much they suck. However, they have no right to whine about poseurs when they\u2019re pretty much poseurs themselves. Changing their style of music to appeal to the masses. Not to mention them ripping off of Exhorder\u2019s The Law demo which was already stated earlier. The song is also pretty boring with average riffs. Overall, it\u2019s just mediocre at best. 5/10\n\nHowever, the album redeems itself a bit with the next song, Fucking Hostile. This song is aggressive thrash with an attitude. It has heavy riffs which will leave you head banging for a while. The solo kicks ass as well. It shows that this band still has the ability to be a pretty good band, it\u2019s just that their image is more important to them than they\u2019re music. This song is fucking hostile! 10/10\n\nThis Love is the first of the two ballads. At least Pantera is still good at performing ballads as this and Hollow are pretty damn good. They have both emotion and aggression. About the only reason why I\u2019m not too crazy about this song is that it\u2019s a little too angst driven for my taste. Phil mutters out \u201cI\u2019d kill myself for you.\u201d Oh, poor you! If Phil didn\u2019t have to fuck this song up with that whiny little \u201caaaahhhhhhh!!!!!\u201d scream than I would\u2019ve given this an 8 out of 10. At least the solo is good. 7/10\n\nRise is the other fast and aggressive song on here. It\u2019s not quite as thrashy as Fucking Hostile, but it\u2019s still heavy as fuck! The riffs and drumming are very fast and loud with an awesome solo towards the half way point. Too bad Phil\u2019s vocals butcher this song a little, otherwise, I\u2019d give it a 10/10. It\u2019s still awesome though! 9/10\n\nNo Good (Attack The Radical), Live In A Hole, Regular People (Conceit), and By Demons Be Driven are all pretty horrible songs with annoying vocals, mediocre guitar work, and solos that are average at best. The solos are probably the only good factors in these songs. I really can\u2019t find anything else that is good about any of these songs. They\u2019re boring and repetitive, and Phil\u2019s whiny and annoying singing certainly help any. Live In A Hole has a pretty annoying noise during the beginning of the song. I\u2019m not sure if that was suppose to help them look tough or not. Oh, and Phil\u2019s whispers sure are annoying as well. When an album has four or more filler tracks in a row like this, you really can\u2019t expect it to be all that good. This is one of the reasons why I\u2019ve been knocking this album so much.\n\nNo Good: 5/10\nLive In Hole: 4/10\nRegular People: 5/10\nBy Demons Be Driven: 4/10\n\nThe album closes off with another ballad called Hollow. This song is also very emotional, but not in the \u201cOMG I HATE MYSELF!!!\u201d kind of way which despite popular belief, isn\u2019t \u201cemo\u201d at all. Anyway, the guitar work is good, and Phil\u2019s vocals are pretty good here. He uses clear voice singing here which at least sounds better than those god awful \u201ctough guy\u201d vocals he mostly used on this album. The song speeds up and gets more aggressive towards the middle of the song. Overral, this song is pretty good, and is one of the better tracks on this album. 8/10\n\nOverall, this album doesn\u2019t exactly suck, but it\u2019s not good either has it has a bunch of filler tracks, and annoying vocals. The album does have it\u2019s moments though. I\u2019m not even going to bother to listen to their later albums as judging by their ratings, are probably suck even more than this album did. I would recommend this for someone who is just getting into metal, and probably used to listen to shitty bands like Slipknot and Disturbed. In fact, this was one of the first real metal albums that I bought, and at the time, I really liked it, but grew out of it over time. However, Cowboys From Hell, and even their earlier glam albums piss on this one, in my opinion.\n",
        "\nThis is Pantera\u2019s fifth album, and not their debut which the band used to claim. In this album, they had completely ditched their glam metal past, and went on to a more aggressive style of metal. This style would later be known as groove metal. There\u2019s plenty of thrash here to go around, particularly Heresy, Domination, and especially Shattered. Most of the other songs use a much slower and groovier version of the genre. That said, Phil Anselmo is still using falsetto vocals for this album, but uses them a lot less often then he did in Power Metal, as he is mainly using more aggressive vocals this time. However, his voice would go to shit on their next album. In terms of heaviness, they were certainly at their peak. The drumming is pretty fast and intense, and Dimebag shreds like crazy on this album.\n\nThe title track, Cowboys From Hell, starts off with a nice groovy riff that\u2019s bound to get you head banging, or at least tapping your foot. Phil sounds a lot more aggressive here. Dime really starts to shred towards the 2:30 mark with a cool solo. This is one of the better tracks on here. 10/10\n\nPrimal Concrete Sledge is mainly a drumming based track, and it\u2019s very aggressive. The drums are fast as shit. That\u2019s pretty much the highlight of this song. Phil and Dime also give a pretty nice performance in this song. However, it\u2019s a little too short as it only last about two minutes. It\u2019s still awesome though. 9/10\n\nPsycho Holiday is one of my favorite songs on here. The guitar work is pretty catchy and has a nice groove to it that\u2019s bound to get stuck in your head after a few listens. Phil sounds cool on this song as well. I especially like when he wails out the chorus. \u201cI\u2019m on a Psycho Holidaaaaay!\u201d That\u2019s cool as shit. The drumming stays consistent too. The solo is pretty cool as well. This song rules! 10/10\n\nHeresy is one of the more thrashier songs on this album, and that proves to be obvious the second you listen to it. It starts off with one hell of a riff that you have o headbang too. Then drumming is pretty aggressive and fast and adds to the song. Phil sounds awesome in this song, especially when he shrieks out the chorus. \u201cHeresyyyyy!\u201d He manages to stay aggressive vocally. The song really gets good though at the 3:30 mark when the riffs and drumming speed up. This song is heavy as shit! 10/10\n\nCemetery Gates is the only ballad on this song, and it\u2019s the best ballad they\u2019ve done, in my opinion. It\u2019s very emotionally driven, yet still manages to stay heavy in it\u2019s own right. It\u2019s got riffs considering that it\u2019s a ballad. I find it kinda ironic that made this song, considering that it\u2019s about missing someone who passed away and died. Ironically, that person would be Dimebag Darrel himself. Though this is probably very obvious, it\u2019s ironic, because he wouldn\u2019t have been murdered until about 15 years later. Anyway, this song has a nice solo towards the five minute mark that adds to the atmosphere to this song. My favorite part of the song, though, is when Phil wails out \u201cGaaaaaaates\u201d! I could sing along right to that, and I sometimes do. Awesome song! 10/10\n\nBoth Domination and Shattered are heavy thrashers that kick the shit out of anything they would do on their later albums. They have the riffs, drumming, and overall aggressiveness that your typical thrash metal song has. Shattered, in particular, is very fast and Phil is certainly at his peak here vocally. His vocals are almost godly in this song. His singing alone would make the song, but add one awesome solo from Dimebag, and you get one monster of a song. Both of these songs get a 10/10.\n\nClash With Reality is another groovy thrash song. Phil\u2019s vocals on this song are awesome, he mainly uses his falsetto vocals here. The riffs are pretty heavy as well. The song kinda drags a little though. It\u2019s still good though. 9/10\n\nMedicine Man, Message In Blood, and The Sleep are all decent groove metal songs. They lag a little, and get pretty boring after a while, but they still piss on most of the stuff they would do later. Dimebag gives out a nice performance in all of these songs, which save them a little. All three of these songs get an 8/10.\n\nThe Art Of Shredding is a cool song that\u2018s about shredding. Dimebag does just that in this song, as the riffs are heavy, and there\u2019s a bit of a variety of different riffs in this song, and the solo is cool too. The guitar work in this song is just purely awesome. Phil gives out a nice performance as well. 9/10\n\nOverall, this album is heavy as well as aggressive. However, it was this album that would push Pantera even further into the mainstream, and therefore would encourage them to stick to trends. \nTheir next album isn\u2019t half as good as this one, and it would go to show that being \u201ctough\u201d and \u201cbadass\u201d is more important to them then the music itself.\n",
        "\nMany times these early Pantera albums are derided for being \"glam.\" Well, I totally FUCKING DISAGREE!!! Sure, they may not be the mosh pit inducing groove-whatever-metal of later years, but are they worthless? HELL NO!!!\n\nFor those of you who had been following this band along for a while, Terrence Lee changes his squealy vocal delivery a bit on here, making it quite a bit more rude sounding. He's not doing the Halford antics of early Phil Anselmo, what he sounds like is kind of a really pissed off Axl Rose with a much better and more controlled range. Pretty damn effective, I must say, and his vocals really give this some added heaviness.\n\nThere are some moments of uttter cheese such as \"Daughters of the Queen\" and \"Hot N Heavy,\" but these are more than made up for with slamming tracks like the title track, \"Valhalla\" and \"Down Below.\" The former two tracks sound quite a bit like vintage Judas Priest with more technical riffing, but really fast paced and driving. \"Down Below\" really showcases a churning, sleazy sort of riffing that shows up on a number of other tracks on here, and Terrence really wails on here. Heavy shit, that's for damn sure. \n\n\"Onward we Rock,\" despite having a really stupid name and really stupid lyrics, is one hell of a driving tune. It's got an almost martial quality to the way the drums and bass \"march\" onward. In here we get another totally viscious solo courtesy of Dime. Fucking sweet! It's got to be my pick for best solo on here. \n\nThe closer is a ballad, \"Forever Tonight.\" Sure, this is ultracheesey, pretty glammy, and features falsetto vocals, but damn! It's fucking beautiful! Seriously, I never thought I'd say that about a Pantera song, but it really does sound nice. The main melody is played by harmonics, with riffs being more of an afterthought. Cool stuff. \n\nThe production is pretty weak, and I can't say that Vinnie or Rex get too wild on here, but otherwise there're just a few weak moments in songs, and certainly nothing that makes this album \"glam shit.\" If anything, you find still more great leads by Dime, and an interesting time piece. It's a damn shame that Vinnie doesn't rerelease these old classics through his new label so all Pantera maniacs can hear Dime's potential at such an early age.\n",
        "\nThis is probably my favourite Pantera album for a number of reasons. One of which being that it contains what I feel to be Dime's best guitar solos, a fact that can easily be verified by checking out the fucking massive solo on \"We'll Meet Again\" and the totally mind bending shred fest that is \"Death Trap.\" The second being that Phil Anselmo's vocals were almost perfect (I loved his performance on Cowboys), and his screaming was like a very harsh Rob Halford...strange to think that this guy pigeonholed himself to just one type of delivery later on. And overall, I think this is the perfect combination of aggression and melody, the exact thing that \"power metal\" should be, not some rooty tooty pretty boys singing about faeries and elves wandering off into \"battle.\"\n\nTake the ferocious riffs of early Megadeth and combine them with some Painkiller-era Judas Priest, and you've got a pretty good idea of the basic framework here. Nothing off Power Metal is light years away from Cowboys From Hell, except for maybe the fact this is more thrash based and not as down tuned. \n\nTake the title track is one ripper of a fucking track. No weak riffs here, just balls out shredding, and towards the end, it breaks down into one of those heavier, moshing riffs that would later make Pantera so famous. \"We'll Meet Again\" is my favourite off of here, a sort of prelude to \"Cemetary Gates,\" with spoken vocals by Phil and the that awesome solo in the middle. \"Over and Out\" is a ferocious maelstrom of riffs, riffs and more riffs, going through many changes and leaving you feeling wearied from the viscious onslaught. \n\n\"Down Below\" is a track from I Am the Night, and perfectly bridges the gap between Terrance Lee and Phil Anselmo Pantera. Both singers perfectly pull this one off, and it's hard for me to pick a favoured version of this tune. It's got a bit of a sleazy riff, but heavy enough for destruction. Then comes \"Death Trap\" which is pure Pantera...galloping, raging riffs combined with screaming, over the fucking top vocals...then a lead break so savage that your neck is nearly snapped in the process! Fuck, that's got to be one of the best leads ever, and it sounds like Dime harmonized it with two guitars in different places. Surely, Trey Azagthoth and Eddie Van Halen would smile upon hearing how out there it is.\n\n\"Burrrn\" could have easily come off of Defenders of the Faith, with a galloping bass and drum combo charging along. \"PST 88\" is kind of a throwaway track, but very amusing if you've got a sense of humour.\n\nReally the only thing I can gripe about is the production, which is a tad thin, especially with the drums. Obviously, when they got Terry Date in there for Cowboys, things got way heavier, but the raw fucking power of this album is enough to drive you through the roof. Stylistically, it reminds me of Savatage's Power of the Night, a point where two eras of the band met and perfectly gelled, or something like that.\n\nGlam? I think not. This is REAL power metal!\n",
        "\nAs with all of their other 80s albums, Pantera, after they released Cowboys From Hell, decided to bury their glam past, and with it any knowledge that they have made glam albums in the past. Unfortunately, this album was also buried with the rest of their glam albums. Why they would deny this album is beyond me, because it is certainly, in my opinion, their absolute best album, and they were very stupid for doing so.\n\nAnyway, enough about that. This is about Pantera\u2019s fourth album, Power Metal. This is their debut album with vocalist, Phil Anselmo, and back then, he sure was one hell of an awesome singer. His vocals on this album sound a bit like Rob Halford. His falsetto vocals were at least 10 times, if not more, a good as his screaming and \u201ctough guy\u201d vocals on Vulgar Display and later. Dimebag Darrell improves even further in his guitar playing, and throws some nice killer solos in all of the songs. The only actually glam songs on this album are Rock The World, Proud To Be Loud, and the two semi-ballads We\u2019ll Meet Again, and Hard Ride. Everything else is a mix between speed metal (Down Below and Burnnn) and straight out thrash (Power Metal, Over And Out, Death Trap, and P.S.T. 88), yes Pantera showed signs of thrash even back in their glam days. However, every song on here is flawless and pretty unique.\n\nRock The World starts out with a nice heavy riff. For a glam song, this sure is heavy. The lyrics are cool as well. It\u2019s all about rocking the world in this song, and they indeed do just that. Phil makes a pretty cool shriek at the 2:40 mark at the song. 10/10\n\nPower Metal starts off fast and heavy with the riffs and drumming. This stays consistent throughout the song. I also like the \u201cpower meeeetal!!\u201d shriek in the chorus. The solo is cool as well. This song is awesome thrash/speed metal, and it\u2018s just a preview of what\u2018s to come later on in this album. 10/10\n\nWe\u2019ll Meet Again is the first of the two ballads on this albums. It has one heavy riff for a ballad though. It\u2019s sort of a prequel to Cemetery Gates. Dimebag throws another awesome solo towards the middle of the song. The song really gets good though, towards the end when the riffs really start to get heavy. Add Phil\u2019s cool screaming of the chorus during this riff, and you get one heavy ballad. 10/10\n\nOver And Out is the next thrash song on this album. It has a cool riff that you can easily headbang to, and the drumming is pretty intense as well. The song really gets good during the solo though. This is one of the heavier songs on this album. 10/10\n\nProud To Be Loud is probably my favorite song on the album. It has basically everything I look for in a song, catchiness, cool riffs, and an awesome solo. Despite it being glam, I can easily headbang to this song. The lyrics are cool as shit too, I love singing along to this song. \u201cCause of proud to be loud, and I\u2019ll never turn it down again, no!\u201d This song rules, enough said! 10/10\n\nDown Below was originally on their last album, I Am The Night, and just like the last version, it\u2019s killer speed metal. The only real difference is the singer. Phil Anselmo is singing it this time around, and he sounds slightly better than Glaze did on this song. As said before, this is Judas Priest worship. 10/10\n\nDeath Trap is probably the heaviest and thrashiest song on this album. Just the riffs and drumming will leave you headbanging for a while. Phil shows a little bit of attitude in this song vocally as his voice is slightly more raspy then in any of the other songs on here. Dimebag plays one killer of a solo on here that\u2019s bound to get your hair spinning, if you have long hair that is (like me). The way Dimebag shouts out \u201cdeath trap!\u201c near the end of the song is cool too. This song is pure thrash with an attitude. 10/10\n\nHard Ride is the other ballad on here. However, it also has some pretty cool riffs. Phil sounds a lot like Rob Halford in this song. It may not be as heavy as the other songs on this album, but it sure is very catchy, and for me, or anyone else who looks for that in a song, it\u2019s a good thing. I sing along to this song every time I listen to it. Another cool solo is heard here which concludes the song. This is one of my favorite tracks on this album. 10/10\n\nBurnnn! is killer speed metal. The drumming is fast, and the riffs are heavy. Just like Down Below, this is also Judas Priest worship. Through in your typical awesome solo form Dimebag, and you get another perfect and heavy song. 10/10\n\nP.S.T. 88 (a.k.a. Pussy Tight) is cool thrash metal. The song has typical glam metal lyrics (sex, girls, getting laid), but the riffs are heavy as fuck. Dimebag is the one who is singing this song, and he sounds pretty cool. You have to love that chorus! (Pussy Tight! Tonight!) Dimebag throws in a cool solo towards the two minute mark. The drumming is fast, and stays consistent. This song is cool as shit! 10/10\n\nIn my opinion, Pantera has certainly reached their peak. There is absolutely no song on here that can\u2019t be listened to. Every song on this album is awesome, and I can listen to this album over and over again. That\u2019s how much I like it. If you\u2019re a fan of glam, speed, thrash, or just straight up heavy metal, then you should defiantly get this album. I think it\u2019s just a matter of time before the remaining members of this band end up re-releasing this album. Hopefully, that will be soon.\n",
        "\nThis is Pantera\u2019s third glam metal album, and their final album with singer, Terry Glaze. They would later replace Glaze with singer after singer until two years when they found singer, Phil Anselmo. Anyway, this is definantly the best out of the first three albums, and it\u2019s not even a full glam album, as it has several speed metal tracks on here (I Am The Night, Onward We Rock, Down Below, and Vahalla), and most of the songs on here that are glam are pretty heavy in their own right. Dimebag\u2019s guitar playing progresses even further in this album, Vinnie Paul has a new bass drum that sounds cool in the songs, and gives them more of a feel, Rexx Rocker sounds good on the bass as always, and even Terry Glaze has improved drastically in his style of singing which kind of sounds like a mix between Axle Rose and Rob Halford.\n\nHot & Heavy opens up the album with a bang! It\u2019s an awesome song about girls and sex. \u201cTake a lick at my ice cream cone, baby. I can\u2018t wait to take you home, and beat ya with my stick!\u201d That\u2019s so cool! The drums stay consistent with a good beat. I love the guitar solo towards the middle to end of the song. It\u2019s ashamed that most people only know about Pantera\u2019s 90s albums, and judge Dimebag\u2019s playing only by those songs. His solos and overall guitar playing were a lot better back in the 80s then they were in the 90s. This is one of my favorite songs on the album. 10/10\n\nI Am The Night is the first speed metal track on this album, and opens up with a little bit of shredding from Dimebag. Then, the song starts up, and income the riffs. The drumming is very fast, which is of course awesome. The vocals kind of sound a bit evil as well, as it is both Glaze and Dimebag singing at the sound time. We get another solo towards the 2:45 mark of the song. This, as well as the next song, screams Judas Priest. 10/10\n\nOnward We Rock starts out with a nice heavy riff, and once the drums begin, you know right from the start what you\u2019re in for. One heavy as heel song! The chorus, which is sung by Dimebag, by the way) is cool as shit as well. \u201cOooonward we rock! Slaaaave to the dark\u201d That screams heavy fucking metal all over. Add another awesome solo from Dimebag, and you get another flawless killer of a song. 10/10\n\nD*G*T*T*M is really the only weak track on this album, as it's pointless filler. There\u2019s a bunch of various weird noises throughout the song along with a bunch of guitar noodling. Meh. 5/10\n\nDaughters Of The Queen is the next song. Towards the: 40 mark of the song, we get treated to a nice riff that you can\u2019t help, but headbang to. The song stays pretty consistent. This song appears to be about a guy who wants to rescue a couple of princesses from and castle, and then make love to them. The lyrics are slightly lame, but that doesn\u2019t hurt the song at all, as there are plenty of cool riffs, and the drumming is awesome as well. 10/10\n\nDown Below is probably the best song on here, as it is killer speed metal with an attitude. In fact, it\u2019s so awesome that they decided to redo it, and put it on their next album, power metal, with Phil Anselmo doing the singing. Once again, this is Judas Priest worship all over. It kind of reminds me of their song, Eat Me Alive. The songs starts out with another heavy riff, which you absolutely have to headbang to. I do it every time I listen to it. The drumming is lighting fast, which adds to the awesomeness. Then, the solo comes, and you start swinging your long hair around. Well, I do anyway. I\u2019d give this song an 11/10 if I could, but I can\u2019t, so there. 10/10\n\nCome - On Eyes is the other \u201clame glam\u201d song on this album, as started in an earlier review. However, since I like glam so much, I find nothing lame about this song. It has cool lyrics about sex, and is very catchy. The drumming stays consistent and heavy as well. The song has cool riffs, and is very catchy. 8/10\n\nRight On The Edge is real heavy, for a glam song anyway. The riffs and drumming are heavy as fuck. Glaze is probably at his peak vocally in this song, as even he contributes to the heaviness in this song. Add another solo, and you get another perfect song. 10/10\n\nVahalla is the last speed metal track on here, and it kind of sounds like a less heavier version of \u201cBurnnn\u201d which they would do on their next album. However, it\u2019s still very heavy. I love the chorus in this song. Glaze screams out \u201cVahallaaaaah!\u201d That\u2019s cool as shit! Dimebag performs yet another awesome solo. 10/10\n\nThe album once again closes off with a hair ballad called Forever Tonight. However, for a ballad this is very good. The fact that Dimebag can nail cool riffs on a ballad like this proves that he was one of the better guitarists of the 80s, even though they weren\u2019t very popular back then, which is pretty ironic considering that they were a glam metal band in the 80s, and as everyone should know, glam was extremely popular back then. Anyway, the song stays consistent. Dimebag nails another cool solo in this song. This is probably my favorite ballad ever. 10/10\n\nOnce again, if you\u2019re not into glam metal, stay away from this album. However, there are moments where even a non-glam metal fan could appreciate this album. However, in my opinion, they wouldn\u2019t reach they\u2019re pinnacle until their next album. If you\u2019re a fan of glam metal, or even speed metal, then you should defiantly get you hands on this, as soon as possible.\n",
        "\nPantera is an interesting band that surely cannot be generalized like any other. Their first albums were certainly not unique or special and were merely hair metal; the trend of the time. With Cowboys From Hell they changed their sound to fit the mainstream once again now that hair metal had begun fading away into obscurity. When Darrel Abbott was shot down while preforming with his false metal band, Damageplan, in 2004 his and Pantera's popularity skyrocketed overnight as scenester teenagers began to embrace him post-death.\n\nSurely a band that is as popular as Pantera must be good, correct? No, this album is just a pathetic display of awful music that somehow gets called a classic metal album. Listening to another false metal band - Lamb of God or Slipknot perhaps - it is far easier to pick out the Pantera influence than in any real metal band. It is clear through the song titles and lyrics that Pantera is full of angst and merely wanted to try and appeal to the masses instead of trying to put any real thought in their music.\n\nEvery riff on this album sounds uninspired and almost like nu-metal. Abbott's solos are nothing special either, particularly on the song \"Rise\" which has one of the worst I have ever heard. Similarly all the other instruments do not fare well. Paul Abbott's drumming is dull and slow paced, doing nothing other than keeping time. Bass is audible but not exciting.\n\nAnselmo's vocals are nothing great to be sure. Clearly the point of this album was to be \"tough\" and \"brutal\" as evidenced by his coarse yells and barks. The whole atmosphere of this sounds fake and is not believable, down to the point of being corny at times (Like on \"Fucking Hostile\").\n\nSo far I have only brushed on the weakest point of the album - That it seems completely artificial, fake, and dumb. The songs do not go anywhere, and all are extremely repetitive and get very boring after the first third or so. Normally the solos would help alleviate this a bit, but since they are also dull and boring they do not. I cannot see any real value behind this album; it only serves as face value entertainment that can be thrown away and never missed. Just who Pantera was trying to appeal to with this album is a mystery. It is also a clear rip off of the sound Exhorder created with \"The Law\" that was released earlier the same year.\n\nMusically, Vulgar Display of Power is certainly competent. However it fails to excel in any areas at all, instead falling flat. I have seen this album placed high with thrash metal classics like Darkness Descends and Bonded by Blood. But this album is not thrash, it is not original, and it has little merit beyond what you hear at first.\n",
        "\nThis was Pantera\u2019s second album, and also their second album with vocalist, Terry Glaze. This is a glam metal album no doubt, but there are several songs on this album that are faster and heavier, and resemble speed metal. Unlike their debut album, which was heavily influenced by Kiss, this album tends to have more Judas Priest influences. I must also add that this album is defiantly not for everybody. Especially, if you\u2019re not a fan of glam metal/80s metal. However, I happen to be a huge fan of the genre. The production is a lot better on this album, and Dimebag\u2019s playing has really improved. Rex Brown, or Rexx Rocker as he was referred to back then, adds a nice groove with the bass. The drumming is also very good, and mix in pretty good with the songs. Terry Glaze users very high-pitched singing, which for the style of rock this is, is good.\n\nAll Over Tonight is the first track on the album. This song is very catchy, and after a few listens, you will probably know the lyrics by heart, and the riffs are also very catchy. The drumming stays very consistent throughout the song. Terry puts out a pretty good performance as well. My favorite part, though, is the guitar solo. Dimebag certainly was an awesome guitar player back then. There was also a video made for this song, which features them playing on stage. Awesome song! 10/10\n\nOut For Blood is the first speed metal song on this album, and it sure is one awesome one at that. Add very catchy vocals, lightning fast drumming, plus another awesome solo, and you get another flawless killer of a song. I also enjoy the lyrics. \u201cShe\u2019s out for blood!\u201d That is cool as shit! 10/10\n\nBlue Lite Turnin\u2019 Red features one awesome minute and a half solo from Dimebag Darrel. In my opinon, this can compete with Van Halen, or any other 80s rock/metal band. 10/10\n\nLike Fire is probably my favorite song on the album. It\u2019s catchy, fun, and I really like the lyrics. Some people think lyrics about girls/sex is cheesy, but I personally think it\u2019s cool as shit. Which is one of the reasons why I\u2019m a big glam/hair metal fan. Once again, the drumming stays consistent, and the riffs are great, and fit right into the mix. Add yet another killer guitar solo, and you get one perfect song. 10/10\n\nIn Over My Head starts out with some nice synthesizer effects, which your average metalhead would frown upon, but is still cool, and it adds to the atmosphere of this song. This song also has nice riffs, and towards the end of the song, you get treated with a nice solo. About the only flaw this song has is Terry\u2019s singing which is a little too girlish, and doesn\u2019t really fit in right with the song. Nonetheless, it hardly hurts the song at all. 9/10\n\nThen, comes Projects In The Jungle which is no doubt the heaviest song on this album. This would almost be borderline thrash, if they had the right vocalist for this song. However, it\u2019s killer speed metal. Vinnie Paul adds a nice double-bass with drums, and the riffs are heavy as fuck! Dimebag\u2019s solo is also very awesome. This could easily fit in with one of their later works (Power Metal comes to mind). 10/10\n\nHeavy Metal Rules is, as the title says, is an awesome anthem about just that. Heavy fucking metal! The lyrics are metal themed, and sounds like something that Judas Priest would do. \u201cI stick my fist high in the air! Heavy metal rules!!!!!\u201d That\u2019s heavy metal for you there! Dimebag also plays a nice solo. However, the riffs could be a little better. No complaints though, heavy metal rules, and so does this song. 9/10\n\nOnly A Heartbeat Away is probably the least memorable song on this album, and just like In Over My Head, Terry Glaze\u2019s singing is a bit too girly. However, it\u2019s till pretty good, as the solo saves this song from being below decent. 8/10\n\nKillers is the final speed metal track on this album, and as stated in an earlier review, this is NOT an Iron Maiden cover. However, I\u2019d say it\u2019s just as heavy. The riffs are heavy, as well as the solo, the drumming is fast, and Terry\u2019s singing is pretty cool as well. This is one of the better songs on here. 10/10\n\nThen, we close this song off with a hair ballad called Takin\u2019 My Life. For a ballad, it\u2019s decent. Though, it\u2019s not really my favorite track on here. Mainly, due to Terry\u2019s singing which is as I\u2019ve already stated is a little too girly. If it weren\u2019t for Dimebag\u2019s awesome solo, I\u2019d probably give this song a 7. However, I\u2019m bumping it up a notch just because of the solo. 8/10\n\nAs I\u2019ve stated earlier, this album is not for everybody. If you\u2019re not a fan of glam/hair metal, then I insist that you stay away from this album, as it has plenty of glam to go around. However, if you\u2019re a huge fan of the genre (like I am), then defiantly get it. I\u2019d recommend eBay which is how I got my hands on it. There are moments where the band was starting to become heavier (the title track comes to mind). This is an essential for any glam metal/80s metal fan.\n",
        "\nMetal Magic. The debut album Pantera was too embarrassed to acknowledge. That fact, coupled with poor reviews, let me know exactly what I was getting into before I ever listened to this. And let me assure you, this album deserves all the shit that it gets. This is poor even for glam metal and has very few redeeming qualities. \n\nThe most initially disturbing aspect of this album is the sheer amount of cheesiness throughout. From the respective intros to \"Ride my Rocket\" and the title track, Terry Glaze's poorly over-the-top vocals, the consistently corny lyrics, and the presence of all kinds of 80's synth layerings, it's actually pretty painful to listen to (as the cover is painful to look at). The music itself is fairly weak as far as 80's pop metal is concerned. There's a few legitimate speed metal moments (\"I'll Be Alright\" is pretty much the only song worth hearing on here), but much of this is pure Kiss worship. There are actually some decent bass lines on here, as the bass plays a much more integral role than it does on Pantera's later groove albums, but everything else is pedestrian at best. The riffs are lame, the drums are standard, vocalist Terry Glaze sucks, and the lyrics are full of cheesy innuendo. A far cry from the personal struggles chronicled in groove-era Pantera, these are desperate anthems for getting laid. If you're into glam, you might be able to find appeal in some of the catchy vocal melodies and guitar lines, but even Poison and Whitesnake never sucked this hard. \n\nEven Dimebag Darrell (then \"Diamond\" Darrell) fails to deliver here. Later in his career, his fantastic guitar solos made up for some of the shittier songs on Pantera albums, but here, his talent is still in its infancy. There are some cool leads, but most of them are just era-typical and far inferior to the work of the rising thrash metal bands at the time. \n\n\"So Metal Magic is sub-par glam. That's really not so bad.\" Agreed, except that the album's listenability is crippled by really, really shitty production. The guitar tone is thin and fuzzy, there's several equalizing errors, and there's too much emphasis put on the shitty synth effects when they roll around. No matter how cool somebody tries to tell you this album's title track is, just listen to the stupid echoing half-whispered chorus. Lame, lame, and fucking lame. \n\nI can't recommend this to anyone with a straight conscience. If you want to check out Pantera's old albums, skip over this one and go right to Projects in the Jungle onward.\n",
        "\nExtreme Steel Plus is an ep that can be described as just perfect, the only downfall is that it is 33 minutes short. It also features some songs that were previously only released on singles. Also included are one Ted Nugent cover and two Black Sabbath covers.\n\n\u201cRevolution is my name\u201d and \u201cHollow\u201d show off your typical Pantera-style songs, filled with out of this world riffs, heavy fitting lyrics intermixed with great softer periods. If these songs do not draw you in and make you forget about your own personal problems for a while then I don\u2019t know what will.\n\n\u201cCatch Scratch Fever\u201d, a Ted Nugent classic is reworked and brought up to a new extreme level of classic. The madman himself would be proud to hear his new heavier classic performed by a fellow guitar master.\n\nPlanet Caravan gives Dimebag a chance to showcase his excellent soft touch, as well as to pay tribute to Black Sabbath. On a side note if you really appreciate Dimebag\u2019s soft touch I would also recommend his tribute to Ace Frehley on \u201cSpacewalk\u201d. \u201cHole in the sky\u201d is another Sabbath classic that Pantera just makes their own.\n\nThe remaining tracks are live versions of two classic Pantera songs (\u201cWalk\u201d and \u201cFucking Hostile\u201d) that will never fail to get your adrenaline pumping.\n\nThis is an excellent EP that combines true classics, excellent tributes, and gives you a chance to hear Pantera perform live as well.\n",
        "\nThis album is a degenerative piece of crap. It\u2019s difficult to see what people see in this garbage. The only thing they accomplish is fulfilling every metal clich\u00e9 immediately available. Perhaps that\u2019s the reason why it has such an enduring popularity. The only reason this album exists is just to please a bunch of butt-rocking head bangers who care about nothing, except for beer and well, banging their heads against the wall. There is enough crap on this album to lower one\u2019s intelligence in such a manner. Repetitive song structures, laughable attempts at riffs and a pretentious macho guy attitude to boot is why this album sucks.\n\nOne aspect that makes this album so worthless is those lousy riffs. Of course, there is a variety of crummy riffs, they come in all shapes in sizes. There\u2019s blunt groove riffs that try to stress how heavy they are, and that\u2019s about it. Some of them are those tremendously irritating stop-go that surely must have inspired mall core bands to come. Just observe certain riffs; all of them contain their share of pathetic groove laden riffs with syncopated strumming on the top two strings and the frequent flowery melodic relief. The only exceptions are the following songs: \u201cHeresy\u201d, which is basically a collection of stolen Metallica riffs; \u201cCemetery Gates\u201c, which is a laughable display of emotion; \u201cShattered\u201c, which isn\u2018t too bad. Although they do contain a viable sense of melody, it is far from being well articulated. The melodies are put together like a pop album, they are mainly displayed as lead melodies for the sake of catching someone\u2019s attention, and to get them hooked. And with catchy riffs like these, any moron will be instantly attracted.\n\nThe worst crime here however, is the embarrassingly redundant song construction. Every single song is cyclical and utterly predictable beyond measure. One can even conclude that every song is composed exactly the same. They begin with some lame, unnecessary intro which then leads to the verse riff. The verse riff is repeated a certain number of times, which is then followed by a pre-chorus of some kind. If there is no pre-chorus, then it will lead directly to the chorus. The pattern is repeated, followed by a bridge decorated with an admittedly brilliant Dimebag guitar solo. Once Dimebag is done flashing his skills, the aforementioned pattern is repeated one last time. Every single song is outright predictable, one could literally sit there and guess what paths the song will take, and chances are, they will be correct most of the time.\n\nPantera does nothing special here, they only prove that you don\u2019t need to be an eloquent composer to impress a crowd of metal heads. There is nothing truly impressive about this, save for of course Dimebag\u2019s solos. On a side note, the macho man attitude is just so hysterically nonthreatening. This album almost deliberately degenerates into a pop album with metal riffs.\n",
        "\nFor those well tuned in to the history of metal, particularly its final days at the top in 1992, one will take note of several things. First, the recording industry signs a bunch of similar sounding bands such as Alice in Chains, Soundgarden, Pearl Jam, The Smashing Pumpkins, and a whole shit load of others for the express purpose of capitalizing on the new marketability of purposeless angst that followed the rise of Nirvana\u2019s Nevermind to No. 1 on the charts. Second, a whole collection of metal bands who enjoyed success in the 80s decide to try to appease those who hate them by trying to sound similar, one of the first being Pantera.\n\nAlthough this single, which my brother got off a friend who received it and had since grown out of it, is the best of what Pantera would offer at this time it reeks of mediocrity next to what they were capable of. The primary problem is Phil Anselmo\u2019s vocals, which are annoying as all fucking hell and grate on the ears like a broken chainsaw. \u201cRise\u201d, though musically being the best song off the entire Vulgar Display of Power album, is a shining example of how not to try to sound aggressive, and if it weren\u2019t for the amazing music going on behind him this would not qualify as metal.\n\n\u201cMouth for War\u201d offends in a similar manner in the vocal category, although again we have a damn fine collection of riffs that do much to cover the vocal frog farts, despite them being way too high in the mix. The breakdown section during the solo that precedes the faster section at the end is a solid homage to Black Sabbath, while the following fast section is a minimalist version of classic speed metal.\n\nThe live material is where this album really loses points as Phil Anselmo has proven unable to maintain the flash and flair in his voice during the recording sessions for \u201cCowboys from Hell\u201d. His vocals are not nearly as offensive as they would be on later tours following the releases of Driven and Trendkill, but they are definitely not worthy of what they are trying to sing along to. The truth is nothing Phil Anselmo has sung to since the year this was conceived can be qualified as inspired or outstanding.\n\nAs for who would want this album, mostly its old deluded fools who saw this as a continuation of the fight against the mediocrity of the Nirvana wave. Pantera wasn\u2019t kicking Kurt Cobain\u2019s ass with this music, they were kicking their own asses and the results of the current metalcore scene are connected with the subsequent self-mutilation. Speaking for myself, it\u2019s not a legacy I\u2019d be proud of, but considering the large collection of people who still defend Vulgar Display of Power and Far Beyond Driven, pride can easily be substituted with a large audience at your shows, regardless of the IQ level of those in attendance.\n",
        "\nPart 1:\n\nWhen one thinks of what was wrong with the 1990s, one will often think of the severe lack of direction that the music of the time had. Everyone was looking for the next new thing, regardless of whether or not it was a good or bad new thing. It is in times like these that we are offered genuine piles of crap like what is found on this single, a single that is genuinely not worth the CD that it was printed on.\n\nI have heard some pretty uninspired vocal performances in my career as a metal fan and musician, but Phil Anselmo\u2019s rendition of \u201cPlanet Caravan\u201d ranks high in my top 10 worse remakes ever category. His voice is completely devoid of any passion, feeling, or desire. This same guy who can scream his damned lungs out live about a \u201cNew Level\u201d (the vocals on the live version are a perfect reflection of the studio version in that they suck something awful and sound like the jock-ass uncle of Fred Durst) apparently can\u2019t seem to hold a tune at all on here, and the reason is obvious, he can\u2019t sing a song like this at all in his current state.\n\nWhen one remembers a better Phil singing to the acoustic line of \u201cCemetery Gates\u201d, one remembers a Phil that was a bit rough edged, but one that had the power to sing a chorus that was inspired due to his large range. What works against him here is that this song does not have a chorus where he could display his high range, even if he were still in possession of it at this point, mostly because the song is among one of the most non-metal songs ever put together by Black Sabbath. The fact that they would choose to remake this particular song is actually quite telling of the anti-metal nature of the music they were playing at this time.\n\nThe rest of the material found on here is pretty much par for the course for what you\u2019d get from a live performance of Pantera, a faithful remake of the same shitty Groove Metal with redundant riffs, piss poor vocals, and Dimebag Darrels inspired though out of place lead playing. If you already liked the stuff on \u201cVulgar Display of Power\u201d and \u201cFar Beyond Driven\u201d then you will like this single, otherwise don\u2019t bother with it. \n\nPantera will forever be mired by a duality that the metal faithful will no doubt remember as full blown hypocrisy, and that duality is the combination of possessing a great potential in terms of musicality yet have an overwhelming desire not to realize it in order to keep the mosh pits violent and the records selling to snot nosed punks who want to make believe for a few minutes that they are actually tough. If you\u2019re one of those prissy assed little punks and you really want a sense of nostalgia for your time dominating the metal scene, track down this single and then go fuck yourself while listening to it and staring at the band on the CD sleeve. If you\u2019re feeling nostalgic for good music, pick up a copy of \u201cCowboys from Hell\u201d.\n\nPart 2:\n\nWhen you have 2 releases of the exact same single, which is a cover song no less, containing a different collection of live perks you can tell that somebody is getting over promoted. Pantera\u2019s common ground with the Alternative Rock scene does not end with the rubber stamp given to them by the recording industry however, and this is where the point of contention lay. The principle problem here is that this band has a singer who flat out sounds like shit, and all of the studio effects in the world will change it, nor will all the best riffing out of Dimebag Darrel be able to hide it.\n\nObviously the principle problem with \u201cPlanet Caravan\u201d is that it is so vocally exposed that if the singer is unable to carry a pitch in a clean voice, anyone who listens will know it instantly. However, as we already hit this on the first incarnation of this musical feces pie, onto the one area I didn\u2019t touch, the Poison Idea cover song \u201cThe Badge\u201d, which managed to worm its way onto The Crow soundtrack along with a host of other lousy metalcore influenced stuff. Phil Anselmo has finally found a style worthy of his ass bound vocal style, although the cost of which is rendering Dimebag and the others into mere drone machines pumping out primitive riffs. In short, Phil Anselmo sounds good when not singing metal; hence those who think of him as a great METAL singer are sadly mistaken.\n\nAs for the live stuff on here, it\u2019s basically more of the same. We have one song on here from Far Beyond Driven which is obviously a boring half-assed Groove song with an extended acoustic intro. We also have a song from the Cowboys from Hell album that vocally is not overtly hostile to Phil\u2019s different voice, resulting in a slightly more pleasurable listen than his pathetic renditions of \u201cCemetery Gates\u201d on various live efforts.\n\nIn short, the younger brother of a piece of shit is still a piece of shit, although its younger so its not quite as dry and covered with insects. That is the relationship between this single and the other one bearing its name but lacking the \u201cPart 2\u201d next to it. But since this is Pantera, there is a sense of logic in the sentiment of \u201cWhy not put out one pointless single with a fucking cover song on it when we can have 2 and be twice as pointless\u201d, albeit logic in the sense that Pantera sees things. I don\u2019t see it their way, I don\u2019t dance to their music because I prefer to bang my head rather than nod it, so I don\u2019t recommend this be listened to by anyone.\n",
        "\nBut I can\u2019t. I really, really can\u2019t. The first problem with this album is the shitty production. When you take into consideration that Pantera produced this album themselves, you gotta\u2026 well\u2026 UGH, NO. There is no excuse for this; the majority of the other Pantera albums had amazing production. What happened here!? A huge disappointment\u2026\n\nThe lyrics on this release are shit. True, Pantera were never praised for their amazing songwriting\u2026 but they could\u2019ve written something better than:\n\n\u201cWhen I die, I cast a shadow\nAnd I'll fly, I cast a shadow\n\nEverybody get fucking up!\nI cast a shadow...\nI... I cast a shadow\nI cast a shadow...\nI... I cast a shadow\n\nWhen I die, I cast a shadow\nAnd I'll rise, I cast a shadow\u201d\n\nOne part of this CD that I had the highest hopes for before my first listen was the usual that\u2019s to be expected from Pantera: kickass guitar from Dimebag Darrel. As much as I hate to admit it, I haven\u2019t found that here either. No, don\u2019t get me wrong, there is SOME good playing from him (such as on Hellbound, probably the only song on here that compares to anything off of \u201cCowboys From Hell\u201d). But around 90% of the playing is boring, mediocre, weak, lame, shitty, unexciting, dull (need I think of more adjectives?) mallcore riffs. No, I\u2019m being perfectly serious. No more of Pantera\u2019s godly thrash solos. Mallcore riffs\u2026 gimme a break Darrel, what happened? \n\nThe songwriting in general (not talking about lyrics now, but music) is\u2026 well\u2026 sloppy. I can think of any other way to describe it. All the sounds seem to be forced together, and the vocals that are attempting to tie them all together failed miserably. Phil\u2019s voice is steadily dying out, as it could be starting to be heard of Vulgar Display of Power\u2026 It has gotten so weak; it just doesn\u2019t cut it anymore. Combined with the sloppy drumming, which is way off in a lot of parts, combined with Darrel\u2019s disappointing weak riffs create a mixture that is almost sickening to listen to.\n\nIt\u2019s quite a shame for Pantera to end their career this way, really. They started off with \u201cMetal Magic\u201d which was also terrible. Starting out with BAD glam/hair-metal, they evolved to one of my favorite power thrash bands of all time\u2026 and then once again turned to shit, this time in the form of mallcore that almost makes Trivium seem like a great band. Sad to see this happen to Pantera; they should\u2019ve called it quits ten years ago. \n\n-Marcin C.\n",
        "\nPantera are most known for their abrasive, ultra-heavy form of groove metal, most predominately displayed here. Sure, they didn't invent groove metal, but they popularized it for the masses and the dozens, if not hundreds, of imitators that would soon follow. Unfortunately for their imitators, the groove metal that they spawned on this album died with this album, and no other groove metal album would really go on to garner any serious respect in the metal community from this moment on.\n\nFirst of all, this album isn't entirely groove metal. Some leftover Cowboys from Hell style thrash shows its face in tracks like \"Fucking Hostile\" and \"Rise,\" and it makes them easily among the album's best tracks. The rest of the heaviness on this album is derived from the introduction of Pantera's soon to be signature groove riffing. And to be honest, I don't really mind it here. \"Mouth for War\" hits hard and fast, mixing some thrash riffing with groove riffing to make for a pretty heavy, pretty cool song. The best thing about this song is that one of the guys at Id Software ripped off the verse riff in MIDI form and included it in one of the levels of their legendary first-person shooter DOOM (I think they ripped off \"Rise\" too). Seemingly irrelevant, but for me, that sends my nostalgia meter off the charts. The most well known groove metal song of all time, \"Walk,\" is included here, but I actually like it. There's something about it's simplicity, especially since it's the first song of its kind that I ever heard, that makes it cool. The groove metal formula is clearly working well here, but I promise you, by the end of the album, you'll be convinced that's it died here as well. The second half of the album just gets tedious and old, with a bunch of unmemorable filler songs. Fortunately, it closes on a high note. The second power ballad of sorts is here. \"Hollow\" is magnificent and reminiscent of the mighty \"Cemetary Gates\" in its fusing of great clean riffing, meaningful lead work, and some powerful riffing. Unlike the earlier power ballad, \"This Love,\" which is the first sign of this album's inherent shittiness.\n\nThere's a lot of great, or at least decent, riffing on this album, but the guitar solos are one of its highlights. Every song gets A-list lead guitar treatment by Dimebag, from the classics to the most banal of the groove metal dregs. Everyone else does a decent job as well. The drumming and bass work are spot on, so I can't really form any complaints against them. The vocals, however, have clearly deteriorated from Cowboys from Hell. There's only a few moments where Phil actually sings, and even fewer moments when his screaming is tolerable. Again, it sounds cool at first, but by album's end, it becomes unbearable. And while the lyrics are okay here, every album after this one features shittier and shittier ones.\n\nWhat we have here is a highly overrated album, glorified more for its aggression and badassness than for its musical substance. This abrasive deconstruction of the once formidable Pantera would only continue as their albums went on, making this look far better by comparison, but it's still no masterpiece, by any means. Oh, and the cover art, while sort of brutal, is in no way the best picture of a guy getting his face destroyed by a fist. Check out Anthrax's Fistful of Metal to see and hear what a great metal album should look and sound like. At best, Vulgar Display of Power has its moments. At worst, it, along with Far Beyond Driven, influenced an entire generation of moshcore/groove metal bands that continue to plague the metal scene to this day. You might feel inclined to avoid it on principle, but at the end of the day, it's really not that bad.\n",
        "\nThis is the first Pantera album that's almost rendered unlistenable by an overwhelming emphasis on groove riffing and horrible screaming from once talented frontman Phil Anselmo. It's not entirely repugnant, but for the most part, absolute garbage.\n\nThe majority of the album is groove riffing. I should hate every second of it, but try as I might, the catchiness of the groove is hard to deny. Sure it's not the most balls out killer sound ever, but there is a certain heaviness to it that's undeniable. Certain songs really do this well, \"I'm Broken\" and \"5 Minutes Alone\" for instance. There are some psuedo thrash moments, but they're brief and generally the precursor to some incredibly banal groove shit. \"Strength Beyond Strength\" shows promise by thrashing it up for a bit, but eventually degenerates into more mindless grooving. The songs I've mentioned, plus maybe two more, are decent enough that the poor riffs don't completely destroy them. The rest of the album is trash, nothing more or less. The cover of \"Planet Caravan\" is interesting, but that song wasn't that great to start with.\n\nThe only other redeeming aspect of the album besides being something mindless to headbang to is Dimebag Darrell's guitar solos, but a guitar solo rarely justifies a shitty song, unless you're the type that likes to listen to 3-4 minutes of terrible wannabe metal to hear a 20-30 second guitar shred fest. To each his own, but the highlight certainly isn't anybody else in the band. Rex and Vinnie have a solid rhythm section I get, but they only really add to the overwhelming groove infection that makes up the whole of the album. Phil Anselmo just plain sucks. He doesn't even sound aggressive anymore, just tired and shitty. His performance here was probably the inspiration for countless Hatebreed-like mallcore bands and that's even more unforgivable than having to listen to him on this album.\n\nSo to recap: there's \"I'm Broken,\" a couple cool riffs in a few other songs, and some nice guitar solos. That constitutes maybe 8 minutes in music total, though the album is at least seven times that in length. So what's going on during all those other minutes? Not a damn thing. Not a damn thing worth listening to twice anyway. This is overrated if at all.\n",
        "\nPantera's legacy is not a pretty one. They began as shitty glam, evolved into some pretty sweet thrash, than degraded into shitty groove (despite the fact that they pretty much innovated that style of metal). Reinventing the Steel is their final futile effort to justify their overrated brand of sludgy groove-core garbage, and it's probably their worst album since their glam metal debut.\n\nDimebag Darrell is a phenomenal guitar player. His riff-writing on Cowboys from Hell was brilliant in execution and powerful in delivery. So why the fuck did he regress into pumping out shitty downtuned groove riffs? The rhythm guitar here is the spiritual precursor to Darrell's next band, Damageplan, and almost as bad as everything on that band's New Found Power album. His lead work is still good, but his solos encompass a very small part of the songs. The songs generally consist of agonizingly banal mallcore rhythms accompanied by Phil Anselmo's increasingly irritating vocal roars. The lyrics are garbage, plain and simple. The only memorable parts of the album are the guitar solos and a few occasional rhythm/drum collaborations, namely in \"Hellbound,\" \"Goddamn Electric,\" and \"You've Got to Belong to It.\" These moments are few and far between, and their rarity is the primary reason for this album's failure.\n\nWorst of all is the production. Inexcusably shitty. Their fucking glam albums sounded better than this. Perhaps its worth noting that the band produced this album themselves. It certainly shows.\n\nThis is a sad way to end the legacy of the same band that brought us the mighty Cowboys from Hell, and even the memorable Vulgar Display of Power. Reinventing the Steel reinvents nothing, only reinforcing the fact that groove metal lacks innovation and sucks major ass. Avoid this atrocity, it's an unfitting final release from an otherwise talented band.\n",
        "\nI picked up a second hand copy of this album a few months after it came out, and it immediately got a treatment that I rarely give a CD, a use of the repeat button on a single track in \u201cRevolution is my Name\u201d. At the time I was still occasionally tuning into VH1 and had seen the video several times. It always associated it with some of the better moments on the Trendkill release, which I had gotten into not long before. Recently I gave this one another listen and found out that there were some positive things going on here, though nothing that stood out as being phenomenal.\n\nPretty much we have 5 songs on here that qualify as good, while 2 others are listenable and the other 3 are completely groove dominated throwaways. I can\u2019t still figure out why Pantera resorted to writing more groove material, when it was being taken up by the likes of Limp Bizkit and other posers in the Nu-Metal scene. \u201cWe\u2019ll Grind that Axe for a Long Time\u201d is kind of self-refuting lyrically when you think about, it is bitching about the establishment, when in fact Pantera had pretty much become the establishment in their own right. They actually sought to protest the fact that pop bands keep recycling their material, and then proceeds to write a song about it over a set of riffs recycled from \u201cMouth for War\u201d, excuse me while I step aside for a moment to laugh my ass off.\n\nThings are slightly less ridiculous lyrically on \u201cYou\u2019ve got to belong to it\u201d, but the guitar riffs are fucking comical sounding as hell. Dimebag Darrel was a decent guitar player, although amongst the flock of shredders in the 80s he was par for the course, but here it just doesn\u2019t show at all. That annoying as hell high end guitar effect that he uses for the break down section just kills it for me, let alone the fact that we have way too much groovy repetition in the riff section. \u201cGoddamn Electric\u201d (Goddamn Boring would be more appropriate) has more groove, ergo it sucks as bad as most of their early 90s material. It\u2019s too fucking slow, the riffs are under-developed and dry sounding, and Phil\u2019s vocals sound as nauseating as they did on VDoP.\n\nOn the mediocre side of things, \u201cUplift\u201d has its moment, but is mostly a more up tempo variation of the same groove crap that I just went through. The main riff is solid, but repeated way too much. The bridge before the chorus sounds almost like something Jimi Hendrix would do. During the solo section things are pretty cool, and the guitar and bass have a brief lead duel, something rare for this band. \u201cI\u2019ll cast a shadow\u201d has a nice up tempo intro, but then it settles into a groove for the verse, and I begin to lose interest until the tempo picks up again. Phil is occasionally singing in a clean voice, which is a positive as even after 3 albums of screaming his lungs out he can\u2019t get that low death metal voice right at all. \n\nOn the more positive side of things, \u201cHellbound\u201d learns the lesson of previous albums and elects to keep things short, and properly balances out the groovy sections with the more Black Metal sounding chorus. \u201cYesterday don\u2019t mean shit\u201d has a hell of an awesome thrash riff in it, which almost sounding like it could have been on \u201cSeasons in the Abyss\u201d by Slayer. \u201cDeath Rattle\u201d is a great speed metal song featuring some solid riffing, unfortunately I had to go through 5 other songs to get to it, usually the fast cooker is track 2. \u201cIt Makes the Disappear\u201d starts off with a goofy guitar effect, but then gets cooking with another great thrash riff and basically keeps it interesting for the entire song.\n\nAnd the grand highlight of this album is the single \u201cRevolution is my Name\u201d, and it stands strong in it\u2019s delivery of a single message, this band is finally finished beating a dead horse. They got some good licks in on the decaying stallion corpse with Trendkill, but ultimately their glory days were gone with the end of the year 1991. This song encompasses all the best thrash ideas that were found on Cowboys from Hell and the few diamonds that you can pull out of the rough of VDoP and FBD, in addition to one last effort by Phil Anselmo to sing with his voice rather than fart through his mouth.\n\nNot long after this Pantera called it quits and they did it 8 years too late if you ask me. One of the common misconceptions people have about those who were angry with this band is that they were angry because they were successful, they may articulate that anger in such a way that one would think that, but actually the reason for the anger lay in the inferior product they put out. Vulgar Display of Power was a contrived piece of garbage that tried to marry thrash with groove metal, Far Beyond Driven was a slightly better produced version of the exact same thing, and the Great Southern Trendkill was a properly focused expression of rage towards the truly bad elements of human society. So where does this album fall into that mix you ask? It falls somewhere in between the first two and the third one, pure and simple. It has some nostalgic moments to it, most of them borrowed from better days; otherwise it is a self-contradictory attempt to free itself from its own success. When a person becomes the leader of a country, he is laughed at and called an idiot if he complains about the direction that it\u2019s going, because he is the one determining the direction. Pantera bitched about the mainstream, and continued to do so long after the mainstream made them rich for the musical compromises they made with it. It is fashionable non-conformity in the same vain as Kurt Cobain, only in his case he never had any great accomplishments to throw away, Pantera did and it will haunt them for the rest of their careers.\n\nIn conclusion, this CD is bargain bin material. Half of this album is good; the other half is either forgettable or painfully horrid. I bought this CD off a friend who didn\u2019t want it anymore for $6, and I still feel like I got ripped off as even today I could get the good songs off it for less through legal MP3 downloads, despite price inflation. The lost generation of early 90s metal heads who lived for the groove will like some of this, but everyone else should stick to real metal, something that Pantera had forgotten about a while ago\n",
        "\nI had just about given up on these guys after the past two albums, but something happened between this album and the last one that while they were on tour, because they actually found something that they had completely lacked on previous efforts. Both VDoP and FbD were loaded with attitude and intricate guitar solos, but the overall songs were about as unfocused as you could get. In addition to that, Phil Anselmo was not pulling off his newly adopted \"tough guy\" vocal approach at all and sounded more like a more masculine version of Kurt Cobain, but here he has done something equally rough yet much more metal appropriate with his voice.\n\nParticularly on the faster tracks, Anselmo has pumped a good deal of black metal style shrieks, which work a lot better than the quasi-Hetfield meets proto-metalcore sound that he had exhibited on the last 2 albums. It\u2019s not as individualistic or as varied as the brilliant vocal display he had exhibited on Cowboys from Hell, but it sounds a hell of a lot more metal. He still displays the flaws from previous efforts, but they have been cut back quite a bit and localized to a few specific tracks. \n\nThe lyrics also have a bit more focus, seeming mostly to be directed towards the band\u2019s sense of Southern Pride. Unlike the crowd of politically correct whores of the mainstream, I\u2019m not frightened by this, mostly because I haven\u2019t swallowed their propaganda about my country\u2019s history. Directly after recording their last album, Pantera had caught some shit because of a rant that Anselmo made on the topic of rap music and black pride. Phil Anselmo doesn\u2019t strike me as a bigot based on the company he keeps, particularly guitarist Kevin Bond of Superjoint Ritual who is half-black ( a race more often ridiculed by pure black Americans), and a life-long friend named Kirk Windstein is jewish. \n\nIn response to the flak that they caught, Pantera decided to give the guilt-drenched left wing the finger and released an album of unapologetic Southern Pride. This alone gives them points in my book as many bands had seen fit to pander to left-wing propaganda in recent years and basically suck the cock of socialism with their music. (*cough* MegaDeth). This is highly consequential as it is the primary drive of the lyrics, which are a breath of fresh air from the directionless-yet-fashionable non-conformity that the last 2 albums represented. To put it candidly, Pantera had finally got themselves a set of enemies worthy of the blind rage that they exhibited on this album, the mainstream media and the political left.\n\nMusically, the good far outweighs the bad, as Pantera has ratcheted up the tempo and the aggressiveness of their sound to something that transcended the boring groove sound that dominated their past 2 releases. Such high octane cookers as \u201cSandblasted Skin\u201d, the title track, and \u201cSuicide Note Part 2\u201d are loaded with evil as hell vocals, crushing guitar riff, and a pounding rhythm section that will probably blowout your speaker if you push the volume past 6. \u201cWar Nerve\u201d , \u201c13 Steps to Nowhere\u201d and \u201cThe Underground in America\u201d are a bit slower, but still equally as aggressive. Dimebag Darrel\u2019s soloing is getting even more effects driven, and there might be an argument that some of these solos influenced some of the lead guitarists of the current Black Metal scene.\n\nWhat we can call the ballads of this album are, in fact, quite interesting songs. \u201cSuicide Note Part 1\u201d is an all acoustic ballad with a synthesizer track that sticks out like a sore thumb. Anselmo\u2019s vocals are low and dark as hell, painting the picture of a man ready to end his own life. \u201cFloods\u201d is a bit overlong, but shows another rather gloomy vocal performance on the part of Anselmo, at times utilizing some odd effects in order to make his voice sound like he\u2019s underwater. The acoustic lines are quite gloomy sounding as well, although the true highlight of this song is Darrel\u2019s agitated guitar solo, which is my pick for the best one on this album.\n\nThe groove tracks on here are a bit mixed, but still a monster improvement from the last album. \u201cDrag the Waters\u201d sees a more polished vocal performance, although it\u2019s still a bit long for a groove track. The cowbell in the drum line is a nice touch, underscoring the Southern spirit of the album. \u201c10\u2019s\u201d is my pick for the weakest track on here, it has too many of those annoying as hell micro-bends that have that Korn sound to it. \u201cLiving through me\u201d has too much groove as well, in addition to some structural meandering. This time it\u2019s a bit more forgiveable, as using the skip button 2 times is a hell of a step up from using it 6 or 7 times.\n\nIn conclusion, this album is a step up from previous efforts with this new sound that Pantera would continue to exhibit until their ultimate demise. Among the releases that they had in the 1990s (excluding \u201cCowboys from Hell\u201d, which was seen as an 80s album by nearly everyone) this one is the best. It doesn\u2019t shack up to the musical greatness that they had on their first 2 albums with Anselmo, but it is worth the money. This album comes recommended to fans of Black Metal, Death Metal, and all other aggressive styles with mostly toneless screams. The rage on here is focused, it\u2019s well directed, and it hits its intended adversary, the cult of guilt and unquestioning conformity.\n",
        "\nThis album had a bright future of collecting dust on my shelf for the past 8 years, but I recently got it out again as I have tried to reconcile my present opinions as both a musician and a reviewer with the rather morbid history that was the music of the early to mid-90s. This album pretty much gets less hatred from me than the last one because of a slightly better production and some better riffs. However, the critical flaws in the style that Pantera had adopted since VDoP have now been magnified, and a connection with the source of the corruption can be seen clear as day.\n\nIn response to rather incomplete take on history Brocashelm provided, I will now seek to correct what I believe is an oversight in the nature of music history. There were far greater things going on musically in 1994 than what was presented before us, and naturally at the time it would have been both difficult and costly to invest the needed money to import the music I speak of. Power Metal had been kicked down, but as underscored by the continuing presence of bands such as Gamma Ray, Blind Guardian and Helloween it was far from finished. Other bands such as Angra, Kamelot, and Nocturnal Rites were just starting to hit the scene and were achieving great success outside the States. Furthermore, if history proves accurate, Dio and MegaDeth were still pumping out music and challenging the notion that groove was the key to saving metal.\n\nLet it be stated plainly that the value of music or any other art is not determined by public will, if that were the case, the best art would be pornography and wallpaper. So what if \u201cFar Beyond Driven\u201d debuted at No. 1? If the masses can be ignorant for throwing their money away on wallpaper pop act geared towards public consumption, what makes it better that metal bands get them to do the same thing on musical diarrhea tailored for the same purpose? I couldn\u2019t give a damn if a heavy album debuted at number 1, what I\u2019m concerned about is whether or not it\u2019s actually enjoyable to listen to.\n\nFurthermore, the fact that Metallica saw fit to tour for as long as they did is the key to understanding the reason for the chain of events that would follow. The bands who survived the hostile takeover that the Grunge scene incited, guided by the recording industry, were the ones who compromised with the so-called caprices of said scene in terms of song creation. That\u2019s right my friends, Pantera sold their souls to the groove and spat on the face of what metal stood for, defying conventions. There is nothing more conventional than creating music that you can tap your foot and nod your head to, and that is what defines the lion\u2019s share of Pantera\u2019s music. We\u2019re not angry with Pantera because they sold a lot of records; we are pissed at them because they put out music that sucked.\n\nNo offense to fans of Pantera, but what the hell do you mean by showing the Metallica kids the real shit? What I hear on this album is actually a bastardized version of the same groove that we find on Metallica\u2019s \u201cBlack Album\u201d, though with frog farts acting as vocals and some more emotionally driven lead work. I don\u2019t despise the Black Album nearly as much as others do, but I do know what the results of its undeserved success have been and one of them is this album. The more radio friendly tracks in particular bear a strong resemblance to such Metallica tracks as \u201cDon\u2019t Tread on Me\u201d and \u201cEnter Sandman\u201d, particularly the lack of development of the riffs. But the flaws don\u2019t end there obviously.\n\nWe have some songs that are not only skip-worthy, they are completely revolting. \u201cGood Friends and a Bottle of Pills\u201d is nothing more than a collection of repetitive and boring riffs with Phil Anselmo either blabbing random bullshit in that corny low speaking voice of his or screaming unintelligible nonsense in a hideous set of grindcore style screams. I\u2019m not going to quote any of the lyrics, because quite frankly they are so utterly idiotic that I fear killing brain cells if I get them in my head while typing them. When you put the horrible spoken and yelled lyrics and the disjointed guitar sounds, you have the essential blueprint for every Korn song that has ever been recorded.\n\nWe\u2019ve got a large collection of groove tracks as well, some of them being far too long for their own good. Both \u201c25 Years\u201d and \u201cHard Lines, Sunken Cheeks\u201d break the 6 minute mark, which is way too long for something that constantly grooves, speaking nothing for the goofy ass lyrics that dominate the sung parts. As Voltaire put it best \u201cAnything too stupid to be said is sung\u201d. \u201cThroes of Rejection\u201d and \u201cBecoming\u201d have a strong amount of groove, but are thankfully shorter and have more interesting riffs and some good change ups. \u201cShedding Skin\u201d is our token ballad on here, and like on the previous album it is injected with plenty of boring groove sections. \n\nNaturally, as was the case with the previous collection of musical abortions VDoF, we have some tracks that are highly listenable and loaded with intrigue. The opening number \u201cStrength Beyond Strength\u201d and \u201cUse My Third Arm\u201d are coated with some amazing speed/thrash sections., particular the latter which has some amazing drum work in it. \u201cSlaughter\u201d is mostly devoid of boring groove sections and has some fast sections that flirt with thrash. All of these songs have their fair share of Phil Anselmo noise, but it works much better with the faster sections of the songs.\n\nNow let us get to the matter of the mainstream friendly tracks as they are the primary reason for the album\u2019s success. Essentially \u201c5 Minutes Alone\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m Broken\u201d are more vocally aggressive versions\u2019 of the various singles that came off the Black Album. There is a rather interesting and probably non-coincidental parallel between the amount of development of the main riff of Metallica\u2019s \u201cEnter Sandman\u201d and the main riff of \u201cI\u2019m Broken\u201d. And much like its predecessor, this riff is banged out over and over until it\u2019s drilled into your skull. In fact, the cover art depicting a man getting his head drilled is a rather fitting analogy to the way the mid-90s groove metal was presented to the masses, and the excruciating pain that the old metal faithful probably felt as they were indoctrinated into this corrupt version of the music they love.\n\nWe then close this album off with a cover of Black Sabbath\u2019s \u201cPlanet Caravan\u201d, which is 100% unchanged save Phil\u2019s vocals, which actual succeed in sounding weaker on a ballad than Ozzy Osbourne was when the song was first recorded. Although one might think this song a rather pointless bonus track, it helps to demonstrate the large musical void that existed at the time. In the 90s, there was no innovation, to suggest otherwise is to tell the greatest lie of all time. Every band took their sound from the achievements of former rock acts, most of them zeroing in on one specific album by a band in order to achieve it. Grunge and Groove Metal were both taken from Black Sabbath, and both missed the point what that band signified. They were not a force for stagnation, nor were they a band defined merely by darkness, they were a band that believed in the principle of musical progression, of breaking down barriers, not building them up like prison walls and then calling it innovation. \n\nIn conclusion, although we have a cleaner production on this release, it is still the same expression of musical bankruptcy that was observed on its predecessor. Don\u2019t waste your money on this piece of garbage, for there is better music out there to be heard. \u201cFar beyond Driven\u201d is blight on the history of heavy metal, but it is nonetheless a thing of history, and there it ought to remain as a lesson for future generations on what happens when metal compromises with the will of the public.\n",
        "\nBack in the year 1992, the musical world was essentially collapsing down onto itself, as the recording industry was reveling in its newly found ability to completely destroy a musical scene and then rebuild it as it saw fit. Nearly everyone I\u2019ve debated on the fall of metal in the early 90s say the same thing, \u201cit was inevitable\u201d. Bullshit! Things are only inevitable when no one stands up and acts in opposition to what is happening. The fall of metal back into the underground that it came raging out of back in the late 70s was brought about not just by the disease of \u201cGrunge\u201d, but also by the willing submission to that takeover by bands like Pantera.\n\nThe question revolving around how Pantera could have helped in destroying metal is the concept of \u201cThe Groove\u201d. Many have alluded to this in reviewing both this album and the ones that came after it, all of which were piles of crap that happened to be sugar-coated with some amazing guitar soloing. Essentially when music grooves, it doesn\u2019t go anywhere, we don\u2019t get change ups, we don\u2019t get contrast, we simply get the groove. We don\u2019t get intricate riffs, we don\u2019t get soaring banshee screams and clean low vocals, we merely get the groove. We don\u2019t get music: we don\u2019t get art, WE GET THE FUCKING GROOVE!!!\n\nThe true nature of the groove is fully realized in only a small number of the tracks on here, the most blatant example being the pretentious and utterly terrible song \u201cWalk\u201d, but its presence is seen in nearly all the songs on here. To be fully forthcoming, I don\u2019t despise the groove in itself, but I do if it interferes with the musical value of the album. This album bears almost no resemblance at all to \u201cCowboys from Hell\u201d other than the guitar solos; it sounds like a third-rate punk band with Eddie Van Halen playing the lead tracks. \n\nAs much as I hate to say it, Pantera did something truly groundbreaking on this god awful release; they managed to completely piss away a great sound in favor of innovation gone haywire. This album, in its entirety, is probably one of the most blatant musical self-contradictions I\u2019ve ever encountered. You\u2019ve got amazing lead guitar work and drum work meshed with boring as all hell groove riffs and probably the worst attempt at death metal vocals I\u2019ve ever heard. Phil Anselmo probably had the most versatile and powerful voices of the late 80s, and he would throw it all away on trying to sound like a dying bullfrog (which is the only thing he succeeds at). \n\nAlthough this particular release has its share of stand out tracks that I can not only tolerate, but actually enjoy, they number a rather pathetic 5 out of 11. Out of these the obvious winner is the opener \u201cMouth for War\u201d, which contains a solid set of thrash riffs and an amazing set of guitar solos. Phil Anselmo is not breaking the high ground as he was 2 years ago, but among the songs on here is voice is not overtly ridiculous, as is the case on many others. \u201cFucking Hostile\u201d, despite having a rather stupid sounding title, is an amazing speed fest that actually reminds me a lot of the faster sections of Type O Negative\u2019s \u201cWe hate everyone\u201d. This is essentially high octane punk rock with a guitar player who actually has his shit together. Anselmo\u2019s singing on here is fairly ridiculous, but it works well with the hyper speed guitar riffs and blast beats.\n\n\u201cThis Love\u201d has a nice quiet section with some somber low singing, reminding a lot of the softer sections of \u201cCemetery Gates\u201d. The chorus is a bit repetitive, but the riffs are fairly solid and the solo is crazy as all hell. \u201cRise\u201d kicks off with an amazing speed metal intro, and then settles into an up tempo set of thrash riffs. The lyrics are actually quasi-intelligent, and take some good shots at the education system. \u201cRegular People (Conceit)\u201d has a great set of introductory guitar riffs, which thankfully are not accompanied by Anselmo\u2019s annoying ass grunts. The lyrics on this one are kind of stupid, but the singing mostly sounds like a decent James Hetfield impersonation, which has its redeeming qualities on a song like this.\n\nEverything else on this album is skip-worthy, ranging from the 100% terrible to the mostly bad. \u201cA New Level\u201d has probably the most utterly boring introductory section, followed by a somewhat interesting faster section. Essentially the true killer of this track are the vocals, which are intelligible, but utterly hideous sounding. \u201cNo Good (Attack the Radical)\u201d starts out with a decent riff, but as soon as the vocals kick in we have something that sounds like bad metalcore, loaded with quasi-rapped, quasi-screamed nonsense. The chorus is slightly less ridiculous, but still has the core sound to it. \u201cLive in a Hole\u201d has a nice guitar solo at the beginning, including some rather cool talk-box effects. However, the corrupting presence of both Anselmo\u2019s dead frog vocals and the groove pretty much kill the body of the song. \n\n\u201cBy Demons Driven\u201d has a rather generic sounding intro riff, in addition to an out-of-tune unison bend that is probably where Korn got their inspiration for all of their music. We\u2019ve got a good amount of groove on this one, with the occasional changes in feel which amount to nothing more than mindless meandering. \u201cHollow\u201d has a nice acoustic line for the first half of the song, and I can actually tolerate Phil Anselmo\u2019s voice because he is actually singing, although you can tell that he\u2019s already blown out his higher range. However, the second half of the song sees the electric guitars kick in and the return of that fucking annoying groove. \n\nHowever, the true viral corruption, the true reason why I hate this album as a whole, is the 5 minute plus groove-fest \u201cWalk\u201d. Back in 1993 this fucking song was all over the place, and even though I was a full-blown Kurt Cobain freak at the time, I couldn\u2019t stand this song. It\u2019s the same damned 3 notes banged out over and over for the first minute, and although we have some occasional held out power chords, like a bad habit the damned 3 note groove manages to worm its way into the verse, the pre-chorus, and the damned chorus. Truth be told, I don\u2019t think there is a damned verse or chorus in this song, there is only the groove, it\u2019s just there, grooving, not moving, just grooving.\n\nThe lyrics to this song are so utterly brainless and pretentious that they deserve to be satirized for the next century. \u201cRe...spect\u2026.Walk\u2026.Are you talkin\u2019 to me!\u201d, what the hell are you singing about Phil? In my experience, when someone feels obligated to shout at the top of your lungs that you\u2019re manly, there must be some question in the matter. To give you the brutally honest truth, as this album claims to be doing, if you want to prove your manhood you can do so by doing something with yourself. Grabbing a microphone and doing nothing but bragging about how much of a tough guy you are is the same as a whore grabbing one and boasting about how many guys she\u2019s been nailed by. \n\nBasically to sum up, this album underscores the pretentious angst that was on full display in nearly every mainstream act during the early to mid-90s. Although now the self-proclaimed \u201cDimebag\u201d Darrel has not given up on shredding up some amazing solos, this is about the only thing that is remotely metal about this album, everything else here contains the building blocks of grade A mallcore, mostly of the Korn variety. The riffs are redundant and boring, save the exceptions that I noted previously. Furthermore, I\u2019m probably going to piss off a lot of people by saying this, but Phil Anselmo\u2019s vocals on this album and subsequent releases are more reminiscent of Fred Durst than they are of Charles Schuldiner. Did Pantera help usher in the generation of mallcore posers that we still hear about even today? It\u2019s tough to say, but I suspect that their concession to the same groove style may have been a model for others.\n\nIn conclusion, I can not give this album my recommendation; it is a truly painful listen. If you really want to get a taste of the better parts of this album, go onto itunes and download \u201cMouth for War\u201d or \u201cRise\u201d. If you simply love Dimebag\u2019s soloing and can stand a little bit of extreme S&M style pain, you may give this album a whirl, but definitely go for a used copy out of the bargain bin.\n",
        "\nPantera was one of those bands that just were never in the right place at the right time. They had all the ability to break out into the 80s metal scene and challenge most of the others, but for some reason their music just didn\u2019t seem to take. Under such circumstances, it is quite natural that after 7 years of fighting to get a head in the glam scene, the band would want to take a different road. What \u201cCowboys from Hell\u201d represents is an affirmation of the overall spirit of metal, but with a good deal more aggression than their last album, but still the same signature solos and over-the-top vocal acrobatics. \n\nThe primary distinction between this album and \u201cPower Metal\u201d is the lyrical subject matter, which has more to do with the darker side of life rather than the clich\u00e9 80s party hearty approach that dominated their previous efforts. In addition, although he has continued to belt out the high notes, Phil Anselmo is now incorporating the rougher low range associated with the thrash genre. Think of a combination between Rob Halford and James Hetfield, both sides of the coin complementing each other rather than fighting each other. \n\nAlthough the riffs on this album are a bit heavier, there are a lot of similarities in the guitar work on here with that of \u201cPower Metal\u201d. We have a strong collection of mid-tempo rockers, combined with an increased number of speed metal tracks. However, as some bands were starting to shy away from the shredding that had dominated the threshold of the 80s, Diamond Darrel was still tearing it up with the best of them, and exploring the various unconventional approaches to guitar effects first pioneered by his inspiration Eddie Van Halen.\n\nWe kick of this masterpiece with the title track, and right away we can tell something is different by the weird guitar intro (it almost sounds like a train), followed by a much heavier set of riffs than heard previously. This track tends mostly towards the more mid-tempo feel, but is loaded with power and amazing guitar work. \u201cPrimal Concrete Sledge\u201d is pure thrash in the mold of acts like Overkill and early MegaDeth, loaded with fast drum work and heavily minimalist riffs. \u201cPsycho Holiday\u201d is a more groove oriented thrash in the mold of \u201cJump in the Fire\u201d, but loaded with some rather rapid changes in feel, and an army of contrasting riffs. The solo on this one probably bears the most similarity to a thrash solo in the Mustaine/Friedman vain, though painted with the occasional Van Halen inspired screech.\n\n\u201cHeresy\u201d has another interesting Van Halen inspired intro, although what follows is pretty much Metallica inspired thrash. One thing I can say for these guys, when they do their Metallica worship, it works a lot better than when all the others do it. \u201cCemetery Gates\u201d is one of the highlights of this album, combining together a very dreary acoustic section with a set of heavy riffs. This song gets my pick for best lead guitar/guitar solo work, and my second pick for vocal performance. \u201cDomination\u201d is more up tempo thrash with some straight-forward riffs, though a bit heavier. The Metallica worship is starting to get a bit obvious at this point, although as it is still being done well I\u2019m not complaining.\n\n\u201cShattered\u201d is another highlight of this album, in this case for the extremely intricate vocal performance on the part of Phil Anselmo. Sometimes it reminds me of \u201cPainkiller\u201d, at others it reminds me of \u201cTrapped Under Ice, but in both cases it cooks relentlessly. \u201cClash with Reality\u201d is another thrash classic with some extremely aggressive guitar and drum pounding, and more Halford worship as only Anselmo can do it. \u201cMedicine Man\u201d is another quasi-groove oriented rocker with some Doom inspired spoken narrations before launching into more amazing banshee wails. Another series of great guitar solos in this one, showcasing how non-contradictory the Van Halen approach to shredding is with the groove variety of thrash.\n\n\u201cMessage in Blood\u201d has some great contrasting quiet and loud sections, thought a bit less gloomy, yet vile sounding than \u201cCemetery Gates\u201d. Another great guitar solo here, loaded with amazing pentatonic licks and some neat feedback and harmonization effects. \u201cThe Sleep\u201d has a nice classical guitar intro to it, though it ultimately ends up being another mid-tempo Metallica homage. We then close this magnum opus with the riff driven and change-up happy, \u201cThe Art of Shredding\u201d. The tempo is ratcheted up again in many parts of this song, after a set of slower tracks, as the drums have become a main focus yet again. Darrel has put some really great effects on his guitar, as this solo is amazingly agitated yet simultaneously beautiful.\n\nThere is ultimately only one drawback to this album, and that is that it didn\u2019t function as the influential piece of art that it was, but was instead a transitional album into a dark time for music. Ultimately only one song off this album would be treated as something worthy of emulating, and that is \u201cPsycho Holiday\u201d. Although a great song, it alone can not do justice to the amazing genre that spawned it, and ultimately would lead to its exile from the mainstream. Even sadder still, Phil Anselmo decided to dumb his vocal style down to mere death grunts, rather than continue working with his versatile range to challenge the musical mediocrity that was fast approaching.\n\nIn conclusion, this album is a brilliant hybrid of thrash and power, from start to finish. Fans of thrash and power metal alike will find plenty of head-banging good music to latch onto. Perhaps in time, this album may become the inspirational collection of songs that will help bring thrash back from the gutter here in the States, after the right set of musicians decide to start emulating it. I proudly give it my full endorsement and state without any hesitation that it is the greatest album ever to be put out by this band, and one of the 5 greatest albums of 1990.\n",
        "\nIt can be plainly stated that the 80s was a time of excess, be it in the realm of partying, of image, but more importantly of music. The music of the 80s was in all respects excessive, be it the technical prowess, the lyrical subject matter, and the overall musicality. Bands of the highest caliber poured their heart and soul into the music and injected the belief that in order to be a star, you had to earn it with a talent in your field. The guitar players were obligated to fulfill and even surpass their potential, drummers were demanded to sound loud and thunderous, bassists had to be rock solid, and singers had to be able to cover the better part of both the masculine and feminine ranges with an almost neurotic sense of drama and intrigue.\n\nThis album came in at the height of those excesses, 1988, the year that Iron Maiden put out the most musically ambitious album of their career and Judas Priest kicked it up a serious notch with \u201cRam it Down\u201d. Although it resembles the latter more than the former, \u201cPower Metal\u201d has the spirit of Iron Maiden on full display. This is a band that was not only hell bent for technical intrigue and high octane power metal, it was raging for an audience, and unfortunately they would not get the level of attention that most of the bands that influenced them did.\n\nAlthough ever member of the band is amazingly accomplished at their instruments, Phil Anselmo and Dimebag (then Diamond) Darrel steal the show from start to finish. Phil has an absolutely astonishing range, and although the true versatility of it would be shown on the more thrash-oriented \u201cCowboys from Hell\u201d, we can tell that he is the singer\u2019s singer. Most of the time he sounds like a combination of Rob Halford/Udo Dirkschneider but occasionally during his brief mid-ranged singing we hear a bit of Axel Rose. Darrel\u2019s solos and riffs are absolutely amazing, as he is clearly modeling the Van Halen approach to solo effects and technical flair. His riffs are more reminiscent of Judas Priest and other of the NWOBHM, but the spirit of the songs has an LA tinge to it.\n\nThis release is not your typical 80s glam LP, it can easily be listened to all the way through without the need of the skip button. It is well paced and switches smoothly between the mid-tempo rock tunes and the speed metal. \u201cRock the World\u201d and \u201cProud to be Loud\u201d are obviously Twisted Sister influenced, containing fairly straight-forward riffs, although I must say that the solos are quite a cut above anything that those guys ever attempted. \u201cP.S.T. \u201888\u201d (pussy tight) is a bit humorous, but still loaded with some excellent guitar work. \u201cWe\u2019ll meet again\u201d and \u201cHard Ride\u201d are the obligatory ballads, but damned if you can\u2019t tell by all the loud guitars and crazy vocals. \u201cOver and Out\u201d and \u201cDown Below\u201d are heavily trash oriented and give the older guard like Metallica and MegaDeth a good run for their money.\n\nHowever, the two clear winners on this release are the two fastest speed metal tracks on here. \u201cPower Metal\u201d carries the same name as the genre of metal that is my absolute favorite, and for good reason to. From start to finish it is a massive double bass driven assault with a riff that would seem more at home with a band like Overkill rather than a band with a glam image. \u201cBurnnn\u201d is pure Judas Priest/Riot worship, sounding actually a lot like the title track to \u201cRam it down\u201d. Great lead and back up vocals on this, particularly during the highly catchy chorus.\n\nIn conclusion, this album represents all that was great about the 80s, and its treatment by the band that produced it in the early 1990s is a clear indication of what was wrong with that time. A lot of amazing bands suddenly got this idea into their heads that they should feel guilty for creating fun and amazingly technical music. If you want to know why the 80s died the way they did, look not only to the garbage producing \u201cGrunge\u201d acts that replaced them, also look to how willingly they gave up their thrown and how pathetically some actually went out of their way to join ranks with inferior musicians. This album comes recommended to fans of late 80s speed/power metal, as well as people who love great shred style guitar playing that rivals that of George Lynch and Yngwie Malmsteen. Unfortunately this album is probably destined to go out of print, and the surviving members of the band still seem to feel guilty over their former greatness, so if you manage to find a copy of it I would suggest clinging to it for the rest of your life.\n",
        "\n\u201cSo out of the darkness and into the light\u201d, A lyric taken from the powerhouse opening song, perfectly sums up this whole album. \n\nAfter four glam-rock albums, although \u201cPower Metal\u201d had some transition elements, something as heavy as \u201cCowboys from Hell\u201d was highly improbable. Driven by the rhythm section of Rex Brown and Vinnie Paul, and, of course, Diamond Darrell\u2019s (as he was known then) powerful and forceful riffing. Phil Anselmo provides his best vocal performance with the band. Instead of simply grunting or barking the lyrics, he shows off his vocal talents and I must say he is talented. The music is groovy and thrashy, without falling prey to just sounding like any other band which helps this album stand out from the rest.\n\nAlso the incredible production of Terry Date is worth mention. He makes the whole thing feel tight, without feeling smothered. \n\nThe album starts off with a bang, with the now metal classic, title track \u201cCowboys from Hell\u201d. \u201cCowboys from Hell\u201d contains one of the most instantly recognizable riffs ever made, and is hands down the best track on the album.\n\n\u201cPrimal Concrete Sledge\u201d follows and is seems to be a showcase for Vinnie Paul\u2019s drumming skills, but also contains one of the best solos on the album. \u201cPsycho Holiday\u201d comes next, which it is my favorite song on the album, has one of the grooviest feels of the whole album.\n\nAfter \u201cHeresy\u201d and \u201cCemetery Gates\u201d the album starts to sound bland. Truth be told, the first half really carries this whole album. While the songwriting is solid throughout some of the songs fall suspect to sounding like the one before it and after it. The last track \u201cThe Art of Shredding\u201d is a perfect way to the album, showing off the awe-inspiring guitar prowess of Diamond Darrell.\n\n\u201cCowboys from Hell\u201d is arguably the best thing Pantera ever put to record. This is the band at their songwriting peak, before any rifts or drugs got in the way of the music. \n\nThis is Pantera\u2019s breakthrough into the big time and if you could only have one Pantera album this is the one to get.\n",
        "\nThe 1996 LP, The Great Southern Trendkill, is an often overlooked classic from Pantera which is a stark contrast from Cowboys From Hell, Vulgar Display Of Power and Far Beyond Driven. Phil Anselmo\u2019s vocals are no longer as authoritative and dominant as the previous three releases, but the bile and resentment he spews forth is as palpable as ever. Dimebag hasn\u2019t missed a step, and you\u2019ll know that it hasn\u2019t as soon as the first track finishes. Rex and Vinnie are solid in their respective roles as usual, and the quartet works wonderfully in harmony. This album features extensive overdubbing, but I don\u2019t feel that it takes away from the quality at all. One example of this is Phil\u2019s screams, which again do not detract from the album.\n\nThe album begins very strongly with the opening title track, which is as intense as Hell. From Phil\u2019s screams to the drums and guitars which pummel the listener upside the head, the song soon segues into fairly groovy, but still vicious section which is fantastic. It sounds like a snake weaving along the floor, which makes the album cover look apropos. Next up is War Nerve which is totally brutal (in the best sense of the word) and features angry and hostile vocals. Lovely. Drag The Waters is more of the same, but it\u2019s quite catchy all the same. So far, so good.\n\nThe next two tracks are 10\u2019s and 13 Steps To Nowhere, which honestly aren\u2019t all that special at all. I skip these if I\u2019m listening to individual tracks, but I won\u2019t if I pop in the CD. 10\u2019s is one of the more mellow songs here, but is still pretty powerful. The vocals get repetitive and the riffs are ordinary, but overall it isn\u2019t a terrible song. 13 Steps To Nowhere is like the first three tracks, but not as good because it drags along sluggishly in places. It\u2019s hard to put it any other way, really.\n\nNext up we have Suicide Note Pt. I and Pt. II as separate tracks. The former is played with an acoustic and features no drumming (if I recall correctly) and is as least Pantera as Pantera could be. The latter needs little introduction as all of the extreme attributes mentioned earlier \u2013 resent, bile, intensity, viciousness etc. \u2013 all come out in this one song and pierces your heart with its hatred. Both of these are great, and although they contrast greatly from one another, they somehow work together.\n\nLiving Through Me (Hell\u2019s Wrath) is forgettable, and what\u2019s worse is the lengthy boring part near the middle. The riffs are uninspired and nothing really clicks here. I never feel remorseful for skipping this one, which is what I never do for the next song: Floods. Floods is a somber ballad and is calm early on, and is beautiful. Once the song picks up it gets really good, especially with Dime\u2019s highly memorable solo which lasts about a minute. This solo is too beautiful to describe. Other parts of this song have powerful riffs with \u201cdie, die\u201d vocals which command control. This is easily the best song on here.\n\nLastly we have The Underground In America and (Reprise) Sandblasted Skin. The former segues into the latter so well that it might as well have been the one song, and both share identical riffs in parts. They grab the listener\u2019s attention and picks up the tempo from before Floods, and it\u2019s a fitting way to end the album.\n\nOverall, any classic songs on this are pretty much few and far between, however most of it is well-above solid and hard-hitting. Although some tracks are merely okay, they\u2019re perfect to listen to while listening to the album the whole way through. For me personally listening to the whole thing is a joy, and it makes me wonder why this is so overlooked and/or underrated. For a fan of metal in general you should definitely check this out. For a fan of Pantera, this is definitely essential shit right here.\n",
        "\nWhile most people i know argue which Pantera album is better, \"Cowboys\" or \"Vulgar\", i see The Great Southern as the best piece of music these guys ever record. The album is different from their earlier stuff by becoming more brutal, more known to the power of rock and roll and by giving more metal that's rooted with southern music. This album shows from where Dimebag and Vinnie really came from.\n\nThe album starts with a scream of Phil that continues to one of the most brutal song Pantera ever released, named as the title. After that come the heavy riffs songs \"War Nerve\" and \"Drag the Water\". \"Let the war nerve break\" says Phil at the second song and that's exactly what's happening in the chorus of \"13 steps to nowhere\" (who have some vary hard lyrics like \"A backwards swastika/The black skin riddled in lead/A Nazi Gangster Jew/It beats a dog that's dead\") and \"Suicide Note pt.2\" who combines with the acoustic pt.1 to a songs which talks about the 2 sides of suicide - suicide as the escape from life by drugs in part 1, and suicide the cowardly act in different way to die in part 2. These 2 tracks to me personally are the most 2 powerful songs Pantera ever record, delivering such a strong subject in 2 ways that are so different from each other.\nAfter it comes the fast opening of \"Living through Me (Hell's Wrath)\", and after him the amazing rock and roll song \"Floods\" the shows one of Dimebag best solos. The album closes with the more slow heavy song \"The Underground in America\" and after him the speed metal song \"Sandblasted Skin (Reprise)\".\nThe present of the South America sound can be sensed in all of those songs, if it's Dimebag guitar, Phil voice or any other thing in it.\n\nThis album didn't have the respect he should have got. Through \"Drag the Waters\" is the only song in this album who released as a video, and the only one who was put in Pantera \"Greatest Hits\" record. This albums contains some of Pantera best work, with no pose, not trying to be trendy and just do what they do best - some KICK ASS METAL.\n\n\n\"The trend is over and gone forever\" - Long Live The South.\n",
        "\nMary, Mother Of God did Pantera reach the peak of their powers here! This is the full metal sound they decided on in 1986 influenced by James Hetfield soaking Dimes glam posters in phlegm, the more ballsy Anselmo joining the ranks and from footage from live shows in 1986 they state they're a metal band whilst doing Priest and Keel covers.\n\nHere all of the elements of their music are in their prime. Anselmo is 5 times the singer Terry Glaze was and this, along with Cowboys, is his finest performance of his career. That INCLUDES Superjoint Shitual, Down, any of his shitty side projects and the post-Cowboys Pantera albums. But because of his glammy 80's image he's in denial this music exists. Retard.\n\nThe riffs here are even heavier and as the other reviewers have said it is almost thrash because of this and the drumming which is also heavier. Add to the mix some sublime solos and this album's one of Dimebags' greatest achievements. Rest In Peace. \\m/\n\nIt's hard to single out the best tracks here because from start to finish it's high quality, but the tracks that have to be heard are the title track, \"We'll Meet Again\" which is a prelude to \"Cemetary Gates\", A ballad with great heavy riffs, \"Death Trap\" could easily have walked onto the \"Cowboys From Hell\" and \"Burnnn\" is \"Defenders Of The Faith\" on smack!\n\nThe production isn't as good as Cowboys From Hell but the songwriting is better in places because of the better sense of melody. It's very much a heavily Priest influenced album with gritty riffs which yes, do sound borderline thrash. This album is fucking AWESOME most of the time. \n\nEven the Dimebag sung \"Pussy Tight\" with ridiculous lyrics has a fucking brilliant catchy riff. This album hardly does wrong AT ALL and it's their best pipping Cowboys From Hell by a small margin. \nPity the band buried it, mainly because of the front cover!\n",
        "\n..And so Pantera's rise in quality continues as the 80's progressed. This is an \"80's metal album\" by definition as over half of the album is furious metal with only a handful of laid back, silly glam rock. For me it's on par with Malice's \"In The Beginning\" and Laaz Rockit's \"No Stranger To Danger\" so if you dig those 2, jump to hear this.\n\nThere's nothing here as seizure inducingly awesome as the track, \"Projects in the Jungle\" but it's a more consistent album with more memorable songs than before and really only 3 that are worthless. \"Hot and Heavy\" as you can might guess is disgusting, \"Come On Eyes\" is more \"she's hot\" lame glam and D*G*T*T*M is guitar noodling with weird noises. I advise you strongly to skip that as the oddness will plant sheer terror in your subconscious.\n\nThe highlights for me would be the ultra catchy and heavy, \"Right On The Edge\", the manic speed metal of the title track and \"Valhalla\" which opens up into proto-Cowboys riffwork halfway through the song and whilst \"Down Below\" is indeed about oral sex, but like Priest's \"Eat Me Alive\" is great speed metal. They even nail the love ballad at the end, \"Forever Tonight\", which has a great atmosphere.\n\nTerry Glaze is yet again the weakest link but even he showcases more range in his vocals here which half the time are more shrieky and a bit Halford esque than the pure glam style he had on \"Metal Magic\". Too little too late tho as he was replaced a year after this album with some guy called Phil Anselmo.\n\nAs with all 80's Pantera if you can't stand the 80's sound in your metal don't bother with this, but if you're in love with it (like me) you need to hear this. Some of their best music is here and it pisses on a lot of their 90's stuff.\n",
        "\nThis is where Pantera get the ball rolling with their careers not on \"Vulgar Display of Power\" like they would claim. They up the riffage, the album is a bit less glam and Dimes playing has improved. It's pretty comparable to the first crue albums as it's got the riffs and menace but with a big slice of glam.\n\nThe production is a lot clearer and louder and along with heavier riffs makes the sound SO much better than their first record. However, Terry Glaze and the lyrics are the big spanner in the works of the album. If the album had a vocalist with testicles and metal themed lyrics I'd give the album 20 more points.\n\nSaying that there are a couple of pure metal numbers here...\"Projects In The Jungle\" and \"Heavy Metal Rules\". The latter is pretty dull but the former is the best track here! Speed Metal, like the title track on Metal Magic but this time with heavier riffs and drumwork and it's even reminiscent of the Cowboys album!! Yes back in 1984 they showed traces of where they were going to go. Awesome song.\n\nOther highlights here include \"All Over Tonight\" which has another bludgeoning riff, \"Like Fire\" which whilst being glam lyrically has riffwork which is catchy as hell and \"Killers\" which is NOT an Iron Maiden Cover which most people think. It's pretty decent speed metal.\n\nMost of the rest are mediocre love ballads but with above average riffs and \"Blue Light Turnin Red\" is a 3rd rate version of Van Halen's \"Eruption\".\n\nOverall a half decent album. They started to use Judas Priest/Accept riffwork & the title track is brilliant. Track that down if you're interested in whether Pantera sounded heavy in the ol' days. You'll be surprised!\n",
        "\nYeah, apparently odes to getting laid over rock n roll boogies was Dime & Co.'s idea of metal back in the early 80's. The vibe here is pretty much a complete flipside to the life's hardships angst on \"Far Beyond Driven\" and \"The Great Southern Trendkill\".\n\nIt's best comparable to a cheesy version of Poison with lyrics as crass as Spinal Tap's \"Sex Farm\"!! The majority of the stuff here isn't GOOD by ANY standards. Dimes playing is decent and the solos are ear catching but it's impossible to enjoy them with the \"ooo baby\" vocals, \"lick my ice cream cone\" lyrics and lame riffs. Really amateur glam, kind of like a demo Poison used to get signed by a company. \n\nThere is ONE exception however, the title track, which oddly enough is a pretty cool, SPEED METAL number. It starts off with hilarious \"magic\" synthesizer effects but then darts away with a good headbanging riff. Reminds me a lot of Exciter \"Heavy Metal Maniac\" which is a great comparison for any band. \n\nFor the rest, you'll need a strong stomach. From the self explanatory \"Ride My Rocket\", \"Tell Me If You Want It\" and \"(She's got) Nothin on (but the radio)\" to the \"sincere\" ballad \"Biggest part of me\" you'll be highly sickened and amused.\n\nIn reflection the albums only really worth is for seeing where the band came from and for the title track which is decent. You can't expect much from it because they were kids and it's glam, and glam is by definition = music for chicks...oh and the front cover is just DISTURBING.\n",
        "\nNo arena's for Pantera in the 80's i can't see why. Pantera got a new look at their music with this record and i think the jam session they had with Kerry King of Slayer would get them into the Vulgar Display. I have this entire album and i love it! I think that it sounds almost exactly like Cowboys just two different elements\n1.Cowboys has more of a groove to it\n2.Power Metal has more of a Glamish art to it\nTake a listen to Hard Ride and you will hear a Phil Anselmo you will never hear again. Holy Shit!! The guy could really sing back then and in the early 90's. Pantera brought a lot of Metallica/Anthrax based influences into that album than those bands would do themselves later on. The focus track/The Anthem Rock The World is one of my all time favorites. It's got an angry Maiden/Priest thing in it that i love listening to, and just think this was before Phil could actually scream. He did a little screaming on Cowboys but the next two records did it for him. Power Metal is a great record that doesn't get the credit it deserves. I still don't know why Pantera denied all the old stuff i think it kicked ass! Pure Gold right here, and if you don't have it GET IT!\n",
        "\nVery few people are aware that the highly successful Metal Cowboys from Texas known as Pantera released the album before Cowboys From Hell called Power Metal, let alone had any clue that they had released a few albums before that. For those who know of this album are most likely HIGHLY aware of the controversy on how Pantera created 'Power Metal', and also believe that this is a Power Metal album.\n\nI can most definately assure you that this is not a Power Metal album, and even more so, they definately did NOT create Power Metal, but in some way at the bear most COULD have been an inspiration to Power Metal. I would say the common mistake made why this is labelled Power Metal is because of both A) the drums, and B) The Vocals. There are alot of fast double kick, and that doesn't quite make it power metal, and Phil's vocal style is often heard in mass majority of Power metal. Still, this is not power metal. If you ask me, I would say that this is more than anything but power metal.\n\nIn my point of view, the best way to describe this album's sound is think of Traditional Metal or even 80's Metal with almost NO glam and A LOT more aggression. Not quite Thrash though, but has SOMEWHAT thrash influences. Listen to Over and Out and you'll know what I mean. That is the song on here that I would consider to have a much more Thrash sound to it.\n\nNow, those of us who love Pantera love them because of their groove sound. I know that's why I love them, especially when I hear music from that old saga genesis game Skitchin. But after listening to this, I have a much greater perspective on Pantera. To some extend, I almost prefer listening to this more than I do listening to their other stuff, with the exception of C.F.H. or a personal favorite V.D.O.P.\n\nWhat I love about this album is how technical/melodic and how catchy it is. Yes this is indeed metal, and though it might not be Thrash, it has it's moments of thrash with songs like Over and Out. I also love how this is not exactly 80's Glam shit either THANK Pantera. This is a very nice and catchy album.\n\nBOTTOMLINE: If you ask me what to expect of this album, I would tell you that all depends on what you are looking for, meaning if you want a (post) Thrash album, hmmmm, I guess you could say stay away because this is NOT thrash. Thought it has it's influences of Thrash and aggression, this is much more of a Traditional Metal sound. If you want a Power Metal album, stay away from this, because this is NOT Power Metal. I'll give 'er an 88 because of how much I was pleased.\n",
        "\nSo this is where Pantera really shed the hair metal crap. At this point hair metal was dying quickly so I'm sure they wanted to move on and not be forgotten. So they decided to go in a heavier direction, and Phil is really what they needed to become heavier. \n\nBy 1988 thrash had become a completely oversaturated genre. So many bands were putting out worthless thrash albums. Well Pantera really missed the glory days of thrash and that turned out to be a good thing. This album sounds like alot of thrash bands did in the early 80's, well in the way that it's trying to be thrash but isn't quite there. Instead of playing a really heavy NWOBHM like the early thrash bands did Pantera played a really heavy version of mainstreem 80's metal. \n\nThere are moments where you can see that they really wanted to thrash. The title track is one of the best examples of this. The thrashy moments really are quite good and wouldn't sound out of place on say metal massacre 4 or 5. However there are lots of times when thrash is no where to be found. It mostly sounds like a heavier version of Grim Reaper, which isn't bad. \n\nSo Pantera tried to be thrash on this album, but they were just a little too late. That actually turned out to be a good thing. Had they played a fully realized thrash style they probably would have been signed to Combat or Metal Blade and put out a forgetable album. Fortunately Pantera didn't do that, instead they put out a nearly thrash album that is pretty fuckin cool. They would reach their thrash peak, and overall peak for that matter with Cowboys From Hell. Luckily for metal in general Pantera didn't really develope their style until the thrash scene was pretty much dead, so they had to evolve and ended up saving metal during the dark days of the 90's. \n\nWell this album is good, very good. It's not Cowboys, but it's close. If you like Pantera you will like this. If you like thrash there are moments that you will appreiciate. Overall I like it alot.\n",
        "\nSo here we have Pantera's real debut, and it's nothing like the album they want you to think is the debut. This is basically generic hair metal or galm or whatever you want to call it. I actually tend to like this genre, but this is bad even for hair metal. \n\nThe songs on this album sound like a mix between early Motley Crue and every 80's new wave band. Actually everything about Metal Magic screams 80's. The vocals are whiny at times, screamy at times, and melodic at times. However they suck all of the time. The drums are pretty good and fit the music perfectly. That said this is nothing compared to what Vinne would eventually do on Cowboys From Hell, Vulgar Display Of Power, or even Power Metal. The bass can only be heard on one track, Nothin On(But The Radio). This might be the worst track on here, there is really nothing metal about this song. It sounds like Loverboy or something like that. \n\nThe only saving grace about Metal Magic is Diamond Darrel, as he was called. He shows on this album how much of a Eddie Van Halen master he is. The riffs are mostly garbage, generic hair metal stuff. The only riffs I really like are on the title track. Prue Judas Preist worship on this one and it's done very well. If the vocals didn't suck this would be an awsome song. Every solo found on this album is killer. Dime really was a great guitar player even if his songwriting ability was lacking at this point. \n\nSo if you like 80's hair metal you may like this. There are many other albums of the genre that are much better, but a big fan may like this. If you like Pantera and haven't heard any of the pre Cowboys From Hell albums listen to Metal Magic just to see where the band came from. I actually appreciated the later albums even more after hearing this.\n",
        "\nWhile it may not be quite as good as Pantera's rokkin' debut(eh, Rex?) this album kicks ass. In every sense of the expression. Every riff on this album are anger-fueled creations of heaviness created by none other than the late Dimebag fuckin' Darrell. Need I say anymore? Yes, but the mention of Dimebag Darrell alone should be a good indication that you need this album. \n\nWalk was the first heavy song I'd ever heard. As a young Christian at the time, this very song set me straight for good. You don't hear a riff this heavy and churning(and simple too, but that's beside the pont) in some shitty Christian rock band and it's still one of my favorite riffs today. After I heard this song I purchased the album...and it was the first heavy album I ever bought, serving as an introduction to the great wide world of METAL. \n\nSo, of course Dimebag Darrell is the highlight of this album as one of the best metal guitarists to ever walk the earh, at least in my humble opinion. There is a solo in EVERY song in the true heavy metal tradition, as if to remind you that this ain't no acoustic set guitarist...but a pure electric madman. It takes skill to do what Dimebag did on the Pantera albums, and more than what it takes to please a crowd. The second best thing about Pantera is Phil Anselmo. From various television commentaries, I've seen that Phil can be a total dick as a person both on and off stage, but when it comes to being Pantera's frontman Phil does a terrific job. Although he doesn't show off his vocal range as much as he does on Cowboys from Hell with all of the 80s screams and what not, he proves on songs like This Love that he can actually sing....and then tears your speakers apart with a straight up badass voice. It's the only way to describe Phil Anselmo and the album as a whole: badass. Behind the drumkit we have the man, the master Vinnie Paul. This guy strings everything together, providing some righteous back beats to some righteous riffs. Rex is on bass, but we don't hear him as much. He keeps the production thick and meaty, sticking to the drums more than the guitar.\n\nOnto the songs! Rather than outline every song on this album, I'll just rap about the ones I really enjoy and the ones that you, dear reader, should hear right away. This album is a bit of a premature ejaculation with all the good songs stacked at the top and the leftovers trailing after. Pantera is a band with epic songs that you can listen to over and over again....and with other songs that aren't really that great with less memorable parts, and that's why this album received an 85 instead of a full fledged 100. Now, Vulgar Display does not fuck around, it starts off with arguably the best song on the entire CD...Mouth for War. It even has a short intro section much like Cowboys from Hell to sort of psych you up for the badassery that is come. The main riff is great, the kind of riff you hear in a movie when a biker or some sort of rebel is walking down the street. It's not quite a head banging riff, but there's no denying that it commands respect. The chorus is really nice too, and I think that Phil pulls it off really well. I won't waste time explaining how much I love Walk, but this should be the first song you play when you pop in Vulgar Display of Power. My favorite song other than Walk is Fucking Hostile...man, what a kickass song. This *is* a headbanging riff. When Pantera played this live, you got to the pit right away. You don't get anymore metal than Fucking Hostile...a total expression of anger both musically and lyrically. And that solo! It's insane, which proves once more the incredible talent of Dimebag Darrell. Right after this brilliant little thrasher, is This Love. It starts off a little lame, and the song isn't *that* great until the riff of the album. Go to 2:47. This is a riff to raise the dead and it's only followed by another riff that pulverizes you with crushing heaviness. Hell, it's even the riff that Beavis and Butthead hum. \n\nWell, that's it kids. Vulgar Display of Power. In summary this is one of the finer pieces of metal from the early 90s in my opinion. Riding the line between groove metal and trash and influencing band after band who heard the band as I did...as an amazing work of heavy music and indisputably badass.\n",
        "\nPantera grew out of their glam rock origins to form the \"power groove\" sound they named for themselves. This record set the mark and really propelled this band to great heights. \n\nThe music itself still has hints of power metal in it. The vocals have a lot of high pitch falsetto screams and the guitar solos are very flashy, but you could tell these guys were on to something. The riffing on this record is too badass and the drumming is also pretty intense. The vocals are ripe with emotion and attitude as Phil Anselmo was making a name for himself as was \"Diamond\" Darrell as he was called at the time. \n\n\"Cowboys from Hell\", the title track which is now a metal classic starts this record off in prime fashion. That legendary opening riff along with Anselmo's \"Come on!\" gets the heads banging real quick. The best part of this song though is from the solo on. Dime shreds with vicious accuracy and surgical precision before the band gets into a sick riff with harmonics flying all over the place, only to finish with a chorus and to come back to the sae sick riff. This song is a landmark and the delivery is flawless. \n\n\"Primal Concrete Sledge\" is a very drum oriented track that has a solid feel to it, a good song. \"Psycho Holiday\" is full of attitude and has a very long but amazing solo section that kicks into high gear and the song ends with some really heavy riffing, another solid number. \"Heresy\" is arguably the most power metal song on here, with Anselmo belting out the title in almost Halford fashion during the chorus. On to two other classics.\n\n\"Cemetery Gates\" has a great acoustic intro and some very nice melodic vocals from Anselmo. The song kicks into high gear during the pre-chorus and the chorus with some more kickass riffing from Dime and a solid foundation layed by Vinnie Paul and Rex. Another standout guitar solo, very much in the guitar hero vein. The end is rather intense with the vocals and guitar competing for who gewts the biggest wail, I'll give it to Dime. \"Domination\" is probably the heaviest song on the record, this one would've belonged on VDOP and probably done well. The start/stop riffing is very cool and the chords are very powerful. This song though is best known for it's ending. First of all Darrell gives what is probably the best solo on the record, followed by a gargantuan breakdown that is so heavy it hurts. The song ends on a slow chugging note and leaves the listener gasping for air. \n\nThe rest of the album is also very solid, \"Shattered\" is a fast paced ripper of a song, \"Clashy with Reality\" has some groovy riffing and a very catchy chorus, \"Medicine Man\" is another song in the power metal vein with some very cool instrumental bits. \"Message in Blood\" is a slow creeper with a lot of time changes, \"The Sleep\" is a pretty long track with some eerie acoustic guitar and a slow delivery on the vocal front. The album closer \"The Art of Shredding\" gives us a final kick in the face with intensity filled verses and a steamroller of a chorus that ends things in style.\n\nAs far as the songwriting goes this is Pantera at their best. The songs are well crafted and the riffs are simply awesome. I think this album also catches Dime at his peak. There are so many stellar guitar moments on this record it's hard to keep track. This was their breakthrough record and there's no denying the logic behind this fact.\n",
        "\nNow sit right back and you\u2019ll hear a tale about a quartet of Texas bad-asses shed their makeup and perms and decided to throw down head-crushing style, my friends. What! You don\u2019t associate makeup and perms with these here gun slingin' whiskey drinkin\u2019 noise makin\u2019 boys with that there stuff. Well wise up, kids, because previously to reinventing themselves as seriously riff-tastic maniacs, Pantera did the whole glam metal look thing, and managed to turn in no less than 4 (yes, four!) full length albums before converting to the thrash cum hardcore style they\u2019d make their beer soaked names in. \n\n\nAnd who could blame them? None of those first four Pantera albums are worth all that much musically, only one featured signature vocalist Phil Anselmo, and the music they were to forge thereafter was really and truly innovative, ludicrously powerful and often lyrically acerbic. And Cowboys From Hell was the first warning shot in this equation, and the shot was indeed heard round the world (well, at least the metal world that is). \n\n\nThe ingredients here that matter are as follows. Dimebag (Diamond at the time, but we\u2019ll excuse that early nom de plume) Darrell Abbot was in possession of a jam-packed arsenal of guitar ammunition, not the least of which being his thrash metal style compressed riffing and hi fluid but super thick soloing tone. Backed by tight as a duck\u2019s butt drummer Vinnie Paul and bassist of doom Rex Brown, the band conjured up riff driven grooves that are truly an ugly beast to behold (and hear, for that matter). Vocalist Phil Anselmo brought a grit and roar to this sound that while not approaching the underground shriek/growl of death metal, did borrow from it, and his venom would continue to fester noxiously over the band\u2019s music going forward. \n\n\nAnother nice thing! The band could actually forge their combined strengths into memorable songs, some actually becoming among the best (don\u2019t laugh kid, I\u2019ll sick Vinnie on yer ass) ever penned in this metal age. Doubt me? Okay wise-ass just try and get the riffs and hooks of the title track to this here opus out of your head after one hearing. The same goes for the double bass-thunder of \u201cPrimal Concrete Sledge\u201d and \u201cDomination,\u201d both of which accomplish what so many longer standing acts had failed to do; bring the authentic sound of the metal underground to mainstream ears. Somehow the combination of visceral force and tuneful riffs made lettermen and jocks across the nation love this band, as did the metal-heads, causing the band massive loss of street cred from the underground and major influx of cash from everywhere else. \n\n\nA bunch of the other tracks can kinda run together, but the killer riff count is still a thing to marvel at, especially where \u201cMessage In Blood\u201d and \u201cThe Art Of Shredding\u201d is concerned. But on the whole, the real triumph here is the ballad (well, kind a ballad, I guess) \u201cCemetery Gates,\u201d which not only reveals the depth of the band\u2019s song writing, displays the diversity of Anselmo\u2019s voice, it contains some of Darrell\u2019s most inventive, memorable and downright mind blowing axe work ever. From riff to solo to general flourishes, this one is a guitar worshippers altar, man.\n\n\nThe album was produced with no lack of tact by Terry Date, who produces the thing with maximum compression. That means the bass drums are as in your face as the slammin\u2019 guitar riffs, and the bass (usually lost like a set \u2018o car keys in metal production jobs) is right up front as well. No complaints here, as this sort of sound is perfect for this type of no frills riff delivery system. And so friends, my advice is to skip the first four Pantera novellas (not like you\u2019ll be able to find \u2018em anyway) and hop the train here. And believe me, the ride is only going to get much bumpier from here, as Pantera continue to slither closer and closer to the death metal frontier, dragging many a mainstream here along with them. And bless them for it.\n",
        "\nAll moving parts intact, Pantera moved into the serious big leagues here, remaining, with Metallica one of the few bands able to stay standing after the great grunge purging of \u201992. And while Cowboys From Hell began the snarl age of Pantera, Vulgar Display Of Power left no idea left in metal minds worldwide that this band would be mellowing out anytime soon. In fact, whereas it\u2019s predecessor offered some small rays of melodic light here and there, this one offers less respite from the fury of riffs that just don\u2019t let up. Pantera staked their claim last time around, and here they\u2019re like pissed off prospectors, letting loose torrents of gunfire at anyone foolhardy enough to trespass on their turf. \n\n\nThere is a slight snag though, and it\u2019s a snag that would haunt this band right up until their unfortunate demise; there are less killer songs here. Now the good news is that when the songs are good, they\u2019re titanic. Let\u2019s check \u2018em out: \u201cMouth For War\u201d opens with some teeth rattling guitar shrapnel and a beautiful bent-chord performance from axe-man Abbott, and Anselmo really lays into this one vocally, especially in it\u2019s thrashing finale. And don\u2019t even think about picking a scrap with \u201cWalk,\u201d one pissed off anthem of a cut that only an idiot would stroll into a dark restroom with. Seriously, the riffs, Darrell\u2019s soloing, the righteous slam of the lyrics and monster chorus make this a blueprint for most metal that followed it. Any young folks in the audience who think Limp Bizkit or Linkin Park or even Korn is badass shit should go directly to this one. Hear it and weep, my sons. Even the ballad \u201cThis Love\u201d does it\u2019s clear evolutionary predecessor \u201cCemetery Gates\u201d one better by being menacing rather than heartwarming, and contains a trudging riff so blunt it hurts (don\u2019t worry, you\u2019ll KNOW when it hits). Elsewhere \u201cFucking Hostile\u201d rings some major bells, and \u201cLive In A Hole\u201d contains that signature super-compressed style riff only the demented mind of Darrell Abbott could give us. \n\n\nBut on the whole, the album\u2019s remainder is just really good, just not as much of a shock to the system that Cowboys From Hell and it\u2019s what the hell pissed them off so much of all sudden vibe was. Don\u2019t get me wrong, this is still high caliber shredding, and as time will tell, Pantera would travel further down the brutal spiral on their next time out. Because one massive tour, about 50 bales of reefer, many gallons of whiskey and a brewery full of suds later, Pantera would blaze out with their most radical offering yet. My advice is go directly to Far Beyond Driven....Now!\n",
        "\n* NOTE * After reading abunch of negative reviews for this album on the site, I re-listened to this album and tried to apply some historical perspective into this review...take it for what it's worth...thanks.\n\n\nDebuted at number one on the Billboard charts. Probably the heaviest album to date to do so, and easily Pantera\u2019s most furious effort to date, this was also their last great act of purpose as a band. The scene: Nirvana had arrived on the scene, making the glam and hair metal that had previously sold bucket-loads unfashionable seemingly overnight. Now American was in the throes of the \u201calternative\u201d music takeover, a funny conglomeration where artists as divergent as Marilyn Manson, Sonic Youth, Nine Inch Nails, and Soundgarden grabbed many, many inches of column ink, wrote new rules for what was cool (by logical reasoning also deciding what was not cool) and the fashion world adopted the \u201cnew\u201d scene with eager aplomb. \n\n\nThe metal scene itself was in equal confusion. Death metal had left the building popularity-wise, black metal was this evil thing from across the sea that no American fan quite grasped yet, Metallica was still touring the black album after three years, and metal fans were wondering if this grunge and alternative thing was their future. And so returned Pantera into this muddled fray. After kicking many doors down with Vulgar Display Of Power, the band were now bent on driving their sound deeper, harder, showing the Metallica kids (formerly the Guns N Roses kids that Metallica wanted to impress) where the real shit was, and doing their best to flat out ignore everything else that was going on. And in doing so, Pantera made their heaviest, hardest, most tortured and unlistenable album yet. To be brief, it\u2019s another metal masterpiece. \n\n\nBy now openly adopting fringes of industrial and death metal elements (the rapid fire regimented rhythms, as well as the guttural roar and savage riffing) the band were a true no compromises proposition. You didn\u2019t have to like Pantera but standing in the way of this off the rails self-destruction machine was highly inadvisable. The skinny: some of this album is so densely packed with noisy, almost discordant riffs it becomes painful, which was surely the intention. For example, \u201cUse My Third Arm\u201d sounds like an epileptic fit one would suffer upon falling asleep blind drunk to discover in paranoid horror that you have no memory of how you got where you are. Been there\u2026not fun. \u201cStrength Beyond Strength\u201d kicks off affairs with a blast of thrashy speed before \u201cBecoming\u201d adopts a slower, but no less torturous riff, with Dimebag supplying enough false harmonics and pick squeals to fill an arena on their own. \u201cGood Friends And A Bottle Of Pills\u201d is Anselmo addiction poetry at it\u2019s finest, managing to parody a Ted Nugent song title and write a harrowing tale of drug-blurred perception all in one sick, almost revolting 3 minute cut. \n\n\nThat pretty much leaves the more famous cuts to deal with, which for the most part are only slightly prettier. \u201c5 Minutes Alone\u201d rides another discordant riff backed by those militant industrial strength beats, blessed as well with some very serpentine Dimebag soloing, and an appropriately desperate vocal from Phil. The real heads over all winner here is \u201cI\u2019m Broken,\u201d a track that combines all that is great about the thing that is (was) Pantera in exactly 4:25 of musical ferocity. A killer riff, guttural vocal, a chorus that will tattoo itself on your soul, and the ending: a tribal stomp of dense storming power that could have lasted three times as long and I\u2019d still want to hear more of it. Another nice thing: as the smoke of \u201cThroes Of Rejection\u201d and it\u2019s churning, nauseating riffs wind down, the band mellow out into the most unexpected of Black Sabbath covers, the ethereal \u201cPlanet Caravan,\u201d perhaps the perfect doomed but meditative mood to close this raging effort. \n\n\nFor Pantera, this album would see them at their peak in every sense. From this point on, good but not godlike albums would appear, Anselmo, despite recording a masterpiece of an album with side project Down, would appear to become ever more of an addicted mess (mostly to pain killers taken to cope with a back injury) and finally Dimebag and Vinnie would retire the band\u2019s name and reputation to the past, forming the effective but about two years too late project Damageplan. And then in one of rock\u2019s most senseless and premature murders ever, Darrell \u201cDimebag\u201d Abbott was shot and killed onstage while performing by a mentally disturbed fan. \n\n\nPantera caught tons of shit over the course of their existence for essentially not doing what was expected of them. It's funny to find that in their sad abscence, some metal fans still regard their legacy with suspicion and malice. I gotta say I don't understand this. Pantera never sold out, got soft, sued Napster, betrayed their fans, said metal \"was dead,\" or any other number of stupid things other big time bands have over and over again, and still they get no respect. I just don't get it. The day I'm too cool or hip to understad metal this fierce, please shoot me. I'll be dead already.\n",
        "\nOne can see the decay that was slipping into the Pantera camp during this new \"Reinventing the Steel\" album. While a quality \"party-death\" metal album it was, it certainly wasn't the focused surge of \"Far Beyond Driven\" or the strange redneck-genius of \"Trendkill\". Pantera weren't together for this, the songs were obviously written by two seperate parties hiding from one another and the vibe is a disjointed one at worst and a loose ass-kicking at best. This may be the album with the most style over substance...but it's obvious that Pantera weren't in this for the focused attack but to keep the name alive through hard times for a band that has taken the stick from the underground and often faced accusations of being pretenders to the throne.\n\nIn terms of songwriting, the record has three or four knucklehead classics in \"Hellbound\", \"Yesterday Don't Mean Shit\" and \"Death Rattle\". Much of the record though is sloppy, with terrible vocal melodies that show Phil losing his way around the often sloppy riff-structures. Is much of it enjoyable but lacking in hook? Sure. Is this anything compared to \"Far Beyond Driven\" or \"Trendkill\"? Hardly. One can still feel the redneck-beer-rage spitting from the mix, but one can hardly remember most of it once the record has completed it's running order. \"Death Rattle\" and \"Yesterday Don't Mean Shit\" though served as passable singles that save the band from sinking into the \"angry but directionless\" mess that this could have been.\n\nThe seeds of dissention and musical disagreement can be heard on this release in plain form. Thankfully though, the bands commercial grunt-and-roar approach does provide a few sure kickers to keep the Pantera party moving...\n\nIt's half-good, half-horrible and all somewhat pointless for a band that had managed a strange classic only one album before...\n",
        "\nThey kind of lost me a little on this one, as it certainly doesn't hold up to the previous album. Pantera tends to fit a greater amount of groove into the thrash framework of the Cowboys from Hell formula on most songs, sometimes bringing that up to the forefront. The album is very reminiscent of the last disc, with Phil Anselmo's vocals a step up in roughness and coming in with more low-end bellows than higher pitched screeches. Any traces of their pre-Cowboys from Hell sound are now just about erased. If taken a few songs at a time, there are some very good moments on here which rank up with some of those on Cowboys. But as a whole the album becomes redundant in places, with a lack of new ideas to push it onward being the main problem. The band stops trying and stays where they are, but still manage to keep their heads above the water. \n\nIt starts off very promisingly. Mouth for War and A New Level end up not unlike some of the faster tracks from the last album only substituting the relentless thrashing with a firm grooved up base which keep the songs dynamic. It still packs the punch, but in a different way. Fucking Hostile is your token fast thrasher which cannot help but be headbanged to. It\u2019s one of those familiar areas they can\u2019t really mess up. This Love and Hollow work in dark acoustics and function as counterparts to The Sleep and Cemetery Gates coming out with similarly cohesive results. \n\nUgh, Walk has to constitute the scarcest arrangements and minimal substance which drags on and on following its dull main groove. Take your pick of what is now left, and you\u2019ll find songs varying from above average replicas of the first two tracks (Rise, No Good (Attack The Radical)) or those coming off a little hollow and lazy (Live In A Hole, Regular People (Conceit), By Demons Be Driven). I honestly didn\u2019t expect this to be as disappointing as it invariably turned out to be. It\u2019s not their worst album at all, and for those few very good moments it comes recommended though turn your attention elsewhere for something truly worthwhile.\n",
        "\nI used to be a huge fan of Pantera, so when I saw that a DVD was made containing all of their videos, I had to buy it. The first big problem I faced was that there were no chapter breaks, meaning that you had to watch each hour-long video in one sitting. Those who just want to automatically watch the music videos will have to fast forward through the whole thing just to get to them.\n\nThe main attraction of this thing is the video content itself, in which case, \"Vulgar Videos from Hell\" isn't very good. We get three hour-long videos which show the exact same stuff: the drunken band members making complete fools out of themselves. They throw stuff around, they cuss at each other, and do loads of other annoying stuff that no one cares about. This kind of stuff is a little interesting for about 15 minutes, but it becomes unbearable at the end of the hour (to show you how boring it is, I've had this thing for over 6 months and haven't even been tempted to watch one of the other two videos included). \n\nAs predicted, the band once again ignores any of their stuff before \"Cowboys From Hell\". Also, those hoping for some live concert footage will be disappointed as well. I really can't believe I paid $34.99 for this thing. What a waste.\n",
        "\nPantera's \"debut\" album, is one step up in heaviness from their previous effort, Power Metal. To me, this is also the best thing they've ever released. While Power Metal was very competent, this is raising the bar much further and has a more professional polish to the songs. It's more or less a slightly groovy speed/thrash metal album for the most part. The Exhorder comparisons and ripping off have been really analysed to death in reviews of this period of Pantera's career so all I shall say is that the similarities are indeed there and very prominently shown, but that doesn't change the fact that this is one focused and hard hitting album. \n\nIt needs no time to warm itself up and goes straight for it in typical metal fashion, with what could be considered their \"flag tune\", the title track. It's got the tough attitude, the staple southern sound and all the aggression that you can squeeze into four minutes. Classic. It then speeds up with \"Primal Concrete Sledge\", a short but menacing tune that holds you firmly down to your seat. \"Pyscho Holiday\" is a slower, more considered and stretched out song, while \"Heresy\" does just the opposite and thrashes away with its infuriated riffs. I must mention Diamond Darrell's excellent leads in the former song. \"Cemetery Gates\" is a semi ballad of sorts, and is a longer song with many different parts to it and a generally mournful and sombre atmosphere. I'd say this is the most unusual song here, but has a fantastic feel. It's definitely the highlight of the album. Back to the all out thrash with \"Domination\", mimicking the \"Heresy\" formula and keeping up the quality. It's the same with the next couple of tracks. They're ones that slip the memory the most, but manage to retain something and keep the album going.\n\nBefore \"Medicine Man\" brings us back to the \"Psycho Holiday\" feel again, with the emphasis this time on a darker and mystic mood. It's continued with the furiously charged \"Message In Blood\" with the foreboding, doomful verses and the incredible riff that holds that all together. \"The Sleep\" continues onward with a sort of more a ballady feel, but in the sort of way \"Cemetery Gates\" dug into a deep gloomy hole. \"The Art of Shredding\" closes better than I'd fear at this point, it's a monster thrasher with ripping energy and an offbeat structure.\n\nThis is far more consistent than the two albums that come after it, and the good songs come thick and fast. The mid paced and slower songs mingle well with the fast thrashing numbers. It's a shame they never retained the same standard again, but there are many great moments still present in the Pantera catalogue.\n",
        "\n\"Vulgar Display of Power\" is quite vulgar indeed. It's a well crafted (but hardly artful) piece of \"tough guy\" rock that stomps and growls but doesn't really go anywhere in the end. Phil started to destroy his range and singing voice on this record for a predictable \"death-groan\", the riffs are good but not great and the performance is tight but somewhat lacking in terms of feel. It was the perfect record to catch the post-80's audience and lead them back to metal because it wasn't too challenging, and gave enough violent lyrical/musical edge to catch the few who wanted something \"dangerous\", but didn't feel like falling into culture-trap of \"gangsta rap\". Pantera were the right band at the right time...but they weren't the best band of any time. (Though they, and their fans would have you believe differently.)\n\nThe bigger singles like \"Walk\" and \"This Love\" have so much bravado and chest-pounding to them that one who is slightly self-concious cannot help but giggle a bit. Phil convinces you that he THINKS he's tough, but he hardly convinces you that what he thinks may actually translate to the proper reality. Maybe it's just the glam photos from the early...but something...stupid emanates from the songwriting on this record. The guitars and drums do a good job of putting the riffs/hooks where they belong and hence captured the imagination of the metal populace...but the overall feeling of one is \"desperate to please\" and not nearly catching the brutality of something like...oh..say the early Cro-Mags. This is \"good\", but it's hardly GREAT. The band could have done a lot more with the ideas put down on plastic...\n\nPantera did what was needed, and nothing that was to compete with what would become a much stronger metal underground. Bravado, rage and violence are all here, delivered with an all-too-simplistic feel that anyone can enjoy for a least a few moments...\n\nIt ain't higher art...but I guess it did what it was supposed to...?\n",
        "\nI was a big fan of Pantera a few years back, but I've never really loved this album. In my opinion it contains to much filler. Let's see what we have here.\n\nOpener 'Strength Beyond Strength' is killer. It's a fast, in-your-fucking-face kind of song that makes your adrenaline production sky-rocket. It goes midtempo in the middle, but soon gains speed again. Now if every Pantera song was as good as this. 'Becoming' is more sluggish, and a very good song too. While there's no denying how talented Dimebag is at playing guitar, you can be driven nuts about how he plays sometimes. Not only that, he has a terrible tone too, and it sounds like it's recorded inside a metal tube/cylinder or something. And the pinches and squeals aren't that cool. Next song is '5 Minutes Alone', and it's one of Pantera's most popular. What can I say, it's good, and especially the chorus makes you wanna murder, in a good way. The riff is a bit like 'Walk', slow and that start-stop type riffing, which I mostly like a lot. The solo in this one is crazy, it sounds like some sort of siren, and very different from Dimebag's rhythm guitar work, which is a plus. \n\nThe disc continues with 'I'm Broken', another good one, and slightly better than the two before, in my opinion. Actually, 'Becoming', '5 Minutes Alone' and 'I'm Broken' are kind of in family. They have about the same half-slow tempo, and generally the same feeling. Which is why I never remember which order they come on the record. Another cool solo, by the way, on 'I'm Broken'. Then we get another kind of beast. 'Good Friends & a Bottle of Pills' is a slow, stupored, sleazy number, with the bass taking the front seat. I love it, actually, it's so different from anything else. Phil talks like he's stoned in the verse (which maybe he was, at that), and screams his lungs off in the chorus, and it all adds up to a fun and interesting track. Ok, so far, so good. But then comes 'Hard Lines, Sunken Cheeks', which sounds as dull as the title promises. A VERY slow and doomy affair to begin with, before it speeds up in the verse, and then it slows down again in the crappy chorus, maybe the worst chorus I've ever heard. Now that's an accolade! Arrgh, listening to it pains me, I must say. 'Slaughtered' is way better, thank all the gods, but hardly a masterpiece. I like the main guitar riff, and the drums that follows it, air-guitar worthy methinks. Again, though, the chorus is a major letdown. All he says is \"slaughtered!\". Ah, well. \n\n'25 Years'....'5 Minutes Alone'....hmmm....many numbers and timeframes on this album, and '25 Years' sure is the worst of them. This is, if not the worst song on display, then pretty damn close. Horrid verse, horrid riffs, horrid chorus, horrid everything. It's simply stupid. When Pantera decides to suck, they sure do it big time! Luckily, quality comes by again with 'Shedding Skin', which has a funny main riff. Sounds very happy, unlike the verse, which is just a whispering Phil and mellow guitar playing. Come to think of it, this song is not that great, but the main riff makes up for it. Wish I was good enough to play it myself! Another useless track we have in the horribly titled 'Use My Third Arm'. 34 seconds into the song it actually sounds trash/death, but of course it soon changes back to suckiness. That death section is used a few times, and sounds cool, it's just too bad that the rest is garbage. The last original song is 'Throes of Rejections', and sadly this isn't any good, either. A somewhat interesting main riff section, where it suddenly stops, and the drums get all the attention for a sec, but it can't save the song. \n\nAfter so many shit songs, it's bliss to hear the final track, 'Planet Caravan'. For those who do not know (and by the gods, everyone should know) this is a Black Sabbath cover. It's neither better nor worse than the original, and that's fine, 'cause it means it rules. It's a tripped-out hippie kind of a song, with nice clean guitars, easy tribal drumming, and neat sound effects. As this plays, let me just say that \"Far Beyond Driven\" is a mediocre album, where the best songs are the opening track and the cover. The production is fine, the guitar tone is suck, the bass is uninteresting, the vocals are sub-standard, and the drums are cool. Lots of nice moments tucked in with lots of shit ones, therefore the score. \n\n'Till next time, my fellow metalheads.\n",
        "\nSo it took pretty a long time for Pantera to come up with a follow up to \"The Great Southern Trendkill\", and I recall being quite curious when I finally got my hands on this album, Pantera were never my favourite Metal band ever, but I always used to enjoy their stuff. They had their own thing going and they did it well; my only concern was that IMO the songwriting, despite taking a much more personal and distinctive approach, has started to become quite watered down since \"Far Beyond Driven\". For this reason, \"Reinventing The Steel\" quite surprised me when I first cranked it up. It was still packed to the brim with that typical Pantera-styled aggression that marked \"The Great Southern Trendkill\", but this time the boys slowed it took a bit more time to come up with some more interesting riffs to hold the listener's attention. Not that I hated \"The Great Souther Trendkill\", but I just found it overdone at points, and still believe it could have been better with a bit more variety thrown in.\n\nAlbum opener \"Hellbound\" assaults the listener with classic Pantera trademarks from the first second: Dimebag's guitar is still there with its load of vicious distortion, Phil's vocals are abrasive as ever (although I wish he'd stop using those whispering/moaning interludes which make him sound like he's having anal sex with an orangutan), Vinnie's not the best drummer in the world but still shows a rare precision, and Rex's bass... hey, someone turned his bass volume up! That's a good achievement, for the former \"Rocker\" guy has quite some cool tricks up his sleeve for this album. Anyway, \"Hellbound\" alternates more laid-back verses to angry choruses, and finishes with a nice Thrashy acceleration. Powerful, varied and accessible - great way to open an album.\n\"Goddamn Electric\" continues the thought although the rhythm variation between verse and bridge/chorus is more drastic and the tempo is generally slower. Phil throws in some clean vocals in the chorus, which helps the variation, and Kerry King of Slayer fame contributes with a solo in the outro... nothing to write home about really, as it barely classifies as a solo (just a bunch of distorted noises with - guess what? - lots of whammy bar masturbation). Still, the song stands out thanks to its heavy groove feeling.\n\"Yesterday Don't Mean Shit\" kicks the speed up and relies on a very strong rhythmic backbone provided by Rex and Vinnie's excellent work; above it, cool riffs and Phil's angry performance complete the winning formula. Watch out for the bass lines underneath Dimebag's solo, and see why having an audible bass sound is a good thing.\n\"You've Got to Belong To It\" is further focused on the rhythm, with Vinnie pulling off some nice patterns closely followed by Anselmo's vocal lines; a bit of inconsistency is to be found in the riff department, but the good points make up for it. Dimebag's shrill guitar hook is also pretty damn cool.\nThen we get \"Revolution Is My Name\", which opens with a rather pointless slow intro before kicking into a great groove which sustains the whole song. The whole band's performance is top notch here, and Phil stretches his limits swithcing between cleaner parts to agrressive screams.\n\nThe second half of the record begins with \"Death Rattle\", a short and fast injection of crushing riffs and intense vocals. The riff structure is actually more complicated than a first listen would let imagine, and the whole thing is a great combination of mature musicianship and no-frills aggression. It can't be a bad thing, can it?\n\"We'll Grind That Axe For a Long Time\"... long title, and the song itself seems to be a bit too long too. It's not really bad, it just tends to drag on a bit due to sections that would simply need to be cut off before they last long enough to become repetitive (see the chorus).\n\"Uplift\" has more bite, especially in the first part, but then again drones on for too long near the end; still, it has some pretty interesting riffs going on here and there, and Vinnie's drumming is precise as ever.\nThe pace goes down for \"It Makes Them Disappear\", a dark, brooding track filled with heavy riffs, tortured vocals and haunting clean guitar passages (although Dimebag could have picked up a less silly effect for it).\n\"I'll Cast a Shadow\" retains a similar mood but lies on the faster side, and closes the album on a high note... or rather would, if it wasn't for that lame talking section at the end which doesn't serve any purpose at all.\n\nAt the end of the day \"Reinventing The Steel\" comes out as a great addition to the Pantera discography. It won't make you change your mind about the band's music in any way, so if you liked Pantera's pervious albums you can go for it right now, otherwise avoid like plague.\n",
        "\nThere is one main problem with this album, and that is the lack of consistancy that it holds. It really drops off after \"Hard Lines, Sunken Cheeks\" and doesn't redeem itself until \"Throes of Rejection\".\n\nWith that in mind, this album sounds like it was put together fast. In that I mean that the riffs are not the greatest, the lyrics are not the most original and the production is not up to par with \"A Vulgar Display of Power\". The guitar tone is annoying and sounds like it did on \"Cowboys From Hell\", but much heavier. The drum sound is rather tinny, but bearable (no Lar$ here). The production has so much fucking treble I can't even hear the bass at all, with the exception of maybe \"Hard Lines, Sunken Cheeks\". Phil's vocals are good, they are pretty much the same as always, and are a HELL of a lot better than they are nowadays. \n\nMore evidence that the songs were rushed is the abrupt song changes. Take the first track \"Strength Beyond Strength\". It is a decent song, but the ending part is annoying. The song would have been much better if they had kept the fast thrash throughout. Speaking of thrash, much of that is gone by this time. Many of the songs are midpaced, such as \"Becoming\", which has a few good riffs and a catchy chorus, but again, nothing absolutly special going on here. \"Good Friends and a Bottle of Pills\" is great. Well, the actual song sucks, but the lyrics are funny as hell and Phil's vocal delivery is very convincing. Other notable songs include \"5 Minutes Alone\", the best song on here, great riffs, nice verse part, \"I'm Broken\", which is pretty good but drags at the end, \"Thoes of Rejection\" features a good buildup with a killer chorus consisting of basically one word, and finally \"Planet Caravan\", which is very well done and a faithful tribute to the Sabbath original. A soft, smooth ending to a heavy album.\n\nWith the good out of the way, here come the bad. \"Slaughtered\", \"25 Years\", \"Shedding Skin\" and \"Use My Third Arm\". All in a row too. Damn. None of these songs are memorable in the least, have any cool riffs or any decent hooks. Just stay away from these songs.\n\nA good album, not great, but good. Check out Pantera's other stuff out first.\n",
        "\nFirst off, this is Pantera's third attempt at giving the die-hard fans a look at the backstage life that is Pantera. All that can be said is that they are living the life of true rock-stars. The vid is made up of the tour life of the Pantera boys from the Far Beyond to Trendkill tours with videos from both albums. That in and of itself is pretty damned cool, because its impossible to see those videos anywhere else (thank you Much {Shitty} Music). \n\nMost of the video is shot by Dimebag stumbling around with his camcorder while most definitely getting loaded. Each member of the band has their own little glory spot on the video, showcasing each's own talents. But not only that, they show the road dogz doing what they do best (aside from smoking lotsa dope and drinkin). The video gets pretty fucking funny at times, especially with them trashing dressing rooms and cars and whatnot. It makes it hard to believe that after all the damage that they would have to pay for that they would have any money left over to even release this video. \n\nWhen thinking about buying this video, you gotta remember that it ain't gonna entertain you unless your heavy into Pantera. I would say only then would you get your money's worth out of this one.\n"
